DiMario, Public \nPrinter\n\n[[Page S13774]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                           Nebraska Senators\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, until someone comes to work on these bills, \nI would like to mention one thing. I wanted to say this last night. The \nhour was late. The Presiding Officer was the same.\n  I have had the good fortune during the time I have served in the \nSenate to work with some outstanding Senators. The two who come to my \nmind are from the State of Nebraska. Senator Jim Exon was such a unique \nindividual. I have so many fond memories of this great big man who had \nsuch a big body, but in that big body was a great big heart. He was a \ntremendous Senator. I miss him a great deal.\n  Then, of course, to serve with Bob Kerrey is an experience. He was \ntruly a free spirit, someone who was not only an American hero, having \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor, but someone who was as valiant in his \nlegislative duties as he was in his military duties.\n  Following in the footsteps of these two men whom I enjoyed serving \nwith so much is the Presiding Officer, a man who served as Governor of \nthe State of Nebraska and came to the Senate with great credentials \nfrom my perspective. On paper, the Presiding Officer has all the \ncredentials to be a great Senator. A lot of people are good on paper in \nall walks of life. But in the short time I have served with the \nPresiding Officer as a Senator from Nebraska, his credentials certainly \nhave served him well in the Senate because the Presiding Officer is as \ngood a person as he is on paper.\n  I extend my congratulations to the people of Nebraska for sending to \nthe Senate a person with such great qualities. I am sure the people of \nNebraska appreciate Senator Ben Nelson. But I am not sure they \nappreciate him enough. For those of us who work personally with the \nPresiding Officer on a daily basis, in some of the most difficult \nlegislative matters that ever come before this country, I can say \nwithout hesitation that Senator Ben Nelson is in the same caliber as \nNebraskans who have served before him and with whom I have had the \nhonor of serving: Senators Exon and Kerrey.\n\n  Nebraska should be very proud of the dignity and the service of the \nthree people I have had the good fortune of serving with in the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                           Economic Stimulus\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to make a couple of general \ncomments. As we move towards perhaps the final day, certainly very \nclose to the final day of our time here, I hope we can move forward. We \nhave three appropriations bills that we have been looking forward to \ndiscussing and have to finish before we end. There will probably be \nsome discussion on particularly the Defense appropriations.\n  Nevertheless, the bill and the issue that I suppose we will talk \nabout the most, and seems to be one that is not agreed to, is that of \neconomic stimulus. Certainly that will be coming forward. We have \ntalked about it for a very long time. The President has talked about \nit. We have had meetings about it. The House obviously has worked out a \nseparate proposal for us. I am hopeful that as we undertake this \neffort, we will decide, as we should on all of the topics that come \nbefore us, what do we want to see as the result.\n  So often we get wrapped up entirely with the details of what is going \non here, and the details obviously are important, but what is more \nimportant is what it is we want to accomplish and how will what we are \ntalking about do that.\n  Certainly, I hope we talk about what is the purpose of an economic \nstimulus package. Obviously, we are in a recession. No one seems to \nknow exactly what the best techniques are to deal with stimulating the \neconomy. We have listened to all kinds of economists, including our \nnationally celebrated economists. There are different ideas about that. \nCertainly, we want to see if we can't create more jobs, if we can't \nstrengthen the economy.\n  If it is called an economic stimulus, then certainly that has to be \nthe purpose.\n  How do you do that? You do it by creating jobs and investment. You do \nit by putting more money in the hands of the people in the countryside, \nparticularly those who have suffered, of course. That is another \nalternative. The proposals we have had do both of those things in \nvarying degrees. So I hope we can do that.\n  There are those, of course, who believe that at this point an \neconomic stimulus is not necessary. I don't agree with that, but it is \na point of view. I was thinking this morning, listening to the TV, \nabout politics. This is politics. Well, having different views is not \nunusual. Everyone in the country has different views. In many places, \nthat is defined as standing up for what you believe. When we disagree \nhere, it is suddenly called politics. I understand that. There are \nlegitimate, different views.\n  I hope we can keep in mind that certainly one of the major purposes \nof an economic stimulus is to stimulate the economy, to create jobs. We \nare not looking for a continuing assistance program. We are looking for \nsomething that will cause jobs to come back, so people can spend money. \nThe other thing that, obviously, we want to do is assist those who have \nsuffered as a result of the September 11 tragedy.\n  I look forward to it. I hope we can do something that will have an \nimpact. Frankly, we will be limited in time, but I hope we don't \nestablish new entitlement programs through this kind of emergency \nprogram. We ought to really be serious about seeing what we can do that \nis effective in measuring against the results we would like to have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                            Stimulus Package\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I didn't want this morning to disturb the \nmood of our last day here. Therefore, I didn't do anything about the \nmessage delivered from the House this morning. When she came in and \nbowed--and I appreciate the dignity that creates here--I had a big \nsmile on my face. I wrote on my pad here ``laugh,'' because it is \nlaughable.\n  A stimulus package now? What in the world are they trying to do in \nthe House of Representatives? They are going home at 1:30 this \nafternoon. Did they think, after we worked on this so long and hard, we \nare going to accept that in the Senate? It makes the original bill they \ndid that was so bad look good.\n  So I hope the American public understands the charade. That is what \nit is. The House of Representatives worked until 4:30 this morning \ncoming up with a stimulus package strictly for political purposes. It \nhas no substantive merit whatsoever. They knew that, and they know it \nhas no chance of passing over here. That is too bad.\n  We started out with a stimulus package that made sense. Senator Byrd \nand I wanted to do something to create jobs. We knew that for every \nbillion dollars spent on road building, 42 thousand jobs are created, \nand those 42,000 people would, of course, pay taxes and buy \nrefrigerators and cars. The Republicans would not go along with that. \nWe were always attempting to protect the American worker--their \nunemployment benefits, health benefits.\n  Because of the very narrowminded of the Republican House of \nRepresentatives, we are unable to do anything. That is too bad. I am \ndisappointed that we have, on the last day of the session, this silly \npackage brought to us from the House of Representatives. That is what \nit is--a silly package.\n\n\n                      Complimenting Senator Harkin\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, changing the subject for a minute, while I \nstill have the floor, I have spent 2 or 3 weeks with the Senator from \nIowa on the farm bill. He has done a wonderful job getting the bill out \nof committee, trying to satisfy the disparate groups throughout America \nthat have farm interests. He has done that. Again, because of a \nfilibuster, we were unable to bring the bill forward. He is here again \ntoday as chairman of the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, which \nis, other than Defense, the biggest money-spending bill we have.\n  There are so many important provisions for the State of Nevada and \nevery State in our Nation. I hope people in Iowa understand what a \nresource they have in Tom Harkin, chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, chairman of the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, one \nof the most senior members of the Appropriations Committee. I didn't \nhave a chance, because of the parliamentary situation in the\n\n[[Page S13775]]\n\nlast few days, to say anything complimentary about my friend. I want \nhim to understand, on behalf of the entire Democratic caucus, how much \nwe appreciate what he does. He is a resource that is invaluable to the \nSenate and this country.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Nevada for the very kind words. I, \nagain, thank him for all of his great support and help as we tried to \nget the farm bill through, but it was stopped by the other side. I \nthank my friend from Nevada for his great help on getting our \nappropriations bill through.\n  As Senator Reid said, this is the second largest appropriations \nbill--second only to Defense. But what is important is that this is the \nappropriations bill that binds our country together. This is the bill \nthat makes America unique in the world. This is the appropriations bill \nthat says to every kid in America: No matter where you are born, no \nmatter the circumstances of your birth, you are going to get a good \neducation; we are going to put the resources out there. No matter what \nyour resources are, we are going to get you the funds you need to go to \ncollege, or for job training if you don't want to go to college.\n  This provides the underpinning of our medical research. This bill \nunderpins the health care of America in so many ways. This is the bill \nthat provides all of the support for our jobs, our Job Corps, our \ntraining programs, all of the worker training programs that come \nthrough the Department of Health. This is the bill that covers the \nDepartment of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, \nand the Department of Labor, and all biomedical research.\n  So I am very proud and I feel very privileged to be a Senator, but \nalso to be on the Appropriations Committee and to chair this \nsubcommittee that I believe speaks about what America really is. I am \nalso on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. That is the committee \nthat defends our interests around the globe. This is the subcommittee \nthat makes America what America is in the world community--unique among \nnations.\n  I am proud and privileged to bring to the Senate Chamber this morning \nthe conference report on the Labor, Health and Human Services, \nEducation and related agencies appropriations bill.\n  First, I thank my good friend and longtime partner in this effort, \nSenator Specter. We have had a great partnership for a number of years. \nSome time ago, I was chairman of this subcommittee, and he was my \nranking member. Then when the other party took control of the Senate, \nhe became chairman and I was ranking member. Now I am chairman again \nand he is ranking member again. We have had a great partnership, going \nback now just about an even dozen years. I thank him and his staff, who \nI will name after a bit, for helping put together this bill on a truly \nbipartisan basis.\n\n  The conference report is a good bill. It is one I can strongly \nrecommend to my colleagues. Senator Specter and I worked with our \nsubcommittee members, the House leaders, Congressmen Obey and Regula, \nto help shape it. We have done our best to accommodate the literally \nthousands of requests we have received from our colleagues.\n  I wish to highlight some of the main features of our conference \nreport.\n  First, it takes a number of important steps to improve the quality, \naffordability, and accessibility of health care in America. We included \na record increase for the National Institutes of Health of $3 billion--\nagain, building upon the excellent work done when Senator Specter \nchaired this subcommittee, in meeting the stated goal of the Congress \nto double NIH funding over 5 years. So we put a record $3 billion into \nthis bill for NIH.\n  We have also combined with that an additional approximately $200 \nmillion in NIH resources related to bioterrorism, which is included not \nin this bill but in the supplemental appropriations bill. This keeps us \non track in doubling our commitment. This action holds the hope of \nimproving the lives of millions of Americans plagued by killers such as \nAlzheimer's, cancer, Parkinson's, heart disease, diabetes, \nosteoporosis, and so many other things.\n  The conference agreement also makes a major improvement in access to \naffordable health care by providing a $175 million increase to \ncommunity health centers and major increases in critical prevention \nactivities, such as cancer and heart disease screening. These changes \nwill save lives and improve health around the country.\n  As a Senator from Iowa and cochair of the Rural Health Caucus of the \nSenate, I am pleased to report that the agreement includes a major new \neffort to improve health care in rural areas and small towns.\n  We will bring more doctors, nurses, and other health professionals to \nplaces they are needed by expanding the National Health Service Corps \nand the Nurse Loan Repayment Program. Our struggling rural hospitals \nare given help to deal with Medicare paperwork and help to expand into \nother activities, such as adult daycare.\n  This agreement also includes substantial new resources to improve \neducation. While I am disappointed that additional funds were not \nprovided by beginning to fully fund special education as a part of the \neducation reform bill, I believe we did a good job with the resources \nwe were provided.\n  The agreement makes college more affordable for millions of young \npeople by increasing the Pell grant maximum to $4,000. We increase the \nTRIO Program by $72.5 million, which brings total funding for the TRIO \nProgram to $802 million.\n  The bill also increases funding for title I reading and math by $1.6 \nbillion for a total of $10.35 billion to title I.\n  We increase afterschool programs by $154 million. We finally broke \nthe $1 billion threshold. We provide for $1 billion in afterschool \nprograms.\n  We increase the funding for teacher quality by three-quarters of a \nbillion dollars. The total we have in this bill for teacher quality is \n$2.85 billion.\n  The Senate bill contained nearly $1 billion when we passed it to make \nneeded repair to our schools, including security enhancements. We \nstarted this initiative last year. It has been a great success. I am \nvery disappointed we could not reach an agreement to continue it this \nyear. However, I have made it clear that I will bring the issue back \nagain next year. We have schools crumbling all over America, and I \nthink it is a legitimate role for the Federal Government to play to \nhelp our States and local communities repair, rebuild, and modernize \ntheir schools to make them adaptable for the 21st century. The average \nage of our schools now is well over 40 years, many 50 years old and \nover 75 years old. They need to be upgraded. They need to be \nmodernized. Our property-tax payers in my State and I know in the \nPresiding Officer's State are overburdened as it is. Property tax is \nnot a real reflection of one's ability to pay, and yet that is still \nhow we fund the rebuilding of our schools across America.\n  We started on this last year. I am disappointed we could not continue \nit this year, but hopefully we will be back again next year to meet \nthat need.\n  I am also pleased this agreement improves our commitment to worker \ntraining and safety. We funded our State unemployment offices to handle \nthe increased caseloads they are facing now and probably will face for \nthe remainder of the winter. At this time of economic downturn, these \ninvestments are crucial.\n  I wish to highlight a substantial initiative in this bill to improve \nservices to our Nation's elderly. We will allow more homebound seniors \nto receive Meals on Wheels. We provide a major increase in services, \nsuch as adult daycare, to help the elderly stay in their own homes and \nto give their loved ones who are taking care of them needed respite \ncare and support.\n  Finally, our subcommittee held a series of four hearings on the need \nto better protect Americans from the threat of bioterrorism. Based on \nthese hearings, Senator Specter and I put together a comprehensive \nantibioterrorism funding plan.\n  While the agreement before us contains a modest level of funding to \naddress this need, our comprehensive $3 billion plan is included in the \nhomeland security package which we will work on later today on the \nDefense appropriations bill. Between the two, we will be substantially \nimproving the security of Americans against a bioterrorist attack. For \nthe record, in the bioterrorism supplemental, we have provided $865 \nmillion to expand State and local public health capacity, to expand the \nhealth alert network, and for\n\n[[Page S13776]]\n\nround-the-clock disease investigators in every State.\n\n  We provided $512 million to acquire enough smallpox vaccine for every \nAmerican, and hopefully the smallpox vaccine will be available for \nevery American sometime towards the end of next year, maybe as early as \nSeptember of next year.\n  We included $593 million to beef up our entire vaccine stockpile in \nAmerica; $135 million to help our hospitals with surge capacity. If, \nGod forbid, we did have a terrorist attack, our hospitals in so many \nareas just would not be able to handle it. We have provided $135 \nmillion that will help hospitals meet that surge capacity if they \nrequire it.\n  We provided $155 million to improve vaccine research and lab \ncapacities at NIH. And we included up to $10 million for a new national \ntracking system for deadly pathogens such as anthrax. Right now, we \ntrack every microscopic ounce of radioactive material that is in our \npowerplants, in our laboratories, and weapons. We keep a good inventory \nand tracking system of radioactive nuclear materials, but we do not \nhave such a capacity with our deadly pathogens, as we have seen with \nanthrax.\n  It now looks as though the anthrax that was sent to Senator Daschle's \noffice and Senator Leahy and others that came through the mail \noriginated in this country. There are all kinds of stories in the press \nof it coming through Fort Detrick, MD, and Dugway in Utah, but no one \nknows because we have never had in place an inventory and tracking \nsystem for deadly pathogens. The money we appropriated will begin the \nprocess of making sure this situation does not happen again.\n  We put in $71 million to improve security at our Nation's \nlaboratories.\n  That is all the money we put into the bioterrorism portion of the \nbill which will be in the Defense appropriations bill later today.\n  I believe we have a good bill of which we can be proud. It is the \nproduct of a bipartisan compromise. As I said, it is not perfect. Some \nof us wanted different provisions. I wish we could have kept the money \nin for school construction, but that is the legislative process. We had \ngood bipartisan cooperation in getting to the end result.\n  I close by thanking my chairman, Senator Byrd, for all of his support \nand for the excellent leadership he has provided to make this bill and \nthe bioterrorism package possible. I thank our ranking member, Senator \nStevens. Again, at every step of the way he has been a strong supporter \nand has made sure we received the necessary allocations for our bill.\n  Finally, this bill, as I said earlier, would not have been possible \nwithout the tireless and outstanding staff work. Our staffs have done a \nterrific job. I know they have not had much sleep in the process. In \nfact, I understand the night before last they broke at 6 o'clock in the \nmorning. They worked all night to get this done. That is the kind of \ndedication and hard work of our Appropriations Committee staff of which \nI am proud.\n  I especially note the great work of the staff director on the \nsubcommittee, Ellen Murray, who worked tirelessly through the year to \nshape, form, and work on the allocations and bring this all together. \nJust as I have worked closely with Senator Specter, I know she has \nworked closely with another great staff person, Bettilou Taylor with \nSenator Specter, and all of our staffs. Bettilou and Ellen have just \ndone an outstanding job of putting this together. It would not have \nbeen possible without them. I thank them both very much for their \nexpertise and their hard work.\n  I thank Jim Sourwine, Erik Fatemi, Mark Laisch, Adam Gluck, Lisa \nBernhardt, Adrienne Hallett, and Carole Geagley, as well as Bev \nSchroeder and Chani Wiggins of my personal staff for their terrific and \ntireless efforts.\n  As I said, the bill before us simply would not have been possible \nwithout them. I mentioned my staff. Let me also mention Mary Dietrich \non Senator Specter's staff, Sudip Parikh--I do not know where Sudip is, \nbut I thank him for all the great briefings he has given me in the \npast. I thank him very much.\n  Maybe after all my briefings on anthrax he will let me know how it \nall works. Emma Ashburn, also I thank Emma for all of her great work.\n  I say again, we have an outstanding staff, and I thank them all. I \ntake this opportunity publicly to wish them a restful Merry Christmas. \nI hope they catch up on all the sleep they have lost over the last \ncouple weeks. They have done a great job and have my undying \nappreciation and admiration and thanks for the great job they have \ndone.\n  I know a couple of other Senators were seeking time. How much time do \nI have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator has 22 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Harkin. He and I were \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives, and he would probably \nrecall that Congressman Bill Natcher of Kentucky on the Appropriations \nCommittee always chaired the subcommittee that had this appropriations, \nthe Labor-HHS appropriations, and he would come to the floor in his \ncourtly and dignified way and announce that this was the people's bill, \nLabor-HHS appropriations was the people's bill.\n  When Congressman Natcher took a look at the rollcalls he had in \nsupport of the bill, all the people were voting for it. And I think it \nreflects what Senator Harkin said earlier about what is in this bill. I \nnoticed Senator Inouye was here a few moments ago. As chair of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense, he has a responsibility to \ndefend and protect America. Senator Harkin of the Labor-HHS \nSubcommittee of Appropriations has the responsibility to make sure that \nAmericans' lives are worth living, whether it is education, health care \nor a commitment to labor. Time and again Senator Harkin, in this \nappropriations bill, has answered the call of this country. I commend \nhim, as Senator Reid did earlier.\n  This is an important bill for America. It is a better bill because of \nthe hard work Senator Harkin and Senator Specter and the staffs have \nput into it. I am going to be an anxious supporter of the bill.\n  I have been fortunate to have served 12 years on the House \nAppropriations Committee and now 3 years on the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, but my dream to be on this appropriations subcommittee is \nstill yet to be realized. I hope someday to make it because I think it \nis most important and certainly reflects your hard work has made it to \nthe bill that will be considered on what may be the last day.\n\n\n                   Verification of Personal Identity\n\n  Madam President, I would like to address another issue very quickly, \nif I may.\n  Since September 11, 2001, all of us in Federal, State, and local \ngovernments have been looking for ways to enhance our homeland \nsecurity. We have reviewed just about every government regulation or \npractice that affects the security of our daily lives in order to fix \nweaknesses, close loopholes, and beef up protection for all Americans.\n  Among other efforts that I have led--such as airline security, food \nsafety, assuring a state of national readiness--I am now working on a \nbill to address weaknesses in our nation's personal identification \nsystem.\n  Specifically, I am interested in fixing the problems in the current \ndisparate system we have where states issue driver's licenses without \nuniformity and without cross-checking with sister States.\n  In the aftermath of the most devastating attacks on America, we \nlearned that some of the terrorists who were responsible for the \nSeptember 11 tragedy carried driver's licenses issued to them by states \nthat had extremely lax application process.\n  In Virginia, for example, it was reported that a terrorist paid a \ncomplete stranger $50 in the parking lot of a Department of Motor \nVehicles to sign a sworn statement that vouched for the terrorist's \nidentity and in-state residence on his driver's license application.\n  It was also reported that 13 of the 19 terrorists held driver's \nlicenses from Florida, a state that--at that time--did not require any \nproof of permanent\n\n[[Page S13777]]\n\nresidency from anyone. In fact, any foreign tourist could walk into a \nmotor vehicles office, fill out a form on his own, and get one.\n  I am certainly not asserting that the September 11 attacks would have \nbeen avoided had the terrorists not had these driver's licenses. \nClearly, there is little direct connection between the cards these evil \nmen carried and the ungodly deeds that they carried out.\n  But what these driver's licenses--which have now become the most \nwidely used form of personal ID in the country--gave these terrorists \nwas the cover of legitimacy that allowed them to walk around and mingle \ninto American society without being detected.\n  A driver's license is a key that opens many doors. In America, anyone \nwho can produce a valid driver's license can access just about \nanything.\n  It can get you a motel room, membership in a gym, airline tickets, \nflight lessons, and even buy guns--all without anyone ever questioning \nyou about who you are. If you can produce a driver's license, we just \nassume that you are legitimate, and you have a right to be here.\n  I realize that the investigations surrounding September 11 are still \nongoing, but I think we can safely assume what some of the problems \nwere that led to the vulnerability we left for the terrorists to \nexploit.\n  The terrorists took advantage of a combination of failures in our \nintelligence, law enforcement, border patrol, aviation security, and \nother infrastructures that, at some point, should have been able to \ndiscover and identify these individuals as threats.\n  As we enhance homeland security, it is critical that we improve all \nof these areas. But no amount of data sharing among Federal, State, \nlocal, and international law enforcement and regulatory agencies can be \nuseful if one of the most significant pieces of the data that they \ntransmit back and forth is unreliable.\n  And today, verification of personal identification is that weakest \nlink in the process.\n  Whenever someone presents identification to a government official, we \nmust be able to rely on that ID to be sure that the person is in fact \nwho he says he is. That is the only way to ensure accurate results when \na government official inputs that person's name into various databases \nthat agencies use.\n  But today, with hundreds of different forms of ID cards that are in \nuse across the Nation and with rampant identity theft problems, it is \nnearly impossible to know with certainty who a person is standing \nbefore you, no matter how many ID cards they can produce.\n  To further aggravate the problem, one form of ID often begets \nanother, and can help someone assume a completely false identity.\n  For example, a person can start with a fake driver's license; and \nthen pick up a fake Social Security number--this is really easy to get, \nand you don't even need a photo.\n  With this, he can easily obtain credit cards, library cards, video \nrental membership cards, etc.--all genuine forms of ID based on the \nfake original.\n  To begin the process of critically reviewing our Nation's ID system, \nI am drafting legislation to enhance the reliability of today's most \npopularly-used form of identification--the driver's license and State \nID card.\n  But before I explain what this bill does, let me be absolutely clear \nwhat it does not do.\n  This is not about creating a new national ID card nor is it about \ndeveloping one centralized mega-database that houses everyone's \npersonal data. I understand the concerns that Americans have about \ngoing in that direction, and I agree that we do not need a national ID \ncard which crosses that critical line of personal privacy.\n  Instead, my effort is focused on fixing a problem that we can address \nimmediately and with significant results. My bill is about making the \ndriver's license--which many consider as a de facto national ID card--\nmore reliable and verifiable as a form of personal identification than \nit is today.\n  First, my bill requires all States and U.S. territories to adopt a \nminimum uniform standard in issuing drivers' licenses.\n  If someone walks into a department of motor vehicles in Virginia, he \nshould be required to provide the same methods of verifying who he is, \nand should go through the same set of requirements, as someone who \nwalks into a DMV in Illinois.\n  Why? Because if we don't have uniformity among States, we will remain \nvulnerable to those who exploit the system by forum shopping for a \ndriver's license card in the weakest State. With that initial ID card, \nthey can go on to obtain other ID cards and gain official recognition.\n  Or, under reciprocity, they can trade in that driver's license for a \ndriver's license in another State with more strict application \nrequirements even though they may not have qualified to get a license \nin the other State.\n  If we mandate a minimum standard that is applied uniformly across the \nNation, we can ensure that anyone who presents any State-issued \ndriver's license can be trusted that he is in fact who he claims he is, \nsince he would not have been able to obtain the card but for having \ninitially verified his identity in the same way across the country.\n  To set up the criteria and implementation of the uniform standard, I \nhave enlisted the assistance of the American Association of Motor \nVehicle Administrators AAMVA, which is a nonprofit organization whose \nmembers consist of motor vehicle and traffic law enforcement \nadministrators of jurisdictions in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\n  AAMVA is the national expert on issues dealing with motor vehicle \nadministration, and it develops model programs and encourages \nuniformity and reciprocity among the States.\n  My bill appoints AAMVA as the regulatory document and biometric \nstandards-setting body, and tasks AAMVA to develop the minimum \nverification and identification requirements that each State must adopt \nfor issues such as:\n  Uniform definition of in-State ``residency''; validation of source or \n``breeder'' documents to verify ID; establishment of legal presence in \nthe country; initial issuance procedures; and minimum security \nfeatures.\n  With congressional oversight, AAMVA would supervise the \nimplementation by the States so that within reasonable time, every \nState of our Nation will finally have uniform standards.\n  In implementing the uniform standards, it is also important to make \nsure the State DMVs have the support they need to verify the data they \nreceive. Many DMVs across the country have complained that they receive \nlittle cooperation from Federal agencies who maintain databases \ncontaining information that could verify and confirm the information \nthat people present at the DMV counter.\n  For example, the Social Security number is one of the primary unique \nidentifiers used across the country. Yet many State DMVs have a \ndifficult time accessing records from the Social Security \nAdministration to match the number with the name of the applicant of \nthe driver's license.\n  My bill addresses this problem by authorizing the Social Security \nAdministration, Immigration and Naturalization Service, law enforcement \nagencies and any other sources of appropriate, relevant, real-time \ndatabases to provide motor vehicle agencies with limited access to \ntheir records.\n  My bill would also authorize and fund an initiative to ensure that \nall of these databases are compatible and can communicate with each \nother effectively.\n  Let me emphasize here that the access to the records is for the \nlimited purpose of cross-checking and verifying individuals' name, date \nof birth, address, social security number, passport number if \napplicable, or legal status.\n  It is not a carte blanche access to records that could contain many \nconfidential and sensitive and private information.\n  But we know that there may be unscrupulous employees in any \norganization, and some DMV employee, unfortunately, may be tempted to \ncut corners.\n  In order to discourage and prevent anyone from accessing these \nrecords without authorization, or use it in an unauthorized manner, my \nbill provides stiff penalties for any employee, agent, contractor, or \nanyone else who engages in unlawful access to such records.\n  Similarly, my bill provides for internal fraud within a department of \nmotor vehicle where state employees access\n\n[[Page S13778]]\n\nDMV records to make fake IDs or to personally profit in any way.\n  My bill also encourages individuals to report any suspicious \nactivities within such offices by providing whistleblower protection to \nthose who uncover internal fraud.\n  But setting up the uniformity and data sharing are not enough to \nensure security. I also want to make sure that the driver licenses and \nother forms of government identification cards issued by departments of \nmotor vehicles are tamper proof so that there is no other source from \nwhich someone can obtain such a card.\n  It is time to stamp out the multi-billion dollar cottage industry of \nfake IDs.\n  My bill will make life miserable for those who manufacture, \ndistribute, market, or sell fake driver's licenses or other forms of \ngovernment identification cards, by raising the stakes for those caught \nin the act.\n  Identity theft is a national problem, and it deserves a national \nresponse. That is why I propose to make it a Federal offense to engage \nin the fake ID business.\n  I have heard from State and local officials across the country who \ncomplain that they didn't have sufficient tools to go after these \ncrooks who hang out in parking lots and on the web luring people to buy \nfake IDs\n  In most States, such offenses are dealt with a slap on the wrist and \nthe criminals are back on the streets eagerly trying to earn back the \nfines they just paid with the sale of a few more fake cards.\n  So I believe we need to federalize the illegal nature of this \nactivity and go after the manufacturers, distributors, and marketers \nwith full force of the law.\n  Likewise, I propose severe penalty for anyone who purchases fake IDs, \nobtains legitimate ID cards in a fraudulent manner, or engages in any \nactivity that misrepresents their personal identification in anyway by \nusing a fake or altered government-issued ID card.\n  Last year, I worked with Senator Collins to pass the Internet False \nIdentification Prevention Act of 2000 which addressed many of these \nproblems. My bill is designed to ensure that this and other laws \ndealing with fake IDs which are already in the books are working, and \nif they are not, that we find ways to ensure they are enforced against \ncriminals.\n  Since September 11, all of us have been working around the clock with \na singular goal: enhancing security of our homeland. I believe this \nbill will help us seal some of the cracks in our internal security \nsystems, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n  As chairman of the Governmental Affairs' Subcommittee on Oversight of \nGovernment Management, I will be holding a hearing when we return from \nthe holidays to address this problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think there is time that has been allocated to the \nSenator from Massachusetts. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has not at this point been time \nallocated to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see my friend and colleague from Minnesota. I am \nmindful that there is only about 12 minutes remaining to the Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen remain.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I yield any time remaining under my \nallocation of time until Senator Harkin's return to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized. \nThe Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, also to facilitate the Senator from \nMassachusetts, I think I have 10 minutes separately allotted; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, first of all, I join with others in commending our \nfriend and colleague from Iowa for an excellent job in finding scarce \nresources and focusing them on the Nation's needs. I think particularly \nof the great efforts he made to make sure children in this country were \ngoing to have the benefits, hopefully, of an education bill that can \nprovide educational opportunities for young people in this country. As \na result of the actions of Senator Harkin and his committee, more than \n600,000 children who would not have participated in the title I program \nwill participate in that program; 400,000 children who would not have \nparticipated in a bilingual program will participate in those programs; \n200,000 children who would not have had an opportunity for after-school \nprograms will benefit from those programs; and there will be tens of \nthousands of children who will benefit from the 1.2 billion that he has \nhad in special education. So this has been an impressive achievement.\n  When you look at the allocations for funding of these programs in the \nearly part of the year, none of this was foreseen. I think he would \nagree with me that we are going to have to do even better in the future \nas we are facing the challenges in education, and understanding the \nimportance that has in the lives of families in this country.\n\n  I also commend him for his extraordinary efforts in leading this \nbody, along with Senator Hagel and our colleague, Senator Jeffords, in \nthe funding for the IDEA program, which is related to education. There \nare those who say it is not, but I think we understand, as indicated in \nthe conclusion of the debate on education, that two out of three of the \nchildren who receive IDEA funding also qualify for Title I. These, in \nmany instances, are the same children. Shortchanging one group pits one \ngroup against the other. By adding the money even over the \nadministration's budget, it will mean additional quality services for \nneedy children.\n  We were unable to get the funding for the children who need IDEA, and \nthat is going to be the subject of my comments this morning.\n  I also want to thank Senator Harkin and Senator Specter for the great \nprogress that was made in funding the health care priorities. Graduate \nMedical Education was increased by $50 million; the National Health \nService Corps was increased by $24 million; and Community Health \nCenters received an increase of $175 million, which is the largest \nincrease in its history.\n  Of course Senator Harkin was there in the beginning with his \nsubcommittee, understanding the importance of getting the funding to \ndeal with bioterrorism. His committee worked with the Appropriations \nCommittee and had very instructive and productive hearings developing \nthe strong case for funding for bioterrorism as well as building a \nstockpile of vaccines. I feel strongly that, just as we have a \npetroleum reserve, we ought to have a pharmaceutical reserve so every \nchild can be protected against any of these potential threats.\n  Senator Harkin, in his committee, held very important hearings. Then \nSenator Byrd, with his strong leadership was able, working with Senator \nHarkin, to make sure we are going to meet our Nation's responsibility. \nAll of us are thankful for that leadership.\n  For more than 200 years, Americans have fought battle after battle \nagainst discrimination in all its forms. We have fought for racial \nequality to assure that all people are judged not by the color of their \nskin. We have fought for voting rights for women, and their rightful \nplace in shaping the nation's democracy. We have acted to end \ndiscriminatory practices against the elderly and disabled.\n  Despite our many successes in the ongoing battle for fairer treatment \nfor all, there is one form of dangerous discrimination that still \npervades every community in this country. Few families have escaped \nfacing this discrimination personally, or seeing the harm it has caused \nto loved ones, friends, or acquaintances. This discrimination is not \nbased on skin color, gender, or age. It is based on an illness--mental \nillness.\n  For years, millions of Americans across this country with mental \nillness have faced stigma and misunderstanding. Even worse, they have \nbeen denied the treatment that can cure or ease their cruel \nafflictions. Too often, they are the victims of discrimination \npracticed by health insurance companies. It is unacceptable that the \nNation continues to tolerate actions by insurers that deny medically \nnecessary care for curable mental illnesses, while fully covering the \ncost of treatment for physical illnesses that are often more costly, \nless debilitating, and less curable.\n\n[[Page S13779]]\n\n  It is long past time to end this unjust discrimination.\n  Unfortunately, we have just suffered a serious setback in the ongoing \nbattle for the rights of the mentally ill. The House Republican \nleadership has blocked the Domenici-Wellstone Mental Health Equitable \nTreatment Act, which assures fair health insurance coverage of mental \nillness for the millions of Americans who must live with depression, \npost-traumatic stress, anorexia, and other mental illnesses.\n  This important bill was approved by the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee last month on a unanimous vote. It passed \nthe Senate without a word of opposition. This success was achieved by \nthe skilful leadership and hard work of the bipartisan team of Senator \nPaul Wellstone and Senator Pete Domenici.\n  That bill deserved to become law this year, but the House Republican \nleadership has refused to act. Three House committees have jurisdiction \nover parts of this legislation, but none has held a markup. Not one has \nheld a single day of hearings. Now, operating behind the closed doors \nof the conference committee, the House Republican leadership has \ninsisted on striking the amendment which the Senate added to the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services Appropriations bill to achieve this essential \ngoal.\n  The House leadership has bowed to the pressure of insurers and big \nbusiness, at the peril of the health of millions of Americans. This \nlegislation has the support of the American people. It has the support \nof a broad bipartisan majority of the Congress. It is cosponsored by 65 \nMembers of the Senate. Over 240 Members of the House have signed a \nletter urging the House leadership to accept the Senate mental health \nparity amendment as part of the appropriations bill. The collective \nwill of Congress has been flagrantly disregarded.\n  The message of the opponents on this basic issue is the same message \nof delay and denial that has been such a shameful blot on our national \nhistory when it was applied to African-Americans, to women, to the \ndisabled, and to the elderly.\n  One of the most disappointing things about this first session of \nCongress has been the apparent retreat from the principles of equality \nand nondiscrimination.\n  On the education bill, the Congress failed to provide needed funding \nfor IDEA. The Congress retreated from the commitment made a quarter of \na century ago to assure that every child with disabilities would have a \nfair and equal chance for a quality education. Today, Congress has once \nagain retreated on a basic question of civil rights and \nnondiscrimination--fair treatment for the mentally ill.\n  As one who has been involved in these struggles to end discrimination \nthroughout my career, I know that the American people understand that \ndiscrimination against any American diminishes all Americans. They \nunderstand that discrimination is not only a denial of our brotherhood \nas human beings, it denies our country the ability to benefit from the \ntalents and contributions of all our citizens.\n  Surely, this time of renewed patriotism in the struggle against the \ncommon enemy of terrorism is the wrong time to retreat from our basic \nAmerican ideals.\n  Equal treatment for the mentally ill is not just an insurance issue, \nit is a civil rights issue. At its heart, mental health parity is a \nquestion of simple justice.\n  The House Republican leadership has now succeeded in blocking action \nfor this session of Congress. But the battle goes on, and it will not \nend until true parity has been achieved once and for all. The American \npeople understand that this battle is about justice for the mentally \nill and their families. The Senate and a majority of the House \nunderstand it. It is time for the House Republican leadership to stop \nkowtowing to powerful special interests and listen to the voice of the \nAmerican people--and to what is fair, just, and right for all those who \nsuffer from mental illness.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, before I yield time to my good friend \nfrom Minnesota, let me again thank Senator Specter, who showed up here \nfrom the hearing in which he has been tied up.\n  Let me thank Senator Kennedy for his great leadership on the two \nareas on which he spoke. Basically, I want to speak about education. I \nam privileged to serve on his committee and have for almost all the \ntime I have been in the Senate. There isn't anyone I could even think \nof mentioning here in the Chamber who has devoted more of his or her \nlife to the education of our kids and making sure they have a good \nquality education than Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts. It has been a \nprivilege and honor to work with him all these years.\n  We have had a tough fight over the last year in reauthorizing the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. I believe we came out with a \ngood bill, one that will move us forward. But now, as I said at the \ntime when the authorizing bill passed: We have created the \nauthorization, now show us the money.\n  I think this is an appropriate time to say the President's budget \nwill be coming down in a couple of months, the budget for next year. \nThe President, I know, is a strong supporter of the reauthorization of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It has all these \nrequirements for schools for testing and teacher quality and \nimprovement, all the things on which we agreed. But will we have the \nresources? Will this President, in his budget, provide those resources \nto back up the authorization bills we passed? That will be the real \ntest.\n  I hope this President will meet that test. I hope we get a budget \nfrom him next year that reflects those priorities.\n  Again, on the issue of the mental health parity, we had it on this \nbill.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts said--I know Senator Wellstone will \nspeak about it here in just a second--we had it in the bill, and it was \nwidely supported, almost unanimously, in the Senate. It was widely \nsupported in the House. But for some reason which I can't really divine \nand understand, the House Members decided they were going to vote \nagainst it. But it was the moment in time when we could have finally \ngotten over this, when we finally could have provided the same access \nto health care for mental health problems as we do for physical health \nproblems.\n  Quite frankly, I believe we have failed in this endeavor. It should \nhave been done. We held as long as we could, but when the House decided \nthey would not agree to it, we had to abide by that and come back to \nthe Senate without that provision in it. It is perhaps the biggest \nglaring loophole in our entire appropriations bill that we are now \nreporting back to the Senate.\n  My friend from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, has been the leader in \nfighting for the people with mental health problems in this country to \nassure they have the same kind of health care coverage in their \npolicies that people have for physical health problems. He has been the \nleader. He has led the charge on it. I know he is not going to give up. \nIf I know anything about Paul Wellstone, he is not going to give up on \nthis fight. We will be back again next year. I will look to him next \nyear for the same kind of leadership he provided this year, and for so \nmany years in the past, for finally breaking down this last civil \nrights issue. I think Senator Kennedy spoke about that. We have to \nconfront it here in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I begin by congratulating my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, with whom I have worked \nclosely on the subcommittee which has the responsibility for \nappropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education for many years. While I liked it better when I was \nchairman for 6\\1/2\\ years, I believe the work of the subcommittee goes \non seamlessly regardless of whether Tom Harkin is chairman or Arlen \nSpecter is chairman. I think Senator Harkin and I both recognize you \ncan't get anything done in Washington if you are not willing to cross \nparty lines and make accommodations.\n  May I just parenthetically note my very deep disappointment that \nthere has not been an agreement on a stimulus package before Congress \nadjourns,\n\n[[Page S13780]]\n\naccording to the most recent reports. Perhaps that will be corrected \nbefore we adjourn. If they would assign it to me and Senator Harkin, I \nam sure we could get it worked out.\n  But this subcommittee report adopted by the full committee--and now \nby both the Senate and the House--is one of the most important pieces \nof legislation to emerge from the Congress all year.\n  I regret that I could not be here at the outset when the bill was \ncalled up. But I had reason to go to the hearing of the Commerce \nCommittee which is considering the nomination of John Magaw to be the \nNo. 3 man at that Department. I came back as soon as I could to make \nbrief opening comments before yielding to Senator Wellstone who I know \nis waiting to speak.\n  This bill is one of enormous importance to America. The total figure \nof $123 billion represents an enormous investment in critical aspects \nof our way of life.\n  This bill contains very important funding and increases in the \nDepartment of Labor on worker safety, funding for the National Labor \nRelations Board, funding for the various other agencies, the Mine \nHealth Safety Board, and OSHA.\n\n  It is my hope yet that we will resolve the critical question of \nergonomics on which we await action by the Department Of Labor \nsubcommittee. The subcommittee has held extensive hearings.\n  With respect to education, this bill contains more than $48 billion. \nThere is an enormous increase for Federal participation in education. \nLast year's budget increased education funding by $5 billion. This \nyear's budget increases education funding by $8 billion more.\n  Not only is there additional Federal funding but, as a result of \naction by the Congress, we are directing more of this money to the \nneediest students. Philadelphia, illustratively, under the new formula \nwill get $115 million as opposed to $90 million last year.\n  In the conference, we adopted an amendment to provide additional \ntargeted funding for those who were the neediest. We have provided very \nextensive funding on Pell grants and on guaranteed student loans in our \nrecognition that education is a priority second to none and a major \ncapital investment for the United States.\n  On a brief personal note, education was very heavily emphasized in \nthe Specter household, perhaps because my parents had so little of it. \nMy father was an immigrant from Russia in 1911 and had no formal \neducation but became very extensively self-educated. My mother only \nwent to the eighth grade but increased her educational background on \nher own. But my brother and my two sisters and I have been able to \nshare the American dream because of our educational opportunity. When \nthe President talks about leaving no child behind, it is not only for \nchildren, it is for college students, adult education, and literacy \ntraining.\n  There is very important funding in this bill.\n  The health subcommittee has taken the lead in increasing the funding \nfor the National Institutes of Health--some $11 billion in the past \nseveral appropriations cycles. This year's increase was $2.9 billion. \nFrankly, I would like to have seen more, but there were other \npriorities.\n  The mark from our Senate subcommittee was $3.4 billion. The National \nInstitutes of Health are the crown jewels of the Federal Government--\nmaybe the only jewels of the Federal Government. They have made \nmarvelous strides in conquering Parkinson's, perhaps with a sight 5 \nyears down the road to cure Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer, heart \ndisease, and virtually every known malady.\n  Three years ago, there burst upon the scene the stem cell issue. Stem \ncells are extracted from embryos. Now they are working on inserting the \nstem cells in the human brain to cure Parkinson's or delay Alzheimer's; \nor into the heart, or into many other parts of the body.\n  A controversy has arisen because some object to stem cell research \nbecause they are extracted from embryos. Embryos can produce life. But \nthe ones which are used for stem cell research would be discarded. \nEmbryos are created from in vitro fertilization--customarily about a \ndozen. Mainly three or four are used, and the balance are being \ndiscarded.\n  If any of those embryos could produce life, I think they ought to \nproduce life and ought not be used for stem cell production. If they \nare not going to produce life, why throw them away? Why not use them \nfor saving lives?\n  We have put into this bill $1 billion for sort of a test program on \nembryo adoption. Let us try to find people who will adopt embryos and \ntake the necessary steps on implanting them in a woman to produce life. \nIf that could be done and use all of the embryos, that would be \nmarvelous to produce life. But where those embryos are going to be \ndiscarded, I think the sensible thing to do is to use them for saving \nlives.\n  We have had in this Chamber an effort by our subcommittee and then \nthe full committee to expand Federal funding for research on stem \ncells.\n  Right now Federal funding is permitted on stem cells once they have \nbeen extracted but not to extract them. My view is, that is something \nin which the Federal Government ought to participate, with the \nextensive funding available now in NIH.\n  Our efforts to expand that activity, to some extent, was complicated \nby amendments offered by the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback, who \nwanted to raise the cloning issue. We deferred that until next year \nbecause it would have tied up the bill for a protracted period of time. \nAs the slow schedule of the Senate has worked, we could have been tied \nup, in any event, but we made the judgment, with the agreement of the \nmajority leader, that a freestanding bill would come up in February or \nMarch.\n  While there is a consensus against cloning of another individual, \nthere has been an unfortunate use of the terminology ``therapeutic \ncloning,'' which is really a transplant. That involves a process where \nthere is the DNA for a person, for example, who has Parkinson's, and \nthat is inserted into the embryo so the stem cells come out consistent \nwith the patient, not being rejected by the patient. So that is \nsomething we will be working on further with hearings set for our \nsubcommittee into the next year.\n  We have taken a very firm stand on the bioterrorism issue, with our \nbill containing $338 million, and our subcommittee taking the lead on \nhaving hearings which eventuated in the supplemental appropriations \nbill having an additional $2.5 billion for the needs of State and local \nhealth departments purchasing vaccines against bioterrorism.\n  When the officials from the Centers for Disease Control came in, we \nadmonished, I guess is as good a word as any, why they had not made the \nsubcommittee aware of their needs before.\n  It is no secret, you did not have to wait until anthrax came into the \nHart Building or the terrorist attack on September 11 to realize the \ndangers of bioterrorism. Had they told us what their needs were, we \nwould have responded as we were responding with billions for NIH.\n  But we worked through that. We asked them in an October 3 hearing for \na list of all the bioterrorism threats and what it would cost to cure \nthem. They produced the list, but we could not get it. CDC had to give \nit to HHS which did not want to disclose it because HHS had to give it \nto OMB, the Office of Management and Budget. By the time you finish \nplaying alphabet soup in Washington, virtually everything is stymied.\n  But we had a subsequent hearing, and we got these figures, asking \nthem what their professional judgment was as to what the funding should \nbe. We have taken very important steps to protect America on \nbioterrorism.\n  Head Start has been a big issue for the subcommittee. There is \nadditional funding, as we have in community health centers, and \nelevating women's health with additional funding. There was an \ninitiative taken in the early 1990s by Senator Harkin and myself to \ncreate a separate unit on women's health in the National Institutes of \nHealth. There is additional funding for LIHEAP, the aging programs, \nAIDS, education, including education for disadvantaged children, school \nimprovement programs, impact aid, bilingual education, special \neducation, student aid, and public broadcasting.\n  Madam President, the conference agreement on the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education bill before the Senate today includes \n$123.1\n\n[[Page S13781]]\n\nbillion in discretionary spending, the full amount of the \nsubcommittee's budget authority allocation under section 302(b) of the \nBudget Act. This amount represents an increase of $14 billion over the \nfiscal year 2001 freeze level.\n  At this time, I want to take this opportunity to thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, the chairman of the \ncommittee, for his hard work in bringing this bill through the \ncommittee and on the floor for full consideration by all Senators.\n  The programs funded within the subcommittee's jurisdiction provide \nresources to improve the public health and strengthen biomedical \nresearch, assure a quality education for America's children, and offer \nopportunities for individuals seeking to improve job skills. I would \nlike to mention several important accomplishments of this bill.\n  The conference agreement includes $23.3 billion for the National \nInstitutes of Health, the crown jewel of the Federal Government. The \n$2.9 billion increase over the fiscal year 2001 appropriation will \nsupport medical research that is being conducted at institutions \nthroughout the country. This increase will continue the effort to \ndouble NIH by fiscal year 2003. These funds will be critical in \ncatalyzing scientific discoveries that will lead to new treatments and \ncures for a whole host of diseases.\n  Since September 11, 2001, Americans have become acutely aware that \nour enemies will use any means to murder and maim large numbers of U.S. \ncivilians. The use of biological agents is no longer a threat--it is a \nreality. The committee has included $338 million to coordinate state \nand local readiness, stockpile appropriate pharmaceuticals, and build \nour public health infrastructure to respond to any act of bioterrorism. \nThe anthrax found in Senator Daschle's office and in the House and \nSenate mail rooms, at postal facilities in New Jersey and the District \nof Columbia and surrounding areas, in news and other media facilities \nproves that we must try and prevent, detect and quickly respond to any \nfurther acts of bioterrorism. The supplemental appropriations bill \nwhich the Senate will take up shortly contains an additional \n$2,504,314,000 to address the needs of state and local health \ndepartments, purchase smallpox vaccine, to upgrade the capacity of \nlaboratories and the CDC and NIH, and develop new vaccines at the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  For the first time, the conference agreement includes $1 million for \na public awareness campaign to educate Americans about the existence of \nspare embryos and adoption options. During stem cell hearings, we were \nmade aware that there are 100,000 spare frozen embryos stored in \ninvitro fertilization clinics throughout the U.S. Many infertile \ncouples could choose to adopt and implant such embryos if they were \naware of that option.\n  To enable all children to develop and function at their highest \npotential, the agreement includes $6.5 billion for the Head Start \nProgram, an increase of $338 million over the last \nyear's appropriation. This increase will provide services to 916,000 \nch8ldren in 49,420 classrooms across the nation.\n\n  To help provide primary health care services to the medically \nindigent and undeserved populations in rural and urban areas, the \nagreement contains $1.34 billion for community health centers. This \namount represents an increase of $175.1 million over the fiscal year \n2001 appropriation. These centers provide health care to nearly 12 \nmillion low-income patients, many of whom are uninsured.\n  Again this year, the conferees placed very high priority on women's \nhealth. Included in the amount is $26.8 million for the Public Health \nService, Office of Women's Health, an increase of $9.5 million over \nlast year's funding level to continue and expand programs to develop \nmodel health care services for women, provide monies for a \ncomprehensive review of the impact of heart disease on women, and to \nlaunch an osteoporosis public educatoin campaign aimed at teenagers. \nAlso included is $265 million for family planning programs; $124.4 \nmillion to support the programs that provide assistance to women who \nhave been victims of abuse and to initiate and expand domestic violence \nprevention programs.\n  In fiscal year 2001, the Labor-HHS Subcommittee held several hearings \nto explore the factors leading to medical errors and received testimony \nfrom family members and patients detailing their experiences with \nmedical mistakes. The Institute of Medicine also gave testimony and \noutlined findings from their recent report which indicated that 98,000 \ndeaths occur each year because of medical errors and these deaths may \ncost up to $29 billion in excess health care expenditures and lost \nproductivity each year. The conference report bill before the Senate \ncontains $55 million to determine ways to reduce medical errors.\n  The agreement maintains $2 billion for the low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program LIHEAP. The amount, when combined with the \nadditional $300 million in emergency appropriations, will provide a \ntotal of $2.3 billion for the LIHEAP program fiscal year 2002 LIHEAP is \nthe key energy assistance program for low income families in \nPennsylvania and in other cold weather states throughout the Nation. \nFunding supports grants to states to deliver critical assistance to low \nincome households to help meet higher energy costs.\n  For programs serving the elderly, the agreement includes: $357 \nmillion for supportive services and senior centers; $566.5 million for \ncongregate and home-delivered nutrition services; and $206 million for \nthe national senior volunteer corps; $445 million for the community \nservice employment program which provides part-time employment \nopportunities for low-income elderly. Also, the bill provides $893.4 \nmillion for the National Institute on Aging for research into the \ncauses and cures of Alzheimer's disease and other aging related \ndisorders; funds to continue geriatric education centers; and the \nMedicare insurance counseling program.\n  For AIDS, the agreement includes in this amount is $1.9 billion for \nRyan White programs, an increase of $103.1 million. also included is $; \n$781.2 million for AIDS prevention programs at the Centers for Disease \nControl; and $2.341 billion for research at the National Institute of \nAllergy and Infectious Diseases.\n  To enhance this Nation's investment in education, the bill before the \nSenate contains $48.5 billion in discretionary education funds, an \nincrease of $8.3 billion over the fiscal year 2001 level, and $4 \nbillion more than the President's budget request.\n  For programs to educate disadvantaged children, the bill recommends \n$12.3 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion over last year's level. The \nagreement also includes $250 million for the Even Start program to \nprovide educational services to low-income children and their families.\n  For school improvement programs, the agreement includes $7.8 billion, \nan increase of $1.6 billion over the fiscal year 2001 appropriation. \nWithin this amount, $2.850 billion will be used for a new state grant \nprogram for improving teacher quality. The agreement also includes \n$700.5 million for educational technology state grants.\n  For impact Aid programs, the agreement includes $1.143 billion, an \nincrease of $150.1 million over the 2001 appropriation. Included in the \nrecommendation is: $50 million for payments for children with \ndisabilities; $982.5 million for basic support payments, $48 million \nfor construction and $50 million for payments for Federal property.\n  For bilingual education, the agreement provides $665 million to \nassist in the education of immigrant and limited--English proficient \nstudents. This recommendation is an increase of $205 million over the \n2001 appropriation.\n  For special education, the $8.6 billion provided in the agreement \nwill help local educational agencies meet the requirement that all \nchildren with disabilities have access to a free, appropriate public \neducation, and all infants and toddlers with disabilities have access \nto early intervention services. The $1.2 billion increase over the \nFY'01 appropriation will serve an estimated 6.5 million children age 3-\n21, at a cost of $1,133 per child. While also supporting 612,700 \npreschoolers at a cost of $637 per child.\n  For student aid programs, the agreement provides $12.3 billion, an \nincrease of $1.6 billion over last year's amount. Pell grants, the \ncornerstone of student financial aid, have been increased by $250 for a \nmaximum grant 34 million,\n\n[[Page S13782]]\n\nthe work study program is held at the FY '01 level and the Perkins \nloans programs is increase by $7.5 million.\n  The agreement includes $380 million for the Corporation for Public \nBoardcasting. In addition to the core amount provided for CPB, the \ncommittee recommends $25 million for the conversion to digital \nbroadcasting.\n  There are many other notable accomplishments in this agreement, but \nfor the sake of time, I have mentioned just several of the kep \nhighlights so that the nation may grasp the scope and importance of \nthis bill.\n  In closing, Madam President, I again thank Senator Harkin and his \nstaff and the other Senators on the subcommittee for their cooperation.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from Minnesota for his patience, \nif, in fact, he was patient.\n  I yield the floor. And may I note for the record that I am going to \nhave to return to the Commerce Committee, but I will be back to carry \nforward on the floor consideration of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I, first of all, say to Senator Specter that was very \ngracious. Senator Specter and Senator Harkin--Senator Harkin and \nSenator Specter--are the ones who have led us, the ones who have been \nthe leaders on this bill. So it was important to hear Senator Specter \noutline this legislation. I thank Senators Harkin and Specter for their \nleadership. I am very proud of what they have done, given the resources \nwith which we had to work.\n  I also thank Ellen Murray and Bettilou Taylor for their work. For a \nlot of us, there is a lot in this bill that is important to the people \nwe love and believe in in our States. It is just a fact that a lot of \nthe real tough work is done by the people who work with us. I thank \nthem.\n  I also thank Ellen Gerrity because she is the one who has really \ndriven, for me, and for lots of people, the mental health work. I am \nblessed to have her working with me. Senator Domenici and I are blessed \nto have her working with us.\n  On the vote which occurred 2 days ago in the conference committee, 10 \nHouse Members basically decided to eliminate the mental health parity \nlegislation which would have ended the discrimination against people \nwho struggle with this illness. This was the chance to end the \ndiscrimination, and they decided not to do so.\n  There were 67 Senators who were cosponsors of this legislation. It \npassed our committee--the HELP Committee--with the leadership of \nSenator Kennedy, by a 21-to-0 vote. It was unanimously accepted on the \nfloor of the Senate. And 244 House Members called on the conference \ncommittee: Please, don't block this legislation. This is an idea whose \ntime has come. You can do something very good. You can end the \ndiscrimination against people struggling with this illness.\n  But the insurance companies won the day. The insurance companies \nlobbied furiously, and they got the House leadership to stop this. And \nthe White House did not give us the support. No. The White House did \nnot give us the support.\n  House leaders say next year they will hold hearings. They never have \nin the last 6, 7, 8, 9 years, but they say they will hold hearings. The \nWhite House says: We want to help next year. They could have helped \nthis year. They could have helped now. It is not as if this \ndiscrimination just started yesterday. It is not as if we have not been \nworking on this legislation for years. But they did not help now.\n  But I am confident, working with Senator Domenici--I am proud to work \nwith him--that we will get their support next year. All of the groups \nand organizations representing all the people who struggle with this \nillness, and all the people who have loved ones who struggle with this \nillness, will be back.\n\n  My hope is that next year there will be a thousand people who \nstruggle with this illness and who have friends and loved ones who \nstruggle with this illness who will go to the House of Representatives \nand get 1 inch away from these Members who have blocked this bill and \nsay: We are not going to let you do this to us any longer. We are men \nand women of worth and dignity and substance, and we refuse to accept \nthis discrimination any longer.\n  They argue premiums would go up, but the Congressional Budget Office \nsaid premiums would go up 0.9 percent. They say it would be too \nexpensive, but they do not talk about the $70 billion a year that we \nsave by getting the treatment to people who now work, who can work with \nmore productivity, with less absenteeism, or whose children now will be \nin school and will not be in jail, incarcerated, and needing to receive \nsocial services help.\n  The Washington Post editorialized last week that ``the new asylums of \nthe 21st century'' for people struggling with mental illness are the \nprisons. I visited some of these juvenile ``correctional'' facilities. \nI have seen these children who never should have been there.\n  I say to Senator Harkin, if there had been treatment for them on the \nfront end, they would have never wound up incarcerated.\n  I went down to a hearing in Houston with Sheila Jackson-Lee. She \nasked me to come down there. It was packed with desperate parents who \ntalked about the fact that their children ended up in jails because \nthey couldn't get any coverage or help anywhere else. And the \nleadership of the House of Representatives, doing the bidding of the \ninsurance companies, blocked this bill, and the White House did not \nhelp.\n  Now with the insurance industry we have something we have to be \ncareful about. They are saying maybe next year we will cover only \nserious mental illness. They know that 90 percent of their costs are \nassociated with severe mental illness, and they know that if they now \nall of a sudden say other illnesses won't be covered, the accountants \nworking for the insurance companies will decide, not the doctors.\n  Do you want to know what will happen if all of a sudden we say we \nwill only cover what they say is serious mental illness? The children \nwill be the ones most discriminated against.\n  Suicide is the third leading cause of death of young people in the \nUnited States. Every year 30,000 Americans take their lives. In 90 \npercent of these situations it is because of depression, and the cause \nis inadequately treated mental illness. Every 18 minutes a child or \nadult takes their life because of the unmitigated, searing pain of \ndepression and mental illness, and next year, while Americans wait for \nfairness in mental health care, thousands more will die and millions \nmore will suffer because the House of Representatives, the Republican \nleadership, couldn't stand up to the insurance industry and couldn't do \nthe right thing. And the White House couldn't see its way to help.\n  I thank the 67 Senators who helped. I thank the 244 House colleagues \nwho helped. I thank the 154 organizations that have supported this \nlegislation. I thank the Coalition for Fairness in Mental Illness \nCoverage, and I thank all of the organizations that are involved in \nthat coalition.\n  I look forward to the day when people with mental illness will \nreceive decent, humane, and timely health care. It will be a good day \nfor our country.\n  A critical vote occurred in the Labor Health and Human Services \nconference committee earlier this week when 10 House members decided \nwhether Congress would respond to the will of the people and establish \nfair treatment for people with mental illness. They decided they would \nnot. The Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act (S. 543), supported by \n67 Senators and 244 House members, was included in the Senate version \nof the LHHS appropriations bill, but not in the House version. Most of \nthe 32 conferees had expressed strong support for this bill, and thus \nhad their chance to vote their conscience and resist the enormous \npressure that had been brought to bear by the business and insurance \nindustries to kill this measure. Unfortunately, these lobbyists were \njoined by the House Republican Leadership and the White House to stop \nthis bill in its tracks. They succeeded when the 10 House Republicans \nvoted against accepting the mental health provision. Mental health \nparity was dropped.\n  House leaders are reportedly promising to hold hearings on parity for \nnext year, and I strongly urge them to do so, and to allow no further \ndelay to pass a full mental health parity bill. I look forward to \ncontinuing my long partnership with Senator Domenici and\n\n[[Page S13783]]\n\nworking with the House to ensure that such hearings are fair and \nrepresent all those with mental illness. Mental health parity \nsupporters on the House side have waited nine years for the authorizing \ncommittees to do just that and move the mental health parity \nlegislation in the House. The White House too has expressed support for \nworking on mental health parity legislation next year, though they had \nno explanation for their opposition to moving the bill now. They were \nvery pleased with the bill as it was voted out of the Senate HELP \ncommittee with a vote of 21-0 on August 1, 2001. Yet, when Americans \nwith mental illness needed the support of their President, now more \nthan ever, he was not there for them.\n  Sometimes opponents claim that ending unfair limits for mental health \ncare will cost too much, yet the Congressional Budget Office reported \nthat the bill would increase total premium costs by only 0.9 percent. \nMoreover, this estimate does not even take into account the cost \nsavings that have resulted in overall health care costs when mental \nhealth care is properly covered. Nor does it consider the cost savings \nin the workplace when absenteeism is reduced, and productivity is \nincreased. Something else is lurking behind the claim of cost problems. \nWhat is lurking there is the continuing and widespread discrimination \nagainst people with mental illness in our health care system.\n  The stigma against people with mental disorders has persisted \nthroughout history. As a result, people with mental illness are often \nafraid to seek treatment for fear that they will not be able to receive \nhelp, a fear all too often realized when they encounter outright \ndiscrimination in health coverage. Why is it that because the illness \nis located in the brain, and not the heart or liver or stomach, that \nsuch stigma persists?\n  One of the most serious manifestations of stigma is reflected in the \ndiscriminatory ways in which mental health care is paid for in our \nhealth care system. Health plans routinely set aside ``mental'' \nillnesses as distinct from ``physical'' illnesses in health care \ncoverage. Inexplicably, they set an arbitrary number of hospital days \nor visits, or a higher level of copayments or deductible, as a way to \nhandle mental health care. There is no clinical or scientific evidence \nthat mental illness, or any illness for that matter, can always be \ntreated successfully within a fixed number of days. Nor is there any \neconomic or moral justification for charging people with mental illness \nmore money for their care. One can only conclude that health plans try \nto save money at the expense of people with mental illness, and they \nbank on the stigma that accompanies this illness to discourage \nindividuals from demanding better care. What a sad commentary on our \nhealth care system, and on our country.\n\n  The opponents, business and insurance lobbyists and their \nCongressional friends, who cite cost issues fail to recognize that \nproper treatment of mental illness actually saves money. They ignore \nthe $70 billion per year cost of untreated mental illness. They also \nfail to recognize that our society picks up the cost of untreated \nmental illness in any case, for untreated illnesses don't just go away. \nChildren with mental illness may end up in public institutions, foster \ncare, or jail because their parents cannot afford their care. Adults \nwho have private insurance are often forced into public health care \nsystems financed through State governments, Medicare, and Medicaid. \nThese systems are then forced to take scarce resources from those who \nhave no insurance. Families are forced into bankruptcy; lives are \nbroken; and lives are lost.\n  We also know that the number of people with serious mental illnesses \nin America's jails and prisons today is five times greater than the \nnumber in state mental hospitals. That is what happens when people, \nincluding those with jobs and private health insurance, do not get \nadequate care. How can our country tolerate this kind of abuse of basic \nhuman rights? Prisons, as the Washington Post editorial noted last \nMonday, are ``the new asylums of the 21st century.'' This \ncriminalization of the mentally ill is inhumane. It is also emotionally \nand financially costly, and a testament to government failure at all \nlevels. We cannot afford to lose any more lives and we must not let \nthose with mental illness go on being treated as criminals or as \nunworthy of medical care.\n  Opponents also often try to defeat mental health parity legislation \nby claiming they want to cover mental illness, but only ``serious'' \nmental illness, and thus they would limit coverage to a selected list \nthat is also designed to discriminate, most of all against children. \nThe bill that was developed this year was carefully crafted to address \nthe health needs of all those with mental illness as well as the \nconcerns of employers, and it did so without discriminating against \nparticular diagnoses. The insurance industry is very aware that 90 \npercent of their costs associated with mental illness are associated \nwith the most severe, as is true for other kinds of health issues as \nwell. And yet, they want to oppose coverage for life-threatening \nillnesses that accountants, and not doctors, have listed as not \n``serious''. Any effort on the part of the lobbyists, the House \nRepublicans, or the White House to limit coverage by particular \ndiagnoses should be stopped immediately. It is just another way to try \nto stop the effort to provide fairness in treatment for people with \nmental illness.\n  We know that mental illness is a real, painful, and sometimes fatal \ndisease. It is also a treatable disease. The gap between what we know \nfrom scientific research and clinical expertise and what we do on \nbehalf of patients is lethal. Suicide is the third leading cause of \ndeath of young people in the U.S. Each year, 30,000 Americans take \ntheir lives, and in 90 percent of these situations, the cause is \ninadequate treated mental illness. This is one of the true costs of \ndelaying this bill that I hope those who voted against this understand: \nEvery 18 minutes, a child or adult takes their lives because of the \nunmitigated, searing pain of depression or other mental illness. Next \nyear, while Americans wait for fairness in mental health care, \nthousands will die and millions will suffer.\n  Parity will do so much to end the unfair cost requirements, access \nlimits, and personal indignities that people seeking mental health care \nhave been forced to endure. Parity in private insurance has been shown \nto save other health care costs and would revolutionize our country and \nour health care system in extraordinarily humane ways. Congress was \nstopped from doing this right now because of a few members and their \nlobbyist friends. We must not let these powerful lobbyists subvert the \nwill of the Congress and the will of the 154 supporting organizations \nof the 2001 Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act and the millions of \nAmericans they represent whose lives are touched by the pain, \nsuffering, and sorrow of mental illness.\n  I thank the 67 Senate and the 244 House colleagues who worked hard to \ndo the right thing for people with mental illness, and I urge them to \nnot take this defeat lightly. I especially want to thank the 154 \norganizations who supported this legislation and fought for its \npassage, particularly the Coalition for Fairness in Mental Illness \nCoverage and its member organizations: American Managed Behavioral \nHealthcare Association, American Medical Association, American \nPsychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, Federation \nof American Hospitals, National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, National \nAssociation of Psychiatric Health Systems, and National Mental Health \nAssociation.\n  We must return quickly to this bill early in 2002 and accept no \nexcuses from the Administration or the House for any further delay. I \nlook forward to the day when people with mental illness receive decent, \nhumane, and timely health care. It will be a good day for our country.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, today I would like to bring to your \nattention title VI of the Labor, Health and Human Services \nAppropriations bill (H.R. 3061), which is the ``Mark to Market \nExtension Act of 2001''. This legislation was passed unanimously out of \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on August 1, 2001. \nWe worked closely with both the House and the Administration to craft \nthe final product that is now part of this conference report.\n  The legislation will ensure that HUD continues to have the authority \nto restructure the rents and the mortgages of its FHA-insured section 8 \nproject-\n\n[[Page S13784]]\n\nbased portfolio. These properties have been operating for the past 20 \nyears on long term rental subsidy contracts, many of which are \ncurrently paying above-market rents. The program we seek to reauthorize \nprovides HUD with the tools to reduce those rents to market levels and \nto restructure the underlying mortgages so that the new, lower rents \nwill be sufficient to cover the debt. At the same time, the program \nprovides for the rehabilitation of these projects, and requires another \nlong term commitment to keep the properties affordable.\n  The appropriators asked that this reauthorization be incorporated \ninto this appropriations bill in order to make use of the $300 million \nin savings that this legislation will generate. We were happy to \naccommodate this request.\n  I would like to thank Senator Reed, the Chairman of the Subcommittee \non Housing and Transportation, Senator Gramm and Senator Allard for \ntheir hard work, support and cooperation throughout this process.\n  Below is a detailed description of title VI, which I would like to \nsubmit for the record on behalf of myself and Senators Reed, Gramm and \nAllard.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the two statements be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of Senator Sarbanes, Senator Gramm, Senator Reed, and Senator \nAllard on Extension of Mark-to-Market Program for Multifamily Assisted \n         Housing in FY-20 Labor-HHS Appropriations Legislation\n\n       The following represents the views of the Chairman and \n     Ranking Members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, \n     and Urban Affairs and its Subcommittee on Housing and \n     Transportation regarding the ``Mark-to-Market Extension Act \n     of 2001,'' which is part of the Labor-HHS Appropriations \n     Conference Report.\n\n\nSubtitle A--Multifamily Housing Mortgage and Assistance Restructing and \n                       Section 8 Contract Renewal\n\n                         Section 602: Purposes\n\n       The bill includes a number of new purposes that reflect \n     some of the concerns of the Committee and a number of \n     stakeholders regarding the administration of the mark-to-\n     market (MTM) program. For example, concerns were raised that \n     the private participating administrative entities (PAEs) \n     might not be providing the amount of rehabilitation and \n     reserves necessary for the properties to meet the 30 years \n     affordability commitment required by the law. Likewise, it is \n     important for the PAEs, both public and private, to correctly \n     calculate project expenses. Underestimation of expenses, as \n     with inadequate investment in rehabilitation, will undermine \n     the physical and financial condition of the properties. \n     Failure to account realistically and accurately for the \n     expenses of running a project could result in the project \n     underwriting being too ``tight'' with too little debt \n     restructured, and too little cash flow. In such cases, \n     unexpected events, such as spikes in energy prices, could \n     force the property into default. Such an outcome would \n     undercut the purpose of this program, which is intended to \n     reposition these properties both physically and financially \n     to continue to serve low-income residents for the long haul.\n       The Committee expects the Department to continue to keep \n     track of the properties after they have been restructured. \n     This is particularly important for a number of properties \n     that have had rents reduced to market levels without the debt \n     being restructured. These properties have been put on a \n     ``watch list'' to make sure the owners continue to maintain \n     the properties, despite the reduction in cash flow. The \n     Committee expects HUD to act expeditiously if these \n     properties show any signs of deterioration.\n\n                 Section 611: Mark-to-Market Amendments\n\n       Subsection (a)--Authorizes $10 million per year for tenant \n     groups, non-profit organizations, and public entities for \n     technical assistance and capacity building to meet the \n     purposes of the Act. This provision allows the funding to be \n     carried over. Entities that qualify for debt forgiveness \n     under section 517(a)(5) automatically qualify for grants \n     under this subsection.\n       (b) Exception rents are allowed for up to 5 percent of the \n     total number of projects subject to a portfolio restructuring \n     agreement.\n       (c) Provides for notice to residents of the Secretary's \n     rejection of an assistance plan.\n       (d) Allows certain properties to go through the program \n     upon transfer of ownership, at the request of the new owner.\n       (e) Provides the Secretary the authority to reduce the \n     amount of funds contributed by owners for rehabilitation in \n     cases where additional features such as an elevator or air \n     conditioning are added to the project and were not previously \n     in that project. This flexibility extends to these additional \n     features only; the Committee expects the Secretary to \n     continue to apply the full matching funds requirement for all \n     standard rehabilitation.\n       (f) Allows owners of previously eligible projects to opt \n     back into the program. HUD believes that the section 8 \n     contracts on some properties that should have gone through \n     the mark-to-market program were renewed without going through \n     the program. This subsection allows such properties, at the \n     owner's consent, to get back into the program, if the \n     property would have been otherwise eligible.\n       (g) Redefines second mortgages to allow inclusion of \n     miscellaneous costs, subject to likelihood of repayment. This \n     subsection also allows the Secretary to assign the second \n     mortgage to an entity that meets the conditions for debt \n     modification or forgiveness. The Congress intends this \n     additional tool to be used in the same framework as \n     modification or forgiveness. For example, if HUD would \n     otherwise have forgiven a second mortgage, we would expect \n     the Secretary to assign the mortgage to the eligible owner \n     without any additional requirements, if that is the \n     preference of the non-profit owner.\n       (h) Retains program exemption for elderly projects financed \n     through section 202 that have been refinanced.\n\n    Section 613: Consistency of Rent Levels Under Enhanced Voucher \n                   Assistance and Rent Restructurings\n\n       The Mark-to-market program is designed to lower section 8 \n     rental payments that are above market and, where necessary, \n     restructure the underlying debt in eligible properties. To \n     determine if the contract rent is above, below, or at market \n     levels requires that a rent comparability study be done. The \n     Department raised a concern that some rent comparability \n     studies may be inaccurate, resulting in a number of contracts \n     being renewed at above market rents. Alternatively, the \n     Committee has heard reports that OMHAR is setting rents too \n     low, or that the value of vouchers being provided to \n     residents in the case of opt outs are being set too high, \n     thereby encouraging owners to avoid the mark-to-market \n     program.\n       The Committee believes that none of these results is \n     desirable: properties with rents that are above market should \n     go through the program in order to get a thorough financial \n     and physical review. Moreover, whatever organization is \n     establishing the comparable market rent, whether it is the \n     PAE or the PHA, the results should be consistent so that the \n     owner's decision to stay in the program or opt out is not \n     determined by who is doing the rent study. In this section, \n     the Committee directs the Secretary to establish procedures \n     for ensuring rents as determined through this program, the \n     contract renewal process, or for enhanced vouchers for the \n     same units are reasonably consistent.\n\n    Section 614: Eligible Inclusions for Renewal Rents of Partially \n                           Assisted Buildings\n\n       Allows certain projects that are partially assisted with \n     section 8 to get budget-based rents up to comparable market \n     rents, sufficient to cover the costs of maintenance of the \n     project.\n\n Section 615: Eligibility of Restructuring Projects for Miscellaneous \n                           Housing Insurance\n\n       Amends Section 223(a)(7) of the National Housing Act to \n     allow HUD-held mortgages on properties in the program to be \n     treated as FHA-insured loans to expedite the refinancing \n     process. In addition, it extends the maximum term of FHA-\n     insured and HUD-held mortgages refinanced under this \n     subsection to 30 years.\n\n\n   Subtitle B--Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring\n\n    Section 621: Reauthorization of Office and Extension of Program\n\n       Extends the program to October 1, 2006. Extends the Office \n     until October 1, 2004.\n\n Sections 622 and 623: Appointment of Director and Vacancy in Position \n                              of Director\n\n       Establishes the procedure for appointing the Director of \n     OMHAR and for filling vacancies. The Director would be \n     appointed by the President, but would no longer be a Senate-\n     confirmed position.\n\n         Section 624: Oversight by Federal Housing Commissioner\n\n       Places OMHAR under the jurisdiction of the FHA \n     Commissioner/Assistant Secretary of Housing, as requested by \n     the Administration. This is being done to enable better \n     coordination between the Office of Housing and OMHAR. The \n     Committee does this with the understanding, as expressed by \n     Assistant Secretary Weicher at the Subcommittee's June 19, \n     2001 hearing, that HUD has ``every expectation that [OMHAR] \n     will continue to be fully dedicated to [the mark-to-mark] \n     work.''\n       The Committee also expects the FHA Commissioner to work \n     conscientiously to maintain the highly qualified staff that \n     exists at OMHAR. At the hearing, the GAO witness noted \n     several times of the need to retain OMHAR's ``contract staff \n     that have unique expertise in this program. . . .''\n\n            Section 625: Limitation on Subsequent Employment\n\n       Prohibits certain OMHAR employees from subsequent \n     compensation from parties with financial interests in the \n     program for a period of 1 year.\n\n\n          Subtitle C--Miscellaneous Housing Program Amendments\n\n      Section 631: Extension of CDBG Public Services Cap Exception\n\n       Extends the expanded public services cap for Los Angeles \n     for an additional 2 years. It is expected that this will be \n     the last in a number of extensions.\n\n    Section 632: Use of Section 8 Enhanced Vouchers for Prepayments\n\n       Extends eligibility for enhanced vouchers to projects that \n     prepaid in 1996.\n\n[[Page S13785]]\n\n   Section 633: Prepayment and Refinancing of Loans for Section 202 \n                           Supportive Housing\n\n       Makes the refinancing provisions for elderly (section 202) \n     projects in the American Homeownership and Economic \n     Opportunity Act of 2000 self-enacting. The Committee believes \n     that the provisions enacted last year should have already \n     been implemented by HUD. This Section makes it clear that the \n     provisions from the 2000 Act are self-enacting, and do not \n     need implementing regulations from the Department.\n\n\n changes to the 2001 and 2002 appropriations committee allocations and \n                        the budgetary aggregates\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, section 314 of the Congressional Budget \nAct, as amended, requires the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto adjust the budgetary aggregates and the allocation for the \nAppropriations Committee by the amount of appropriations designated as \nemergency spending pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced \nBudget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. The \nconference report to H.R. 3061, the Departments of Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act \nfor 2002 includes $300 million in emergency-designated funding for the \nLow-Income Home Energy Assistant Program. That budget authority will \nresult in $75 million in new outlays in 2002.\n  Pursuant to section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act, I hereby \nrevise the 2002 allocation provided to the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee in the concurrent budget resolution in the following amounts.\n\n     TABLE 1.--REVISED ALLOCATION FOR APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE, 2002\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Budget\n                                                 authority     Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent Allocation:\n  General Purpose Discretionary...............      549,444      551,304\n  Highways....................................            0       28,489\n  Mass Transit................................            0        5,275\n  Conservation................................        1,760        1,232\n  Mandatory...................................      358,567      350,837\n                                               -------------------------\n    Total.....................................      909,771      937,137\n                                               =========================\nAdjustments:\n  General Purpose Discretionary...............          300           75\n  Highways....................................            0            0\n  Mass Transit................................            0            0\n  Conservation................................            0            0\n  Mandatory...................................            0            0\n                                               -------------------------\n    Total.....................................          300           75\n                                               =========================\nRevised Allocation:\n  General Purpose Discretionary...............      549,744      551,379\n  Highways....................................            0       28,489\n  Mass Transit................................            0            0\n  Conservation................................        1,760        1,232\n  Mandatory...................................      358,567      350,837\n                                               -------------------------\n                                                    910,071      937,212\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for the conference report to H.R. 3061, \nthe Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002.\n  The conference report provides $123.371 billion in discretionary \nbudget authority, which will result in new outlays in 2002 of $50.089 \nbillion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into \naccount, discretionary outlays for H.R. 3061 total $107.791 billion in \n2002. The conference report provides virtually the same amount of \nbudget authority as did the Senate-passed bill, which provided $123.37 \nbillion. The conference report is at the Senate subcommittee's section \n302(b) allocation for both budget authority and outlays.\n  Included in the conference report's total is $300 million in \nemergency-designated funding for the low-income home energy assistance \nprogram, (LIHEAP), which will result in new outlays of $75 million in \n2002. In accordance with standard budget practice, I am adjusting the \nappropriations committee's allocation by the amount of that emergency-\ndesignated spending.\n  Additionally, H.R. 3061 also provides $18.874 billion in advance \nappropriations for 2003 for employment and training, health resources, \nchild care, and education programs. Those advances are specifically \nallowed for under the budget resolution adopted for 2002, and, combined \nwith all other advance appropriations considered by the Senate to date, \nfall within the limit imposed by the resolution. Further, the report \nadopts the Senate provision extending the Mark-to-Market Program for \nmultifamily assisted housing. That provision, which is included in the \nabove totals, is estimated to save $355 million in 2002. Finally, the \nreport includes language that extends by one year certain benefits \nregarding mental health parity. Because that provision includes \nlanguage directing how its costs are to be counted for budgetary \npurposes, it violates section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget committee \nscoring of this report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  H.R. 3061, CONFERENCE REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND\n HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT,\n                                  2002\n    [Spending comparisons--Conference Report, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report:\n  Budget Authority...............      123,371      272,937      396,308\n  Outlays........................      107,791      272,968      380,759\nSenate 302(b) allocaiton:\\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............      123,371      272,937      396,308\n  Outlays........................      107,791      272,968      380,759\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............      116,382      272,937      389,265\n  Outlays........................      105,957      272,968      378,925\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............      123,371      272,937      396,308\n  Outlays........................      106,828      272,968      379,796\nSenate-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............      123,370      272,937      396,307\n  Outlays........................      107,749      272,968      380,717\n \n  CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............            0            0            0\n  Outlays........................            0            0            0\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............        7,043            0        7,043\n  Outlays........................        1,834            0        1,834\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............            0            0            0\n  Outlays........................          963            0          963\nSenate-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............            1            0            1\n  Outlays........................           42            0           42\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ For enforcement purposes, the budget committee compares the\n  conference report to the Senate 302(b) allocation.\n \nNotes.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, during this summer's debate on the ESEA \nreauthorization legislation, I offered an amendment to increase the \nauthorization for the new math and science partnerships program from \n$500 million in the Senate bill to $900 million in fiscal year 2002. \nRaising the authorization to this level brought math and science \npartnership participated and science partnership funding to the same \nlevel as the Reading First program also created in the education bill. \nMy amendment passed by voice vote.\n  During that debate, I joined several of my colleagues in emphasizing \nthe critical need to improve math and science education in our nation's \nelementary and secondary schools. U.S. students consistently score \nlower than their counterparts in other nations in math and science, yet \nmore than one in four high school math teachers and nearly one in five \nhigh school science teachers lack even a minor in their main teaching \nfield. The training and preparation of math and science teachers must \nbe a top priority.\n  I am disappointed that the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill \nfunds the math and science partnerships at just $12.5 million in fiscal \nyear 2002-- a level far below the $450 million authorized by Congress \nfor this program in the final ESEA legislation.\n  But I am encouraged by language included in the conference report \nthat states,\n\n     the conferees believe math providing high-quality math and \n     science instruction is of critical importance to our nation's \n     future competitiveness, and agree that math and science \n     professional development opportunities should be expanded. \n     The conferees therefore strongly encourage the Secretary and \n     the State to continue to fund math and science activities \n     within the Teacher Quality Grant program at a comparable \n     level in fiscal year 2002.\n\n  I understand that the conferees intend that at a minimum, the current \ncommitment to the training of math and science teachers will be upheld. \nThe conference report urges the Secretary of Education and the States \nto use the Teacher Quality grant program, funding available for math \nand science partnerships and through other federal grants to bring math \nand science education is a level that adequately prepares our young \npeople for\n\n[[Page S13786]]\n\nthe demands for the demands of the 21 century. I hope that States and \ndistricts continue to increase their efforts in the area. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues next year to further support \nstrong math and science education in schools.\n\n\n               smallpox vaccination for first responders\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, smallpox is a deadly disease that if not \ntreated within the few first days after initial exposure, can cause \ndeath in 1 out of 3 cases. Clearly, this is not a disease to take \nlightly.\n  The problem with smallpox, unlike our recent experience with anthrax, \nis that it is highly contagious, and not simply infectious. Thus, one \nperson can spread the disease to hundreds of people within a matter of \ndays.\n  In this new climate of threatened bioterrorist attacks, it is \nessential that we prepare ourselves for the worst case scenario and not \nsimply sit back and hope for the best.\n  This fact was highlighted in disturbing detail in the ``Dark Winter'' \nexercise conducted by the Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies at \nJohn Hopkins University.\n  ``Dark Winter'' showed that an aerosol release of smallpox virus \nwould spread easily, and that the dose needed to cause infection is \nvery small. The exercise showed that 20 confirmed cases could result in \nas many as 300,000 additional infections and 100,000 deaths in just 3 \nshort weeks.\n  In light of this, the Federal Government is working quickly to ensure \nthat public health officials at all levels of government are able to \nwork together should an outbreak occur.\n  I applaud the steps already taken by the Centers for Disease Control \nto vaccinate some of its first response personnel and to ensure the \nsafety of those vaccinations.\n  But I believe it is not only essential to have a trained and ready \nteam in place at the federal level to respond immediately to a possible \noutbreak, I believe that such a vaccination program should be expanded.\n  That is why I sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary \nThompson urging him to work with Governors to identify and vaccinate \nkey first responders in all 50 States. I specifically asked Secretary \nThompson to instruct CDC officials to reach out to Governors and work \nwith them to create lists of critical first responders in their States, \nand to authorize those vaccinations within the next 60 days.\n\n  We must also work quickly to make sure we have at least 290 million \ndoses of smallpox vaccine available to treat the entire population as \nwell as support additional research on antiviral therapies and other \nvaccines to help control and contain any bioterrorist attack.\n  In California, many companies are already making progress toward such \nantiviral therapies for smallpox, and I hope that we will not delay in \nproviding funding for this type of research.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I commend my colleague from California on her thoughtful \ncomment on the dangers of smallpox. I agree with her that much more \nresearch on new vaccines and therapies is needed and am proud of the \nmany companies across the nation that are leaders in this important \neffort.\n  As my colleague indicates, the CDC has recently developed a strategy \nfor vaccination in response to a smallpox outbreak and the funding \nprovided in the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \nAppropriations bill will help the CDC in carrying out this goal.\n  Additionally, I believe that the funding provided for the Office of \nEmergency Preparedness for bioterrorism-related activities can be \nespecially useful in making the vaccine available to first responders.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my distinguished colleague from Iowa for his \nsupportive remarks, and hope that Secretary Thompson will seriously \nconsider his suggestion.\n  I truly believe that a small cadre of vaccinated first responders \nfrom each of the 50 states would provide an indispensable complement to \nthe CDC staff already inoculated.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with my colleague from California that \nvaccinating first responders should be given serious consideration as \nthe CDC and the Office of Emergency Preparedness pursue bioterrorist \nactivities.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As we continue to discuss funding to prepare for \npotential bioterrorist attacks, we should also have confidence in this \ncountry's ability to react to a smallpox outbreak promptly. Ensuring \nthat first responders are ``armed'' with a vaccination and in a \nposition to respond is a responsible way to achieve this goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the conferees on this bill for \ntheir hard work. This is important legislation that provides Federal \nfunding for the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, and \nEducation, and related agencies.\n  I am pleased to see increased funding for many programs, especially \nin light of our Nation's war on terrorism. This includes an increase in \nfunding for bioterrorism activities and for strengthening our Nation's \npublic health infrastructure. This funding is critical for all our \nStates, localities, and our Nation as a whole to ensure that we are \nready to respond to all contingencies.\n  There is funding to ensure our Nation's food supply remains safe and \nresources for helping meet the health care needs of the uninsured. In \naddition to funding key public health programs, this bill provides \nfunds for helping States and local communities educate our children. \nFurthermore, it funds our scientists who are dedicated to finding \ntreatments, if not cures, for many illnesses, including Parkinson's, \nAlzheimer's, and ALS.\n  The legislation also ensures our Nation's most vulnerable, our \nchildren, senior citizens and the disabled, have access to quality \nhealth care.\n  Funds are also provided for important programs that assist working \nfamilies needing child care, adult daycare for elderly seniors, and \nMeals on Wheels.\n  For all the good in this bill, I ask: How many other worthy programs \nare being shortchanged because of our parochial appetites? Again, I \nfind myself in the unpleasant position of speaking about parochial \nprojects in yet another conference report. I have identified nearly $1 \nbillion in earmarks. The total amount in porkbarrel spending \nappropriations bills considered so far is $15 billion.\n  I would like to start out by asking unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord the Web site of the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            United States Senate Committee on Appropriations\n\n\n       authorizations and appropriations: what's the difference?\n\n       Authorization laws have two basic purposes. They establish, \n     continue, or modify federal programs, and they are a \n     prerequisite under House and Senate rules (and sometimes \n     under statute) for the Congress to appropriate budget \n     authority for programs.\n       Some authorization laws provide spending directly. In fact, \n     well over half of federal spending now goes to programs for \n     which the authorizing legislation itself creates budget \n     authority. Such spending is referred to as direct, or \n     mandatory, spending. It includes funding for most major \n     entitlement programs. (Some entitlements are funded in annual \n     appropriation acts, but the amounts provided are controlled \n     by the authorization law that established the entitlement.) \n     The authorization laws that provide direct spending are \n     typically permanent, but some major direct spending programs, \n     such as the Food Stamp program, require periodic renewal.\n       Discretionary spending, which is provided in the 13 \n     appropriation acts, now makes up only about one-third of all \n     federal expenditures. For discretionary spending, the role of \n     the authorizing committees is to enact legislation that \n     serves as the basis for operating a program and that provides \n     guidance to the Appropriations Committees as to an \n     appropriate level of funding for the program. That guidance \n     typically is expressed in terms of an authorization of \n     appropriations. Such authorizations are provided either as \n     specific dollar amounts (definite authorizations) or ``such \n     sums as are necessary'' (indefinite authorizations).\n       In addition, authorizations may be permanent and remain in \n     effect until changed by the Congress, or they may cover only \n     specific fiscal years. Authorizations that are limited in \n     duration may be annual (pertaining to one fiscal year) or \n     multiyear (pertaining to two, five, or any number of specific \n     fiscal years). When such an authorization expires, the \n     Congress may choose to extend the life of a program by \n     passing legislation commonly referred to as a \n     reauthorization. Unless the underlying law expressly \n     prohibits it, the Congress may also extend a program simply \n     by providing new appropriations. Appropriations made \n     available for a program after its authorization has expired \n     are called ``unauthorized appropriations.''\n\n[[Page S13787]]\n\n       Longstanding rules of the House allow a point of order to \n     be raised against an appropriation that is unauthorized. \n     During initial consideration of a bill in the House (which by \n     precedent originates appropriation bills), unauthorized \n     appropriations are sometimes dropped from the bill. However, \n     the House Committee on Rules typically grants waivers for \n     unauthorized appropriations that are contained in a \n     conference agreement. In the Senate, there is a more limited \n     prohibition against considering unauthorized appropriations.\n       Both House and Senate rules require that when the \n     Committees on Appropriations report a bill, they list in \n     their respective committee reports any programs funded in the \n     bill that lack an authorization. The information in the \n     committee reports, however, differs somewhat from the \n     information shown in this report. This report covers programs \n     that at one time had an explicit authorization that either \n     has expired or will expire. Unlike the lists shown in the \n     Appropriations Committee reports, this report does not \n     include programs for which the Congress has never provided \n     authorizations of appropriations. For example, some Treasury \n     Department programs have never received explicit \n     authorizations of appropriations. They receive appropriations \n     nonetheless because the authority to obligate and spend funds \n     is considered ``organic''--inherent in the underlying \n     legislation or executive action that originally empowered the \n     Treasury to perform particular functions.\n       As mentioned above, many laws establish programs with \n     authorizations of discretionary appropriations that do not \n     expire. Both the Appropriations Committee reports and this \n     CBO report exclude programs with that type of authorization \n     because its effect is permanent.''\n\n\n                        Where Does the Money Go?\n\n       While the size of the annual federal budget has increased \n     in dollar terms (reflecting inflation, increased population \n     and economy) over the years, the proportion available for \n     common government services has shrunk dramatically. \n     Competition among federal agencies for funding is heating up.\n       Over the last three decades, discretionary spending has \n     been cut significantly to accommodate rapid growths in other \n     expenses. Discretionary spending covers everything from road \n     building to police protection to medical research to our \n     national defense--most of the government services with which \n     Americans are familiar. All other spending is mandatory--\n     required by law regardless of what is left over for \n     discretionary spending. Mandatory spending includes \n     entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare, and the \n     enormous interest the U.S. must pay every year to finance the \n     national debt.\n       Three decades ago, nearly two-thirds of the federal budget \n     was available for discretionary programs: 1966--$9 billion, \n     interest; $43 billion, entitlement; $90 billion (63%), \n     discretionary.\n       In the 1970s, entitlement spending jumped, placing a crimp \n     on discretionary spending: 1976--$27 billion, interest; $189 \n     billion, entitlement; $475 billion, (45%), discretionary.\n       By the mid-1980's, interest payments on the national debt \n     began to rise: 1986--$136 billion, interest; $462 billion, \n     entitlement; $438 billion (42%), discretionary.\n       By 1996, entitlement spending took half of the budget pie. \n     In just 30 years, the amount left over for roads, police, \n     defense, and most other government services shrunk to a third \n     of the budget: 1966--$241 billion, interest; $859 billion, \n     entitlement; $535 billion (33%), discretionary.\n       Current budget projections show the same trend. By 2006, \n     entitlement spending will demand the majority of the federal \n     budget. Interest payments will continue to be a major drain \n     on the Treasury, and the remaining amount will be divided \n     among discretionary programs: 2006--$209 billion, interest; \n     $1,476 billion, entitlement; $6266 billion (27%), \n     discretionary.\n       Compare the forty-year difference side-by-side: 1966--$9 \n     billion, interest; $43 billion, entitlement; $90 billion \n     (63%), discretionary. 2006--$209 billion, interest; $1,476 \n     billion, entitlement; $626 billion (27%), discretionary.\n\n\nrule XVI--appropriations and amendments to general appropriations bills\n\n       1. On a point of order made by any Senator, no amendments \n     shall be received to any general appropriation bill the \n     effect of which will be to increase an appropriation already \n     contained in the bill, or to add a new item of appropriation, \n     unless it be made to carry out the provisions of some \n     existing law, or treaty stipulation, or act or resolution \n     previously passed by the Senate during that session; or \n     unless the same be moved by direction of the Committee on \n     Appropriations or of a committee of the Senate having \n     legislative jurisdiction of the subject matter, or proposed \n     in pursuance of an estimate submitted in accordance with law.\n       2. The Committee on Appropriations shall not report an \n     appropriation bill containing amendments to such bill \n     proposing new or general legislation or any restriction on \n     the expenditure of the funds appropriated which proposes a \n     limitation not authorized by law if such restriction is to \n     take effect or cease to be effective upon the happening of a \n     contingency, and if an appropriation bill is reported to the \n     Senate containing amendments to such bill proposing new or \n     general legislation or any such restriction, a point of order \n     may be made against the bill, and if the point is sustained, \n     the bill shall be recommitted to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n       3. All amendments to general appropriation bills moved by \n     direction of a committee having legislative jurisdiction of \n     the subject matter proposing to increase an appropriation \n     already contained in the bill, or to add new items of \n     appropriation, shall, at least one day before they are \n     considered, be referred to the Committee on Appropriations, \n     and when actually proposed to the bill no amendment proposing \n     to increase the amount stated in such amendment shall be \n     received on a point of order made by any Senator.\n       4. On a point of order made by any Senator, no amendment \n     offered by any other Senator which proposes general \n     legislation shall be received to any general appropriation \n     bill, nor shall any amendment not germane or relevant to the \n     subject matter contained in the bill be received; nor shall \n     any amendment to any item or clause of such bill be received \n     which does not directly relate thereto; nor shall any \n     restriction on the expenditure of the funds appropriated \n     which proposes a limitation not authorized by law be received \n     if such restriction is to take effect or cease to be \n     effective upon the happening of a contingency; and all \n     questions of relevancy of amendments under this rule, when \n     raised, shall be submitted to the Senate and be decided \n     without debate; and any such amendment or restriction to a \n     general appropriation bill may be laid on the table without \n     prejudice to the bill.\n       5. On a point of order made by any Senator, no amendment, \n     the object of which is to provide for a private claim, shall \n     be received to any general appropriation bill, unless it be \n     to carry out the provisions of an existing law or a treaty \n     stipulation, which shall be cited on the face of the \n     amendment.\n       6. When a point of order is made against any restriction on \n     the expenditure of funds appropriated in general \n     appropriation bill on the ground that the restriction \n     violates this rule, the rule shall be construed strictly and, \n     in case of doubt, in favor of the point of order.\n       7. Every report on general appropriation bills filed by the \n     Committee on Appropriations shall identify with particularity \n     each recommended amendment which proposes an item of \n     appropriation which is not made to carry out the provisions \n     of an existing law, a treaty stipulation, or an act or \n     resolution previously passed by the Senate during that \n     session.\n       8. On a point of order made by any Senator, no general \n     appropriation bill or amendment thereto shall be received or \n     considered if it contains a provision reappropriating \n     unexpended balances of appropriations; except that this \n     provision shall not apply to appropriations in continuation \n     of appropriations for public works on which work has \n     commenced.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will quote from it. It says:\n\n       Authorization laws have two basic purposes. They establish, \n     continue, or modify federal programs, and they are a \n     prerequisite----\n\n  I emphasize, ``a prerequisite''----\n\n       under House and Senate rules . . . for the Congress to \n     appropriate budget authority for programs.\n\n  I found that entertaining and amusing because we have this list of \nhundreds of projects which are not authorized and are funded at \nwhatever level the appropriators see fit.\n  I will go through a number of them. Some of them are entertaining; \nsome of them make you sad. I would like to pose a question to the \nmanager of the bill, if I could have his attention. I see that there is \n$1 million for the Shakespeare Rose Theater to enhance educational and \ncultural programs and language literacy in the arts for students and \nthe general public.\n  Could the manager of the bill tell me where the Shakespeare Rose \nTheater is located?\n  I admit there are hundreds here. I can understand why the manager of \nthe bill wouldn't know why it is a paltry $1 million, but could the \nmanager of the bill tell me where the Shakespeare Rose Theater is \nlocated?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Might I inquire of the Senator, what committee does the \nSenator----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I only have 10 minutes. Can you tell me where the theater \nis located? That is a pretty straightforward question. It deserves a \nstraightforward answer.\n  Mr. HARKIN. You know, Madam President, I would just say to the \nSenator, he asked me a question----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I withdraw the question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. You asked me a question. Now he won't let me answer it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I asked for an answer. I didn't get an answer.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The answer is there are 1,600 different items in this \nbill. If the Senator has about 60 seconds of patience, I will find out \nfor him.\n\n[[Page S13788]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank you, but it is an example. The manager of the \nbill doesn't even know where a place that we are giving $1 million of \nthe taxpayers' dollars is located.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is in Massachusetts.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is instructive. That is instructive about the \nproliferation of the pork in this legislation.\n  Let me cite a few others: $500,000 for the Mattatuck Museum in \nWaterbury, CT; $800,000 for the Mind-Body Institute of Boston, MA--the \nMind-Body Institute of Boston, MA?--$150,000 for the Lady B Ranch Apple \nValley, CA, for the Therapeutic Horseback Riding Program.\n  I want to go back to what the Senator said, that there are 1,600 \nearmarks. So the manager of the bill doesn't even know where $1 million \ngoes. Maybe $1 million isn't much to the manager of the bill, but it \nsure as heck is a great deal of money to my constituents. I won't \npursue this.\n  Again, $150,000 for the Lady B Ranch Apple Valley, CA, for the \nTherapeutic Horseback Riding Program. If you asked the average citizen \nif a therapeutic horseback riding program was at the top of their \npriority list, I don't think so. But therapeutic horseback riding has \nto be earmarked for Apple Valley, CA.\n  Continuing, $500,000 for the University of Washington Center for \nHealth Workforce Studies in Seattle, WA. By the way, there is $800,000 \nfor the Seattle King County Workforce Development Council, Seattle, WA, \nfor the purpose of retraining displaced Boeing employees. Now in the \nDefense appropriations bill, which is coming up very shortly, we will \nhave a $26 billion bailout for Boeing. Yet we still need $800,000 to \nretrain their workers. That is a good deal for Boeing.\n  The list continues:\n  $750,000 for the Center for Textile Training and Apparel Technology \nat Central Alabama Community College;\n  $200,000 for the University of Arkansas Medical Services BioVentures \nIncubator for equipment needed for wetlabs used in training;\n  $800,000 for Bishops Museum. I dare not ask the manager where Bishops \nMuseum is, but I can find out for myself.\n  Continuing with the list: $200,000 for the Mississippi State \nUniversity, Center for Advanced Vehicular Systems, Mississippi State, \nMS, for automotive engineering training.\n  The list goes on and on and on. Here is something that is really \nentertaining, or saddening, depending on whether or not you are a \ntaxpayer. For example, it earmarks $5 million, $5 million for a program \nnever authorized--never a hearing through the Commerce Committee--$5 \nmillion for a program to promote educational, cultural apprenticeships, \nand exchange programs for Alaska Natives, native Hawaiians, and their \nhistorical whaling and trading partners in Massachusetts. That is \nremarkable, remarkable--$5 million. This is a new program authorized by \nthe Senate-passed version of the ESEA authorization bill. It was not \nrequested by the administration.\n  It is interesting to note that even though the United States does not \nengage or support commercial whaling--we are against commercial \nwhaling--we are willing to provide $5 million for a program \nhighlighting the practice.\n  Another issue of concern is the report's inclusion of $25 million for \nequipment and facilities to assist public broadcasters with the \ntransition to digital television. I would remind my colleagues that \nthis request was never the subject of a hearing by the Commerce \nCommittee, which is the authorizing committee. I don't believe that \nCongress is exercising sound fiscal policy when it decides to \nappropriate millions of dollars to publicly funded television stations \nso that they may purchase the latest in digital technology.\n  Rather, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting should have come \nbefore the Commerce Committee to discuss with us the best way to \nachieve the goals of public broadcasters and ensure that taxpayer \ndollars are spent wisely.\n  So as the manager said, there are 1,600 earmarks in this bill, very \nfew of them, if any, previously authorized; all of them are in \nviolation of the Web site the Appropriations Committee has. The \noverwhelming majority of these earmarks are for members of the \nAppropriations Committee, so that those States that are not represented \non the Appropriations Committee are shortchanged. There is no \ncompetition. There is no authorization. There is no hearing. We are \ntalking about a billion dollars here. It is remarkable.\n  The rules of the Senate have to be changed. The rules of the Senate \nhave to be changed so that those of us who don't support these programs \nwill have an opportunity to have our States' priorities considered as \nwell.\n  I have something that my staff put in front of me regarding the Rose. \nApparently, it is in London, England. It was built in 1587 by Philip \nHenslowe. The Rose was the first theater on London's Bankside. Its \nrepertory included plays by Kyd, Jonson, Shakespeare, and Marlowe. In \n1989 its remains were discovered and partially excavated amidst a blaze \nof international press coverage.\n  Are we now giving a million dollars to a theater in London, England? \nRemarkable. Put in without any hearing, without any authorization, \nwithout anything? We are going to give a million dollars for that? Are \nthe British so bad off that they need a million dollars from us for a \ntheater in London?\n  We have homeless people wandering the cities of America and we are \ngoing to give a million dollars to the Rose Theater? Remarkable. \nRemarkable.\n  Madam President, it is outrageous, disgraceful, and it is an \nabrogation of the process of legislation. Again, I will continue to \noppose this and try to bring this to the attention of the American \npeople.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the Senator from Arizona never mentioned \nthe projects in Arizona in the amount of $6.7 million. Let me read a \ncouple: University of Arizona for a border health initiative. There is \none for Pima Community College in Arizona for minority students to \nattend college. There is the Pima County Department of Health and the \nUniversity of Arizona. Here is one for Herd Museum in Phoenix to \ndevelop exhibits and educational programs about the historic Phoenix \nIndian School and the Native Americans who attended the school.\n  Does the Senator want us to knock all those out?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Absolutely. I have opposed every earmarked project for my \nState, and I have done so for all the years I have been here. I am \nsorry the Senator from Iowa doesn't know that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator knows full well that the other Senator from \nArizona supports those.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The other Senator does not support those. It came from \nthe House.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So does the Congressman.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It came from the House. He doesn't even know where the \ntheater is in London.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Congressman also supports them. I want to mention a \ncouple of other projects. The Senator mentioned the Bishop Museum \nlocated in Hawaii. The other one mentioned was in Massachusetts. The \nSenator made fun of a horseback riding project that he kind of mocked. \nI don't know that program intimately, but I remember when it was \nbrought up. This is a program in California for therapy for severely \nmentally retarded and brain-injured kids. It is a program where they \nhave found that by using this kind of therapy, it allows these kids to \nhave a little bit better life. I am not a medical expert. I don't know \nhow this works. But according to the Member of Congress who brought \nthis up, this is something the health care professionals believe is \nvery important to these disabled kids.\n\n  I am told that the Senator from Arizona may be slightly mistaken, \nthat the Senator from Arizona did ask for some of these projects. The \nPima County Department of Health in Arizona, a $400,000 grant was asked \nfor by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain--I am sorry, Mr. Kyl. It \nwas asked for by the other Senator from Arizona. Certainly, the other \nSenator from Arizona --I can't speak for him--would not say just this \nis mine and nobody else's. So I say that there are four projects in \nArizona asked for by Senator Kyl from Arizona. I want the record to \nshow that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have any time remaining.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n[[Page S13789]]\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I believe I have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield a minute to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Iowa knows that Senators speak for \nthemselves. My record is clear over many years. I have never supported \nearmarks, not because of its virtue or vices, but because it didn't go \nthrough an authorizing procedure. The Pima County College project may \nbe good and beneficial, and the therapeutic horseback riding project \nmight be good and beneficial. I happen to be ranking member of the \nCommerce Committee. Those are under the oversight of our Committee and \nthey should be authorized. It is disgraceful the way these are put in.\n  The Senator from Kansas will soon bring out an example of a problem \nof legislating on appropriations. There is a major issue in his State \nconcerning Indian gaming on which there has never been a hearing, never \nconsideration. It was stuck into an appropriations bill, and it has \nprofound effects on the State of Kansas. He is here, and rightfully \nupset, to say the least, about the fact that he, as a Senator from \nKansas, never had any input into it and it was stuck into an \nappropriations bill.\n  I tell the Senator from Kansas that I will do everything I can to \nhelp him in the authorizing process to see that the process is carried \nout in a legitimate fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n\n                             Indian Gaming\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I want to draw attention to something \nthat happened in my State that I think is completely wrong in the \nappropriations process. The Senator from Nevada is aware of this and \nstated yesterday his support to help me out with this problem. I hope I \ncan get the attention, as well, of the Senator from Iowa. This is what \nhappens in the worst situations in the appropriating committees. It is \nnot about money or an appropriation for a particular line item. In a \nconference committee, a half sentence was written in the report that \noverturned a Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals decision about Indian \ngaming in Kansas. It affects the Huron Cemetery in Kansas City, KS.\n  You can look at this picture. This is not a casino site. This is a \ncemetery site, Huron Indian Cemetery. It has been there several hundred \nyears. It is on the banks of the Kansas River. It is a beautiful site, \nmaintained well. What took place was this. We have four recognized \nIndian tribes in Kansas, and all four have casinos. A fifth tribe from \noutside the State, the Wyandotte tribe of Oklahoma, bought adjacent \nland and said: We want to make it into a reservation and casino, even \nthough our tribe is in Oklahoma. We want to do this in Kansas City \nbecause this looks lucrative to us.\n  So they said, first, they wanted to put it right on top of this site. \nThen the courts and local opinion said no. Then they wanted to build \nthe casino on stilts on the site. They said no to that, also. So they \nbought an adjacent building. That was blocked. That was blocked in the \ncourts. The State of Kansas fought it.\n  The four recognized tribes of Kansas fought against it. I fought \nagainst it. The other Senator from Kansas fought against that. It has \nbeen stopped. The people of Kansas City don't want this taking place \nthere.\n  OK. So then the tribe from Oklahoma litigates it in court. They are \ndefeated at the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. They can't do this \ncasino in Kansas, according to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. The \nGovernor doesn't want it, we Senators don't want it, and the tribes \ndon't want it. Then they go into a conference committee--Department of \nInterior--and in the conference, at the last minute, a half-sentence, \nhandwritten note was put in that overturns the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Now they are going to be able to go forward and build a casino \nnext to this beautiful cemetery.\n  This is a sacred site to a number of Native Americans in the United \nStates. But because in a conference committee they got a half sentence \nin, written in pencil, it will overturn all of this work by all of \nthese people. Is that right? Is that fair to take place? Is that the \nway the system is supposed to work? I don't think that is what is \nsupposed to take place.\n  So we came back in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill and on the floor \nwe worked with the managers and said: Look, this isn't right. Let's \ncorrect this in this appropriations bill.\n  The managers in the Senate, to their great credit--and I thank the \nSenator from Iowa--said: You are right; we will correct it in the \nLabor-HHS bill. Then it got stripped out of the bill because the House \nwould not recede. We were trying to correct what took place in the dark \nof night through this conference committee report on Labor-HHS, and we \nwere not able to get it done.\n  Now we are left with the possibility of a casino being built next to \na cemetery by an out-of-State tribe that the tribes in Kansas, the \nGovernor of Kansas, and the Senators from Kansas do not want, and it \ntook place in the Appropriations Committee process.\n  We need a rule change so it does not happen again. I am here today to \ntell my colleagues that I am going to be working on this next year to \nget this overturned, to get this clarified. There were no hearings on \nthis issue--none--in either the House or the Senate. It was stuck in at \nthe last minute. It should not have taken place, yet it did, and now it \nis the law of the land, in spite of what all the people involved in \nthis think about it.\n  This is clearly not appropriate. I hope we can put a rule in place to \nraise a point of order, requiring a 60-vote supermajority, against \nsituations such as this happening to the Huron Indian Cemetery in \nKansas City, KS. This just is not right. I am going to raise this issue \nnext year. I hope my colleagues, and those on the Appropriations \nCommittee, will work with us to correct such an injustice.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has no time remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time does Senator Specter have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-nine minutes.\n  If no one yields time, time is charged equally to both parties.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: If a quorum call \nis instituted, does that time run against both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, it will run against \nall sides.\n  Mr. HARKIN. In that case, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes to \nspeak on the underlying bill and another unrelated subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Against whose time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Whatever time is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I realize there is time remaining and I \nthank the Senators for yielding. I have spoken many times on this \nissue, but I want to take another minute to speak about the underlying \nappropriations bill, particularly the educational aspects and \ncomponents of this legislation. There were a few things I didn't get to \nsay that I would like to add for the Record.\n  I thank the chair of the subcommittee, the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nHarkin, for his extraordinary work in this area for helping bring \nforward an appropriations bill that reflects the positive changes of \nthe authorization bill, to have the appropriations reflect those new \nstrategies for improving our schools and strengthening our move for \nreform, for strengthening the notion that every child can learn, that \nwe can really have excellence in every school, that we are not happy \nwith the status quo, that we recognize some schools\n\n[[Page S13790]]\n\nare terrific, some teachers are wonderful, but the system itself is not \nas invigorated and as strong as it should be, and it can be improved.\n  That is what this legislation says: No to the status quo and yes to \nchange; no to process and yes to progress; no to ``incomes'' and yes to \noutcomes; and yes to results.\n  In this holiday season it is a wonderful gift to ourselves, to our \nNation, to change the way we are appropriating funding for public \nschools and for all schools in this Nation.\n  Today marks a historic moment. For the first time in 35 years since \nthe Federal Government says we will work in partnership with States to \nhelp educate our children, it needs to be a local responsibility, but \nit must be a national priority. Our Nation cannot be strong, it cannot \nbe great, it cannot be economically as vital if we don't have good \nschools. In Florida and Louisiana, that does not begin in kindergarten \nor end with a college degree; that is prekindergarten, early childhood \neducation, and lifelong learning.\n  It is clearly in our Nation's interest to help States and local \ncommunities educate and bring schools to our citizens. The best place \nto begin doing that is in the home. The second best place to shore that \nup is in schools, starting at the lower grades and working up. As a \nmother with young children, I know directly and very personally that \nthose first few years, the foundation, are important.\n  This bill is historic because in that whole partnership, for the \nfirst time, we have actually funded something we talk about. We \ntargeted the grants for title I. We have funded the effort to help get \nthe money to the districts that need a helping hand, that have \ndifficulty raising either sales tax or property tax or industrial tax \nand corporate tax because the tax base is not there, but the children \nare. The tax base might not be there, but there are smart children who \nlive in that county. The tax base is not there, but their parents are \nworking hard.\n  This bill, for the first time, sends the new money through the \ntargeting formulas to bring that help to poor and disadvantaged \nchildren so they can take the new tests, pass them, and meet the new \nstandards of accountability.\n  It is an extraordinary accomplishment. I thank the Senator from \nVermont. I know he cast his vote--it was a difficult vote to cast--\nagainst the authorization bill because we failed to fully fund special \neducation. I am disappointed in that. I will work with him and pledge \nto work with Democrats and Republicans to pick up more of our \nfair share of those special education dollars. I will work to reform \nspecial education, to make sure it works for our students, our \nfamilies, our children who are greatly challenged, mentally and \nphysically, as well as our teachers.\n\n  Without Senator Jeffords, the Senator from Vermont, his untiring \ncommitment and focus to education, we never would have had $3 billion \nadded to the Education bill. It would have been left on the table and \nthere would not be the energy to get it. I know he is disappointed, but \nI hope he hears my words this morning and is encouraged.\n  There are those in the Chamber who recognize without his complete \ncommitment and dedication to the schoolchildren of this Nation, this \nbill would be short a lot of money. But because he put his political \nmuscle behind it and did what he needed to do, we have seen a \ntremendous increase in these investments. He should be happy and \ngrateful. I know he is disappointed in special education, but I commit \nto him I will work diligently to see if we cannot shore up that part of \nthe bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the list of the \nmoneys the States will receive, additional funds. Every State and \ncounty will be helped, but we will get resources to those families and \ncommunities that need a helping hand. It is a historic moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did I lose time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was a quorum call in progress that was \nevenly divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, let me take a few \nminutes. First, I rise with a sense of great sadness and yet a feeling \nof great hope. You really can have both votes in yourself at the same \ntime. Two nights ago Mental Health Equitable Treatment of 2001 was \ndropped from the Labor-HHS appropriations conference report. The Senate \npassed a wonderful bill. We sent it to the House as part of Labor \nappropriations, even though it was a major, major authorizing bill. We \nhad our hopes high because in the Senate the support was high. The time \nhad come to make sure, 2 years from now in the United States, most \ninsurance policies would cover the mentally ill. That meant to this \nSenator in 8 or 10 years we would be able to look back and see a very \ndifferent America when it came to street people, people who during cold \nwinter months we see on the grates of our cities with the blankets \nwrapped around them.\n  In our jails and prisons, we know that now and for the ensuing months \nthose who have mental illnesses such as distress that comes from \ndepression, manic depression, schizophrenia, and a whole host of \nserious mental diseases, are more apt to be found in the county jail or \nthe State jail than they are in treatment centers, be they treatment \ncenters to which you take your sick person, and they are run privately \nor publicly. More mentally ill people, men and women, are in jails and \nfacilities not intended for them than there are in facilities intended \nfor them.\n\n  We in the Senate, with the leadership and help of my friend, Senator \nWellstone, have a bill. We call it the Domenici-Wellstone bill. It is \nmoving right along. It cleared the Senate, sending a powerful signal to \nthose in America by the millions who are sick with these diseases, \ntheir relatives, and their friends. They had an extremely high hope \nthat ran through their bodies and in many cases gave them a superb ray \nof hope that maybe, in the future in the greatest land on Earth, we \nwould have insurance--subject to some limitations and some exclusions, \nbut across this land the large businesses would be offering insurance \ncoverage for those who were mentally ill who worked for them; that we \nwould begin to see the same thing happen there that has happened to \npeople with heart conditions. We would have doctors taking care of \nthem. We would have research taking place. We would have centers and \nfacilities for research and for care growing up across this land, \npublic or private. We know that would be happening. Sure enough, we \ncould cast our eyes, cast our vision not too far ahead of us, and say \nwe are doing the right thing, serious mental illness is going to \nreceive treatment.\n  I ask consent I have 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Insurance companies will be putting forth the kind of \ncoverage necessary. What a day this will be. What a time that will be. \nWhat joy will come to those of us who have worked so hard. But more \nimportantly, what joy will come to the millions of parents who will now \nsee their children, when they probably have the first signs of these \ndread diseases, and these parents are going to be able to say we are \nnot going to go broke trying to take care of an uninsured child with \none of these dread diseases. What a marvelous, wonderful thing America \nwill have done.\n  What do we hear? Over on the side, a dull but powerful beat of the \ninsurance companies that are saying: This hasn't been covered before. \nLet's not cover it now. We hear a large undercurrent saying: We have \nnever done this before. We should not start now. It is going to cost \ntoo much.\n  To them let me say: We hope you will join us when this bill clears \nboth Houses, and when at that point you have to start writing insurance \nfor people who are sick with schizophrenia, manic depression, those \nkinds of diseases--and there are many other diseases that will be \ncovered. Research will start to take place because these kinds of sick \npeople are carrying on their backs a package of assets, assets that are \nthe payments that will be forthcoming from the sick person running to \nthe doctor, to the clinic, to the research facilities. What a change \nand how America will have grown up when that occurs.\n  There are a lot of workers in this vineyard. There are thousands upon \nthousands of Americans who are busy in this field, in their home \ncities, in\n\n[[Page S13791]]\n\ntheir States. Many came to town this past week to show up at the \nconference meeting where the House and Senate met on this Labor, Health \nand Human Services appropriations bill. Why did they show up? They \nshowed up because the Senate had attached to that bill a thorough \ncovering of these diseases.\n  We knew it was a chance because the House would rather have this \nconsidered by another committee, not an appropriations committee. We \ngot our chance to speak a few words. What words were spoken. Clearly, \nthe message did not stay in this little cubicle, Senator Wellstone. The \nmessage went out from that room. The message went out that it is the \ntime, it is the place, and it is ready.\n  As a matter of fact, I believe the members there present would have, \nby overwhelming numbers, voted to take this bill and put it on this \nappropriations bill and send it to the President for his signature. We \nmade some good things happen. The President of the United States has \nissued a letter saying next year will be the time. We will hold him to \nit. He is saying he would like to do that. We know he had a \ndistinguished friend who had depression and committed suicide, and he \ndoesn't have any trouble with the idea of this being a disease, severe \ndepression. It must be treated. Severe depression must have coverage \njust as the other dread diseases.\n  I have here lately been comparing these dread diseases of the mind \nwith the diseases of the heart. Clearly, we covered heart even though \nit is part spiritual, part physical. We do not say ``we don't cover \nthat because it is very difficult to diagnose and do research on.'' \nThank God we got it together and worked on it.\n  So I understand my time is about to run out. I thank the Chair.\n  I just want to say I am happy again. The tenor and the tone--those \nwho were saying we are going do it were really a different group of \npeople. They are going to have hearings. Where they have not had a \nsingle hearing in the House of Representatives on the issue of parity \nof coverage for American people, we have had numerous hearings here. \nThey have had none. They pledge it. Once they have it, once their \nMembers hear, once their Members are importuned by these citizens to do \nthis, it will move.\n  So I say thanks to Senator Wellstone for all the support and help, \nand to all those in the Senate--there are many, over 65 on the bill. \nThe pressure from that, the ambience from that, was strong. We will, \nindeed, next year, be moving ahead with a big strong wave, and it will \nhappen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: How much time \nremains on the conference report?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining is 20 minutes to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I inquire, if there is a quorum call, then the \ntime runs on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will all be charged to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reid). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator from \nPennsylvania would give me 2 minutes of his time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am delighted to yield 2 minutes to the \nSenator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                          Terrorism Insurance\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we are coming down to the \ncrunch time with the conclusion of this session. One of the issues to \nbe decided this afternoon is whether or not we are going to have any \nprotection on terrorism insurance--not only for large and small \nbusinesses but also for homes and cars, and for personal lives.\n  Since there are so many agendas going on with this topic, I urge, \nsince this is the very last gasp, the Senate to come to an agreement \nfor a fallback and a short period of time--say 6 months--and adopt \nlegislation that would have the Federal Government assume the terrorism \nrisk for that short period of time with a freeze on rates so the \nconsumer is not paying the high rates now being jacked up; and a \nmoratorium on the cancellations so the consumers, businesses, and \nindividual home and car owners would have protection against a \nterrorist risk of loss.\n  We can do that. That is a fallback position. The alternative is to do \nnothing. That is unconscionable.\n  Rates are being jacked as we speak, and cancellations of terrorist \ncoverage is now occurring in the 50 States.\n  I thank the President for letting me bring this to the attention of \nthe Senate. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for yielding the \ntime.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 13 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Is someone yielding time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 2 minutes of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think we need to take the opportunity to \ndo terrorism insurance. I don't think at this late date, having put \ntogether two different compromises, that we could start from scratch on \na program which nobody fully understands. We are going to have a chance \nthis afternoon to do it. We have a compromise that has been worked out \nby Senator Dodd, Senator Daschle, Senator Sarbanes, and members of the \nBanking and Commerce Committees. I think we need to take it.\n\n\n                          The Stimulus Package\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I hope we get an opportunity to vote on the \nstimulus package. I liken our situation to a situation we would face if \nin the cold of winter a storm came along and blew the roof off of an \napartment house. It is clear unless something is not done that people \nwould get pneumonia, frostbite, and suffer from exposure.\n  We have one group of Congressmen and Senators rushing in to say that \nwe have to hire doctors. We have to buy penicillin. We need blankets.\n  We have another group that says: Why don't we rebuild the roof? Then \nit is suggested that rich people live on the upper floors and they \nwould benefit more by putting the roof back on.\n  Then the President proposes the classic political compromise, which \nis: Why don't you rebuild some of the roof and buy some of the \npenicillin?\n  I hope we can go that route. At least we would benefit people. I hope \nwe get a chance to vote on that package today.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senator for this and for many other \nthings.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are about at the end of the time in \nthis session. I just want to make a comment or two about the subject \nmatter of the Domenici-Wellstone amendment to try to bring parity to \nmental health. I regret very much that the Appropriations Committee did \nnot act on it.\n  That amendment passed the Senate floor. And it had support from some \nin the House, really divided along party lines. There are some \nassurances from the President and at least one of the\n\n[[Page S13792]]\n\nauthorizing committees in the House that there will be action to bring \nparity.\n  Mental illness is as much an illness as is physical illness, and that \nought to be corrected. In the conference, I made the point that it was \nmy hope that if action was not taken by the authorizers that the \nappropriators would proceed, again, next year at this time and act in \nour conference.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 8 minutes remaining for the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed for the remainder of that time--the 8 minutes--as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n        Reports On The Cases Of Dr. Wen Ho Lee And Dr. Peter Lee\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before the first session of the 107th \nCongress ends, I want to put on the Record reports on the cases of Dr. \nWen Ho Lee and Dr. Peter Lee, which were subject to oversight by the \nJudiciary Committee on the Department of Justice during the 106th \nCongress. The Subcommittee's work was controversial, partly because it \nincluded oversight of Attorney General Reno's handling of the \ninvestigations into campaign finance matters on President Clinton and \nVice President Gore.\n  Without going into all the details, suffice it to say that bipartisan \nagreement could not be reached within the Subcommittee on a report or \nin the full Committee on issuance of subpoenas to obtain necessary \ntestimony.\n  When a subpoena was sought for FBI Director Louis Freeh, the \nopposition of Senator Hatch, the Chairman of the Committee, proved \ndecisive. In April 2000, the Subcommittee obtained a memorandum from \nDirector Freeh dated December 1996 which recited a conversation between \na ranking FBI official and a ranking Department of Justice official to \nthe effect that the investigation of the Department of Justice would \neffect the Attorney General's tenure at a time before President Clinton \nhad reappointed her. The Freeh memo further referenced a conversation \nbetween Attorney General Reno and Director Freeh. The Subcommittee's \ninability to subpoena and question Freeh was a significant hindrance to \npursuing that important matter.\n  That memorandum and other files have been inaccessible since October \nwith the closing of the Hart Building due to the anthrax mail. The \nterrorist attack of September 11 has further hindered the finishing of \nthe Subcommittee's work because the FBI has, understandably, been \noccupied with investigating terrorists, which preempted other pending \nmatters.\n\n  The Subcommittee's oversight was thwarted repeatedly by delays by the \nFBI and the intransigence of the Department of Energy. Once Wen Ho Lee \nwas indicted, the FBI refused to provide additional information, \nclaiming it would hamper the prosecution. Even after Dr. Wen Ho Lee \nentered a guilty plea and the prosecution was concluded, the FBI \ncontinued to refuse to provide information on the ground that it would \nimpede their debriefing of Dr. Lee in obtaining the tapes which he \ntook.\n  Congressional oversight is traditionally a difficult matter because \nthe House and the Senate are so busy with legislative matters and it is \nlike pulling teeth, at best, to get cooperation from the Executive \nbranch. The Subcommittee's oversight efforts on Dr. Wen Ho Lee have \nbeen even tougher. In addition to the general difficulties, the \nSubcommittee's oversight efforts have been further complicated by the \nchange in party control in May 2001, the terrorist attack on September \n11 of this year, and the departure of the Subcommittee's key \ninvestigator Mr. Dobie McArthur. Mr. McArthur did an extraordinary job, \nvirtually singlehandedly conducting the oversight investigations and \nwriting the reports.\n  With the new FBI Director Robert S. Mueller, III focusing on \nreorganization of the Bureau and the additional responsibilities of the \nFBI occasioned by the September 11 terrorist attack, and the shift of \nthe Department of Justice in the focus of FBI activities, it is very \ndifficult to pursue further the Subcommittee's inquiry on Dr. Wen Ho \nLee, but it is my hope that at some date that might be done. Because of \nthe serious dereliction of the FBI's handling of the Dr. Wen Ho Lee \ninvestigation, it will never be known beyond a reasonable doubt whether \nDr. Wen Ho Lee was a spy, although there is substantial evidence to \nthat effect in the McArthur reports. The publication of the reports on \nDr. Wen Ho Lee and Dr. Peter Lee will enable readers to evaluate the \nseriousness of espionage in damaging our national security interests, \nthe failure of the Executive branch in dealing with those \ninvestigations, the need for changes in procedures by the Department of \nJustice, including the FBI, and the Department of Energy. Some \nlegislation, as noted in the McArthur reports, has already been enacted \nas a result of the Subcommittee's oversight and further legislative \nreforms are needed. Publication of these reports will promote those \nobjectives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the two-page \nFreeh memorandum of December 1996 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 9, 1996.\n     To: Mr. Esposito,\n     From: Director,\n     Subject: Democratic National Campaign Matter\n       As I related to you this morning, I met with the Attorney \n     General on Friday, 12/6/96, to discuss the above-captioned \n     matter.\n       I stated that DOJ had not yet referred the matter to the \n     FBI to conduct a full, criminal investigation. It was my \n     recommendation that this referral take place as soon as \n     possible.\n       I also told the Attorney General that since she had \n     declined to refer the matter to an Independent Counsel it was \n     my recommendation that she select a first rate DOJ legal team \n     from outside Main Justice to conduct that inquiry. In fact, I \n     said that these prosecutors should be ``junk-yard dogs'' and \n     that in my view, PIS was not capable of conducting the \n     thorough, aggressive kind of investigation which was \n     required.\n       I also advised the Attorney General of Lee Radek's comment \n     to you that there was a lot of ``pressure'' on him and PIS \n     regarding this case because the ``Attorney General's job \n     might hang in the balance'' (or words to that effect). I \n     stated that those comments would be enough for me to take him \n     and the Criminal Division off the case completely.\n       I also stated that it didn't make sense for PIS to call the \n     FBI the ``lead agency'' in this matter while operating a \n     ``task force'' with DOC IGs who were conducting interviews of \n     key witnesses without the knowledge or participation of the \n     FBI.\n       I strongly recommended that the FBI and hand-picked DOJ \n     attorneys from outside Main Justice run this case as we would \n     any matter of such importance and complexity.\n       We left the conversation on Friday with arrangements to \n     discuss the matter again on Monday. The Attorney General and \n     I spoke today and she asked for a meeting to discuss the \n     ``investigative team'' and hear our recommendations. The \n     meeting is now scheduled for Wednesday, 12/11/96, which you \n     and Bob Litt will also attend.\n       I intend to repeat my recommendations from Friday's \n     meeting. We should present all of our recommendations for \n     setting up the investigation--both AUSAs and other resources. \n     You and I should also discuss and consider whether on the \n     basis of all the facts and circumstances--including Huang's \n     recently released letters to the President as well as Radek's \n     comments--whether I should recommend that the Attorney \n     General reconsider referral to an Independent Counsel.\n       It was unfortunate that DOJ declined to allow the FBI to \n     play any role in the Independent Counsel referral \n     deliberations. I agree with you that based on the DOJ's \n     experience with the Cisneros matter--which was only referred \n     to an Independent Counsel because the FBI and I intervened \n     directly with the Attorny General--it was decided to exclude \n     us from this decision-making process.\n       Nevertheless, based on information recently reviewed from \n     PIS/DOC, we should determine whether or not an Independent \n     Counsel referral should be made at this time. If so, I will \n     make the recommendation to the Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am now going to commence with the \nreading of the report on Dr. Wen Ho Lee: My understanding, after \nconsulting with the authorities, is that once I begin the reading of \nthe report, the remainder may be incorporated in the Record as if read \nin full.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And the Senator is advised he has 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes left.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. I shall not use the full 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n\n       This report augments and completes the interim report \n     released on March 8, 2000, regarding the Government's \n     investigation of espionage allegations against Dr. Wen Ho \n     Lee who pleaded guilty on September 13, 2000 to one felony \n     count of unlawful retention of national defense \n     information.\\1\\ The special Judiciary subcommittee on \n     Department of\n\n[[Page S13793]]\n\n     Justice Oversight, which I chaired in the last Congress, \n     began oversight on the Wen Ho Lee case and several other \n     matters in September 1999, but suspended its review of \n     this case at the request of FBI Director Louis Freeh after \n     Dr. Lee was indicted and jailed on December 10, 1999.\n       I issued the interim report in March 2000 to demonstrate \n     the need for reforms contained in the Counterintelligence \n     Reform Act of 2000, which became law as Title VI of Public \n     Law 106-567 on December 27, 2000. That bipartisan bill, which \n     passed the Senate Judiciary and Select Intelligence \n     committees without a single vote in opposition despite \n     sometimes strong disagreements about certain aspects of the \n     Wen Ho Lee case, corrected many of the flaws in the \n     government's procedures for handling espionage investigations \n     and prosecutions. This report, consisting of an executive \n     summary accompanied by a detailed review of the case, \n     completes the oversight record on the Wen Ho Lee matter.\n\n\n                        Highlights of the Report\n\n       The government's investigation of Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory (LANL) nuclear weapons scientist Dr. Wen Ho Lee \n     was so inept that despite scrutiny spanning nearly two \n     decades, both the FBI and the Department of Energy missed \n     repeated opportunities to discover and stop his illegal \n     computer activities. As a consequence of these numerous \n     failures, magnetic computer tapes containing some of the \n     nation's most sensitive nuclear secrets are now missing when \n     they could have been recovered as late as December 1998 and \n     possibly even later.\n       One great tragedy of the Wen Ho Lee case is that the entire \n     truth will likely never be known. As a consequence of an \n     inept investigation, the government has lost the credibility \n     to claim that its version of events is the absolute truth. \n     Dr. Lee also lacks the credibility to tell the definitive \n     tale of this case: he repeatedly lied to investigators, \n     created his own personal nuclear weapons design library \n     without proper authority, copied nuclear secrets to an \n     unclassified computer system accessible from the Internet, \n     and passed up several opportunities to turn his tape \n     collection over to the government. If the information Dr. Lee \n     put at risk did not fall into the wrong hands, it is a matter \n     of mere luck. When the nation's most sensitive nuclear \n     secrets are at issue, it is unacceptable that we should have \n     to rely on luck to keep them safe.\n       Among the many concerns arising from the investigation and \n     prosecution of Dr. Lee, the following are most significant:\n       The government obtained highly credible information in 1994 \n     that Dr. Lee had helped the Chinese with computer codes and \n     software, but took no steps to examine his computer. Had Dr. \n     Lee's computer been examined, his illegal downloads of some \n     of the nation's most sensitive nuclear weapons data to an \n     unclassified computer system accessible from the Internet \n     could have been detected and stopped.\n       The manner in which the FBI relied almost completely on the \n     Department of Energy's Administrative Inquiry (AI) throughout \n     the investigation which began in 1996, rather than developing \n     an independent investigative plan, caused an inappropriate \n     focus on the alleged loss of W-88 warhead design information \n     to the exclusion of all else. The FBI never questioned how \n     the suspected loss of the W-88 information related to the \n     codes and software help that Dr. Lee was suspected of having \n     provided to the PRC. The ongoing debate over whether the AI's \n     underlying assumptions--namely that rapid advances in the PRC \n     weapons program in the early 1990s resulted from their \n     acquisition of U.S. weapons design information, and that the \n     loss most likely occurred from Los Alamos--is of secondary \n     importance. The mere fact that the PRC had obtained \n     classified nuclear weapons information should have been \n     sufficient to trigger a thorough investigation, but the FBI's \n     investigation was anything but thorough.\n       The Department of Justice was wrong to reject the 1997 \n     request by the FBI for electronic surveillance under the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Had the request been \n     permitted to go forward to the court, Dr. Lee's illegal \n     downloading could have been detected and halted in 1997. The \n     Department of Justice's own internal review, conducted by \n     Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Bellows, concluded that the \n     request should have been approved.\n       The Department of Energy was wrong to allow Wackenhut \n     contract polygraph examiners to administer a polygraph to Dr. \n     Lee on December 23, 1998. The Wackenhut contractors \n     incorrectly reported that Dr. Lee passed the polygraph, \n     prompting the FBI to nearly shut down its investigation at a \n     time when scrutiny of Dr. Lee should have been intensified. \n     Dr. Lee has told investigators the computer tapes that are \n     now missing were in his office on December 23. Had the FBI \n     conducted its investigation consistent with the fact that Dr. \n     Lee did not pass the polygraph, the tapes could have been \n     recovered.\n       The nuclear secrets that Dr. Lee mishandled were correctly \n     described by the government as extremely sensitive. Dr. Lee's \n     actions in downloading these files onto an unclassified \n     computer system accessible from the Internet, and later onto \n     portable magnetic tapes, constituted a serious threat to the \n     national security.\n       Allegations that Dr. Lee was targeted for investigation and \n     prosecution as a result of ``ethnic profiling'' are \n     unfounded. The repeated investigations of Dr. Lee resulted \n     from reasonable suspicions raised by Dr. Lee's own conduct. \n     Moreover, there is absolutely no evidence that Dr. Lee's \n     ethnicity was a factor in the decision to prosecute Dr. Lee \n     or to hold him in unusually strict pretrial confinement.\n       The government's harsh treatment of Dr. Lee after his \n     arrest on December 10, 1999, including putting him in \n     solitary confinement and requiring him to be manacled does, \n     however, raise troubling questions. The government's claim \n     that Dr. Lee was such a threat he had to be held in pretrial \n     confinement under very strict conditions is inconsistent with \n     the long delay from March to December 1999--when the \n     government first learned of the downloaded secrets until he \n     was arrested--and the acceptance of a plea agreement in \n     September 2000 by which Dr. Lee was released with no \n     monitoring whatsoever, and which is only marginally better \n     than it could have had in December 1999, at least in terms of \n     finding out what happened to the tapes. Taken together with \n     the many missed opportunities to detect Dr. Lee's illegal \n     computer activity and recover the tapes, the government's \n     handling of the plea agreement raises questions as to whether \n     the harsh tactics were intended to coerce a confession.\n       The government's claim that Dr. Lee presented such a danger \n     that he had to be prohibited from communicating is severely \n     undercut by its failure to even seek any type of electronic \n     surveillance on him even after the existence of the tapes was \n     known. If the government was truly concerned that Dr. Lee \n     could potentially alter the global strategic balance through \n     phrases as innocuous as ``Uncle Wen says hello,'' or might \n     send a signal to a foreign intelligence service to extract \n     him, it should have sought to monitor his communications, \n     but it did not.\n       Some of the most controversial and misguided steps in the \n     case appear to have been motivated more by a desire to \n     protect the affected agency's image than the national \n     security. This is particularly true of the Department of \n     Energy's decision to administer a polygraph to Dr. Lee in \n     December 1998 when it seemed likely that the House's Cox \n     Committee report \\3\\ was going to expose the many missteps \n     that had occurred up to that point.\n       The full report which follows addresses each of these \n     matters in detail, as well as several other important aspects \n     of the case.\n\n     Report on the Government's Handling of the Investigation and \n                     Prosecution of Dr. Wen Ho Lee\n\n       The government's conduct in this case is so filled with \n     major breakdowns by every agency involved that it almost \n     defies analysis and makes determining responsibility for the \n     failures a very complicated matter. This report attempts to \n     sort out what went wrong and why, and to determine how such \n     mistakes can be avoided in future cases. It includes some new \n     information which has not been publicly disclosed before, and \n     provides a thorough review of the facts that are known. For \n     ease of reading, it is organized in roughly chronological \n     order, with the exception being a section in the beginning \n     which describes the key elements of the government's case \n     against Dr. Lee.\n     The case against Dr. Wen Ho Lee\n       Most Americans had never heard of Dr. Wen Ho Lee before he \n     was fired from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico \n     on March 8, 1999. The first vague hints of the story that \n     would explode on the national scene in March 1999 had come in \n     a January 7, 1999, Wall Street Journal article by Carla Anne \n     Robbins, which alleged that ``China received secret design \n     information for the most modern U.S. nuclear warhead'' and \n     quoted unnamed U.S. officials as saying that the ``top \n     suspect is an American working at a U.S. Department of Energy \n     laboratory.'' \\4\\ The WSJ article went on say that the loss \n     of information related to the W-88 warhead was the ``most \n     significant in a 20-year espionage effort by Beijing that \n     targeted the U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories,'' and that \n     ``China was given general, but still highly secret, \n     information about the warhead's weight, size and explosive \n     power, and its state-of-the-art internal configuration, which \n     allowed designers to minimize size and weight without losing \n     power.'' \\5\\ The article further noted that the investigation \n     of the suspected loss of W-88 information was the ``third \n     major Chinese espionage effort uncovered at the U.S. labs \n     over the last two decades,'' and was a key part of the work \n     of the special House committee, known as the Cox Committee, \n     that was reviewing American high-tech transfers to China.\\6\\\n       The story of suspected espionage at LANL remained dormant \n     after the Robbins article until the New York Times published \n     a March 5, 1999 piece by James Risen and Jeff Gerth, titled \n     ``Breach at Los Alamos: A Special Report.'' The article did \n     not name Dr. Lee, but raised the profile of the case by \n     quoting unnamed administration officials as saying that \n     ``working with nuclear secrets stolen from an American \n     Government laboratory, China has made a leap in the \n     development of nuclear weapons: the miniaturization of its \n     bombs. . .'' \\7\\ The Risen and Gerth story put a political \n     spin on the case, quoting ``some American officials'' as \n     asserting that ``the White House sought to minimize the \n     espionage issue for policy reasons.'' The senior National \n     Security Council official who handled the case, Gary \n     Samore, denied the allegations, telling the NYT reporters \n     that ``The idea that we tried to cover up or downplay \n     these allegations to limit the damage to U.S.-Chinese \n     relations is absolutely wrong.'' \\8\\\n\n[[Page S13794]]\n\n       Risen and Gerth then explained that their own investigation \n     had revealed that ``throughout the Government, the response \n     to the nuclear theft was plagued by delays, inaction and \n     skepticism--even though senior intelligence officials \n     regarded it as one of the most damaging spy cases in recent \n     history.'' \\9\\ In support of their charges, they cited \n     disagreements between former DOE intelligence chief Notra \n     Trulock, who was the main proponent of the view that Chinese \n     weapons advances were attributable to espionage, and other \n     senior administration officials, including former Acting \n     Energy Secretary Elizabeth Moler, who was said to have \n     ordered Trulock not to brief the Cox Committee ``for fear \n     that the information would be used to attack the President's \n     China policy.'' \\10\\\n       Ms. Moler denied the allegations that she had interfered \n     with Mr. Trulock's congressional testimony, but the die had \n     been cast so that as the story unfolded over the following \n     months there was always an underlying hint that the Clinton \n     Administration had ignored or downplayed an important \n     espionage case to avoid criticism or complications with its \n     China policy.\n       On March 8, 1999, Dr. Lee was publicly named for the first \n     time in an Associated Press story by Josef Hebert. Quoting a \n     statement from the Department of Energy (which did not name \n     Dr. Lee), Hebert wrote that Dr. Lee had been fired for \n     ``'failing to properly safeguard classified material' and \n     having contact with `people from a sensitive country'''.\\11\\ \n     Shortly thereafter, the New York Times ran another article by \n     James Risen, who had interviewed Energy Secretary Bill \n     Richardson. According to Risen, Richardson told him that Dr. \n     Lee had been fired on March 8 ``for security breaches after \n     the FBI questioned him in connection with China's suspected \n     theft of American nuclear secrets. . .'' \\12\\ Secretary \n     Richardson also acknowledged that Dr. Lee had been questioned \n     for three days, but had ``stonewalled'' during the \n     questioning.\\13\\\n       Through the spring and summer, details of the case dribbled \n     out as the press continued its investigation into the matter \n     and several congressional committees conducted oversight on \n     the case. Among the new details to emerge were allegations \n     totally unrelated to the W-88 matter, including charges that \n     Dr. Lee had transferred massive amounts of classified \n     nuclear data to the unclassified portion of the LANL \n     computer system and later onto portable magnetic tapes, \n     which were thought to be missing.\n       The Cox Committee released its unclassified report on May \n     25, 1999, which did not mention Dr. Lee by name but clearly \n     referred to his case. The President's Foreign Intelligence \n     Advisory Board released its own review of security at the \n     national labs in June, concluding that the labs did wonderful \n     science but were lousy on security matters.\\15\\ In August, \n     Senators Thompson and Lieberman of the Governmental Affairs \n     Committee released a special statement, saying:\n       ``This is a story of investigatory missteps, institutional \n     and personal miscommunications, and--we believe--legal and \n     policy misunderstandings and mistakes at all levels of \n     government. The DOE, FBI, and DOJ must all share the blame \n     for our government's poor performance in handling this \n     matter.'' \\16\\\n       By September 1999, the government had finally separated the \n     W-88 matter from the issue of Dr. Lee's illegal file \n     downloads, and had started a new investigation aimed at \n     finding out how the PRC had obtained the W-88 information it \n     was known to possess. It did so quietly, without publicly \n     acknowledging that Dr. Lee was apparently no longer a suspect \n     in the loss of the W-88 information.\n       Also in late September 1999, the Senate Judiciary \n     subcommittee on Department of Justice Oversight was \n     organized, with a mandate to examine: technology transfer to \n     the PRC, including the Wen Ho Lee case, the Peter Lee case, \n     and the Loral/Hughes matter; the facts surrounding the FBI's \n     use of pyrotechnic tear gas rounds during the 1993 standoff \n     at Waco, which had recently been confirmed in a special \n     report of the Texas Rangers; and the Department of Justice's \n     handling of campaign finance investigations and prosecutions \n     from the 1996 presidential campaign.\\17\\\n       The subcommittee began an expeditious review of the Wen Ho \n     Lee case and the other matters within its jurisdiction, and \n     sent out letters to witnesses on December 7, 1999, for a \n     hearing on December 14, which would examine two issues: 1) \n     the details of a December 23, 1998 polygraph exam that had \n     been administered to Dr. Lee, and 2) the relationship between \n     the Lees and the government.\n       On December 10, 1999, Dr. Lee was arrested and charged in a \n     59-count indictment \\18\\ of mishandling classified nuclear \n     weapons data, prompting FBI Director Freeh to write to me, \n     asking that I postpone hearings on the case. In view of the \n     extraordinary circumstances of the case and Director Freeh's \n     unprecedented request, which he reiterated to me and Senator \n     Torricelli in a meeting on December 14, I agreed to \n     postpone hearings on the case, but to continue a review of \n     government documents unrelated to the criminal case, as \n     well as documents that came into the public domain as a \n     result of the government's prosecution of Dr. Lee.\n       The indictment of Dr. Lee referred to a series of tapes Dr. \n     Lee made from 1993 through 1997, during which time he \n     collected SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL Restricted Data \\19\\ into a \n     directory on the classified computer system at LANL, then \n     transferred the information onto the unclassified portion of \n     the LANL computer system and ultimately onto a series of \n     portable magnetic computer tapes, each capable of holding 150 \n     megabytes of information. All told, the information he \n     collected and transferred to portable magnetic tapes was more \n     than 800 megabytes, the equivalent of over 400,000 pages of \n     data.\\20\\\n       At the bail hearing of Dr. Lee on Dec. 13, 1999, the key \n     government witness, Dr. Stephen Younger, Associate Laboratory \n     Director for Nuclear Weapons at Los Alamos, testified as \n     follows about the nuclear secrets Dr. Lee was accused of \n     mishandling:\n       ``These codes, and their associated data bases, and the \n     input file, combined with someone that knew how to use them, \n     could, in my opinion, in the wrong hands, change the global \n     strategic balance.'' \\21\\\n       It would be hard, realistically impossible, to pose a more \n     severe risk than to ``change the global strategic balance.''\n       Dr. Younger further testified that:\n       ``They enable the possessor to design the only objects that \n     could result in the military defeat of America's conventional \n     forces . . . . They represent the gravest possible security \n     risk to . . . the supreme national interest.'' \\22\\\n       A ``military defeat of America's conventional forces'' and \n     ``the gravest possible security risk to . . . the supreme \n     national interest'' constitute threats of obvious enormous \n     importance.\n       At this same bail hearing, when the judge seemed to be \n     leaning toward a restrictive form of house arrest, Mr. Kelly \n     warned that Dr. Lee could be ``snatched and taken out of the \n     country'' by hostile intelligence services.\\23\\ The lead FBI \n     Agent then on the case, Robert Messemer, told the judge to \n     expect ``a marked increase in hostile intelligence service \n     activities both here in New Mexico and throughout the United \n     States in an effort to locate those tapes,'' and warned that \n     ``our surveillance personnel do not carry firearms, and they \n     will be placed in harm's way if you require us to maintain \n     this impossible task of protecting Dr. Lee.'' \\24\\\n       The government made these representations in a \n     successful effort to deny Dr. Lee bail and he remained in \n     pretrial confinement for more than nine months. By \n     September 13, 2000, when Judge Parker approved the plea \n     agreement under which Dr. Lee would plead guilty to one of \n     the original fifty-nine felony counts and accept a \n     sentence of ``time-served'' at 278 days, the government's \n     case against Dr. Lee appeared to lie in tatters, as did \n     its credibility.\n       Judge Parker's statements at the plea hearing were a \n     stunning rebuke of the government when he said:\n       ``. . . I believe you were terribly wronged by being held \n     in custody pretrial . . . under demeaning, unnecessarily \n     punitive conditions. I am truly sorry that I was led by our \n     Executive Branch of government to order your detention last \n     December.\n       ``Dr. Lee, I tell you with great sadness that I feel I was \n     led astray last December by the Executive Branch of our \n     government through its Department of Justice, by its Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation and by its United States Attorney for \n     the District of New Mexico. . .''\\25\\\n       After praising many of the lawyers on both sides of the \n     case, Judge Parker made clear where he felt the \n     responsibility for the government's mistakes should lay:\n       ``It is only the top decision makers in the Executive \n     Branch, especially the Department of Justice and the \n     Department of Energy and locally, during December, who have \n     caused embarrassment by the way this case began and was \n     handled. They did not embarrass me alone. They have \n     embarrassed our entire nation and each of us who is a citizen \n     of it.'' \\26\\\n       When Dr. Lee walked free, convicted of a single felony \n     count out of 59 and sentenced to time served, the nation was \n     stunned by the government's rapid reversal. The government \n     had argued even as late as September 1, 2000 that Dr. Lee was \n     so serious a threat to the national security that he had to \n     be held in solitary confinement under extraordinarily \n     stringent conditions, yet less than two weeks later, he was \n     allowed to walk out of jail a free man. Even President \n     Clinton, who strangely acted as though it was some alien \n     entity that had done such a sharp turnabout rather than an \n     agency within his own administration, seemed stunned by the \n     change of position. On the day after Dr. Lee was released, \n     President Clinton told reporters at the White House:\n       ``The whole thing was quite troubling to me, and I think \n     it's very difficult to reconcile the two positions that one \n     day he's a terrible risk to the national security and the \n     next day they're making a plea agreement for an offense far \n     more modest than what had been alleged.'' \\27\\\n       It may remain impossible to reconcile the two positions, \n     but it is necessary to try, if for no other reason than to \n     help Americans understand why the government acted as it did \n     in the Wen Ho Lee case. Although it may not be sufficient to \n     restore the public's confidence in the agencies involved in \n     this case, a thorough examination of the facts such as that \n     attempted here is a necessary step in that direction.\n     The Investigations of Dr. Wen Ho Lee\n       The purpose of counterintelligence is to identify \n     suspicious conduct and then pursue an investigation to \n     prevent or minimize access by foreign agents to our \n     secrets. From a counterintelligence perspective, the \n     government's handling of the Wen Ho Lee matter\n\n[[Page S13795]]\n\n     has been an unmitigated disaster. The investigation of Dr. \n     Lee since 1982 has been characterized by a series of \n     errors and omissions by the Department of Energy and the \n     Department of Justice, including the FBI, which have \n     permitted Dr. Lee to threaten U.S. supremacy by putting at \n     risk information that could change the ``global strategic \n     balance.''\n       While Dr. Lee, of course, must bear primary responsibility \n     for any damage that might result to national security from \n     his mishandling of our nuclear secrets, those officials in \n     the DOE, the FBI and, to a lesser degree, the DOJ, who \n     participated in the investigation of Dr. Lee must accept \n     responsibility for their own failure to detect and put a stop \n     to Dr. Lee's illegal computer activity. It would be one thing \n     if an individual who had never shown up on the \n     counterintelligence radar scope was later found out, but Dr. \n     Lee was under active investigation during the very time he \n     was engaged in illegal computer downloads, yet his activities \n     were not detected.\n       In fact, Dr. Lee was investigated on multiple occasions \n     over seventeen years, but none of these investigations--or \n     the security measures in place at Los Alamos--came close to \n     discovering and preventing Dr. Lee from putting the national \n     security at risk by placing highly classified nuclear secrets \n     on an unsecure system where they could easily be accessed by \n     even unsophisticated hackers.\\18\\ It is difficult to \n     comprehend how officials entrusted with the responsibility \n     for protecting our national security could have failed to \n     discover what was really happening with Dr. Lee, given all \n     the indicators that were present.\n     The 1982-1984 Investigation\n       Dr. Wen Ho Lee was born in Nantou, Taiwan, in 1939. After \n     graduating from Texas A University with a Doctorate in \n     1969, he became a U.S. citizen in 1974, and began working at \n     Los Alamos National Laboratory in applied mathematics and \n     fluid dynamics in 1978.\\20\\ The X-Division, where Dr. Lee \n     worked from 1982 until 1998, has the highest level of \n     security of any division at LANL. It is responsible for the \n     design of thermonuclear weapons, and Dr. Lee was part of a \n     team working on five Lagrangian mathematical codes, also \n     known as ``source codes'', used in weapons development. Dr. \n     Lee's wife, Sylvia, also worked at LANL from November 1980 \n     until June 1995. The last position she held was ``Computer \n     Technician,'' and she held a Top Secret clearance from 1991 \n     through 1995.\\30\\\n       The FBI first became concerned about Dr. Lee as a result of \n     contacts he made with a suspected PRC intelligence agent in \n     the early 1980s. On December 3, 1982, Dr. Lee called a former \n     employee of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) who \n     was suspected of passing classified information to the \n     Peoples Republic of China (PRC). This call was intercepted \n     pursuant to a FISA court authorized wiretap in another FBI \n     espionage investigation. After introducing himself, Dr. Lee \n     stated that he had heard about the Lawrence Livermore \n     scientist's ``matter'' and that Lee thought he could find out \n     who had ``squealed'' on the employee.\\31\\ Based on the \n     intercepted phone call, the FBI opened an espionage \n     investigation on Dr. Lee.\n       For the next several months the FBI investigated Dr. Lee, \n     with much of the work being done under the guise of the \n     periodic reinvestigation required for individuals with \n     security clearances. On November 9, 1983, the FBI interviewed \n     Dr. Lee. Before being informed that the FBI had intercepted \n     his call to the Lawrence Livermore employee, Lee stated that \n     he had never attempted to contact the employee, did not know \n     the employee, and had not initiated any telephone calls to \n     him. These representations were patently false.\\32\\ Dr. Lee \n     offered during the course of this interview to assist the FBI \n     with its investigation of the other scientist.\n       On December 20, 1983 Dr. Lee was again interviewed by the \n     FBI,\\33\\ this time in California. During this interview, Lee \n     explained that he had been in contact with Taiwanese nuclear \n     researchers since 1977 or 1978, had done consulting work for \n     them, and had sent some information that was not classified \n     but that should have been cleared with DOE officials. He \n     tried to explain that he had contacted the subject of the \n     other investigation because he thought this other scientist \n     was in trouble for doing the same thing that Lee had been \n     doing for Taiwan.\\34\\ After this interview, the FBI sent Dr. \n     Lee to meet with the espionage suspect.\n       On January 24, 1984, Dr. Lee took an FBI polygraph \n     examination which included questions about passing classified \n     information to any foreign government, Lee's contacts with \n     the Taiwanese Embassy, and his contacts with the LLNL \n     scientist. Although the FBI has subsequently contended that \n     Dr. Lee's answers on this polygraph were satisfactory, there \n     remained important reasons to continue the investigation. His \n     suspicious conduct in contacting the Lawrence Livermore \n     scientist and then lying about it, the nature of the \n     documents that he was sending to the Taiwanese Embassy, and \n     the status of the person to whom he was sending those \n     documents were potential danger signals. Although not \n     classified, the documents Dr. Lee was passing to Taiwan's \n     Coordination Council of North America were subject to \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission export controls. They were \n     specifically stamped ``no foreign dissemination.'' \n     According to testimony of FBI Special Agent Robert \n     Messemer at a special hearing on December 29, 1999, FBI \n     files also contain evidence of other \n     ``misrepresentations'' that Dr. Lee made to the FBI in \n     1983-1984 which have raised ``grave and serious concerns'' \n     about Dr. Lee's truthfulness.\\36\\ Notwithstanding these \n     reasons for continuing the investigation, the FBI closed \n     its initial investigation of Lee on March 12, 1984.\\37\\\n       Although the FBI's 1982-1984 investigation was generally \n     well run, three areas of concern are worth noting. First, the \n     FBI should have coordinated more closely with the Department \n     of Energy. When initially contacted by the FBI in 1982, the \n     DOE's Office of Security recommended that Dr. Lee be removed \n     from access due to the sensitivity of the area in which he \n     worked. Had the DOE security official's instincts been \n     followed, Dr. Lee would not have been able to put at risk, \n     years later, the massive volume of nuclear data that he \n     ultimately did.\n       The second area of concern is that the FBI closed the \n     investigation despite several troubling indicators. As noted \n     previously, FBI Special Agent Messemer mentioned several \n     misrepresentations that Dr. Lee made to the FBI which were \n     relevant to his truthfulness. Two of these misrepresentations \n     stand out as particularly important. First, Dr. Lee learned \n     about the LLNL scientist's situation from a mutual friend \n     during an October 1982 visit to LLNL.\\38\\ Second, and more \n     importantly, upon learning of the LLNL scientist's \n     predicament, Dr. Lee immediately attempted to call his point \n     of contact at the Coordination Council of North America (the \n     equivalent of the Taiwanese Embassy in Washington, DC).\\39\\ \n     That Dr. Lee would attempt to contact a foreign embassy \n     seeking help for a fellow scientist should have raised \n     serious questions about his trustworthiness.\n       Unfortunately, the FBI did not discover this until after \n     they had already made a decision to use him in the \n     investigation of the LLNL scientist. Had the FBI been more \n     cautious in assessing Dr. Lee's trustworthiness in the first \n     place, it would likely not have used him in the investigation \n     of the other scientist, and would therefore have been in a \n     better position to facilitate his termination from LANL or, \n     at the very least, the removal of his security clearance. \n     Director Freeh recently confirmed that the FBI had made no \n     recommendation to the DOE regarding the removal of Dr. Lee's \n     clearance following the 1982-1984 investigation.\\40\\\n       The second element of Dr. Lee's conduct in the 1982-1984 \n     investigation that deserved greater attention from the FBI \n     than it got is the status of the individual to whom Dr. Lee \n     was sending the information at the CCNA. This individual was \n     known to the FBI as an intelligence collector (although it \n     remains unclear as to whether Dr. Lee had any reason to be \n     aware of that). The FBI did take the necessary steps to learn \n     how Dr. Lee came to know this individual, but it did not give \n     sufficient weight to the individual's status as an \n     intelligence collector.\n       The third and final area of concern about the FBI's \n     handling of the 1982-1984 investigation relates to the FBI's \n     reporting of Dr. Lee's assistance in the investigation of the \n     LLNL scientist, which has been inconsistent. Some documents, \n     apparently including information provided to Attorney General \n     Reno in preparation for her June 8, 1999 appearance before \n     the Judiciary Committee in closed session, indicate that the \n     FBI did not use Dr. Lee in its investigation. The final draft \n     of the 1997 request for FISA coverage on Dr. Lee, in \n     recounting this episode, states flatly that while Dr. Lee \n     offered to help the FBI in its investigation of the LLNL \n     scientist, the FBI did not use him.\\41\\ Contemporaneous FBI \n     records of the 1982 investigation, however, indicate that not \n     only did Dr. Lee assist the FBI with its investigation of the \n     other scientist, but that the result was far better than had \n     been anticipated.\n       The failure to mention the assistance provided by Dr. Lee \n     in 1983 when requesting FISA coverage in 1997 is troubling \n     because it has the effect of presenting an incomplete picture \n     of the initial investigation of Dr. Lee. Judgements regarding \n     whether an individual is acting as an agent of a foreign \n     power should be made in consideration of the totality of the \n     circumstances, and the FBI's decision to use Dr. Lee in the \n     investigation of the LLNL scientist is an important element \n     of the total circumstances. If the FBI trusted Dr. Lee enough \n     to use him in the investigation of the LLNL scientist, that \n     fact should have been included in the FISA request. The \n     failure to mention that fact gives an incomplete impression, \n     which is inappropriate in these matters.\n       It is likely that the FBI's incorrect characterization of \n     Dr. Lee's 1982-1984 activities was merely an inadvertent \n     oversight and was not an attempt to conceal the assistance he \n     had provided. For example, the FBI did not make any effort to \n     conceal or deny Mrs. Lee's assistance to the government.\n       While the FBI should have acknowledged Dr. Lee's assistance \n     in the FISA request, the totality of Dr. Lee's conduct in \n     1982-1984 was suspicious and was directly relevant on a \n     probable cause determination.\n       The 1982-1984 investigation of Dr. Lee represents a missed \n     opportunity to protect the nation's secrets. Had the matter \n     been handled properly, Dr. Lee's clearance and access would \n     most likely have been removed long ago, before he was able to \n     put the global strategic balance at risk.\n     The 1994-November 2, 1995, Investigation of Dr. Lee\n       This investigation of Dr. Lee was initiated based upon the \n     discovery that he was well\n\n[[Page S13796]]\n\n     acquainted with a high-ranking Chinese nuclear scientist who \n     visited Los Alamos as part of a delegation in 1994,\\42\\ and \n     that he was alleged to have helped Chinese scientists with \n     codes and software. Dr. Lee had never reported meeting this \n     scientist, which he was required to do by DOE regulations, so \n     his relationship with this person aroused the FBI's concern. \n     Unclassified sources have reported that Dr. Lee was greeted \n     by ``a leading scientist in China's nuclear weapons program \n     who then made it clear to others in the meeting that Lee had \n     been helpful to China's nuclear program.'' \\43\\ In concert \n     with the 1982-1984 investigation, Dr. Lee's undisclosed \n     relationship with this top Chinese nuclear scientist should \n     have alerted the FBI and the DOE of the imperative for \n     intensified investigation and reconsideration of his access \n     to classified information. Instead, this FBI investigation \n     was deferred on November 2, 1995, because Dr. Lee was by then \n     emerging as a central figure in the Department of Energy's \n     Administrative Inquiry,\\44\\ which was developed by a DOE \n     counterintelligence expert in concert with a seasoned FBI \n     agent who had been assigned to DOE for the purposes of the \n     inquiry. (The DOE Administrative Inquiry was given the code \n     name Kindred Spirit.\\45\\) The investigation of Dr. Lee was \n     essentially dormant from November 1995 until May 1996, when \n     the FBI received the results of the DOE Administrative \n     Inquiry and opened a new investigation of Dr. Lee on May 30, \n     1996.\n       It is difficult to understand why the FBI would suspend the \n     investigation in 1995, even to wait for the Kindred Spirit \n     Administrative Inquiry, when the issues that gave rise to \n     1994-1995 investigation remained valid and unrelated to the \n     Kindred Spirit investigation. The key elements of the 1994-\n     1995 investigation are described in the 1997 Letterhead \n     Memorandum (LHM) which was prepared to support the request \n     for a FISA search warrant. Specifically, the LHM describes \n     the unreported contact with the top nuclear scientist,\\46\\ \n     and it makes reference to the ``PRC using certain \n     computational codes . . . which were later identified as \n     something that [Lee] had unique access to.'' \\47\\ And, \n     finally, the LHM states that ``the Director subsequently \n     learned that Lee Wen Ho had worked on legacy codes.'' Given \n     these allegations, it was a serious error to allow the \n     investigation to wait for several months while the DOE AI \n     was being completed. This deferral needlessly delayed the \n     investigation and left important issues unresolved.\n       In addition to information known to the FBI which required \n     further intensified investigation and not a deferred \n     investigation on November 2, 1995, the Department of Energy \n     was incredibly lax in failing to understand and pursue \n     obvious evidence that Dr. Lee was downloading large \n     quantities of classified information to an unclassified \n     system. The sheer volume of Dr. Lee's downloading showed up \n     on a DOE report in 1993.\\49\\ Cheryl Wampler, from the Los \n     Alamos computer office, has testified that the NADIR system, \n     short for Network Anomaly Detection and Intrusion Recording, \n     flagged Dr. Lee's massive downloading in 1993.\\50\\ This \n     system is specifically designed to create profiles of \n     scientists' daily computer usage so it can detect unusual \n     behaviors. A DOE official with direct knowledge of this \n     suspicious activity failed to act on it, or to tell DOE \n     counterintelligence personnel or the FBI. Based on its \n     design, the NADIR system would have continued to flag Dr. \n     Lee's computer activities in 1994 as being unusual, but no \n     one from DOE took any action to investigate what was going \n     on.\\51\\ And it wasn't mentioned to the FBI or DOE's counter-\n     intelligence personnel.\n       In response to written questions after a September 27, 2000 \n     hearing on the Wen Ho Lee matter, DOE officials provided \n     information to put the NADIR alerts in perspective. According \n     to DOE, an average of 180 users per week exceeded the \n     thresholds established by the system, and were flagged just \n     like Dr. Lee.\\52\\ While 180 is a substantial number of \n     individuals, it would not be impossible to devise a system by \n     which counterintelligence personnel can review these records \n     to determine whether or not any individuals who are already \n     under investigation have been identified by the system.\n       In response to another question about what happened to the \n     NADIR records for 1994 (which, according to testimony from \n     Ms. Wampler are missing), DOE replied simply that:\n       ``. . . in 1993 NADIR was a new and developing technique \n     and many other scientists in addition to Dr. Lee were \n     transferring data due to a change in the computer environment \n     at that time. During the 1993-1994 timeframe, Dr. Lee was not \n     a suspect.'' \\53\\\n       Apart from the fact that the DOE's response is incorrect--\n     Dr. Lee was a suspect beginning in 1994--the records should \n     have been available for review when the FBI began its \n     investigation. The fact that the DOE was able to confirm that \n     Dr. Lee was flagged by NADIR in 1993 proves that point, but \n     it does not explain the absence of the 1994 NADIR records. \n     Had the FBI bothered to check with the DOE computer \n     personnel, and there should have been no doubt that Dr. \n     Lee had no expectation of privacy with regard to a system \n     designed to identify abnormal system operations, Dr. Lee's \n     illegal computer downloads could have been detected and \n     halted.\n       The DOE computer and counterintelligence personnel could \n     also have been more helpful in this situation.\\54\\ Had DOE \n     transmitted this information to the FBI, and had the FBI \n     acted on it, Dr. Lee could have and should have been stopped \n     in his tracks in 1994 on these indicators of downloading. The \n     full extent of the importance of the information that Dr. Lee \n     was putting at risk through his downloading was encapsulated \n     in a document the Government filed in December 1999 as part \n     of the criminal action against Dr. Lee:\n       ``[I]n 1993 and 1994, Lee knowingly assembled 19 \n     collections of files, called tape archive (TAR) files, \n     containing Secret and Confidential Restricted Data relating \n     to atomic weapon research, design, construction, and testing. \n     Lee gathered and collected information from the secure, \n     classified LANL computer system, moved it to an unsecure, \n     ``open'' computer, and then later downloaded 17 of the 19 \n     classified TAR files to nine portable computer tapes.'' \\55\\\n       These files, which amounted to more than 806 megabytes, \n     contained information that could do vast damage to the \n     national security.\n       The end result of these missteps and lack of communication \n     was that, during some of the very time that the FBI had an \n     espionage investigation open on Dr. Lee resulting from his \n     unreported contacts with a top Chinese scientist and the \n     realization that the Chinese were using codes to which Dr. \n     Lee had unique access, DOE computer personnel were being \n     warned by the NADIR system that Dr. Lee was moving \n     suspiciously large amounts of information around, but were \n     ignoring those warnings and were not passing them on to the \n     FBI. At the same time, FBI personnel were taking no steps to \n     investigate Dr. Lee's computer activities, even when one of \n     the key allegations that prompted scrutiny of him in 1994 was \n     that he had helped the Chinese with codes and software.\n       The near perfect correlation between the allegations which \n     began the 1994-1995 investigation and Dr. Lee's computer \n     activities is stunning. The codes the Chinese were known to \n     be using were computer codes, yet FBI and DOE \n     counterintelligence officials never managed to discover these \n     massive file transfers. Where, if not on his computer, were \n     they looking? And, as for the lab computer personnel who saw \n     but ignored the NADIR reports, what possible explanation can \n     there be for a failure to conduct even the most minimal \n     investigation?\n       FBI and DOE failures in 1994-1995 represented the loss of a \n     golden opportunity to detect and halt Dr. Lee's illegal \n     computer activities. In the 1995-1996 period, another \n     opportunity to find and fix the problem presented itself in \n     the form of the DOE Administrative Inquiry (AI). \n     Unfortunately, the opportunity represented by the AI was \n     never fully realized.\n     The Investigation Renewed, May 30, 1996 to August 12, 1997\n       As noted previously, the investigation of Dr. Lee was \n     dormant from November 2, 1995 until May 30, 1996. The \n     investigation had been shut down to await the arrival of \n     DOE's Administrative Inquiry, which was presented on May 28, \n     1996. With the DOE AI in hand, the FBI resumed its \n     investigation of the Lees. To understand that investigation, \n     however, it is first necessary to review the AI.\n       The Kindred Spirit Administrative Inquiry\n       The public perception of the government's actions in the \n     Wen Ho Lee case, particularly with regard to charges of so-\n     called ``ethnic profiling'', has been shaped by a \n     misunderstanding of the Department of Energy's Administrative \n     Inquiry (AI), code named ``Kindred Spirit''. Although he was \n     not its author, former DOE intelligence chief Notra Trulock \n     has been closely associated with this document, in large \n     measure because he was instrumental in commissioning the \n     DOE's Kindred Spirit Analytical Group (KSAG) which spawned \n     the AI, and he later forcefully advocated the position that \n     substantial espionage had occurred and that something needed \n     to be done about it. The KSAG was formed in 1995 when \n     scientists studying Chinese nuclear developments became \n     concerned about certain developments in the level of \n     sophistication of the PRC's weapons. During the summer of \n     1995, these concerns were fueled when an individual provided \n     to the U.S. government a document, subsequently known as the \n     ``walk-in'' document, which contained highly classified \n     details of some of our most advanced nuclear warheads.\n       Recent attempts to re-examine the premise of the Kindred \n     Spirit AI and to question its role in the FBI's subsequent \n     investigation of the same name have fostered the perception \n     that the DOE's AI was largely to blame for the FBI's \n     misdirected investigation, which focused almost exclusively \n     on Dr. and Mrs. Lee, the loss of the W-88 information, and \n     the Los Alamos lab, when a much broader investigation was \n     required.\n       The perception that DOE's AI was the weakest link in the \n     FBI's Kindred Spirit investigation is unfortunate because it \n     obscures a far more complex set of circumstances. This \n     perception has also unfairly undermined the \n     government's credibility on the ethnic/racial profiling \n     question and seriously damaged Notra Trulock's reputation \n     and career. A more complete public record on this matter \n     may be helpful in repairing some of the damage.\n       In an October 29, 1999 letter, Energy Secretary Bill \n     Richardson reacted to the FBI's attempts to lay the blame for \n     its problems in the Kindred Spirit investigation on the \n     Administrative Inquiry:\n       ``. . . I think there has been a tendency to overstate the \n     adverse influence that DOE's technical analysis and \n     preliminary investigative support had on the conduct of the\n\n[[Page S13797]]\n\n     KINDRED SPIRIT investigation. There also has been, in my \n     opinion, an over-emphasis on the degree to which DOE input \n     served to limit the FBI's investigative work. . . . [T]he \n     fact is that all of the decisions to limit the scope of the \n     investigation were clearly, mutually agreed-upon by DOE and \n     the FBI, based on security and other concerns.'' \\57\\\n       In this regard, Secretary Richardson is correct. The FBI's \n     failures in the Wen Ho Lee investigation should not be blamed \n     on the AI. The DOE is, by law, limited in the scope of what \n     it can do. The FBI could have and should have looked at the \n     AI as a starting point. Instead, the FBI case agents seemed \n     to think that the DOE investigators had done their job for \n     them, and never seriously looked at the premise of the AI and \n     its relationship to Dr. Lee's activities.\n       The facts of the AI and the controversy surrounding it can \n     be stated in an unclassified fashion as follows:\n       (A) The U.S. government concluded in 1995 that the PRC had \n     made remarkable progress in its nuclear weapons program in \n     the early 1990s.\n       (B) The government also learned in 1995 that the PRC had \n     obtained certain classified nuclear weapons design \n     information on the W-88 warhead and other weapons.\n       There is widespread agreement that both A and B are true: \n     the Chinese made rapid advancements in their nuclear weapons \n     program in the early 1990s, and they obtained classified \n     nuclear weapons design information sometime before 1995. The \n     controversy arises over whether there is any causal \n     relationship between the two facts. One school of thought--\n     embodied in the Kindred Spirit AI--holds that the Chinese \n     advances occurred because they obtained classified U.S. \n     nuclear weapons design information, particularly that related \n     to the W-88. The contrary school of thought holds that while \n     both A and B may be true, there is no evidence that the \n     Chinese nuclear advances resulted from their acquisition of \n     U.S. nuclear weapons design information.\n       Investigations predicated upon these two schools of thought \n     would take remarkably divergent paths. If one took as a \n     starting point, as did the authors of the AI, the belief that \n     the PRC's nuclear weapons design advances were in large \n     part attributable to espionage against the United States, \n     one would be looking for the wholesale transfer of W-88 \n     design information. The alternative view--that the PRC's \n     nuclear weapons advances could have occurred independently \n     of the acknowledged acquisition of classified U.S. weapons \n     data in the ``walk-in'' document--would lead to an \n     investigation focused on the specific bits of classified \n     information the Chinese were known to have obtained, not \n     only about the W-88 but about other weapons systems as \n     well. The former theory paints a picture consistent with a \n     single act of espionage, conducted by a single individual \n     transferring information from a specific place. The latter \n     theory forces a broader review, implicitly acknowledging \n     that the information could involve multiple transfers from \n     multiple sources, quite possibly by numerous individuals.\n       While the debate over whether or not the PRC's nuclear \n     weapons advances resulted from espionage is important from \n     both a counterintelligence and an intelligence point of view, \n     it should not have been the determinative factor in deciding \n     how to conduct this espionage investigation. The threshold \n     for required action by the FBI is met on the basis of fact B, \n     irrespective of fact A and any relationship between the two \n     elements. Section 811 of the Intelligence Authorization Act \n     of 1995, enacted to improve interagency coordination on \n     espionage investigations in the wake of the Aldrich Ames spy \n     case, requires an agency to notify the FBI when it becomes \n     aware that espionage may have occurred. Proof that the PRC \n     had obtained classified U.S. nuclear weapons design \n     information became available in the summer of 1995 in the \n     form of the ``walk-in'' document, which was really a large \n     cache of documents delivered to the U.S. government by a \n     Chinese national. The information in the ``walk-in'' document \n     was sufficient to trigger the requirements of section 811 and \n     to prompt an investigation by the FBI.\n       The DOE could have satisfied its statutory obligations \n     under section 811 simply by notifying the FBI of its view \n     that certain information in the ``walk-in'' document was not \n     in the public domain, had not been authorized for transfer to \n     the PRC, and was therefore likely in the possession of the \n     PRC as a result of espionage. In retrospect, it might have \n     been better if they had done so. The conclusions of the AI, \n     while accompanied by many caveats that the DOE had been \n     limited in its ability to conduct the investigation and that \n     further review was required, were adopted almost wholesale by \n     the FBI and formed the basis of the FBI's own Kindred Spirit \n     espionage investigation.\n       The Bellows Report is highly critical of the DOE AI, \n     concluding essentially that the DOE overstated the degree of \n     consensus that existed on the question of espionage as a \n     causal factor in the PRC's nuclear weapons advances, thereby \n     establishing a faulty predicate for the entire investigation. \n     The fact that the DOE was already concerned that the PRC had \n     detonated what appeared to be an advanced nuclear weapon when \n     the information in the ``walk-in'' document became available \n     may have led some members of the DOE scientific review panel, \n     called the Kindred Spirit Analytical Group (KSAG), to give \n     undue weight to the possibility of a causal link between the \n     PRC's weapons design advances and the information in the \n     ``walk-in'' document. That is a question about which \n     reasonable individuals may disagree--even among the members \n     of the KSAG there was not unanimity on this point \\58\\--but \n     there is no doubt that the AI which flowed from the KSAG was \n     built upon the belief that the PRC's design advances were the \n     result of espionage. There can also be no doubt that the AI \n     cast strong suspicion on the Lees.\n       Any fair reading of the Administrative Inquiry makes clear \n     that its authors (a DOE counterintelligence official and an \n     FBI agent seconded to the DOE to assist with the AI) \n     considered Wen Ho and Sylvia to be the prime suspects in the \n     alleged loss to the PRC of certain W-88 nuclear warhead \n     design information, and that the loss had most likely \n     occurred at Los Alamos. The AI reaches a preliminary \n     conclusion:\n       ``. . . it is the opinion of the writer that Wen Ho Lee is \n     the only individual identified during this inquiry who had, \n     opportunity, motivation and legitimate access to both W-88 \n     weapons system information and the information reportedly \n     received by [the PRC].'' \\59\\\n       A fair reading of the document also shows that the authors \n     explicitly recognized the limitations of their investigation \n     and recommended that the Lees and Los Alamos be a starting \n     place for an investigation into the loss of the W-88 \n     information, an investigation that would necessarily extend \n     well beyond the Lees and Los Alamos. For example, the report \n     says:\n       ``This by no means excludes any other DOE personnel as \n     being possible suspects in this matter. However, based upon a \n     review of all information gathered by this inquiry, Wen Ho \n     Lee and his wife, Sylvia appear the most logical suspects. \n     Wen Ho Lee had the direct access to the W-88 [information], \n     motivation and opportunity to provide the PRC the W-88 \n     weapons design [information].'' \\60\\\n       The report concluded with the following recommendation:\n       ``The writer believes the ECI [DOE Counterintelligence] has \n     basically, exhausted all logical `leads' regarding this \n     inquiry which ECI is legally permitted to accomplish. \n     Therefore, I strongly urge the FBI take the lead in this \n     investigation.'' \\61\\\n       Thus, while the AI strongly points toward the Lees there \n     are also enough qualifiers to make it clear that other \n     suspects should also be investigated.\n       Had the AI arrived on the doorstep of the FBI's Albuquerque \n     office under different circumstances, it might have been \n     handled more appropriately. The AI came when the FBI had \n     already been investigating Dr. Lee, albeit not very \n     competently, on the basis of credible allegations from 1994 \n     that he had helped the Chinese with codes and software. In \n     this context, the AI served to reinforce the FBI's existing \n     perceptions of Dr. Lee as a likely espionage suspect.\n       Instead of using the AI as a starting point for a \n     comprehensive investigation, the FBI did little or no \n     additional analysis and began focusing almost exclusively on \n     the W-88 issue and the Lees. The reason for the FBI's action \n     was made clear in an interview of the special agent who \n     helped write the AI, who said that he assumed that the \n     investigation of Dr. Lee and the Kindred Spirit investigation \n     would eventually merge because it looked like Dr. Lee was the \n     most likely suspect.\\62\\\n       Even when given an opportunity to take a fresh look at the \n     case, the FBI did not do so. When the CIA expressed concern \n     in the summer of 1996 that the individual who provided the \n     ``walk-in'' document might be under the control of a hostile \n     intelligence service, the FBI actually shut down its \n     investigation for nearly three weeks in July and August. An \n     August 20, 1996 teletype from FBIHQ to the Albuquerque \n     division says:\n       ``On August 19, 1996, DOEHQ provided FBIHQ with a letter \n     stating it had conferred with CIAHQ and that DOE judged `that \n     a serious compromise of U.S. weapons-specific restricted data \n     occurred most likely in the 1984-1988 timeframe.' In effect, \n     DOE stands by their original conclusion.'' \\63\\\n       Thus, after the details were sorted out, it was clear that \n     the investigation should go forward because the PRC had \n     information they should not have, even if there were \n     disagreements over what, exactly, had been compromised. A \n     September 16, 1996 FBI 302 from an interview of a scientist \n     puts this in perspective. It says, ``There was no \n     disagreement that `Restricted Data' information had been \n     acquired by the Chinese. The only disagreement was over how \n     valuable the information was.'' \\64\\\n       Thus, the recent attempts to dissect the AI, outlined \n     elsewhere in this report, miss the mark. The FBI had an \n     opportunity when the CIA raised a red flag about the ``walk-\n     in'' in 1996 to review the structure of their investigation. \n     They knew, based on the review they conducted at the time, \n     that there had been some disagreement within the KSAG, but \n     that espionage had, in fact, occurred. Unfortunately, when \n     the FBI restarted its investigation in August 1996, the case \n     agents never questioned the underlying assumptions of the AI \n     or the impact of these assumptions on the structure and \n     course of the investigation.\n       By restarting the investigation where they left off, the \n     FBI failed to take into consideration massive amounts of \n     information in their own files indicating that the \n     investigation should extend beyond the W-88 information, \n     beyond Los Alamos, and beyond the Lees. More importantly, the \n     FBI never seems to have made any effort to understand what, \n     if any, relationship existed between the Kindred Spirit \n     allegations and the investigation\n\n[[Page S13798]]\n\n     of Dr. Lee that was already under way related to computer \n     codes and software. The FBI's failure to ask this basic \n     question sent the investigation on a wild goose chase for \n     more than three years while Dr. Lee's illegal computer \n     activities, which were highly relevant to the 1994 \n     allegations against him, continued unchecked and unimpeded.\n       The ``walk-in'' document\n       The ``walk-in'' document is central to the Kindred Spirit \n     investigation, so it should be described in the greatest \n     detail consistent with classification concerns. This \n     document, dated 1988, is said to lay out China's nuclear \n     modernization plan for Beijing's First Ministry of Machine \n     Building, which is responsible for making missiles and nose \n     cones.\\65\\ The 74-page document contains dozens of facts \n     about U.S. warheads, mostly in a two-page chart. On one side \n     of the chart are various US Air Force and US Navy warheads, \n     including some older bombs as well as the W-80 warhead \n     (cruise missiles), the W-87 (Minuteman III); and the W-88 \n     (Trident II).\\66\\ Among the most important items of \n     information in the ``walk-in'' document are details about the \n     W-88 warhead.\n       The Cox Committee Report provides the following description \n     and assessment of the ``walk-in'' document:\n       ``In 1995, a ``walk-in'' approached the Central \n     Intelligence Agency outside of the PRC and provided an \n     official PRC document classified ``Secret'' that contained \n     design information on the W-88 Trident D-5 warhead, the most \n     modern in the U.S. arsenal, as well as technical information \n     concerning other thermonuclear warheads.\n       ``The CIA later determined that the ``walk-in'' was \n     directed by the PRC intelligence services. Nonetheless, the \n     CIA and other Intelligence Community analysts that reviewed \n     the document concluded that it contained U.S. thermonuclear \n     warhead design information.\n       ``The ``walk-in'' document recognized that the U.S. nuclear \n     warheads represented the state-of-the-art against which PRC \n     thermonuclear warheads should be measured.\n       ``Over the following months, an assessment of the \n     information in the document was conducted by a \n     multidisciplinary group from the U.S. government, including \n     the Department of Energy and scientists from the U.S. \n     national weapons laboratories.''\\67\\\n       The Cox Committee's view that the Chinese had obtained \n     sensitive design information about U.S. thermonuclear \n     warheads is bolstered by the June 1999 report of the \n     President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, which states \n     that the ``walk-in'' document:\n       ``unquestionably contains some information that is still \n     highly sensitive, including descriptions, in varying degrees \n     of specificity, of the technical characteristics of seven \n     U.S. thermonuclear warheads.'' \\68\\\n       The preceding analysis shows that while there can be a \n     legitimate debate as to whether the conclusions of the AI \n     were stated with inordinate confidence, which may have \n     contributed to the FBI's decision to focus on the Lees and \n     the loss of the W-88 information, there can be no doubt that: \n     (1) the PRC obtained classified nuclear secrets through \n     espionage, and (2) the FBI had ample reason to investigate \n     Dr. Lee. The problem is that the FBI focused too narrowly on \n     the Lees as suspects in the W-88 investigation without \n     ascertaining whether their suspicions about Dr. Lee were \n     logically related to the alleged loss of the W-88 \n     information.\n       From 1996 until 1997 the DOE and FBI investigation was \n     characterized by additional inexplicable lapses. For example, \n     in November 1996, the FBI asked DOE counterintelligence team \n     leader Terry Craig for access to Dr. Lee's computer. Although \n     Mr. Craig apparently did not know it until 1999, Dr. Lee had \n     signed a consent-to-monitor waiver \\69\\ on April 19, 1995. \n     The relevant portion of the waiver states:\n       ``Warning: To protect the LAN [local area network] systems \n     from unauthorized use and to ensure that the systems are \n     functioning properly, activities on these systems are \n     monitored and recorded and subject to audit. Use of these \n     systems is expressed consent to such monitoring and \n     recording. Any unauthorized access or use of this LAN is \n     prohibited and could be subject to criminal and civil \n     penalties.'' \\70\\\n       For reasons that have yet to be explained, this waiver was \n     not in Dr. Lee's security file or his personnel file.\\71\\\n       The computer that Dr. Lee used apparently also had a \n     banner, which had information that may have constituted \n     sufficient notice to give the FBI access to its contents. \n     And, finally, LANL computer use policy gave authorities the \n     ability to search computers to prevent waste, fraud and \n     abuse.\\72\\ As noted in the press release accompanying the \n     August 12, 1999, Department of Energy Inspector General's \n     Report, Mr. Craig's ``failure to conduct a diligent search \n     deprived the FBI of relevant and potentially vital \n     information.'' \\73\\ Had the FBI National Security Law Unit \n     (NSLU) been given the opportunity to review these facts, it \n     may well have concluded that no FISA warrant was necessary to \n     conduct a preliminary investigation of Dr. Lee's computer. \n     More importantly, records from the DOE monitoring systems \n     like NADIR could almost certainly have been reviewed without \n     a FISA warrant. Had these records been searched, Dr. Lee's \n     unauthorized downloading would have been found nearly three \n     years earlier. Unfortunately, through the failures of both \n     DOE and FBI personnel, this critical information never \n     reached FBI Headquarters, and the NSLU decided that Dr. \n     Lee's computer could not be searched without a FISA \n     warrant.\\74\\ Thus, a critical opportunity was lost to find \n     and remove from an unsecure system, information that could \n     alter the global strategic balance.\n       Nonetheless, the FBI developed an adequate factual basis \n     for the issuance of a FISA warrant. The information developed \n     by the FBI to support its FISA application in 1997 was \n     cogently summarized in the August 5, 1999 special statement \n     of Senators Thompson and Lieberman of the Senate Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs \\75\\:\n       ``DOE counterintelligence and weapons experts had concluded \n     that there was a great probability that the W-88 information \n     had been compromised between 1984 and 1988 at the nuclear \n     weapons division of the Los Alamos laboratory. It was \n     standard PRC intelligence tradecraft to focus particularly \n     upon targeting and recruitment of ethnic Chinese living in \n     foreign countries (e.g., Chinese-Americans).\n       ``It is common in PRC intelligence tradecraft to use \n     academic delegations--rather than traditional intelligence \n     officers--to collect information on science-related topics. \n     It was, in fact, standard PRC intelligence tradecraft to use \n     scientific delegations to identify and target scientists \n     working at restricted United States facilities such as LANL, \n     since they ``have better access than PRC intelligence \n     personnel to scientists and other counterparts at the United \n     States National Laboratories.''\n       ``Sylvia Lee, wife of Wen Ho Lee, had extremely close \n     contacts with visiting Chinese scientific delegations. Sylvia \n     Lee, in fact, had volunteered to act as hostess for visiting \n     Chinese scientific delegations at LANL when such visits first \n     began in 1980, and had apparently had more extensive contacts \n     and closer relationships with these delegations than anyone \n     else at the laboratory. On one occasion, moreover, Wen-Ho Lee \n     had himself aggressively sought involvement with a visiting \n     Chinese scientific delegation, insisting upon acting as an \n     interpreter for the group despite his inability to perform \n     this function very effectively.\n       ``Sylvia Lee was involuntarily terminated at LANL during a \n     reduction-in-force in 1995. Her personnel file indicated \n     incidents of security violations and threats she allegedly \n     made against coworkers.\n       ``In 1986, Wen-Ho Lee and his wife traveled to China on \n     LANL business to deliver a paper on hydrodynamics \\76\\ to a \n     symposium in Beijing. He visited the Chinese laboratory--the \n     Institute for Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics \n     (IAPCM)--that designs the PRC's nuclear weapons.\n       ``The Lees visited the PRC--and IAPCM--on LANL business \n     again in 1988.\n       ``It was standard PRC intelligence tradecraft, when \n     targeting ethnic Chinese living overseas, to encourage travel \n     to the ``homeland''--particularly where visits to ancestral \n     villages and/or old family members could be arranged--as a \n     way of trying to dilute loyalty to other countries and \n     encouraging solidarity with the authorities in Beijing.\n       ``The Lees took vacation time to travel elsewhere in China \n     during their two trips to China in 1986 and 1988.\n       ``The FBI also learned of the Lees' purchase of unknown \n     goods or services from a travel agent in Hong Kong while on a \n     trip to that colony and to Taiwan in 1992. On the basis of \n     the record, the FBI determined that there was reason to \n     believe that this payment might have been for tickets for an \n     unreported side trip across the border into the PRC to \n     Beijing.\n       ``Though Wen-Ho Lee had visited IAPCM in both 1986 and 1988 \n     and had filed ``contact reports'' claiming to recount all of \n     the Chinese scientists he met there, he had failed to \n     disclose his relationship with the PRC scientist who visited \n     LANL in 1994.\n       ``Wen-Ho Lee worked on specialized computer codes at Los \n     Alamos--so-called ``legacy codes'' related to nuclear testing \n     data--that were a particular target for Chinese intelligence.\n       ``The FBI learned that during a visit to Los Alamos by \n     scientists from IAPCM, Lee had discussed certain unclassified \n     hydrodynamic computer codes with the Chinese delegation. It \n     was reported that Lee had helped the Chinese scientists with \n     their codes by providing software and calculations relating \n     to hydrodynamics.\n       ``In 1997, Lee had requested permission to hire a graduate \n     student, a Chinese national, to help him with work \n     on ``Lagrangian codes'' at LANL. When the FBI evaluated \n     this request, investigators were told by laboratory \n     officials that there was no such thing as an unclassified \n     Lagrangian code, which describes certain hydrodynamic \n     processes and are used to model some aspects of nuclear \n     weapons testing. ``In 1984, the FBI questioned Wen-Ho Lee \n     about his 1982 contact with a U.S. scientist at another \n     DOE nuclear weapons laboratory who was under \n     investigation. ``When questioned about this contact, Lee \n     gave deceptive answers. After offering further \n     explanations, Lee took a polygraph, claiming that he had \n     been concerned only with this other scientist's alleged \n     passing of unclassified information to a foreign \n     government against DOE and Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n     regulations--something that Lee himself admitted doing. \n     (As previously noted, the FBI closed this investigation of \n     Lee in 1984.) ``The FBI, as noted above, had begun another \n     investigation into Lee in the early 1990s, before the W-88 \n     design information compromise came\n\n[[Page S13799]]\n\n     to light. This investigation was based upon an FBI \n     investigative lead that Lee had provided significant \n     assistance to the PRC. ``The FBI obtained a copy of a note \n     on IAPCM letterhead dated 1987 listing three LANL reports \n     by their laboratory publication number. On this note, in \n     English, was a handwritten comment to `Linda' saying \n     `[t]he Deputy Director of this Institute asked [for] these \n     paper[s]. His name is Dr. Zheng Shaotang. Please check if \n     they are unclassified and send to them. Thanks a lot. \n     Sylvia Lee.' ''\n       The FBI request was worked into a draft FISA application by \n     Mr. David Ryan, a line attorney from the Department of \n     Justice's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR) \n     with considerable experience in FISA matters. It was then \n     reviewed by Mr. Allan Kornblum, as Deputy Counsel for \n     Intelligence Operations, and finally, by Mr. Gerald \n     Schroeder, Acting Counsel, OIPR.\\77\\ As is well known by now, \n     the OIPR did not agree to forward the FISA application, and \n     yet another opportunity to discover what Dr. Lee was up to \n     was lost.\n       The Department of Justice should have taken the FBI's \n     request for a FISA warrant on Dr. Lee to the Court on August \n     12, 1997.\n       Attorney General Reno testified about this case before the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee on June 8, 1999. A redacted \n     version of her testimony was released on December 21, 1999. \n     The transcript makes it clear that the Department of Justice \n     should have agreed to go forward with the search warrant for \n     surveillance of Dr. Wen Ho Lee under the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act when the FBI made the request in 1997.\n       The DOJ's internal review of the FISA request, conducted by \n     Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Bellows, confirms that the \n     request should have gone forward. Mr. Bellows said:\n       ``The final draft FISA application [deleted] on its face, \n     established probable cause to believe that Wen Ho Lee was an \n     agent of a foreign power, that is to say, a United States \n     Person currently engaged in clandestine intelligence \n     gathering activities for or on behalf of the PRC which \n     activities might involve violations of the criminal laws of \n     the United States and that his wife, Sylvia Lee, aided, \n     abetted or conspired in such activities. Given what the FBI \n     and OIPR knew at the time, it should have resulted in the \n     submission of a FISA application and the issuance of a FISA \n     order.'' \\78\\\n       In evaluating the sufficiency of the FBI's statement of \n     probable cause, the Attorney General and the Department of \n     Justice failed to follow the standards of the Supreme Court \n     of the United States that the requirements for ``domestic \n     surveillance may be less precise than that directed against \n     more conventional types of crime.'' In United States v. U.S. \n     District Court 407 U.S. 297, 322-23 (1972) the Court held:\n       ``We recognize that domestic security surveillance may \n     involve different policy and practical considerations from \n     the surveillance of ``ordinary crime'' . . . the focus of \n     domestic surveillance may be less precise than that directed \n     against more conventional types of crime. . . . Different \n     standards may be compatible with the Fourth Amendment if they \n     are reasonable both in relation to the legitimate need of \n     government for intelligence information and the protected \n     rights of our citizens. For the warrant application may vary \n     according to the governmental interest to be enforced and the \n     nature of citizen rights deserving protection.'' [emphasis \n     added]\n       Even where domestic surveillance is not involved, the \n     Supreme Court has held that the first focus is upon the \n     governmental interest involved in determining whether \n     constitutional standards are met. In Camera v. Municipal \n     Court of the City and County of San Francisco, 387 U.S. 523, \n     534-539, (1967), the Supreme Court said:\n       ``In cases in which the Fourth Amendment requires that a \n     warrant to search be obtained, ``probable cause'' is the \n     standard by which a particular decision to search is tested \n     against the constitutional mandate of reasonableness. To \n     apply this standard, it is obviously necessary first to focus \n     upon the governmental interest which allegedly justifies \n     official intrusion upon the constitutionally protected \n     interests of the private citizen. . . . [emphasis added]\n       ``Unfortunately, there can be no ready test for determining \n     reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search \n     against the invasion which the search entails. . . .\n       ``The warrant procedure is designed to guarantee that a \n     decision to search private property is justified by a \n     reasonable governmental interest. But reasonableness is still \n     the ultimate standard. If a valid public interest justifies \n     the intrusion contemplated, then there is probable cause to \n     issue a suitably restricted search warrant.''\n       Where the Court allowed inspections in Camera without \n     probable cause that a particular dwelling contained \n     violations, it is obvious that even more latitude would be \n     constitutionally permissible where national security is in \n     issue and millions of American lives may be at stake. Even \n     under the erroneous, unduly high standard applied by the \n     Department of Justice, however, the FBI's statement of \n     probable cause was sufficient to activate the FISA warrant.\n       FBI Director Freeh correctly concluded that probable cause \n     existed for the issuance of the FISA warrant. At the June 8 \n     hearing, Attorney General Reno stated her belief that there \n     had not been a sufficient showing of probable cause but \n     conceded that FBI Director Freeh, a former Federal judge, \n     concluded that probable cause existed as a matter of law.\\79\\\n       The Department of Justice applied a clearly erroneous \n     standard to determine whether probable cause existed. As \n     noted in the transcript of Attorney General Reno's testimony:\n       ``On 8-12-97 Mr. Allan Kornblum of OIPR advised that he \n     could not send our (the FBI) application forward for those \n     reasons. We had not shown that subjects were the ones who \n     passed the W-88 [design information] to the PRC, and we had \n     little to show that they were presently engaged \n     in clandestine intelligence activities.'' \\80\\\n       It is obviously not necessary to have a showing that the \n     subjects were the ones who passed W-88 design information to \n     the PRC. That would be the standard for establishing guilt at \n     a trial, which is a far higher standard than establishing \n     probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant. Attorney \n     General Reno contended that the remainder of the 12 \n     individuals identified in the AI would have to be ruled out \n     as the ones who passed W-88 design information to the PRC \n     before probable cause would be established for issuance of \n     the FISA warrant on Dr. Lee. That, again, is the standard for \n     conviction at trial instead of establishing probable cause \n     for the issuance of a search warrant. Thus, it is apparent \n     from the Kornblum statement that the wrong standard was \n     applied: ``that subjects were the ones that passed the W-88 \n     [design information] to the PRC.'' \\81\\\n       DOJ was also wrong when Mr. Kornblum concluded that: ``We \n     had little to show that they were presently engaged in \n     clandestine intelligence activities.'' \\82\\ There is \n     substantial evidence that Dr. Lee's relevant activities \n     continued from the 1980s to 1992, 1994 and 1997 as noted \n     above.\n       When FBI Assistant Director John Lewis met with Attorney \n     General Reno on August 20, 1997, to ask about the issuance of \n     the FISA warrant, Attorney General Reno delegated the matter \n     to Mr. Daniel Seikaly, former Director, DOJ Executive Office \n     for National Security, and she had nothing more to do with \n     the matter. Mr. Seikaly completed his review by late August \n     or early September and communicated his results to the FBI \n     through Mr. Kornblum. As Mr. Seikaly has testified, this was \n     the first time he had ever worked on a FISA request and he \n     was not ``a FISA expert.'' It was not surprising then that \n     Seikaly applied the wrong standard for a FISA application:\n       ``We can't do it (a FISA wiretap) unless there was probable \n     cause to believe that that facility, their home, is being \n     used or about to be used by them as agents of a foreign \n     power.'' \\83\\\n       Mr. Seikaly applied the standard from the typical criminal \n     warrant as opposed to a FISA warrant. 18 U.S.C. 2518, \n     governing criminal wiretaps, allows surveillance where there \n     is:\n       ``Probable cause for belief that the facilities from which, \n     or the place where, the wire, oral, or electronic \n     communications are to be intercepted, are being used, or are \n     about to be used in connection with the commission of such \n     offense.'' [emphasis added]\n       This criminal standard specifically requires that the \n     facility be used in the ``commission of such offense.'' FISA, \n     however, contains no such requirement. 50 U.S.C. 1805 \n     (Section 105 of FISA) states that a warrant shall be issued \n     if there is probable cause to believe that:\n       ``Each of the facilities or places at which the \n     electronic surveillance is directed is being used, or is \n     about to be used, by a foreign power or an agent of a \n     foreign power.''\n       There is no requirement in this FISA language that the \n     facility is being used in the commission of an offense. This \n     incorrect application of the law was a serious mistake. As \n     noted in the Bellows report, ``This matter should not have \n     been assigned to an attorney who did not already have a solid \n     grounding in FISA law, FISA applications, and the FISA \n     Court.'' \\84\\\n       Attorney General Reno demonstrated an unfamiliarity with \n     technical requirements of Section 1802 versus Section 1804. \n     She was questioned about the higher standard under 1802 than \n     1804: ``It seems the statutory scheme is a lot tougher on \n     1802 on its face.'' \\85\\\n       Attorney General Reno replied: ``Well I don't know. I've \n     got to make a finding that under 1804, that it satisfies the \n     requirement and criteria--and requirement of such application \n     as set forth in the chapter, and it's fairly detailed.'' \\86\\\n       When further questioned about her interpretation on 1802 \n     and 1804, Attorney General Reno indicated lack of familiarity \n     with these provisions, saying:\n       ``Since I did not address this, let me ask Ms. Townsend who \n     heads the office of policy review to address it for you in \n     this context and then I will. . . .'' \\87\\\n       As noted in the record, the offer to let Ms. Townsend \n     answer the question was rejected in the interest of getting \n     the Attorney General's view on this important matter rather \n     than that of a subordinate.\n       The lack of communication between the Attorney General and \n     the Director of the FBI on a matter of such grave importance \n     is troubling. As noted previously, Director Freeh sent John \n     Lewis, Assistant FBI Director for National Security to \n     discuss this matter with the Attorney General on August 20, \n     1996. However, when the request for a review of the matter \n     did not lead to the forwarding of the FISA application to the \n     court, Director Freeh did not further press the issue. And \n     Attorney General Reno conceded that she did not follow up on \n     the Wen Ho Lee matter. During the June 8 hearing, Senator \n     Sessions asked, ``Did your staff convey to you that they had \n     once again denied this matter?'' \\88\\\n\n[[Page S13800]]\n\n       Attorney General Reno replied, ``No, they had not.'' \\89\\\n       As the Bellows Report concludes, ``The failure to advise \n     the Attorney General of the resolution of this matter had an \n     unfortunate consequence: It effectively denied the FBI the \n     true appeal it had sought.'' \\90\\\n       The June 8, 1999 hearing also included a discussion as to \n     whether FBI Director Freeh should have personally brought the \n     matter again to Attorney General Reno. The Attorney General \n     replied that she did not ``complain'' about FBI Director \n     Freeh's not doing so and stated, ``I hold myself responsible \n     for it.'' \\91\\\n       Attorney General Reno conceded the seriousness of the case, \n     stating, ``I don't think the FBI had to convey to the \n     attorneys the seriousness of it. I think anytime you are \n     faced with facts like this it is extremely serious.'' \\92\\\n       In the context of this serious case, it would have been \n     expected that Attorney General Reno would have agreed with \n     FBI Director Freeh that the FISA warrant should have been \n     issued. In her testimony, she conceded that if some 300 lives \n     were at stake on a 747 she would take a chance, testifying: \n     ``My chance that I take if I illegally search somebody, if I \n     save 300 lives on a 747, I'd take it.'' \\93\\\n       In that context, with the potential for the PRC obtaining \n     U.S. secrets on nuclear warheads, putting at risk millions of \n     Americans, it would have been expected that the Attorney \n     General would find a balance in favor of moving forward with \n     the FISA warrant. As demonstrated by her testimony, Attorney \n     General Reno sought at every turn to minimize the FBI's \n     statement of probable cause. On the issue of Dr. Lee's \n     opportunity to have visited Beijing when he had been in Hong \n     Kong and incurred additional travel costs of the approximate \n     expense of traveling to Beijing, the Attorney General said \n     that ``an unexplained travel voucher in Hong Kong does not \n     lead me to the conclusion that someone went to Beijing any \n     more than they went to Taipei.'' \\94\\\n       It might well be reasonable for a fact-finder to conclude \n     that Dr. Lee did not go to Beijing; but, certainly, his \n     proximity to Beijing, the opportunity to visit there and his \n     inclination for having done so in the past would at least \n     provide some ``weight'' in assessing probable cause. But the \n     Attorney General dismissed those factors as having no weight \n     even on the issue of probable cause, testifying, ``I don't \n     find any weight when I don't know where the person went.'' \n     \\95\\ Of course it is not known ``where the person went.'' If \n     that fact had been established, it would have been beyond the \n     realm of ``probable cause.'' Such summary dismissal by the \n     Attorney General on a matter involving national security is \n     inappropriate given the circumstances. In other legal \n     contexts, opportunity and inclination are sufficient to cause \n     an inference of certain conduct as a matter of law.\n       The importance of DOJ's erroneous interpretation of the law \n     in this case, which resulted in the FISA rejection, should \n     not be underestimated. Had this application for a FISA \n     warrant been submitted to the court, it doubtless would have \n     been approved. DOJ officials reported that approximately 800 \n     FISA warrants were issued each year with no one remembering \n     any occasion when the court rejected an application.\n       Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Bellows concurred on the \n     damage done by OIPR's rejection of the FISA request:\n       ``OIPR's erroneous judgment that [deleted] did not contain \n     probable cause could not have been more consequential to the \n     investigation of Wen Ho Lee. From the beginning of that \n     investigation, the FBI's objective had been to obtain FISA \n     coverage. It now faced the prospect of no FISA coverage, an \n     eventuality for which it had never prepared. The other \n     consequence, of course, is that such information as might \n     have been acquired through FISA coverage was not acquired. It \n     is impossible to say just what the FBI would have learned \n     through FISA surveillance. That is, after all, the point of \n     surveillance. What is clear is that [deleted] should have \n     been approved, not rejected. For all the problems with the \n     FBI's counterintelligence investigation of Wen Ho Lee, and \n     they were considerable, the FBI had somehow managed to stitch \n     together an application that established probable cause. That \n     OIPR would disagree with the assessment would deal this \n     investigation a blow from which it would not recover.'' \\96\\\n       Had the FBI obtained the FISA search warrant, it might have \n     had a material effect on the investigation and criminal \n     charging of Dr. Lee. Given the serious mistakes that had been \n     made by the FBI prior to 1997, there is no guarantee that a \n     FISA warrant would have led to a successful conclusion to the \n     investigation, but the failure to issue a warrant clearly had \n     an adverse impact on the case.\n       To put the 1997 FISA rejection in perspective, consider \n     that the open network to which Dr. Lee had transferred the \n     legacy codes was ``linked to the Internet and e-mail, a \n     system that had been attacked several times by hackers.'' \n     \\97\\ Although we do not know the exact figures for the number \n     of times that it was accessed, it has been reported that \n     between October 1997 and June 1998 alone, ``there were more \n     than 300 foreign attacks on the Energy Department's \n     unclassified systems, where Mr. Lee had downloaded the \n     secrets of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.'' \\98\\\n       Consider also the following from a December 23, 1999, \n     Government filing in the criminal case against Dr. Lee:\n       ``. . . in 1997 Lee downloaded directly from the classified \n     system to a tenth portable computer tape a current nuclear \n     weapons design code and its auxiliary libraries and utility \n     codes.'' \\99\\\n       This direct downloading had been made possible by Los \n     Alamos computer managers who made Lee's file transfers \n     ``easier in the mid-1990s by putting a tape drive on Lee's \n     classified computer.'' \\100\\ As incomprehensible as it seems, \n     despite the fact that Dr. Lee was the prime suspect in an \n     ongoing espionage investigation, and despite plans to limit \n     his access to classified information to limit any damage \n     he might do, DOE computer personnel installed a tape drive \n     on his computer that made it possible for him to directly \n     download the nation's top nuclear secrets.\n       An important aim of surveillance under the FISA statute is \n     to determine whether foreign intelligence services are \n     getting access to our classified national security \n     information. Although we do not know, and may never know, why \n     Dr. Lee placed these classified files on an unsecure system, \n     there should be no doubt that transferring classified \n     information to an unclassified computer system and making \n     unauthorized tape copies of that information created a \n     substantial opportunity for foreign intelligence services to \n     access that information. The breakdown of communication \n     between the FBI and DOJ which resulted in the rejection of \n     the FISA in 1997 resulted in yet another missed opportunity \n     to find and protect the information Dr. Lee illegally put at \n     risk.\n       Certain provisions of the Counterintelligence Reform Act of \n     2000, which became law as Title VI of Public Law 106-567 on \n     December 27, 2000, will prevent the kinds of problems that \n     plagued this FISA request. The law now requires that, upon \n     written notification from the Director of the FBI (or of one \n     of the few other officials who are authorized to make FISA \n     requests), the Attorney General must explain in writing why \n     the Department does not believe that probable cause has been \n     established, and to make recommendations for improving the \n     request. When given such recommendations in writing, the \n     requesting official must personally supervise the \n     implementation of any such recommendations. These procedures \n     will ensure that disagreements over matters of probable cause \n     are resolved rather than allowed to linger, as happened in \n     the Wen Ho Lee case.\n     Investigation from August 12, 1997 to December 23, 1998\n       Notwithstanding the serious evidence against Dr. Lee on \n     matters of great national security importance, the FBI \n     investigation languished for 16 months, from August 1997 \n     until December 1998, with the Department of Energy permitting \n     Dr. Lee to continue on the job with access to classified \n     information.\n       After OIPR's August 1997 decision not to forward the FISA \n     application, FBI Director Louis Freeh met with Deputy Energy \n     Secretary Elizabeth Moler to tell her that there was no \n     longer any investigatory reason to keep Lee in place at LANL, \n     and that DOE should feel free to remove him in order to \n     protect against further disclosures of classified \n     information. In October 1997, Director Freeh delivered the \n     same message to Energy Secretary Federico Pena that he had \n     given to Moler.\\101\\ These warnings were not acted on, and \n     Dr. Lee was left in place, as were the files he had \n     downloaded to the unclassified system, accessible to any \n     hacker on the Internet.\n       After the rejection of the FISA warrant request on August \n     12, it took the FBI three and one-half months to send a memo \n     dated December 19, 1997, to the Albuquerque field office \n     listing fifteen investigative steps that should be taken to \n     move the investigation forward. The Albuquerque field office \n     did not respond directly until November 10, 1998. The fifteen \n     investigative steps were principally in response to the \n     concerns raised by OIPR about the previous FISA request. To \n     protect sources and methods, the specific investigative steps \n     in the December 19, 1997 teletype cannot be disclosed, but \n     have been summarized by the FBI as follows:\n       1. Conduct Additional Interviews\n       (a) Open preliminary inquiries on other individuals named \n     in the DOE AI who met critical criteria;\n       (b) Develop information on associate's background, and \n     interview the associate, and\n       (c) Interview co-workers, supervisors, and neighbors.\n       2. Conduct Physical Surveillance\n       3. Conduct Other Investigative Techniques\n       (a) Review information resulting from other investigative \n     methods;\n       (b) Review other investigations for lead purposes; and\n       (c) Implement alternative investigative methods.\\102\\\n       Only two of the leads were seriously pursued. Most \n     importantly, the FBI did not open investigations on the other \n     individuals named in the DOE AI until much later.\n       The False Flag\n       One of the steps recommended in the December 1997 HQ \n     investigative plan was carried out in August 1998. The \n     results of this ``False Flag'' operation against Dr. Lee are \n     partially described in a November 10, 1998 memorandum from \n     Albuquerque to FBIHQ. The memorandum is identified as a \n     request for electronic surveillance and lays out the basis \n     for probable cause, including a description of a series of \n     phone calls between Dr. Lee and an individual posing as an \n     officer of\n\n[[Page S13801]]\n\n     the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of State \n     Security. According to the memo, this undercover agent (UCA) \n     introduced himself to Dr. Lee ``as a representative of the \n     `concerned Department,' from Beijing, PRC,'' and explained \n     that the purpose of his visit to Sante Fe was to ``meet with \n     Wen Ho Lee to assure of Lee's well-being in the aftermath of \n     the conviction of a Chinese-American scientist, Peter Lee in \n     California.'' \\103\\\n       The Albuquerque memo describes Dr. Lee as being \n     ``skeptical of the entire situation and apprehensive about \n     meeting face-to-face with [the UCA]'' and relates how Dr. \n     Lee mentioned that ``departmental policy at LANL requires \n     him to report to his superior if he meets with a \n     representative of a foreign government, however, it does \n     not mean that he is forbidden to meet such a person.'' \n     \\104\\ Dr. Lee stated a preference for discussing any \n     matters with the representative of the PRC over the phone, \n     but when told that there were other sensitive issues \n     besides the Peter Lee case which must be discussed in \n     person, Dr. Lee agreed to meet the UCA at the Hilton \n     Hotel.\\105\\\n       About ten minutes after agreeing to travel to meet the UCA, \n     Dr. Lee called back and said he had changed his mind, \n     reiterating his concerns about registering with his superior \n     when meeting with foreign government officials. Given that \n     Dr. Lee would not agree to a face-to-face meeting, the UCA \n     said that ``although he was an official from the PRC \n     government, he was traveling under civilian status on this \n     trip so that he could avoid scrutiny by the United States \n     government.'' \\106\\ The UCA then asked Dr. Lee if he had been \n     interviewed by any U.S. authorities, including the FBI, and \n     whether Dr. Lee had noticed anything unusual or was being \n     treated differently by his employer or had any restrictions \n     on his travel arrangements in the wake of the Peter Lee case. \n     Dr. Lee responded negatively.\\107\\\n       The UCA then told Dr. Lee that one of the reasons he wanted \n     to meet was to see if there was any material to take back to \n     the PRC. After Dr. Lee said there was not any such material, \n     the UCA said that ``since the material he brought back to \n     China and the speech he gave were so helpful, did Lee have \n     any plans in going to the PRC in the near future.'' \\108\\ Dr. \n     Lee said that he would probably not be going to the PRC until \n     after his retirement from LANL in one or two years. He did \n     not, as one would expect, deny that he had previously sent \n     material.\n       The next day (August 19), the UCA called Dr. Lee again, \n     saying that he would be leaving Santa Fe in a few days and \n     asking if Dr. Lee would like to have a number where he could \n     contact the UCA in the future. Dr. Lee said he would like to \n     have a number, and was provided a pager number and was told \n     that it belonged to an American friend who had helped the UCA \n     and his associates in the past, and who could be \n     trusted.\\109\\\n       Dr. Lee did not immediately report this contact, but he \n     told his wife who told a friend, who told DOE security. When \n     Dr. Lee was questioned by DOE counterintelligence personnel \n     about the phone call, he was vague, and failed to mention the \n     beeper number or the hotel.\n       The FBI did not properly handle the information learned \n     from the False Flag operation. First, it took more than three \n     months for the transcript of the exchange between Dr. Lee and \n     the UCA to get to FBI Headquarters where it could be fully \n     analyzed. Unfortunately, the transcript (and the FISA request \n     based on the results of the False Flag) arrived at FBI HQ \n     just when the DOE was asserting control over the case. Had \n     the transcript been analyzed in the full detail that it \n     deserved, the FBI would have been able to tell the Office of \n     Intelligence Policy and Review that prior concerns about \n     whether Dr. Lee was ``currently engaged'' as an agent of a \n     foreign power had been addressed by his dealings with the \n     undercover agent. Among the key points that should have been \n     worked into the renewed FISA application are the following:\n       That Dr. Lee agreed to meet with an individual purporting \n     to be an agent of a foreign government, traveling in the U.S. \n     in civilian clothes to avoid detection by U.S. authorities. \n     Although Dr. Lee called back and canceled the face-to-face \n     meeting, he never reported to lab security personnel that he \n     had agreed to meet in the first place.\n       That Dr. Lee accepted the contact number of an individual \n     claiming to be an agent of a foreign power, yet failed to \n     disclose that fact to lab security officials about the \n     incident when asked about this contact. Dr. Lee apparently \n     admitted more of the details of the August phone \n     conversations when he was interviewed by FBI agents in \n     January 1999, but his failure to acknowledge this fact when \n     he spoke to Los Alamos officials in August 1998 continued a \n     pattern of incomplete disclosure from Dr. Lee.\n       That Dr. Lee asked questions during the conversation which \n     indicated a knowledge of PRC intelligence and scientific \n     organizations and the operational methods used by these \n     agencies.\n       None of these new items of information was sufficient, on \n     its own, to tip the balance of probable cause against Dr. \n     Lee. However, in the context of the other evidence that had \n     already been gathered by the FBI, these elements were \n     certainly relevant to a probable cause determination and \n     should have been relayed to OIPR for consideration. While the \n     FBI informally told OIPR of Dr. Lee's failure to fully report \n     the August contact, that conversation did not take place \n     until three months after the incident occurred. A proper and \n     timely interpretation of the False Flag operation would have \n     set the investigation on a very different course in late \n     1998. The Bellows Report supports the judgement that the \n     FBI's handling of the False Flag was inappropriate, and that \n     the information gained through the False Flag would have \n     added to a showing of probable cause necessary for a FISA \n     warrant.\n       Surreptitious Communications\n       The December 19, 1997 directive from FBI Headquarters also \n     revived an investigative issue that had come to the FBI's \n     attention in 1995, prior to the start of the Kindred Spirit \n     investigation. Among the 15 actions that FBI Headquarters \n     directed the Albuquerque office to take was a reinvestigation \n     of the possibility that Dr. Lee was engaging in clandestine \n     communications, using either a satellite system or Short \n     Range Agent Communications (SRAC).\n       As part of the 1994-1996 investigation of Dr. Lee, the FBI \n     had learned that Dr. Lee was reported to have installed a \n     satellite antenna near his home and was suspected of using it \n     to communicate surreptitiously. The case agents requested \n     assistance in investigating the possibility that Dr. Lee was \n     engaged in some sort of satellite communications, but the \n     request was summarily dismissed by the case manager at FBI \n     Headquarters, Supervisory Special Agent Craig Schmidt, and \n     the matter was not further pursued for nearly three years.\n       After the FISA request was rejected in 1997, in part \n     because the FBI had not been able to convince OIPR that Dr. \n     Lee was currently engaged in any clandestine activity, the \n     case manager's interest in the communications issue picked \n     up. In the December 19, 1997 communication to Albuquerque, he \n     directed the agents in the field to renew their investigation \n     of this matter, which they did with substantial vigor. For \n     several months during the summer of 1998, the Albuquerque \n     office collected information to determine whether or not Dr. \n     Lee was, in fact, engaged in some sort of clandestine \n     communication from his home.\n       The Albuquerque case agents, with the help of a technical \n     adviser who was brought in specifically for the purpose of \n     helping on this issue, formed a hypothesis that Dr. Lee was \n     communicating by satellite. They included this information, \n     and much of the supporting data, in the November 10, 1998 \n     request for a FISA warrant. The agents did not assert \n     conclusively that Dr. Lee was using SRAC or satellite \n     communications, but they explained their reasons for \n     believing that he might be doing so and requested help in \n     making a final determination about the significance of the \n     possible communications.\n       The FBI has subsequently concluded that the observed \n     phenomenon which originally led the Albuquerque case agents \n     to believe that Dr. Lee might be using SRAC was not linked to \n     any communication from Dr. Lee's house. The FBI's technical \n     analysis of this issue is thorough and convincing. On the \n     current state of the record, the phenomenon which led the FBI \n     to suspect that Dr. Lee was engaged in surreptitious \n     communications, while still unexplained, cannot be \n     conclusively linked to anything that was going on inside Dr. \n     Lee's house or on his property.\n       What is disturbing, however, is that the FBI did not even \n     begin this analysis until November 1999, shortly after the \n     November 3, 1999 closed hearing which focused heavily on this \n     issue. The case manager at FBI Headquarters who received the \n     November 10, 1998 FISA request from Albuquerque rejected the \n     new request, despite the fact that it contained new \n     information beyond what the FBI had felt was sufficient, in \n     1997, to get a FISA warrant. Outside the Albuquerque field \n     office, no one in the FBI made any real effort to \n     understand the data in the November 10, 1998 FISA request.\n       Even when the dynamics of the case changed after the FBI \n     concluded that Dr. Lee had not passed the December 23, 1998 \n     polygraph, and changed again when Dr. Lee failed an FBI \n     polygraph on February 10, 1999, no one in the FBI expressed \n     any interest in examining the possibility that there might be \n     something more to the SRAC issue than initially suspected. \n     The FBI still did not revisit the clandestine communications \n     issue after learning that Dr. Lee had been downloading \n     computer files and putting them on portable tapes. The notion \n     that there might be a link between the clandestine \n     communications and the portable tapes apparently never \n     occurred to the FBI, and no effort was made to investigate \n     the meaning of the strange electromagnetic phenomenon that \n     had led the FBI case agents to suspect that Dr. Lee was using \n     SRAC.\n       Instead of taking action on the new information, the case \n     manager sent back a cable on December 10, telling the case \n     agents that FBIHQ had reviewed the new FISA request and \n     determined that it did ``not yet contain the justification \n     necessary to successfully support a FISA Court application \n     for electronic surveillance,'' and recommended that \n     Albuquerque send copies of written reports from LANL's \n     Counterintelligence officer, Terry Craig, regarding Dr. Lee's \n     deception about the False Flag.\\110\\\n       On the merits, the failure to forward the FISA request to \n     OIPR is inexplicable. The FBI had felt since 1997 that they \n     had sufficient probable cause to get a FISA warrant. The 1998 \n     investigative steps yielded new information that directly \n     addressed the concerns OIPR had raised about the Lees being \n     currently engaged in clandestine activity,\n\n[[Page S13802]]\n\n     yet the FBI case manager summarily dismissed the new request, \n     failing to even forward it to OIPR for consideration. The \n     failure to take action when the dynamics of the case changed \n     in early 1999 is just incomprehensible.\n       When such serious national interests were involved in this \n     case, it was simply unacceptable for the FBI to tarry from \n     August 12, 1997 to December 19, 1997, to send the Albuquerque \n     field office a memo. It was equally unacceptable for the \n     Albuquerque field office to take from December 19, 1997 until \n     November 10, 1998 to respond to the guidance from \n     Headquarters, and then for the FBI not to renew the request \n     for a FISA warrant based on the additional evidence. The \n     FBI's handling of this issue is impossible to justify.\n     The December 23, 1998 Polygraph\n       When Dr. Lee returned to the United States from a three-\n     week trip to Taiwan in December 1998, he was administered a \n     polygraph examination on instructions from Mr. Ed Curran, \n     Director of DOE's Office of Counterintelligence (OCI). \n     Although Dr. Lee was initially thought to have passed the \n     polygraph with very high scores, his access to the X-Division \n     was temporarily suspended to give the FBI time to conclude \n     its investigation. When the polygraph results were examined \n     by the FBI in late January or early February 1999, it became \n     clear that Dr. Lee had not passed, and the investigation was \n     restarted, eventually leading to the dismissal of Dr. Lee \n     from LANL and, several months later, his indictment and \n     jailing.\n       The circumstances surrounding this December 1998 polygraph \n     are among the most important but least understood aspects of \n     the case. The June 1999 report of the President's Foreign \n     Intelligence Advisory Board raised questions about this issue \n     and recommended that the Attorney General determine, ``why \n     DOE, rather than the FBI, conducted the first polygraph in \n     this case when the case was an open FBI investigation. . . \n     .'' \\111\\ The subcommittee's investigation demonstrates that \n     the handling of the December 23, 1998 polygraph, or more \n     accurately the mishandling of this polygraph is one of the \n     most consequential errors of the Wen Ho Lee matter. To \n     understand the impact of the polygraph on the case, it is \n     necessary to review: 1) the events leading up to and the \n     reasons for the December 23, 1998 polygraph; 2) the results \n     of that polygraph; and 3) the effect on the investigation of \n     the erroneous polygraph reading by Wackenhut. The short \n     answer is that: 1) DOE jumped into the case in a heavy handed \n     way during late 1998 in an effort to avoid criticism related \n     to the upcoming release of the Cox Committee report, 2) the \n     Wackenhut examiners' incorrect conclusion that Dr. Lee passed \n     the polygraph prompted the FBI to nearly shut down its \n     investigation of Dr. Lee, 3) with the result that during the \n     time he supposedly was denied access to the X-Division, Dr. \n     Lee was able to return and recover the tapes that are now \n     missing. Given the vast number of mistakes that had already \n     been made prior to December 1998, and the number that were \n     made thereafter, it would be wishful thinking to believe that \n     a correct reading of the polygraph would have led to a \n     successful conclusion in this case, but Wackenhut's erroneous \n     initial interpretation of the results and the long delay in \n     getting the charts passed to FBIHQ for review put the case on \n     a downward spiral from which it almost never recovered. \n     Because these issues are both highly important and widely \n     misunderstood, each is examined in some detail.\n       The events leading up to the December 23, 1998 Polygraph\n       As noted previously, the FBI's investigation of Dr. Lee had \n     been dealt a severe blow in August 1997 when DOJ's Office of \n     Intelligence Policy and Review rejected the FISA request. The \n     local case agents spent most of 1998 trying to get the \n     investigation back on track, but were not notably successful. \n     By November 1998, the newly appointed lead case agent was \n     ready to move forward and sent a new request for FISA \n     coverage to FBI HQ. Unfortunately, the request fell on deaf \n     ears for reasons that will be explored more fully below.\n       At approximately the same time the case agents were seeking \n     FISA coverage, Dr. Lee asked for permission to travel to \n     Taiwan to visit a company called Asiatek. According to an FBI \n     document describing this request, Dr. Lee said that ``Asiatek \n     invited him to visit Taiwan in December 1998 to give a \n     presentation in exchange for his airfare.'' \\112\\ When Dr. \n     Lee submitted a request to travel under these terms, the LANL \n     Internal Security section denied it, so Dr. Lee reportedly \n     traveled at his own expense to visit an ailing sister.\\113\\\n       While the Internal Security section was correct to deny Dr. \n     Lee's request to let Asiatek pay his travel expenses, the \n     request should have set off alarm bells within both DOE and \n     the FBI. The aforementioned FBI document says:\n       ``Asiatek is a Taiwan-based company founded in 1985 which \n     introduced state-of-the art information technology to both \n     China and Taiwan. The company works with both private \n     industry and Taiwan government research facilities such as \n     the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology \n     (administered by the Ministry of National Defense). Asiatek \n     specializes in information technology, program planning and \n     management, business process re-engineering, integrated \n     logistic support, and continuous acquisition and life cycle \n     support environmental planning and implementation. Asiatek \n     also develops cannon and tank systems.'' \\114\\\n       The fact that the prime suspect in a major espionage \n     investigation was asking to travel out of the country for the \n     second time in less than nine months, with his travel to be \n     paid for by a foreign company, should have been a call to \n     action by someone in DOE or the FBI. The local case agent \n     sent a message to FBIHQ asking that this information be \n     considered ``in conjunction with Albuquerque Division's \n     request for FISA/MISUR coverage of Wen-Ho Lee,'' \\115\\ but \n     the case manager did not act on it.\n       If the travel alone was not sufficient to compel the FBI \n     and/or DOE to take some positive steps to regain control over \n     the case, the nature of the work performed by Asiatek and its \n     relationship to the Chung Shan Institute of Science and \n     Technology should have been because these matters related \n     directly to concerns that had been raised about Dr. Lee \n     during the course of the investigation. When asked why Dr. \n     Lee was allowed to travel under these circumstances, Mr. \n     Curran replied that ``FBI personnel were running the \n     investigation and were the ones that allowed Dr. Lee to \n     travel to Taiwan. If it were my decision, I would not have \n     allowed Mr. Lee to leave the country.'' \\116\\\n       Mr. Curran's statement on the travel issue reflects a \n     larger problem that plagued the Kindred Spirit investigation \n     from beginning to end, namely the systemic breakdown of \n     effective communication between DOE and the FBI on matters of \n     great importance.\\117\\ If Mr. Curran was opposed to letting \n     Dr. Lee go to Taiwan, he should have said something. As \n     Director of DOE's OCI, his opinion clearly had weight. He did \n     not act, so Dr. Lee went to Taiwan.\n       As another example of ineffective communication on \n     important issues, consider Mr. Curran's statement that he \n     first learned on December 15, 1998, that Director Freeh had \n     recommended removing Dr. Lee from access more than a year \n     before.\\118\\ Mr. Curran assumed his position as Director of \n     OCI in April 1998 and immediately conducted a 90-day review \n     of the CI program at DOE as mandated by PDD-61. He received \n     what he describes as a ``summary briefing on the Kindred \n     Spirit investigation.'' He was aware of the False Flag that \n     was run in August and wanted to ``get the case moving and to \n     resolve the issues of the possible loss of sensitive \n     information,'' but the fact that the FBI had recommended that \n     Dr. Lee's access to classified information be pulled was \n     apparently not shared with Mr. Curran until mid-December \n     1998, while Dr. Lee was in Taiwan.\\119\\ It should be noted, \n     however, that Mr. Curran told the DOE IG that he learned \n     about Director Freeh's 1997 comments on moving Dr. Lee in \n     October 1998, two months before he finally took action.\\120\\ \n     This is significant because it undermines Mr. Curran's \n     assertion that the reason he acted in December 1998 was \n     because he had just learned of Director Freeh's 1997 \n     recommendations.\n       That the Director of DOE's Office of Counterintelligence \n     was not informed (or did not make himself aware) of the FBI's \n     view that Dr. Lee should be pulled from access reflects \n     poorly on the DOE and the FBI. How could anyone brief this \n     case to Mr. Curran in 1998 without mentioning that the \n     Director of the FBI had twice told DOE's top leadership that \n     Dr. Lee's access to classified information should be removed? \n     What would one say, when briefing the new head of \n     counterintelligence, that would not somehow convey the \n     message that the FBI was concerned about the potential damage \n     from keeping him in access? And how could the top \n     counterintelligence officer in the DOE not inquire as to \n     whether consideration had been given to reducing the risk \n     posed by an individual who was the chief suspect in a major \n     espionage investigation? This lack of communication defies \n     comprehension.\n       The Counterintelligence Reform Act of 2000 will prevent \n     such disasters in the future. The Act requires the Director \n     of the FBI to notify appropriate officials, in writing, when \n     a full field investigation is started in an espionage case, \n     and to present to the head of the affected agency a written \n     assessment of the potential impact of the actions of that \n     agency or department on an FBI counterintelligence \n     investigation. It will not be possible in future \n     investigations for the head of counterintelligence in an \n     agency to claim ignorance of an FBI recommendation regarding \n     a suspect's access to classified information. And the FBI \n     will have to ensure that its coordination with the affected \n     agency is both close and continuous, so that when new \n     officials come into decision-making roles, they will be fully \n     informed as to the important aspects of pending cases. The \n     FBI/DOE polygraph disaster in the Wen Ho Lee case should be \n     the last such calamity.\n       The interim report issued in March 2000 touched briefly on \n     the polygraph issue, prompting a letter from Mr. Curran,\\121\\ \n     who provided the following account of the events leading up \n     to the polygraph:\n       ``Every detail of this case was coordinated between DOE and \n     the FBI. I personally wanted the FBI to do the interview \n     rather than DOE, but they stated that they were not ready to \n     interview him because they first wanted to interview some \n     neighbors and associates of Mr. Lee. DOE had been asking the \n     FBI to bring this case to a conclusion since the [false flag] \n     in August. I did not believe I had the luxury of waiting any \n     longer since the investigative activity in August and this \n     was Mr. Lee's first opportunity to leave the U.S. I was very \n     concerned as to what he would do and say on his trip to \n     Taiwan and then what he would do upon his return. Since\n\n[[Page S13803]]\n\n     the FBI was not going to interview Mr. Lee and bring this \n     case to a conclusion prior to his departure to Taiwan, I made \n     the decision, with the Secretary's approval, to remove Mr. \n     Lee from access upon his return from Taiwan and until the FBI \n     could conclude their investigation through interview and \n     polygraph.\n       ``Mr. Lee returned from Taiwan on December 23, 1998. He was \n     interviewed and removed from access and asked to take a \n     polygraph. The FBI was aware that if Mr. Lee refused to take \n     a DOE polygraph, his security clearance would have been \n     removed and steps taken to terminate his employment; if Mr. \n     Lee agreed to take the test and failed, his clearance would \n     be removed and termination proceedings would be initiated. \n     This activity was completely coordinated with the FBIAQ. On \n     December 21, 1998, a memo was furnished to the Secretary of \n     Energy from me setting forth the above scenario. Mr. Lee took \n     the polygraph test and representatives from FBIAQ were \n     present.'' \\122\\\n       In subsequent correspondence with the subcommittee, Mr. \n     Curran elaborated on his reasons for removing Dr. Lee's \n     access in December 1998. Responding to follow-up questions \n     from a September 27, 2000 subcommittee hearing, Mr. Curran \n     cited four reasons for his decision to remove Dr. Lee from \n     access in December 1998: ``(1) the fact that the FBI no \n     longer required Lee be kept in access, (2) my discomfort at \n     the extent of Dr. Lee's access, which was greater than I had \n     originally thought, (3) the fact that the FBI's false flag \n     operation had been unsuccessful, possibly alerting Lee to the \n     investigation, and (4) the fact that Lee was then traveling \n     in Taiwan, thus able to travel easily to Hong Kong or the \n     People's Republic of China without our knowledge.'' \\123\\\n       While Mr. Curran's account explains what happened, it does \n     not adequately explain why these events took place. It was \n     simply inconsistent for DOE to allow Dr. Lee to travel to \n     Taiwan, yet polygraph him and pull his access to classified \n     information upon his return, even though he supposedly passed \n     the polygraph. If Dr. Lee was such a threat that he needed to \n     be polygraphed and removed from access, why was he allowed to \n     go to Taiwan? And if he passed the polygraph after returning \n     from Taiwan, including specific questions about espionage, \n     why was there still a need to remove his access?\n       Mr. Curran's explanation for the series of events leading \n     up to the December 1998 polygraph shows an investigation that \n     was, at best, disjointed and poorly coordinated (despite Mr. \n     Curran's assertions to the contrary). Consider, for example, \n     that the FBI agent who took over the case on November 6, \n     1998, did not agree with the DOE decision to have Wackenhut \n     \\124\\ give Dr. Lee a polygraph examination, and has called it \n     ``irresponsible.'' According to FBI protocol, Dr. Lee would \n     have been questioned as part of a post-travel interview. \n     However, as Mr. Curran noted, the case agents were \n     inexplicably unprepared to conduct such an interview and the \n     Special Agent in Charge (SAC) in Albuquerque agreed to go \n     ahead with the polygraph at Mr. Curran's request. The lead \n     case agent requested a new FISA in November 1998, but \n     Supervisory Special Agent Craig Schmidt the same FBI case \n     manager at headquarters who had put together an action plan \n     in December 1997 trying to get the investigation back on \n     track had suddenly gotten cold feet on the matter, casually \n     rejecting the FISA request without even showing OIPR a \n     written product. DOE was exercised enough about Dr. Lee that \n     Ed Curran wanted to give Dr. Lee a polygraph and pull his \n     access to classified information (something the FBI had \n     recommended 14 months prior), but was not willing to stop him \n     from traveling to Taiwan. The case was a mess, and then it \n     got worse.\n       The disagreement between FBI and DOE over how best to \n     proceed in late 1998 only partially explains why the \n     investigation lurched forward with FBI seemingly in charge \n     one moment (letting Dr. Lee travel to Taiwan, contrary to Mr. \n     Curran's preference) and Mr. Curran prevailing the next \n     (getting the Albuquerque SAC to overrule the lead case agent \n     on the polygraph question). Other testimony and documents \n     provided to the subcommittee paint a more complete and \n     markedly different picture of the events surrounding the \n     polygraph of Dr. Lee on December 23, 1998. Unfortunately, the \n     picture they paint is one of DOE trying desperately to \n     protect its image from the revelations it expected to come \n     with the release of the Cox Committee report, with the FBI \n     going along, and neither agency focusing on the national \n     security implications of their actions.\n       To understand the context in which these decisions were \n     being made, consider that the Cox Committee was taking \n     testimony in mid-December, and that key portions of the \n     testimony centered on security at the national labs. The \n     atmosphere leading up to the Cox Committee hearings has been \n     described as follows:\n       ``With impeachment as a backdrop, allegations that the \n     Clinton administration was allowing China easy access to \n     American secrets collided with charges that China's military \n     had funneled money into Democratic coffers. The New York \n     Times reported that the daughter of a senior Chinese military \n     officer was giving money to Democrats while also working to \n     acquire sensitive American technology.\n       ``Republicans, opening a new front against a beleaguered \n     president, created a House select committee, headed by \n     Representative Cox, to investigate whether the government was \n     compromising technology secrets by letting American companies \n     work too closely with China's rocket industry. With its \n     deadline approaching, the committee stumbled on the W-88 \n     case.\n       ``Mr. Trulock became a star witness, and committee members \n     were riveted by his testimony. C.I.A. analysts who testified \n     before the committee agreed there was espionage, people who \n     heard the secret proceedings said, but were more equivocal \n     about its value to China.'' \\125\\\n       The Mr. Trulock referenced above is Notra Trulock, former \n     DOE intelligence chief. According to a DOE chronology, the \n     Cox Committee was briefed by DOE on November 12, 1998 and \n     again on December 7. On December 16, Mr. Curran, Mr. Trulock \n     and the Director of the DOE's Office of Intelligence, Mr. \n     Lawrence Sanchez, testified again before the Cox \n     Committee.\\126\\ Describing the impact of his testimony to the \n     House panel, Mr. Trulock told the subcommittee on September \n     27, 2000 that ``after our initial appearance and particularly \n     our second appearance before the Cox Committee in December of \n     1998, there was a high level of agitation within the Office \n     of Counterintelligence on the part of Mr. Sanchez and within \n     the political appointees at the department.'' \\127\\ Mr. \n     Trulock further testified:\n       ``it is certainly not a coincidence that after the FBI \n     provided the information to the Cox Committee on Dr. Lee and \n     other espionage cases within the Department of Energy that \n     for the first time in almost two years, DOE management became \n     energized about addressing the advice we had received from \n     Director Freeh in August of 1997.'' \\128\\\n       Mr. Trulock's testimony is supported by documentary \n     evidence and testimony from other witnesses. A December 18, \n     1998, memorandum from the FBI's Assistant Director for \n     National Security, Neil Gallagher, says that Secretary \n     Richardson would be calling Director Freeh about the Lee \n     investigation on December 21, 1998. The memorandum explains \n     that DOE counterintelligence personnel wanted to ``neutralize \n     their employee's access to classified information prior to \n     the issuance of a final report by the Cox Committee.'' When \n     questioned on this point Mr. Curran acknowledged that the \n     conversation mentioned in the memo had taken place, but \n     denied any connection between DOE's desire to polygraph \n     Dr. Lee and the release of the Cox Committee report.\\130\\\n       Mr. Curran's account of these events is contradicted by \n     testimony from other individuals who were also directly \n     involved. When Director Freeh testified before the Senate \n     Select Committee on Intelligence on May 19, 1999, he told the \n     committee:\n       ``DOE was seeking to establish grounds to terminate Mr. Lee \n     in December of 1998, and they went forward with their \n     polygraph and interview with that objective. We, at that \n     point, wanted more time to prepare for a confrontational \n     interview which in these kinds of cases is the most important \n     interview.'' \\131\\\n       Other FBI files from this period support the contention \n     that Secretary Richardson wanted Dr. Lee fired in early 1999. \n     A January 21 memo from FBI Supervisory Special Agent C. H. \n     Middleton to Deputy Assistant Director Horan said that ``DOE \n     is anxious to avoid criticism about the case. It removed the \n     subject's access to classified information on 12/23/98. DOE \n     wants to fire the subject, but may not have justification to \n     do so at this time.'' \\132\\\n       None of the information the government had in its \n     possession at that point would have justified a decision to \n     fire Dr. Lee, but firing him would have allowed Secretary \n     Richardson to avoid criticism that the DOE had not taken \n     action on a major espionage case. Director Freeh's comments \n     are further buttressed by statements that two security \n     personnel made to the DOE Inspector General during an \n     investigation of the decision-making process related to Dr. \n     Lee's clearance and access. The former Director of LANL's \n     Internal Security Division, Mr. Ken Schiffer, told the IG \n     that he first heard Dr. Lee's name on December 21, 1998, in a \n     conference call with two individuals from the Office of \n     Counterintelligence, one of whom told him that ``the \n     Secretary wanted Mr. Lee to be fired.'' \\133\\ Mr. Richard \n     Schlimme, the Counterintelligence Program Manager in the \n     Albuquerque office, told the DOE IG that he had been on \n     annual leave on December 21, 1998, when he was called to come \n     in to work to deal with the Wen Ho Lee situation. When he \n     arrived, Mr. Schlimme was told that ``Secretary Richardson \n     wanted immediate action, so Mr. Curran decided to interview \n     Mr. Lee immediately.'' \\134\\ Further, according to Mr. \n     Schlimme, ``Mr. Curran wanted Mr. Lee removed from the \n     laboratory regardless of how he did on the polygraph.'' \\135\\\n       In addition to the evidence described above, the \n     subcommittee has a sworn deposition from the case manager at \n     FBI Headquarters, Supervisory Agent Craig Schmidt, who said \n     he had very little control over the investigation in December \n     1998 because the ``Department of Energy was becoming more and \n     more concerned about how they would appear and how they were \n     appearing during the [Cox] committee meetings,'' \\136\\ In \n     the context of all the evidence to the contrary, Mr. \n     Curran's assertion that the decision to act with regard to \n     Dr. Lee had nothing to do with the imminent release of the \n     Cox Committee report is not persuasive.\n       Incorrect reading of the December 23, 1998 polygraph\n       The subcommittee focused very intently on the question of \n     whether Dr. Lee passed or failed the December 23, 1998 \n     polygraph for\n\n[[Page S13804]]\n\n     three reasons: (1) the erroneous reading changed the course \n     of the investigation, prompting the FBI to nearly close down \n     its investigation at a time when the scrutiny of Dr. Lee \n     should have been increasing, (2) it took an inordinate amount \n     of time to discover that the initial reading of the polygraph \n     was wrong, and (3) the public perception that Dr. Lee really \n     passed the test but the FBI somehow later reversed that \n     finding is incorrect.\n       The consequences of the incorrect interpretation of the \n     December 23, 1998 polygraph are the subject of the next \n     section of this report. The remainder of this section will \n     address the matter of the delay in getting the charts to the \n     FBI and the question of whether Dr. Lee actually passed or \n     failed this test.\n       The initial interpretation of the test was made by Wolfgang \n     Vinskey, a Senior Polygraph Examiner with Wackenhut, a \n     private firm that had a contract with DOE to conduct \n     polygraphs. Mr. Vinskey wrote that he had administered ``a \n     DOE Counterintelligence Scope PDD Examination'' to Dr. Lee, \n     and concluded that ``this person was not deceptive when \n     answering the relevant questions pertaining to involvement in \n     espionage, unauthorized disclosure of classified information \n     and unauthorized foreign contacts.'' \\137\\ Mr. John Mata, \n     Manager of DOE's AAAP Test Center, reviewed the exam and \n     concurred with Mr. Vinskey that ``upon completion of testing, \n     the Examinee was not deceptive when answering the relevant \n     questions. . . .'' \\138\\ Mr. Mata followed up the initial \n     report with a more detailed memorandum on December 28, 1998, \n     in which he reiterated to Mr. Curran the information that had \n     been in the December 23 polygraph report, namely that ``data \n     analysis of this examination disclosed sufficient \n     physiological criteria to opine Mr. Lee was not deceptive \n     when answering'' the relevant questions.\\139\\\n       After the exam, the two FBI agents who were on hand were \n     briefed on the results of the test. There is a December 21, \n     1999 memorandum for the record written by John Mata which \n     describes how the test results were relayed to the FBI.\\140\\ \n     Mr. Mata says that he told the lead case agent that the \n     charts did not show significant reaction on three of the \n     questions, but that ``a plus 3 on the fourth question \n     (relating to having knowledge of anyone he knew who had \n     committed espionage against the United States) was \n     close.'' \\141\\ Mr. Mata told the agent that Dr. Lee ``had \n     disclosed information during the examination that he had \n     not previously reported regarding an approach that was \n     made to him on his recent or a past trip,'' and gave her a \n     sheet of paper containing the data analyses.\\142\\ \n     According to Mr. Mata, the agent wrote down the questions \n     from the exam and asked ``if further processing involved \n     the charts being reviewed by their polygraph examiner \n     (specific reference to Roger Black) . . .'' to which he \n     said no.'' \\143\\ Mr. Mata's memo also says that at no time \n     [on that date] was he asked to provide the charts or any \n     allied data from the test to the FBI.\n       During the first week of January, Mr. Mata's memo \n     continues, the entire polygraph package (charts, questions, \n     data analysis sheets and video tape) were sent to OCI \n     Polygraph Program Manager David Renzleman in Richland, \n     Washington. In mid-January, Mr. Mata got a call from Mr. \n     Renzleman instructing him to provide the local FBI with \n     everything generated by the polygraph, which he did.\n       An undated Quality Assurance record of this examination, \n     prepared by David Renzleman contains the following comments:\n       ``This test was initially classified and consequently DOE \n     OCI did not get to see the collected charts or video tape \n     recording until late January 1999.\n       ``When the charts were subjected to the OCI QC [Quality \n     Control] process, the initial NDI [No Deception Indicated] \n     opinion could not be duplicated or substantiated.\n       ``The Test Center Manager was advised of these QC concerns \n     and was requested to send the charts to the Department of \n     Defense Polygraph Institute (DODPI) which he did.\n       ``DODPI advised the Test Center Manager that they could not \n     duplicate or support the NDI opinion of this test.'' \\144\\\n       In the ``QC Opinion'' section of the report, Mr. Renzleman \n     said, ``I am unable to render an opinion pertaining to the \n     truthfulness of the examinee's answers to the relevant \n     questions of this test. Additional testing is recommended.'' \n     \\145\\\n       When the charts and videotape were subsequently analyzed by \n     FBI polygraph experts in late January or early February, they \n     concluded that Dr. Lee had failed relevant questions \\146\\ or \n     was, at best, inconclusive.\\147\\ Based on these concerns, the \n     FBI arranged for additional interviews and a new polygraph on \n     February 10, 1999. In addition to learning on this date that \n     Dr. Lee had reactivated his computer account simply by \n     calling up the help desk and asking that it be restored,\\148\\ \n     the FBI concluded Dr. Lee failed the February polygraph and \n     increased its investigative activity, but by then the chances \n     of salvaging the investigation were slipping away.\n       There remains a serious question about the chain of events \n     which led to the delayed discovery that Dr. Lee did not pass \n     the December 1998 polygraph. A February 26, 1999 memorandum \n     from William Lueckenhoff, Assistant Special Agent in Charge \n     in Albuquerque, says:\n       ``The FBI personnel present immediately requested the \n     polygraph charts and documentation to the polygraph in order \n     to have it reviewed by FBIHQ. DOE's initial response to this \n     request, as per Ed Curran, DOE Counterintelligence Office, \n     was not to allow the FBI access to the tapes and charts, only \n     the numerical results of the polygraph.'' \\149\\\n       As is discussed elsewhere in this report, Dr. Lee did not \n     pass the polygraph, and no one other than the initial \n     reviewers have been able to interpret the charts to say that \n     he did pass. Given that the charts clearly show that Dr. Lee \n     did not pass, any effort to prevent their release to the FBI \n     would be a serious matter. Where DOE was concerned about \n     criticism because it was being accused before the Cox \n     Committee of not taking action on the case, a failed \n     polygraph would tend to prove the critic's point. However, a \n     passed polygraph, followed by an investigation which cleared \n     Dr. Lee of the W-88 allegations yet later resulted in his \n     firing for unrelated security violations would show that \n     DOE's critics were wrong about the W-88 investigation, but \n     that DOE was serious about security anyway and ultimately \n     removed Dr. Lee because he was a security risk. In these \n     circumstances, any shenanigans with the polygraph charts \n     would be extremely serious.\n       Mr. Curran strongly denies the allegation in Mr. \n     Lueckenhoff's memo and DOE documents indicate that Mr. Curran \n     was instrumental in getting the full record of the polygraph \n     into the FBI's hands in January, 1999.\\150\\\n       When pressed for an explanation of the February 26, 1999 \n     memo blaming Mr. Curran for the delay in getting the test \n     results, the FBI took the position that the memo was only a \n     blind memorandum not intended to capture official witness \n     statements.\\151\\ That does not explain why Assistant Special \n     Agent in Charge William Lueckenhoff would attribute such \n     remarks to Mr. Curran if he had no factual basis to do so.\n       Mr. Lueckenhoff's account is consistent with what actually \n     happened, but the FBI is no longer willing to stand by the \n     February 1999 memo. It is also possible that by February 26, \n     1999, after Dr. Lee had failed an FBI polygraph, Albuquerque \n     realized that its failure to obtain the charts in a timely \n     fashion (and the creation of the disastrous January 22 memo \n     clearing Dr. Lee on the W-88 matter) would eventually be \n     questioned. Saying that the FBI tried to get the charts but \n     had been denied by Mr. Curran would provide an excuse for the \n     Albuquerque division's abysmal performance in early \n     1999. Because the FBI will not stand by the version of \n     events in the February 1999 memo, it is not possible to \n     know what really happened. Instead, the FBI's position has \n     the effect--intended or not--of making it next to \n     impossible to assign responsibility for giving Dr. Lee \n     more than a month to regain access to his computer and his \n     office, enabling him to delete the incriminating evidence \n     from his computer and destroy the now-missing tapes.\n       The FBI deserves substantial criticism for its handling of \n     this investigation, but the record should be set straight on \n     the result of the December 23, 1998 polygraph. On this \n     matter, the FBI was correct--Dr. Lee did not pass the \n     polygraph test.\n       One of the earliest and most sustained attacks on the FBI's \n     reading of the December 1998 polygraph came from Dr. Lee's \n     defense team. After Dr. Lee was held without bail at the end \n     of 1999, defense attorney Mark Holscher claimed that Dr. \n     Lee's scores on the 1998 test had been `` `off the charts'' \n     in indicating truthfulness.'' \\152\\ It is a common defense \n     tactic to take evidence that might be harmful to the \n     defendant's position and deal with it up front, trying to put \n     a positive spin on it. Mr. Holscher's comments that Dr. Lee's \n     scores were off the charts in indicating truthfulness would \n     certainly fit into that pattern--taking on an issue that \n     might have to be dealt with if the case went to trial and \n     getting a positive interpretation planted in the public's \n     mind, to include the potential jury pool. As the negotiations \n     between the defense and the government went forward, Mr. \n     Holscher continued to press the polygraph issue, claiming \n     that Dr. Lee had passed the only test that had been properly \n     administered, and suggesting that the FBI was wrong to claim \n     that Dr. Lee had failed either exam. Mr. Holscher's \n     statements on the polygraph are exactly what one would expect \n     a defense lawyer to do, but they have created the incorrect \n     impression that the Wackenhut examiners were right and the \n     FBI was wrong.\n       Mr. Holscher and Dr. Lee's supporters got help on this \n     score from a story by CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson. The \n     February 2000 news report, titled ``Wen Ho Lee's Problematic \n     Polygraph,'' claimed that ``three experts gave the nuclear \n     scientist passing scores but the FBI later reversed the \n     findings. CBS investigation fuels argument that he was a \n     scapegoat.'' \\153\\\n       Ms. Attkisson asked precisely the right question, ``. . . \n     how could the exact same charts be legitimately interpreted \n     as `passing' and also `failing?' '' \\154\\ To answer this \n     question, CBS reached out to Richard Keifer, who was then the \n     chairman of the American Polygraph Association. Mr. Keifer \n     was also a former FBI agent who had run the FBI's polygraph \n     program. The CBS report continues:\n       ``Keifer says, ``There are never enough variables to cause \n     one person to say (a polygraph subject is) deceptive, and one \n     to say he's non-deceptive . . . there should never be that \n     kind of discrepancy on the evaluation of the same chart.''\n       ``As to how it happened in the Wen Ho Lee case, Keifer \n     thinks, ``then somebody is making an error.''\n\n[[Page S13805]]\n\n       ``We asked Keifer to look at Lee's polygraph scores. He \n     said the scores are ``crystal clear.'' In fact, Keifer says, \n     in all his years as a polygrapher, he had never been able to \n     score anyone so high on the non-deceptive scale. He was at a \n     loss to find any explanation for how the FBI could deem the \n     polygraph scores as ``failing.''\n       . . . Since Lee was never charged with espionage (only \n     computer security violations), the content of the polygraph \n     may be unimportant to his case. But the fact that his scores \n     apparently morphed from passing to failing fuels the argument \n     of those who claim the government was looking for a \n     scapegoat--someone to blame for the alleged theft of masses \n     of American top secret nuclear weapons information by China--\n     and that Lee conveniently filled that role.'' \\155\\\n       The CBS report gave the clear impression that the Wackenhut \n     examiners were correct. Rather than take on the issue, the \n     FBI simply told CBS ``it would be `bad' to talk about Lee's \n     polygraph, and that the case [would] be handled in the \n     courts.'' \\156\\ The case never went to trial, and the FBI \n     never got the chance to explain its interpretation of the \n     exam. The result has been that there are lingering doubts as \n     to whether the polygraph is a reliable tool, and whether it \n     was misused by the FBI in the Wen Ho Lee case.\n       When the case of FBI Special Agent Robert Hanssen broke in \n     February 2001, FBI Director Louis Freeh ordered, among other \n     things, an expanded use of the polygraph within the FBI for \n     counterintelligence purposes. The Judiciary Committee held a \n     hearing on the utility of polygraphs in law enforcement and \n     counterintelligence cases, and heard from a distinguished \n     panel with witnesses offering opinions on both sides of the \n     issue. With the matter of Wen Ho Lee's polygraph still \n     unresolved, two of the witnesses were asked to review the \n     results of the December 23, 1998 polygraph and answer a \n     series of questions that would address the same concern that \n     CBS had raised--how can the same charts be interpreted as \n     both passing and failing?\n       Dr. Michael H. Capps, currently Deputy Director for \n     Developmental Programs at the Defense Security Service and \n     formerly head of DOD's Polygraph Institute, reviewed the \n     polygraph data and said that he could ``render no opinion \n     regarding whether or not deception is indicated. . . .'' \n     \\157\\ Mr. Capps went on to describe how he had evaluated the \n     exam with and without the aid of the John Hopkins algorithm, \n     which is designed to provide a statistical analysis using a \n     mathematical model to render a probability of deception. He \n     noted that ``there are what I believe to be substantial \n     differences in the scores my evaluation produced and those of \n     the Wackenhut examiner. . . . I cannot account for the \n     differences between my results and those of the Wackenhut \n     examiners.'' \\158\\\n       In response to a direct question about how different \n     examiners could reach substantially different conclusions, \n     Mr. Capps said, ``One would expect two properly trained \n     examiners evaluating the same data to draw a similar, but not \n     necessarily identical conclusion. This was not the case when \n     comparing my evaluation with that of the Wackenhut examiner. \n     I cannot account for the differences.'' \\159\\\n       One possible explanation for the differing opinions on the \n     polygraph is that the questions were improperly structured, \n     making the entire test invalid because the control questions \n     and the relevant questions were not sufficiently distinct to \n     permit an accurate differentiation of the responses to each. \n     When Dr. Capps was asked about the appropriateness of the \n     questions, he faulted two of the comparison questions used in \n     the exam and said ``these comparison questions were not \n     sufficiently distinct from the relevant questions so as to \n     generate a useful basis of comparison.'' \\160\\\n       Mr. Richard Keifer was also asked to evaluate the December \n     23, 1998 exam in light of his comments to CBS. He provided a \n     detailed analysis and critique of the test and reported:\n       ``My review of the polygraph examination of Wen Ho Lee \n     determined the results to be inconclusive. . . . It is my \n     opinion this examination was not set up, conducted and \n     reviewed using well-established procedures for counter-\n     intelligence polygraph testing. This lack of experience in \n     Foreign Counter-Intelligence polygraph testing contributed to \n     an incorrect decision, an unacceptable delay in the decision \n     making process, and negated the potential of fully uncovering \n     the truth with a timely posttest interrogation.'' \\161\\\n       Mr. Keifer further noted that ``I have reviewed these \n     charts at least a dozen times and have done so under every \n     favorable assumption I could make and I have never found this \n     examination to be non-deceptive.'' \\162\\\n       When asked to evaluate the test itself, which was not a \n     standard set of questions but one that was created \n     specifically for the examination of Dr. Lee, Mr. Keifer said \n     that ``the fundamental problem with this examination was in \n     question formulation.'' He then took issue with both the \n     relevant questions and the control questions.\\163\\ This \n     finding is consistent with the concerns raised by Dr. Capps, \n     as well as by FBI examiners who noted that Dr. Lee appeared \n     to be reacting to all the questions, control and relevant. \n     The structure of the questions used in the test is important \n     because a polygraph is designed to measure differences \n     between a subject's responses to control questions, which \n     should generate little or no reaction, and the relevant \n     questions where a substantial response is meaningful. Control \n     questions that produce a reaction have the effect of \n     minimizing the differences between the reactions to control \n     questions and relevant questions, thereby rendering the \n     test less useful.\n       Mr. Keifer also commented on his CBS appearance:\n       ``I was quoted out of context and I felt it was deliberate. \n     I had numerous telephonic conversations with Attkisson prior \n     to the taped interview. She was fully briefed regarding \n     polygraph procedures. I clearly and fully explained to her \n     several times that the ``scores'' of the examiners were high \n     on the non-deceptive side, but that subsequent testing and \n     admissions indicated Lee was in fact deceptive. During the \n     course of our conversations she suggested cover up and \n     misconduct of various officials in the matter. Unfortunately, \n     during the taped interview she asked only about the \n     ``scores'' and did not provide an opportunity for me to \n     clarify. In my opinion this was deliberate, and the piece was \n     manipulated to suggest wrongdoing by the government. Once I \n     saw the piece, I called officials at the Energy Department \n     and the FBI to clarify the matter.'' \\164\\\n       The subcommittee's review of the matter shows that Dr. Lee \n     definitely did not pass the December 23, 1998 exam. The best \n     that anyone other than the initial examiners has been able to \n     justify is an ``inconclusive'' or ``no opinion'' rating. It \n     is important that no one has been able to substantiate the \n     ``no deception indicated'' finding because any other result \n     even a ``no opinion''--would have put the investigation on a \n     completely different track. Instead, the government quit \n     looking at Dr. Lee at the precise moment when it should have \n     been looking most intently at his activities.\n       The Consequences of DOE's Interference in the Investigation\n       Ordinarily, the decision to polygraph an individual or to \n     remove his access to the classified X-Division spaces would \n     have only limited ramifications. In the Wen Ho Lee case, \n     however, the incorrect handling of the polygraph issue was \n     one of the most consequential mistakes in the entire \n     investigation, likely costing the government an opportunity \n     to recover the tapes that ultimately led to Dr. Lee's \n     indictment and conviction, and creating much angst about the \n     fate of the nuclear secrets on those tapes. In a June 28, \n     2001 letter, Assistant Attorney General Daniel J. Bryant \n     confirmed that ``Dr. Lee has told the debriefing team that on \n     December 23, 1998, the computer tapes at issue in the \n     indictment were in his X-Division office at the Los Alamos \n     National Laboratory.'' \\165\\\n       In other words, the tapes containing the ``crown jewels'' \n     of American's nuclear secrets, that could ``change the global \n     strategic balance,'' were sitting in Dr. Lee's X-Division \n     office and could have been recovered by the government if the \n     DOE had not gone into the panic mode and put political \n     considerations ahead of national security concerns when it \n     became concerned about what the Cox Committee report would \n     say. The FBI, especially the Albuquerque SAC, bear equal \n     responsibility for this turn of events for allowing it to \n     happen.\n       One of the most fundamental tenets of counterintelligence \n     work is that when you spook a suspect, you watch him. The \n     suspect's reaction to unexpected events, whether planned (as \n     when the FBI decides to confront a suspect in a hostile \n     interview) or driven by unanticipated events (like DOE's \n     decision to interview, polygraph and change Dr. Lee's \n     classified access for no reason that he would know about), is \n     a critical element of any counterintelligence investigation. \n     Success often depends on observing and correctly interpreting \n     that reaction. Even if the suspect does not show any apparent \n     reaction in the presence of investigators, it is imperative \n     that he be watched to see what he does when he thinks he \n     isn't being watched. People with problems react differently \n     than people who don't have anything to worry about. Failure \n     to maintain proper surveillance under these circumstances can \n     lead to the loss of the best opportunity to find out what is \n     really going on. In the Wen Ho Lee, it cost a lot more than \n     that.\n       Dr. Lee was definitely spooked by the interview and \n     polygraph on December 23. According to an FBI chronology, the \n     polygraph was completed at 2:18 p.m. and he was told at about \n     5:00 p.m. that his access to secure areas of X-Division and \n     to both his secure and open X-Division computer accounts had \n     been suspended. At 9:36 p.m., Dr. Lee made four attempts to \n     enter the secure area of X-Division through a stairwell. At \n     9:39 p.m., he tried again through the south elevator.\\166\\ At \n     3:31 a.m. on Christmas Eve, Dr. Lee again tried to gain \n     access to the X-Division. Had the FBI maintained proper \n     surveillance, they would have known that Dr. Lee was making \n     these desperate attempts to get back into the X-Division. \n     Surely that would have been a clue that further investigation \n     was necessary. Had the case been handled properly, FBI or DOE \n     personnel could have done what Dr. Lee eventually did--just \n     walk into the X-Division and pick up the tapes. Instead of \n     destroying them, as Dr. Lee says he did, government officials \n     could have properly secured these tapes containing the crown \n     jewels of America's nuclear secrets.\n       In a December 24 meeting, Dr. Lee was told ``that he was \n     being transferred from X-Division to T-Division for thirty \n     days to allow time for the FBI to complete their inquiry.'' \n     \\167\\ If there had ever been any doubt in his mind as to \n     whether he was under an FBI investigation, this comment from \n     DOE removed that doubt. His conduct over the next\n\n[[Page S13806]]\n\n     few days shows clearly that he was worried about the \n     government's sudden interest in him and the fact that his \n     access to the X-Division had been removed. All told, Dr. Lee \n     tried to get back into his X-Division office almost twenty \n     times between the December 23 polygraph and the February 10 \n     exam. Had the FBI and DOE been watching, they might have \n     wondered why Dr. Lee wanted to get back into the X-Division \n     so desperately, and they might have gone there to look.\n       It should be noted that not all of the blame for the FBI's \n     lack of interest in Dr. Lee's conduct after the polygraph can \n     be placed on the incorrect interpretation of the polygraph \n     results. Even if one takes the position that the FBI thought \n     that Dr. Lee had passed the polygraph, there is no excuse for \n     completely dropping an investigation solely on the basis of a \n     passed polygraph, especially when DOE and the case agents \n     were told that during the pre-polygraph interview Dr. Lee had \n     admitted foreign contact that he had not previously reported. \n     The FBI should have continued the investigation on the basis \n     of that revelation, regardless of the polygraph exam. A \n     review of the transcript from the March 7, 1999 interview of \n     Dr. Lee shows that the FBI focused very heavily on that \n     unreported contact. If it was worth investigating in March, \n     it should have been worth investigating the previous \n     December.\n       DOE's answer as to why it failed to monitor Dr. Lee after \n     the December 23, 1998 polygraph is both baffling and \n     informative. DOE's Ed Curran said that ``since the FBI was \n     conducting the investigation of Dr. Lee, it was responsible \n     for determining the level of monitoring necessary.'' \\168\\ \n     All available evidence indicates that the impetus for the \n     polygraph clearly came from within DOE, and that the FBI \n     agreed to this at the insistence of DOE, yet DOE washed its \n     hands of any responsibility for determining whether the \n     polygraph provoked a response from Dr. Lee. Consider also \n     that the catalog of Dr. Lee's attempts to get back into the \n     X-Division was culled from information under DOE's control, \n     information that the FBI did not have access to unless the \n     DOE gave it to them. Under these circumstances, it is not \n     surprising that Dr. Lee's attempts to get back into the X-\n     Division almost immediately after his access was pulled went \n     undetected until much later. The FBI says that it did not \n     learn of Dr. Lee's attempts to reenter the X-Division until \n     March 13, 2000.\\169\\\n       The almost complete breakdown in the surveillance of Dr. \n     Lee had severe consequences. As the FBI later learned, \n     ``within one hour of reactivation [of his computer account], \n     he immediately deleted three files, including one which was \n     named after the graduate student who had worked for him in \n     1997.'' \\170\\ In late January, he began erasing the \n     classified files from the unsecure area of the computer. \n     After he was interviewed by the FBI on January 17, Dr. Lee \n     ``began a sequence of massive file deletions . . .'' \\171\\ He \n     even called the help desk at the Los Alamos computer center \n     to get instructions for deleting files. After he \n     was interviewed and polygraphed again on February 10, \n     within two hours of the time he was told he had failed the \n     exam, he deleted even more files. All told, Dr. Lee \n     deleted files on January 20th, February 9th, 10th, 11th, \n     12th, and 17th. When he called the help desk on January \n     22nd, his question indicated that he did not know that the \n     ``delay'' function of the computer he was using would keep \n     deleted files in the directory for some period of time. He \n     asked why, when he deleted files, were the ones in \n     parentheses not going away, and asked how to make them go \n     away immediately. He also asked, on February 16, how to \n     replace an entire file on a tape.\\172\\\n       Thus, the report that Dr. Lee had passed the December 23 \n     polygraph gave Dr. Lee precious time to delete and secrete \n     information. The significance of Dr. Lee's file deletions and \n     the unreasonable delays in carrying out the investigation \n     that should have detected and prevented them should not be \n     underestimated. As FBI Agent Robert Messemer has testified, \n     the FBI came very close, ``within literally days, of having \n     lost that material.'' \\173\\ The FBI was almost unable to \n     prove that Dr. Lee downloaded classified files. If the \n     material had been overwritten after it was deleted, ``that \n     deletion by Dr. Lee [would] have kept that forever from this \n     investigation.'' In this context, the repeated delays, the \n     lack of coordination between the FBI and the Department of \n     Energy, and later between the FBI and the Department of \n     Justice, are much more serious.\n     February 10, 1999 to March 8, 1999\n       On February 10, 1999, Wen Ho Lee was again given a \n     polygraph examination, this time by the FBI. During this \n     second test, which Lee failed, he was asked: ``Have you ever \n     given any of [a particular type of classified computer code \n     related to nuclear weapons testing] to any unauthorized \n     person?'' and ``Have you ever passed W-88 information to any \n     unauthorized person?'' \\174\\ It should be noted that the 1997 \n     FISA request mentioned that the PRC was using certain \n     computational codes, which were later identified as something \n     Lee had unique access to. \\175\\ Moreover, the computer code \n     information had been developed independently of the DOE \n     Administrative Inquiry which was subsequently questioned by \n     FBI and DOJ officials.\n       After this second failed polygraph, there should have been \n     no doubt that Dr. Lee was aware he was a suspect in an \n     espionage investigation, and it is inconceivable that neither \n     the FBI nor DOE personnel took the rudimentary steps of \n     checking to see if he was engaging in any unusual computer \n     activity. Again, this is not hindsight. The classified \n     information to which Dr. Lee had access, and which he had \n     been asked about in the polygraph, was located on the Los \n     Alamos computer system. The failure of DOE and FBI \n     officials to promptly find out what was happening with Dr. \n     Lee's computer after he was deceptive on the code-related \n     polygraph question is inexplicable. As noted above, this \n     failure afforded Dr. Lee yet another opportunity to erase \n     files from both the unsecure system and the unauthorized \n     tapes he had made.\n       As should have been expected, Dr. Lee used the time \n     afforded him by the delays to delete the classified \n     information he had placed on the unclassified system, and to \n     retrieve and dispose of the now-missing tapes. According to \n     press reports, Dr. Lee was allowed to return to the X-\n     Division in January 1999 by an unwitting security office. On \n     other occasions, he walked in behind division employees. In \n     fact, he apparently managed to slip in though an open door \n     just hours after he was barred from X-Division.\\176\\ He also \n     approached two other T-Division employees with a request to \n     use their tape drive to delete classified data from two tapes \n     (he no longer had access to the one that had been installed \n     in his X-Division computer since he had been moved from that \n     division in December 1998).\n       Nearly three weeks after the polygraph failure, the FBI \n     finally asked for and received permission to search Lee's \n     office and his office computer, whereupon they began to \n     discover evidence of his unauthorized and unlawful computer \n     activities. Even so, the FBI did not immediately move to \n     request a search warrant. The three week delay, from February \n     10 until the first week of March, is inexplicable.\n       The long hiatus in moving the case forward seems to have \n     been broken primarily by the impending release of a story on \n     the W-88 case by the New York Times, after which the case was \n     once again moved from the national security track onto the \n     political track. Upon learning of the New York Times story, \n     government officials asked that it be delayed for several \n     weeks, ``saying they were preparing to confront their \n     suspect.'' \\177\\ It is almost incomprehensible that the FBI \n     was still not ready, in March 1999, to interview Dr. Lee. The \n     same argument had been made in December 1998 when the DOE \n     wanted to polygraph Dr. Lee, so there is absolutely no reason \n     that the necessary preparations could not have been made in \n     the interim.\n       The reporters did not know Dr. Lee's identity, but the FBI \n     said they worried that he might recognize himself from \n     details in the article as if he was not already aware that \n     the FBI was investigating him after having been polygraphed \n     and having his access to classified information suspended \n     since December, having been interviewed by the FBI in \n     January, having been asked to take another polygraph in \n     February.\n       The FBI interviewed Dr. Lee on March 5, and the New York \n     Times published its story the next day, ``China Stole Nuclear \n     secrets for Bombs, U.S. Aides Say.'' Prompted to move by the \n     breaking story, the FBI interviewed Dr. Lee again on Sunday, \n     March 7. It was during this interview that one of the case \n     agents, at the suggestion of Albuquerque SAC Kitchen, asked \n     Dr. Lee if he had heard of the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, \n     the couple who had been executed for providing nuclear \n     secrets to the Soviet Union. The reference to the Rosenberg \n     case, after threats that Dr. Lee would lose his job, be \n     handcuffed and thrown in jail, was over the top, creating the \n     inference that the FBI was trying to scare Dr. Lee into a \n     confession. According to a transcript of the interview:\n       ``Do you know who the Rosenbergs are?'' [the agent] asked.\n       ``I heard of them, yeah, I heard them mention,'' Dr. Lee \n     said.\n       ``The Rosenbergs are the only people that never cooperated \n     with the federal government in an espionage case,'' she said. \n     ``You know what happened to them? They electrocuted them, Wen \n     Ho.''\\178\\\n       FBI Director Freeh later acknowledged that this reference \n     to the Rosenbergs was inappropriate, but he denied that the \n     FBI ever attempted to coerce a confession from Dr. Lee.\\179\\\n       One day after the FBI's confrontational interview, Dr. Lee \n     was dismissed from Los Alamos. Former LANL \n     Counterintelligence chief Robert Vrooman, has suggested that \n     the leaking of Dr. Lee's name to the press had an adverse \n     impact not only on Dr. Lee but also on the integrity of the \n     investigation into how the Chinese obtained U.S. nuclear \n     secrets,\\180\\ but the investigation was already in deep \n     trouble before Dr. Lee's name became public.\n     Reopening the W-88 Investigation\n       Before turning to the criminal case against Dr. Lee, it is \n     appropriate to make a comment about the status of the \n     investigation into the loss of the W-88 information, the \n     matter at the heart of the DOE's AI and the FBI's \n     investigation from 1996 to 1999. The September 1999 decision \n     by the FBI and the DOJ to expand the investigation of \n     suspected Chinese nuclear espionage \\181\\ is puzzling, \n     primarily because it should have happened long ago.\n       In an October 1, 1999 letter, Attorney General Reno and FBI \n     Director Freeh explained the rationale for reopening the \n     case:\n       ``Our decision to take this action in regard to the \n     investigation into the compromise of U.S. nuclear technology \n     is the result of two separate inquiries. First, there were \n     investigative concerns raised by the FBI Albuquerque field \n     office that began to develop in\n\n[[Page S13807]]\n\n     November, 1998, regarding deficiencies in the DOE \n     Administrative Inquiry. Second, after questions were raised \n     by Senate Governmental Affairs Committee staff, we started to \n     re-examine flawed analysis in the conclusions drawn in the \n     DOE Administrative Inquiry.''\\182\\\n       This letter is significant on several fronts. First, it \n     represents the beginning of a top level assault within DOJ \n     and FBI on the AI as an explanation for why the W-88 \n     investigation had been bungled. The reference to concerns in \n     the Albuquerque office in November 1998 is misleading all--of \n     the documents coming out of Albuquerque in 1998 were focused \n     on getting FISA coverage on Dr. Lee. The documents did \n     contain acknowledgment that somewhere in the neighborhood of \n     250 personnel per year had access to the W-88 information, \n     which was more than had been previously believed, but the \n     case agent nevertheless pressed for a FISA. It is simply not \n     accurate to portray the November 1998 documents as raising \n     questions about the AI as a basis for investigating Dr. Lee.\n       Subsequent documents from Albuquerque did raise concerns \n     about the AI. One of the worst in this regard is the January \n     22, 1999 memorandum which essentially clears Dr. Lee. It \n     says:\n       ``A review of the pertinent questions asked in the \n     [December 23, 1998] polygraph exam showed that Lee did not \n     pass classified information to a foreign intelligence \n     service. The polygraph charts and other documentation \n     relating to the examination were made available to FBI AQ by \n     DOE on 01/22/1999 . . .''\\183\\\n       In a section titled ``SAC ANALYSIS'' David Kitchen wrote \n     that ``based on FBI AQ's investigation it does not appear \n     that\n       Lee is the individual responsible for passing the W-88 \n     information.'' At that point, FBI-AQ had done remarkably \n     little investigation. The lead case agent had requested a \n     FISA in November 1998, but had been overruled. By December, \n     the DOE jumped into the investigation in response to the Cox \n     Committee hearings and gave Dr. Lee a polygraph. Based on \n     nothing more than a supposedly passed polygraph--the results \n     of which Albuquerque received on the same day it was writing \n     the memo and could not have--analyzed and an interview on \n     January 17 (during which, according to Director Freeh, Dr. \n     Lee provided new information about his relationships with \n     Chinese scientists), the SAC Kitchen was prepared to shut \n     down the investigation. This is nothing short of outrageous.\n       Was it mere coincidence that in his ``Dr. Lee's not guilty \n     memo'' Kitchen took aim at the AI, which contained the very \n     allegations that were the subject of testimony before the Cox \n     Committee? The January 22, 1999 memo does not even address \n     the allegations, from 1994, that Dr. Lee had helped the \n     Chinese with codes and software, yet Mr. Kitchen is prepared \n     to shut down the investigation. Any comments from Mr. Kitchen \n     regarding flaws in the Administrative Inquiry must be viewed \n     in the context of the Albuquerque division's bungling of the \n     Kindred Spirit investigation.\n       Another significant result of the decision to reopen the W-\n     88 investigation, and to do so based on the supposedly faulty \n     analysis in the AI, has been to put FBI Assistant Director \n     Neil Gallagher on the spot based on his testimony to \n     Congress. In a November 10, 1999 letter on the question of \n     why the investigation was reopened, he acknowledged that when \n     discussing the DOE's Administrative Inquiry (AI) during his \n     June 9, 1999, testimony before the Governmental Affairs \n     Committee,\\185\\ he stated that he ``had full credibility in \n     the report,'' had ``found nothing in DOE's AI, nor the \n     conclusions drawn from it to be erroneous,'' and stated there \n     is a ``compelling case made in the AI to warrant focusing on \n     Los Alamos.'' \\186\\\n       As a result of further inquiry, however, Mr. Gallagher now \n     has reason to question the conclusions of the AI. He cites an \n     August 20, 1999, interview by FBI officials of one of the \n     scientists who participated in the technical portion of the \n     AI, in which the scientist ``stated that he had expressed a \n     dissenting opinion with respect to the technical aspects of \n     the AI,'' and points out that the statement of this scientist \n     is ``in direct conflict with the AI submitted to the FBI \n     because the AI does not reflect any dissension by the `DOE \n     Nuclear Weapons Experts.' '' \\187\\\n       A General Accounting Office investigation of Mr. \n     Gallagher's comments regarding the AI later concluded that \n     his testimony had been inaccurate and misleading because he \n     had ample opportunity to know and should have known that \n     documents created by the Albuquerque office of the FBI raised \n     questions about the FBI in late 1998 and early 1999.\\188\\\n       In his November 1999 letter, Mr. Gallagher could also have \n     mentioned the draft of the July 9, 1999 document prepared by \n     the Albuquerque division, ``Changed: FBI-DOE National \n     Laboratory Assessment. . . .'' Had he done so, he would have \n     reported that:\n       ``Albuquerque is of the firm opinion that the AI should \n     have been used only for investigative assistance during the \n     initial portion of the 'Kindred Spirit' inquiry, and that a \n     more in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the relevant \n     issues/facts should have been continued through the course of \n     the investigation.'' \\189\\\n       A subsequent draft of the same document lists half a dozen \n     reasons why the AI was flawed. The document says that the \n     espionage could have been done by a network of sources, the \n     travel analysis was incomplete, the strategic opinions were \n     preliminary, there had been a disagreement over the extent of \n     the W-88 information compromise, the Lees had been doing \n     things at the behest of the Government, and finally, ``. . . \n     the AI was extremely confusing and self contradictory in \n     reporting its conclusions . . .'' \\190\\\n       This is a classic case of too little too late, and it \n     raises questions as to whether the FBI's assault on the AI \n     was intended to get an investigation back on track or to \n     spread the blame for a bungled investigation.\n       The delay by DOJ and the FBI until September 1999 is \n     perplexing since five governmental reports had concluded, \n     with varying degrees of specificity, that the losses of \n     classified information extended beyond W-88 design \n     information and beyond Los Alamos:\n       (1) the classified version of the Cox Report (January \n     1999);\n       (2) the April 21, 1999 damage assessment by Mr. Robert \n     Walpole, the National Intelligence Officer for Strategic and \n     Nuclear Programs; \\191\\\n       (3) the unclassified version of the Cox Committee Report \n     (May 25, 1999);\n       (4) the Special Report of the President's Foreign \n     Intelligence Advisory Board (June 1999); and\n       (5) the Special Statement by Senators Thompson and \n     Lieberman (August 5, 1999)\n       All of these reports gave FBI and DOJ ample evidence that \n     further investigation was necessary. For example, the Cox \n     Committee report states flatly that ``the PRC stole \n     classified information on every currently deployed U.S. \n     inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM) and submarine-\n     launched ballistic missile (SLBM).\\192\\ Tellingly, the Cox \n     Committee notes that ``a Department of Energy investigation \n     of the loss of technical information about the other five \n     U.S. thermonuclear warheads had not begun as of January 3, \n     1999 . . .'' and that ``the FBI had not yet initiated an \n     investigation'' as of that date.\\193\\ Thus, the failure to \n     reopen the investigation into the loss of W-88 design \n     information much sooner, or to even initiate an investigation \n     of the other losses, simply continued that pattern of errors.\n     The Prosecution of Dr. Lee\n       Two weeks \\194\\ after Dr. Lee was fired from LANL, \n     investigators discovered a notebook in his X-Division office \n     containing a one-page computer-generated document showing the \n     files in the ``kf1'' directory Dr. Lee had created on the \n     unclassified portion of common file system.\\195\\ When it was \n     discovered that many of these files were highly classified, \n     the FBI began a criminal investigation of Dr. Lee which led \n     to his indictment, arrest and pretrial incarceration \n     beginning on December 10, 1999.\n       Almost from the moment Dr. Lee was taken into custody, his \n     attorneys protested the strict conditions of confinement and \n     worked to secure his release under some combination of home \n     detention and electronic monitoring. Judge James Parker, who \n     presided over much of the case, repeatedly urged the \n     government to relax the conditions of confinement, but the \n     government steadfastly argued against releasing Dr. Lee, even \n     under strict monitoring, until September 13, 2000. On that \n     date, the government entered into a plea agreement with \n     Dr. Lee under which he would plead guilty to a single \n     felony count of mishandling government secrets and go free \n     immediately in exchange for a promise to explain what \n     happened to the missing tapes.\n       FBI Director Louis Freeh issued a statement on September \n     13, 2000, explaining the government's decision to reach the \n     plea agreement. In relevant part, the statement said:\n       ``In this case, as has often happened in the past, national \n     security and criminal justice needs intersect. In some cases, \n     prosecution must be foregone in favor of national security \n     interests. In this case, both are served.\n       ``As the government indicated previously, the indictment \n     followed an extensive effort to locate any evidence that the \n     missing tapes were in fact destroyed, and repeated requests \n     to Dr. Lee for specific information and proof establishing \n     what did or did not happen to the nuclear weapons data on \n     these tapes. None was forthcoming. The indictment followed \n     substantial evidence that the tapes were clandestinely made \n     and removed from Los Alamos but no evidence or assistance \n     that resolved the missing tape dilemma. . . .\n       ``The obligation that rests on the government is first and \n     foremost to determine where the classified nuclear weapons \n     information went and if it was given to others or destroyed. \n     This simple agreement, in the end, provides the opportunity \n     of getting this information where otherwise none may exist.'' \n     \\196\\\n       But the sudden reversal of the government's position \n     flabbergasted Judge Parker. During the hearing to finalize \n     the plea agreement, he commented from the bench:\n       ``I would like to know why the government argued so \n     vehemently that Dr. Lee's release earlier would have been an \n     extreme danger to the government when at this time he, under \n     the agreement, will be released without any restrictions.'' \n     \\197\\\n       At a later point in the hearing, the judge continued:\n       ``What I believe remains unanswered is the question: What \n     was the government's motive in insisting on your being jailed \n     pretrial under extraordinarily onerous conditions of \n     confinement until today, when the Executive\n\n[[Page S13808]]\n\n     Branch agrees that you may be set free essentially \n     unrestricted? This makes no sense to me.'' \\198\\\n       The judge was not alone in being puzzled by the \n     government's handling of the criminal phase of the case. It \n     is difficult to reconcile the lack of forceful action between \n     the time the government discovered, in June 1999 at the \n     latest, that the tapes had been created, with its December \n     1999 claims that the only way to safeguard the secrets on the \n     tapes was to hold Dr. Lee virtually incommunicado. As will be \n     discussed later in this report, the information on the tapes \n     was extremely sensitive, but it does not necessarily follow \n     that the pretrial confinement conditions the government \n     demanded represent the only way to protect that information. \n     If it was the government's judgement that protecting the \n     information required extraordinary restrictions on Dr. Lee, \n     then why not act as soon as the existence of the tapes was \n     known? \\199\\ Moreover, if the government was willing, in \n     September 2000, to accept Dr. Lee's sworn statement as to the \n     disposition of the tapes (to be verified by polygraph \n     examination), why could it not have accepted a very \n     similar offer from Mr. Holscher on December 10, 1999, the \n     date of Dr. Lee's arrest?\n       The remainder of this report addresses the government's \n     handling of: (1) the investigation of Dr. Lee from March-\n     December 1999, (2) the pretrial confinement of Dr. Lee, and \n     (3) the case against Dr. Lee. The subcommittee's \n     investigation supports the following conclusions regarding \n     these matters: (1) the information on the tapes was highly \n     sensitive and, if anything, the government should have acted \n     sooner than it did to find out what happened to them, (2) the \n     government overreached in demanding such onerous conditions \n     of confinement prior to trial, and (3) the plea agreement was \n     an acceptable resolution to the case, one that very likely \n     could have been had much sooner if the government had not \n     backed itself into a corner with its aggressive tactics after \n     December 1999.\n       The March-December 1999 Investigation \\200\\\n       One day after Dr. Lee was fired, the Albuquerque Division \n     of the FBI (FBI-AQ) met with the U.S. Attorney for the \n     District of New Mexico, Mr. John J. Kelly. The following day, \n     Dr. Lee's lawyer, Mr. Mark Holscher, wrote to the government \n     offering to surrender Dr. Lee's passport and asking whether \n     Dr. Lee was a target or a subject of investigation. In this \n     letter, Mr. Holscher also advised the government that his \n     client intended to travel to Los Angeles for several \n     days.\\201\\\n       On March 11, the FBI learned that another LANL employee had \n     been asked by Dr. Lee to retrieve a box of documents from his \n     X-Division office.\\202\\\n       After a telephone conversation between Mr. Kelly and Mr. \n     Holscher on March 15, Mr. Holscher wrote on March 19 asking \n     that the investigation of Dr. Lee be terminated, and \n     requesting security clearances so that he could counsel Lee. \n     In this letter, Mr. Holscher also noted that at least six \n     newspapers had carried stories quoting unnamed FBI officials \n     as saying that there was not enough information to indict, \n     much less convict, Dr. Lee. Mr. Holscher described this \n     information as Brady material, and said the government had no \n     evidence that Dr. Lee had any intent to injure the United \n     States, as would be required under the espionage \n     statutes.\\203\\\n       On March 23, investigators discovered the ``kf1'' file \n     listing, and reached a tentative conclusion that classified \n     files had been maintained on the unclassified portion of the \n     LANL computer system. That same day, Mr. Holscher wrote to \n     Mr. Kelly protesting government leaks to the press about the \n     case, including statements that Dr. Lee had failed to \n     cooperate with the government and had failed a polygraph \n     exam. Mr. Holscher pointed out that 28 CFR 50.2(b)(2) \n     prohibits DOJ personnel from disclosing any information \n     that ``may reasonably be expected to influence the outcome \n     of a pending or future trial.'' \\205\\\n       Mr. Holscher also sent a letter to FBI Director Louis Freeh \n     on March 23, demanding an investigation into case-related \n     leaks. In a clear reference to Dr. Lee's assistance to the \n     government in the 1980s, Mr. Holscher told Director Freeh \n     that he had ``refrained from explaining to the press the true \n     facts concerning the Lee's 1986 visit to China and follow-up \n     activities that are known to the FBI,'' and requested that \n     Director Freeh release a statement showing that Dr. Lee had \n     cooperated with the government.\\206\\\n       On March 26, a LANL scientist assisting with the \n     investigation told the FBI that the ``kf1'' directory had \n     been in the open part of the common file system (CFS), that \n     the file names in the directory suggested they were \n     classified, and that the files had been deleted from the CFS \n     on February 11, 1999. The scientist also told the FBI that \n     Dr. Lee had typed up and stored in a CFS directory letters \n     seeking employment overseas.\n       After a telephone conversation between the two men, Mark \n     Holscher wrote to Robert Gorence on March 29, saying that he \n     understood from the conversation that Dr. Lee was the subject \n     of a grand jury investigation rather than a target.\\207\\ The \n     difference is significant because being the target of an \n     investigation is more serious than merely being the subject \n     of one.\n       On March 30, a draft rule 41 search warrant affidavit for \n     Dr. Lee's home was presented to the U.S. Attorney's Office \n     (USAO) in New Mexico. From April 1-8, personnel in Washington \n     and the USAO worked on an affidavit for a search warrant.\n       During this time the FBI was pursuing a dual track, and a \n     key meeting took place on April 7 between the FBI and \n     representatives of the Office of Intelligence Policy and \n     Review. Rather than moving quickly to discover the extent of \n     the potential damage, FBI and DOJ officials continued to \n     wrangle over whether the matter should be handled under FISA \n     or was ``way too criminal'' for that.\\208\\ OIPR attorneys \n     raised their old concerns about the currency and sufficiency \n     of the evidence against Lee, as well as new concerns about \n     the appearance of improperly using FISA for criminal purposes \n     and the prospect of conducting an unprecedented overt FISA \n     search.\\209\\ FBI officials indicated that FBI Director Freeh \n     was ``prepared formally to supply the necessary \n     certifications that this search met the requirements of \n     the FISA statute--that is, that it was being sought for \n     purposes of intelligence collection (e.g., to learn about \n     Lee's alleged contacts with Chinese intelligence).'' \\210\\ \n     The draft FISA application the FBI prepared was never \n     formally presented to OIPR, in large part because the \n     criminal search warrant was issued.\n       On April 9, Attorney General Reno made the necessary \n     certification for using FISA derived material \\211\\ in a rule \n     41 search warrant, and Magistrate Judge William W. Deaton \n     issued the warrant later that same day. The following day, \n     April 10, Dr. Lee's home was searched, and he provided \n     written consent to search his automobiles.\n       In a letter to Mark Holscher dated April 16, Mr. Kelly and \n     Mr. Gorence made one demand and several requests. The two \n     prosecutors demanded the return of any classified material in \n     Dr. Lee's possession, and requested the names and addresses \n     of the individuals with whom the Lees stayed during their \n     March 9 to April 7 trip to Los Angeles. The prosecutors also \n     told Mr. Holscher of their intent to issue a grand jury \n     subpoena to Mrs. Lee regarding the 1986 and 1988 trips to the \n     PRC, and any actions related to those trips.\\212\\\n       On April 18, LANL provided two computer reports, one which \n     outlined the deletion of files by Dr. Lee from his open CFS \n     directories in January and February, and another describing \n     the earlier transfer of these files from the closed to open \n     CFS. A week later, according to an FBI chronology, a \n     technical expert assisting the FBI in the investigation said \n     that the information Dr. Lee had downloaded would not be \n     sufficient for a foreign power to build or duplicate U.S. \n     weapons, but that ``the files would significantly enhance \n     their program and save them years of research and testing.'' \n     \\213\\\n       On April 30, a LANL computer security expert informed the \n     FBI of two incidents involving Dr. Lee which showed up in a \n     review of the Network Anomaly Detection and Intrusion \n     Recording system, one in 1993 and another in 1997.\\214\\ That \n     Dr. Lee was flagged by this system in 1997, while he was \n     under investigation, but the FBI only learned about it in \n     April 1999 is simply inexplicable.\n       On May 5, the FBI was informed by a LANL scientist that a \n     notebook recovered during the search of Dr. Lee's residence \n     contained directions for transferring classified files to a \n     Sun Sparc computer workstation and from there onto portable \n     DC6150 computer tape cartridges. On May 9, a LANL computer \n     official provided a report on how the file transfers had \n     been accomplished.\n       In response to suggestions from counsel for Mrs. Lee that \n     she might claim marital communication privilege, spousal \n     privilege or both, Mr. Kelly and another prosecutor, Ms. \n     Paula Burnett, wrote to Mr. Brian Sun on May 5. The \n     prosecutors laid out the areas of proposed questioning, to \n     include: (1) biographical information on Mrs. Lee, her \n     husband and their children; (2) contacts the Lees have with \n     extended family, friends or business contacts in the PRC and \n     Taiwan; (3) cooperation with the FBI in the 1986-1988 period; \n     and (4) her knowledge of Dr. Lee's work and any job related \n     activity that he did at home. Focusing on the Mrs. Lee's \n     assistance to the FBI, the prosecutors explained that:\n       ``Not only would we ask her the details of what she was \n     asked to do and what she did during the time of cooperation \n     with the FBI, but also the extent to which her husband was \n     aware of those activities and participated in them.'' \\215\\\n       The next day, Mr. Sun responded in writing, saying that he \n     had spoken to Mr. Holscher and felt it was appropriate for \n     Mrs. Lee to assert the marital communications privilege and \n     the spousal privilege. He said, however, that he might be \n     willing to make an attorney proffer.\\216\\\n       On May 11, FBI-AQ prepared a Letterhead Memorandum on the \n     Lee case, which was followed on May 16 by a written status \n     report from USA Kelly to Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder \n     and Attorney General Reno.\n       The next day, May 17, a LANL computer official provided a \n     report on potential movement of files on Dr. Lee's CFS \n     directories from LANL computers to outside computers.\n       The U.S. Attorney presented a prosecution memorandum on May \n     27, and requested guidance form DOJ because ``the Atomic \n     Energy Act violation had never been prosecuted before.'' He \n     anticipated difficulty showing Lee intended to harm the U.S. \n     as a necessary element of the crime.\\217\\ The FBI, USAO, and \n     Criminal Division met in Washington, DC, on the same day the \n     prosecution memorandum was presented, to discuss the case, \n     and two days later FBI-AQ provided a written prosecutive \n     report to USAO.\n\n[[Page S13809]]\n\n       Mr. Holscher wrote on June 9, complaining that the \n     government had not yet advised him what it wanted to discuss \n     with Lee and had not sought to schedule a meeting. Six days \n     later, Mr. Kelly responded that the government was \n     considering serious charges, but ruled out espionage charges \n     under 18 USC 794 (the most serious espionage charge), and \n     suggested a meeting for June 21. In the letter, Mr. Kelly \n     said that he had postponed a previously scheduled meeting \n     so the government could complete its investigation. He \n     further explained to Mr. Holscher:\n       ``I did so not to inconvenience your client, but rather to \n     insure that the interview would take place toward the \n     conclusion of the investigation at a time when I would be \n     able to provide meaningful information about potential \n     charges and, in turn, your client would be motivated to \n     provide a more complete explanation for his potentially \n     criminal conduct. As I stated in our telephone conversation \n     last night, that time has now come.\n       ``You should know that I will be making a charging decision \n     in this matter before the end of June and that the offense \n     conduct under consideration involves various actions by your \n     client over the last decade that collectively have \n     compromised some of our nation's most highly sensitive and \n     closely guarded nuclear secrets.'' \\218\\\n       At the June 21 meeting, which was attended by USAO, FBI and \n     Criminal Division representatives, Dr. Lee's counsel asserted \n     that he had only downloaded unclassified data onto the \n     unsecure computer and then on to tapes. (When later \n     confronted with evidence that Dr. Lee had, in fact, \n     downloaded classified data onto portable tapes, counsel \n     claimed that if Dr. Lee had done so, any such tapes had been \n     destroyed.) The meeting was followed by a written status \n     report to the DAG and the AG the following day.\n       In the interim, on June 15, the FBI learned that Dr. Lee \n     had asked a colleague to retrieve a box of materials that he \n     had left in his X-Division office when he had been \n     transferred to the T-Division. The FBI was told that the \n     colleague had retrieved the box for Dr. Lee, but had taken \n     the materials to LANL security, which had questions regarding \n     some of the contents of the box.\\219\\ The FBI chronology does \n     not mention when the colleague had retrieved the box or what \n     LANL security did about the contents. The absence of details \n     raises the inference that the now-missing tapes could have \n     been in the box, and LANL security may have passed them back \n     to Dr. Lee without knowing what was on them. The FBI has not \n     answered this question.\n       During the first week of July 1999, Dr. Lee's lawyers made \n     written presentations to the Albuquerque USAO and the \n     Criminal Division in Washington, each of which was designed \n     to dissuade the government from taking action against Dr. \n     Lee.\n       On July 15, a LANL scientist provided a report on the \n     creation of Tape N, which was downloaded directly to tape in \n     1997. It was also during July that the government learned \n     that one of the six tapes which had been recovered from Dr. \n     Lee's T-Division office contained a classified file, and that \n     two others contained deleted classified files. LANL computer \n     officials advised the government that one tape had been \n     cleansed of classified data in February 1999, on the unsecure \n     computer workstation belonging to a T-Division colleague of \n     Dr. Lee.\n       Three days after a meeting in Washington between the USAO \n     and the Criminal Division, Mr. Holscher sent a letter to the \n     government explaining that Dr. Lee had not violated the \n     Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The letter was followed one day \n     later, on July 27, by a meeting in Washington between counsel \n     for Dr. Lee and the Criminal Division.\n       Mr. Holscher wrote again on August 2, offering to make \n     additional factual submissions, which prompted a response \n     from Mr. Kelly on August 4, saying the government would \n     review anything Mr. Holscher submitted but wanted a complete \n     explanation from Dr. Lee himself. At the same time, Mr. Kelly \n     sent a letter to Eugene Habiger, Director of DOE's Office of \n     Security and Emergency Operations, seeking to include in a \n     proposed indictment of Dr. Lee information about Dr. Lee's \n     downloading activity.\n       After an August 9 telephone conversation between counsel \n     for Dr. Lee and Richard Rossman, Chief of Staff of the \n     Criminal Division, Mr. Holscher wrote a letter on August 10 \n     stating that Dr. Lee would not submit to any additional \n     interviews and offering further arguments why Dr. Lee had not \n     violated 18 USC 793.\n       On August 16, Criminal Division Chief of Staff Rossman \n     wrote to counsel for Dr. Lee advising that the government had \n     not yet made a decision whether to charge Dr. Lee, and asking \n     for additional information (which had been discussed during \n     the July meeting) by August 30.\n       Following a supplemental written presentation by Dr. Lee's \n     counsel on August 30, Mr. Kelly wrote to Mr. Holscher on \n     September 3 asking for information about the location and \n     custody of the tapes from the time of their creation until \n     the present.\n       On September 8, representatives of the Criminal Division, \n     USAO, LANL and DOE met in Washington to discuss the handling \n     of classified information in the prosecution of Dr. Lee. All \n     of the DOE and LANL representatives concurred as to the \n     significance of the data at issue. By October 4, DOE had \n     prepared a draft classification guide governing issues \n     related to Dr. Lee's illicit computer activity and the \n     classified files involved.\n       On October 14, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a \n     resolution authorizing subpoenas relevant to the work of the \n     Department of Justice Oversight subcommittee, including the \n     Wen Ho Lee matter. (A second, broader resolution was \n     authorized on November 17.\\220\\)\n       On October 27, Assistant Attorney General James Robinson, \n     Criminal Division, wrote a memo to USA Kelly recommending \n     that Dr. Lee be prosecuted under the Atomic Energy Act of \n     1954.\n       On November 3, the Department of Justice Oversight \n     subcommittee held its first hearing on the Wen Ho Lee case. \n     Much of the testimony focused on the failure of the FBI to \n     properly investigate, from 1995 to 1998, the information it \n     had related to Dr. Lee potentially engaging in surreptitious \n     electronic communications.\n       The Lee case was discussed at an National Security Council \n     meeting on November 11, with DOE, DOJ and LANL \n     representatives in attendance.\n       On November 15, a LANL scientist wrote a ``Draft of Input \n     to Damage Assessment'' regarding the case, which was faxed to \n     USA Kelly on November 15. At the request of the NSC, the CIA \n     prepared a damage assessment regarding the material on the \n     missing tapes on November 24.\n       The case was briefed at the White House on December 4. A \n     September 24, 2000 Washington Post article by Walter Pincus \n     and David A. Vise described the events leading up to and the \n     discussion at the December 4 meeting as follows:\n       ``The decision to prosecute Lee was made at a meeting in \n     [Attorney General] Reno's conference room shortly before \n     Thanksgiving. Despite lingering question's about Lee's \n     motives, according to participants, there was unanimity among \n     the federal prosecutors from New Mexico and their superiors \n     in Washington that the government should bring a massive, 59-\n     count indictment against Lee using the Atomic Energy Act. \n     Indeed, officials in Washington had decided to charge Lee \n     with intent to injure U.S. national security and (not ``or'') \n     to aid a foreign adversary.\n       ``Crossing a final hurdle, Reno called a meeting of senior \n     national security officials in the White House Situation Room \n     on Dec. 4, 1999, to explain how much classified information \n     prosecutors were prepared to reveal in court. In addition to \n     Reno, Kelly, Freeh, and Richardson, those present included \n     national security adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger, CIA \n     Director George J. Tenet and deputy defense secretary John J. \n     Hamre.\n       ``Robert D. Walpole, the national intelligence officer for \n     strategic and nuclear programs, began the meeting with a \n     formal assessment that the loss of the data downloaded by Lee \n     would be a serious blow to national security\n       ``The meeting ended after Reno offered her assurance that \n     prosecutors were prepared to drop the case immediately if the \n     judge were to grant a motion, sure to come from the defense, \n     that the data downloaded by Lee had to be introduced, in \n     full, in open court.'' \\221\\\n       On December 7, the Department of Justice Oversight \n     subcommittee sent letters requesting testimony in a closed \n     hearing from nine FBI witnesses, including two of the case \n     agents, FBI General Counsel Larry Parkinson, Albuquerque \n     Special Agent in Charge David Kitchen, Assistant Director for \n     National Security Neil Gallagher, and other case supervisors \n     and managers. The hearing, scheduled for December 14, was to \n     explore the circumstances of the December 23, 1998 polygraph \n     and the relationship between the government and the Lees.\n       On December 8, as required by statute, the Attorney General \n     sent letters to Energy Secretary Richardson and USA Kelly \n     approving charges against Dr. Lee under the Atomic Energy Act \n     of 1954. That same day, Mr. Kelly spoke to Mr. Holscher by \n     phone, telling him that indictment was imminent and asking \n     for information about the missing tapes. At some point in \n     late 1999, prior to the indictment, Mr. Kelly told Mr. \n     Holscher that the case might be resolved without an \n     indictment and advised Mr. Holscher to look at the latter \n     sections of 18 USC 793.\n       Although Mr. Holscher faxed a letter at 8:24 a.m. (Pacific \n     Time) on December 10, offering to make Dr. Lee available for \n     a polygraph by a mutually agreeable polygrapher to verify \n     that Dr. Lee did not mishandle the tapes or provide them to a \n     third party, Dr. Lee was indicted and arrested later that \n     same day.\n       Also on December 10, FBI Director Freeh wrote to request \n     that I ``delay hearings on any aspect of this investigation \n     until the conclusion of the current criminal proceedings \n     resulting from the indictment handed down today.'' \\223\\ In \n     explaining why it was necessary to delay subcommittee \n     hearings, Director Freeh said:\n       ``In my view, the potential that your hearings could \n     inadvertently interfere with the prosecution is substantial. \n     Subcommittee hearings at this time risk impacting upon the \n     Government's ability to successfully prosecute Mr. Lee by \n     creating issues that may not presently exist. Moreover, it is \n     critical for our national security that we have every \n     opportunity to learn as much as we can from Wen Ho Lee in a \n     carefully controllable setting. Given the gravity of the \n     allegations and charges, and the potential opportunities that \n     could be lost by hearings, I respectfully ask that you not go \n     forward at this time. I hope you will agree that to do \n     otherwise poses a substantial risk not only to the \n     prosecution but to the Government's ultimate ability to \n     discover the full extent of the damage done.'' \\224\\\n\n[[Page S13810]]\n\n       When Director Freeh met with Senator Torricelli and me on \n     December 14, he made the same arguments. The subcommittee \n     agreed to withhold hearings until the case was resolved, \n     which occurred on September 13, 2000, with the acceptance of \n     the plea agreement.\n       With the inexplicable exception of never seeking electronic \n     surveillance on Dr. Lee, the chronology presented here shows \n     a thorough and methodical investigation. The discovery that \n     Dr. Lee had created his own portable nuclear weapons data \n     library must, in large measure, be credited to the \n     extraordinary level of effort and skill on the part of the \n     investigators from the FBI and the DOE. In Senate testimony, \n     Director Freeh said that the investigation had required the \n     ``interview of over 1,000 witnesses, review of 20,000 pages \n     of documents in English and Chinese, and the forensic \n     examination of more than 1,000 gigabytes containing more than \n     one million computer files . . .'' \\225\\ Any assessment of \n     the investigation must acknowledge the vast amount of work \n     involved in discovering Dr. Lee's illegal computer \n     activity after he tried so diligently to erase any traces \n     of what he had done. In this regard, the government \n     personnel should be commended.\n       There are, however, two areas for concern \\226\\ related to \n     the conduct of the March-December 1999 investigation. The \n     first is the delay from the time the existence of the tapes \n     was known, which occurred at the latest in June, and the time \n     Dr. Lee was indicted in December. The chronology provided by \n     the Department of Justice shows continuing activity on the \n     part of the government, and multiple contacts with Dr. Lee's \n     attorneys seeking information about the fate of the tapes, \n     but nothing commensurate with its subsequent declarations in \n     court that the only way to keep the information from falling \n     into the wrong hands, where it could change the global \n     strategic balance, was to hold Dr. Lee in very strict \n     pretrial confinement. In responding to a question about this \n     delay, Director Freeh testified, ``This was an extremely \n     complex investigation and prosecutive process. It could not \n     have been brought, in my view, fairly and accurately before \n     it was.'' \\227\\\n       The second great concern is that the FBI did not seek \n     electronic surveillance of Dr. Lee during this period.\\228\\ \n     In view of the government's later pleadings that Dr. Lee \n     could, in effect, upset the global strategic balance merely \n     by saying something as seemingly innocuous as ``Uncle Wen \n     says hello,'' it is difficult to comprehend why the \n     government never sought electronic surveillance in an effort \n     to discover the whereabouts of the missing tapes. In the \n     December 1999 detention hearings, the U.S. Attorney, John \n     Kelly, suggested that if Dr. Lee still had the tapes, he \n     could send a signal to a foreign intelligence service to \n     extract him. If he wasn't in custody ``then we would be \n     dealing with a situation in which an individual not in \n     custody is going to be snatched and taken out of the \n     country.'' \\229\\ As early as April 30, 1999, the FBI had been \n     told by a LANL scientist that if the files Dr. Lee downloaded \n     were given to a foreign power, they would have the ``whole \n     farm,'' the ``crown jewels'' of the U.S. program which had \n     been obtained through decades of effort by the U.S.\\230\\\n       If the government felt his communications were such a \n     potential threat, why was there never an effort to ascertain \n     with whom and about what he was communicating during the \n     March-December 1999 period? This lapse severely undercuts the \n     government's later arguments that the harsh conditions of \n     confinement were only to protect the downloaded information.\n       The Pretrial Confinement of Dr. Lee\n       After his arrest on December 10, 1999, and a detention \n     hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Don Svet on December 13, \n     1999, Dr. Lee was placed in pretrial confinement in the Santa \n     Fe County Correctional Facility. The conditions of his \n     incarceration, including the Special Administrative Measures \n     (SAM) taken to prevent him from possibly communicating to \n     others about the location of the tapes or the material \n     thereon, have received a great deal of attention from Dr. \n     Lee's attorneys, the press, and eventually, Congress.\n       The government's decision to hold Dr. Lee under such strict \n     conditions raises a number of important points. Defendants \n     are presumptively entitled to pretrial release except in \n     certain circumstances specified in statute. Because none of \n     the ordinary conditions for pretrial confinement--for \n     example, when a violent criminal is captured after a killing \n     spree--applied to Dr. Lee, Judge Parker explained in his \n     order that:\n       ``Only after a hearing and a finding that ``no condition or \n     combination of conditions will reasonably assure the \n     appearance'' of the defendant and the safety of the \n     community, can a judge order a defendant's pretrial \n     detention. 18 USC 3142(e). A finding against release must be \n     ``supported by clear and convincing evidence.'' 18 USC \n     3142(f).'' \\231\\\n       In reaching a decision on pretrial detention, the judge was \n     required to take into account the available information \n     regarding: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense \n     charged, (2) the weight of the evidence against the person, \n     and (3) the history and characteristics of the person.\\232\\\n       At a series of detention hearings from December 13 through \n     December 29, before two different magistrates, the government \n     painted a stark picture of Dr. Lee's conduct. A December 23, \n     1999 filing by Mr. Gorence summarized the government's \n     position:\n       ``Lee stole America's nuclear secrets sufficient to build a \n     functional thermonuclear weapon. Lee absconded with that \n     information on computer tapes, seven of which are still \n     missing. Those missing tapes, in the hands of an unauthorized \n     possessor, pose a mortal danger to every American. The \n     government does not know what Lee did with the tapes after he \n     surreptitiously created them. Despite previous denials, Lee \n     now admits that he created the tapes--tapes which the \n     government will establish contain an entire thermonuclear \n     weapon design capability. The risk to U.S. national security \n     is so great if Lee were to communicate the existence, \n     whereabouts, or facilitate the use of the tapes that there is \n     no condition or combination of conditions that will \n     reasonably assure the safety of this country if Lee is \n     released.'' \\233\\\n       The Atomic Energy counts with which Dr. Lee had been \n     charged required that the conduct at issue be done with \n     intent to injure the United states. On this score, the \n     government argued that:\n       ``Lee's secretive and surreptitious actions to gather the \n     classified TAR files, to down-partition and download the \n     files on to tapes, to lie to colleagues to facilitate his \n     actions, and then his subsequent deletions to cover his \n     tracks all evidence an intent to injure the United States. \n     Lee's intent to injure the United States also can be inferred \n     by the additional testimony that the government will present \n     to this Court that Lee, in taking complete thermonuclear \n     weapon design capability, stole information that was not in \n     any way related to his duties as a hydrodynamicist. The \n     United States also will offer additional testimony that \n     there was no work related reason to ever move the \n     classified information that Lee moved and downloaded on to \n     computer tapes from the secure to the unsecure computing \n     environment. These facts evidence an intent to injure the \n     United States by depriving it of exclusive control of its \n     most sensitive nuclear secrets.'' \\234\\\n       The government also argued that the only way to safeguard \n     the information on the tapes Dr. Lee created was to hold him \n     in detention, with special restrictions on his \n     communications. As described in the government's motion on \n     December 23, these measures included segregation from other \n     prisoners; limiting his visitors to immediate family members \n     and his attorneys, having an FBI agent monitor all family \n     visitations, denial of access to a phone except to call his \n     attorneys, and mail screening.\\235\\\n       After the required hearings, Judge Parker issued his order \n     on December 30, 1999, in which he concluded that ``at this \n     time there is no condition or combination of conditions of \n     pretrial release that will reasonably assure the appearance \n     of Dr. Lee as required and the safety of any other person, \n     the community, and the nation.'' \\236\\ He then addressed the \n     nature of the alleged crimes, the weight of the evidence, and \n     the characteristics of the defendant. Judge Parker noted that \n     while the offenses charged fell short of espionage, they were \n     ``quite serious and of grave concern to national security.'' \n     \\237\\ The judge also described the surreptitiousness with \n     which the tapes had been created, citing the government's \n     contention that Dr. Lee had misled a T-Division employee by \n     claiming to want to download a resume to tape.\\238\\ In \n     addressing the weight of the evidence against Dr. Lee, Judge \n     Parker noted that the government had presented direct \n     evidence of the downloads, which was the relevant conduct at \n     issue. With regard to the intent to injure, which was also an \n     element of the charged offenses, he noted that:\n       ``although the Government did not present any direct \n     evidence regarding Dr. Lee's intent to harm the United States \n     or to advantage a foreign nation . . . the Government did \n     present circumstantial evidence of Dr. Lee's intent to \n     violate these provisions of the Atomic Energy Act and the \n     Espionage Act.'' \\239\\\n       With regard to the characteristics of the defendant, Judge \n     Parker made points on both sides, noting that Dr. Lee had \n     ``lied to LANL employees and to law enforcement agents and \n     has consciously deceived them about the classified material \n     that he had put on the tapes and about contacts with foreign \n     scientists and officials.'' \\240\\ On the other hand, the \n     judge noted Dr. Lee's longstanding ties to the community, and \n     said, ``Aside from Dr. Lee's deceptive behavior regarding the \n     issues raised in this case, his past conduct appears to have \n     been lawful and without reproach.'' \\241\\ And, finally, the \n     judge concluded that the government had presented ``credible \n     evidence showing that the possession of information by other \n     nations or by organizations or individuals could result in \n     devastating consequences to the United States' nuclear weapon \n     program and anti-ballistic nuclear defense system.'' \\242\\\n       In concluding, the judge stated:\n       ``With a great deal of concern about the conditions under \n     which Dr. Lee is presently being held in custody, which is in \n     solitary confinement all but one hour a week when he is \n     permitted to visit his family, the court finds, based on the \n     record before it, that the Government has shown by clear and \n     convincing evidence that there is no combination of \n     conditions of release that would reasonably assure the safety \n     of any person and the community or the nation. The danger is \n     presented primarily by the seven missing tapes, the lack of \n     an explanation by Dr. Lee or his counsel regarding how, when, \n     where, and under what circumstances they were destroyed, and \n     the potentially catastrophic\n\n[[Page S13811]]\n\n     harm that could result from Dr. Lee being able, while on \n     pretrial release, to communicate with unauthorized persons \n     about the location of the tapes or their contents if they are \n     already possessed by others. Although Dr. Lee's motion to \n     revoke Magistrate Judge Svet's detention order is denied at \n     this time, changed circumstances might justify Dr. Lee \n     renewing his request for release. If, for instance, Dr. Lee \n     submits to a polygraph examination . . . and the results of \n     the exam allay concerns about the seven missing tapes, Dr. \n     Lee's request for pretrial release can be reconsidered in a \n     significantly different light.'' \\243\\\n       The judge's final statement before denying Dr. Lee's motion \n     for pretrial release was an admonishment to the government \n     ``to explore ways to loosen the severe restrictions currently \n     imposed upon Dr. Lee while preserving the security of \n     sensitive information.'' \\244\\\n       Having lost the initial fight for pretrial release, Dr. Lee \n     returned to jail where the conditions of his confinement \n     became a rallying point for his defenders. The following \n     excerpt is taken from an Internet site established and \n     maintained by Dr. Lee's supporters:\n       ``He was arrested on December 10, 1999 and is now put in \n     solitary confinement in a cell in a New Mexico jail 23 hours \n     a day. He is allowed only one hour of visit a week from his \n     immediate family. He is shackled any time he is out of his \n     cell, at his waist, his ankle and his wrist except when he is \n     meeting with his lawyers (and even then he must wear an ankle \n     chain). A chain around his belly connecting to his handcuff \n     prevents him from raising his hand above his head. We were \n     told that two U.S. Marshals with machine guns accompanied him \n     whenever he goes within the confine of the prison and a \n     `chase car' with armed Marshals follows Dr. Lee when he is \n     moved from Santa Fe to Albuquerque and back. This is highly \n     unusual and we questioned that other prisoners received the \n     same treatment. The lawyer said Lee was kept separate from \n     other prisoners during his hour-long exercise period. He is \n     finally allowed to speak Mandarin with his family but with \n     two FBI agents listening in. We were told by his families \n     that Dr. Lee was always in shackles and chain even during \n     their one hour weekly meeting. We were also told that the \n     food provided by the prison system was inappropriate to Dr. \n     Lee because he has long adopted to live on a non red meat \n     diet after his colon cancer surgery several years ago.'' \n     \\245\\\n       The government, however, portrayed Dr. Lee's conditions of \n     confinement as a matter of necessity to protect the \n     classified information he had downloaded to portable tapes. \n     In a series of memoranda written by Lawrence Barreras, Senior \n     Warden of the Santa Fe County Correctional Facility, on \n     December 10 and 14, 1999, and January 4, 2000, the terms of \n     Dr. Lee's confinement were outlined in detail. Specifically, \n     Dr. Lee's confinement consisted of 24 hour supervision by a \n     rotation of guards, permission to speak only with his \n     attorneys and immediate family members (his wife, daughter \n     and son) and in English only, non-contact visits from his \n     immediate family members limited to one hour per week, no \n     personal phone calls, and that he remain secured in his \n     cell 24 hours a day.\\246\\ Further, Dr. Lee was to remain \n     in full restraints (leg and hand irons) anytime he was to \n     be out of his cell being moved from one location to \n     another.\\247\\\n       As previously noted, Dr. Lee's lawyers protested his \n     conditions of confinement almost from the beginning. In a \n     December 21, 1999 letter to Mr. Kelly and Mr. Gorence, lead \n     defense attorney Mark Holscher said:\n       ``Apparently at the request of the Department of Justice \n     and the FBI, Dr. Lee's jailers have barred his family from \n     visiting him for more than one hour a week. In addition, the \n     agents have demanded that my client and his wife speak only \n     English and do so in the presence of a federal agent.\n       ``Please provide me immediately with a written description \n     of the conditions that you have placed on Dr. Lee's \n     imprisonment, and a statement of the legal authority for \n     these draconian conditions.'' \\248\\\n       The legal authority to which Mr. Holscher referred was at \n     that time still being assembled. Title 28 of the Code of \n     Federal Regulations, section 501.2, provides that upon \n     direction of the Attorney General, special administrative \n     measures may be implemented that are reasonably necessary to \n     prevent disclosure of classified information, upon written \n     certification . . . by the head of a member agency of the \n     United States intelligence community that the unauthorized \n     disclosure of classified information would pose a threat to \n     the national security and that there is a danger that the \n     inmate will disclose such information. Energy Secretary Bill \n     Richardson sent a letter to the Attorney General on December \n     27, 1999, in which he said:\n       ``In my judgment, such a certification is warranted to \n     enable the Department of Justice to take whatever steps are \n     reasonably available to it to preclude Mr. Lee, during the \n     period of his pretrial confinement, any opportunity to \n     communicate, directly or through other means, the extremely \n     sensitive nuclear weapons data that the indictment alleges \n     Mr. Lee surreptitiously diverted to his own possession from \n     Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). I make this \n     certification at the request of the U.S. Attorney for the \n     District of New Mexico, John Kelly, and upon the \n     recommendations and evaluations of the Director of the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation and DOE's Director of \n     Security and Emergency Operations, Eugene Habiger.'' \\249\\\n       By January 6, the Department of Justice had reviewed the \n     administrative segregation procedures at the Santa Fe County \n     Correctional Facility and determined with some additional \n     measures, the standard segregation policy would adequately \n     confine Dr. Lee. In a letter to Warden Lawrence Barreras, the \n     local U.S. Marshal, John Sanchez described ten additional \n     measures that were necessary:\n       1. Mr. Lee is to be kept in segregation until further \n     notice (single cell).\n       2. Mr. Lee is not to have contact with other inmates at \n     anytime.\n       3. All outgoing mail EXCEPT LEGAL MAIL will be screened by \n     the FBI.\n       4. Mr. Lee will not be permitted personal telephone calls.\n       5. Mr. Lee will be allowed to place collect telephone calls \n     to attorneys of record [Mr. John Cline and Mr. Mark \n     Holscher].\n       6. Mr. Lee will be allowed contact visits with his \n     attorneys only.\n       7. Mr. Lee will be allowed non-contact visits with \n     immediate family members. . . . The FBI must be on site to \n     monitor each visit. Visits will not be allowed unless an FBI \n     agent is present.\n       8. Visitors are to be restricted to Attorneys of Record and \n     immediate family.\n       9. Any changes to Mr. Lee's conditions of confinement will \n     be authorized by USMS [U.S. Marshals Service] personnel only.\n       10. Mr. Lee is NOT TO BE REMOVED FROM THE FACILITY BY \n     ANYONE UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY THE USMS.\\250\\\n       That same day, another of Dr. Lee's attorneys, Mr. John \n     Cline, wrote to Mr. Gorence expressing the view that the \n     conditions of confinement were unlawful. He requested three \n     specific changes, including: (1) two hours outdoors every \n     day, (2) permission for Dr. Lee to have a television, radio, \n     and a CD player in his cell and to receive access to \n     newspapers, and (3) a daily shower.\\251\\\n       A January 12, 2000 memorandum to the Attorney General from \n     Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Gary Grindler \n     demonstrates that at least some of the concerns of Dr. Lee's \n     lawyers were taken to the highest reaches of the Justice \n     Department. The memo notes that the Attorney General had \n     ``advised that some individuals have expressed concern about \n     Dr. Lee's access to exercise,'' and explains that the order \n     for Special Administrative Measures that she was being asked \n     to sign ``does not limit Dr. Lee's access to exercise. \n     According to the Santa Fe County Jail rules, Dr. Lee will be \n     limited to one-hour per day of exercise, as are all \n     administrative segregation prisoners.'' \\252\\\n       On January 13, 2000, the Attorney General formally \n     authorized the special administrative measures for a period \n     of 120 days in a memorandum to John W. Marshall, the Director \n     of the Marshals Service. The conditions of confinement were \n     as previously described. It should be noted, however, that \n     from December 10, 1999 until the date the Attorney General \n     signed the order on January 13, 2000, any special conditions \n     of confinement imposed on Dr. Lee would have been without \n     proper authority. If federal regulations require \n     certifications from agency heads and the Attorney General, it \n     can only be presumed that restrictions such as those imposed \n     on Dr. Lee would not be properly authorized until all the \n     certifications were in place. It is troubling that the \n     government was not better prepared to make the necessary \n     certifications in a timely fashion.\n       As the end of the initial 120 days approached, the Attorney \n     General received a new letter from Secretary Richardson on \n     May 4, in which he expressed his support for continuing the \n     SAM. However, he mentioned the conditions of Dr. Lee's \n     pretrial confinement, saying:\n       ``At the same time, I want to emphasize my concern, that to \n     the extent consistent with protecting the sensitive weapons \n     information to which the indictment of Dr. Lee pertains, Dr. \n     Lee's civil rights as a pre-trial detainee should be honored. \n     I understand that, in response to a request by Dr. Lee's \n     counsel, the Department of Justice has arranged for a \n     translator to be present when he speaks with his family so \n     that he can speak Chinese. I further understand that \n     arrangements have been made to permit him to visit with his \n     family on weekends, to have access to Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory with his lawyers under appropriate safeguards so \n     that he can prepare his defense, and to have access to a \n     radio and reading material of his choice, as well as a \n     reasonable period of exercise every day. Finally, I \n     understand that the conditions of his confinement are in no \n     respect more restrictive than those of others in the \n     segregation unit of the detention facility, where he is \n     confined specifically to protect against further compromise \n     of classified information. Based on this information, I am \n     satisfied that his civil rights are being adequately \n     protected.'' \\254\\\n       At about the same time the FBI SAC in Albuquerque, David \n     Kitchen, wrote to the new U.S. Attorney in New Mexico, Norman \n     Bay, and expressed his unequivocal support for maintaining \n     the SAM in place. Agent Kitchen expressed his ``firm \n     conviction that any loosening of the SAM would enable Dr. Lee \n     to communicate with an agent of a foreign power regarding the \n     disposition or usage of the materials contained in the seven \n     missing tapes.'' \\255\\\n       In July, the new lead prosecutor on the case, George \n     Stamboulidis, arranged to have restraints removed from Dr. \n     Lee during his scheduled recreation times,\\256\\ but this did \n     not occur without some difficulty.\\257\\\n\n[[Page S13812]]\n\n       An August 1, 2000 letter from Warden Barreras to Mr. \n     Stamboulidis describes the final state of Dr. Lee's \n     confinement:\n       ``In response to your letter date July 30th, 2000 inmate \n     Wen Ho Lee began recreating without restraints on July 18th, \n     2000 at 8:30 a.m. As of August 5th, 2000 he is also allowed \n     participation in the recreation yard 7-days a week for a \n     period of 1-hour per day.\n       ``In reply to inmate Wen Ho Lee's housing conditions: \n     inmate Wen Ho Lee is permitted to have a radio in his cell, \n     this gives him the ability to listen to news programs; he \n     receives reading materials per the SAM guidelines.\n       ``In addition, an exception to the rule was made to grant \n     inmate Wen Ho Lee visits on Saturdays as opposed to the \n     regular Friday schedule: this was done in order to \n     accommodate his family. Supervisors are the only staff that \n     are assigned to oversee his escort and visit. Inmate Wen Ho \n     Lee also receives extra fruit at dinnertime, daily.'' \\258\\\n       On September 7, 2000, U.S. Attorney Norman Bay requested \n     that the Attorney General continue the SAM, which had last \n     been extended on May 12. In his letter, he outlined recent \n     developments in the case, including Judge Parker's order \n     granting Dr. Lee's renewed motion for pretrial release on \n     August 24. Mr. Bay informed the Attorney General of the \n     government's motion to stay the request of that order, and \n     noted that the Tenth Circuit had stayed Judge Parker's order \n     pending further review. Mr. Bay concluded his request to the \n     Attorney General by noting that ``nothing has changed since \n     the special administrative measures were first imposed to \n     reduce the risk of Lee disclosing highly sensitive classified \n     information to an unauthorized possessor,'' and requested \n     another 120 days of SAM.\\259\\\n       Before the Attorney General acted on the request, the \n     government reached a plea agreement with Dr. Lee, which ended \n     his confinement.\n       After the plea agreement, the conditions of Dr. Lee's \n     confinement were widely discussed in a way that they had not \n     been discussed before, with new allegations that a light had \n     been left on his cell 24-hours a day, and that he had been \n     kept in shackles an inordinate amount of time. During a \n     series of three hearings in late September and early October \n     2000, Department of Justice witnesses were asked about the \n     conditions of detention. Attorney General Reno made the point \n     that Dr. Lee's lawyers had not previously complained about \n     the leg-restraints and that no one had ever mentioned the \n     light before.\\260\\ Mr. Bay explained that the light in \n     question was ``a dull blue light, kind of like a night light, \n     in Dr. Lee's room . . . [used] to make sure that if someone \n     walked by and looked inside his cell that they could make \n     sure that he was there and that he was doing okay.'' \\261\\\n       The Attorney General also read into the record a memorandum \n     from Raymond L. Cisneros, the local sheriff in Santa Fe who \n     served as the jail monitor. The memorandum, dated March 10, \n     2000, was to the county manager and explained that Mr. \n     Cisneros had met with Dr. Lee after receiving phone calls \n     from unknown persons claiming that Dr. Lee was not being \n     treated well. According to the memo:\n       ``Other than being incarcerated, he had no complaints. The \n     staff was treating him very well. He singled out Warden \n     Barreras and Deputy Warden Romero as treating him great. . . \n     . His only request was for additional fruit at the evening \n     meal, which I relayed to Warden Barreras.\n       ``I gave him my business card and told him to contact me \n     through his attorney if there was any mistreatment of other \n     issues regarding his incarceration. . . . Because of the high \n     profile nature of this case, I felt it was necessary to \n     either confirm or disprove the allegations. Mr. Lee was very \n     surprised about the calls and stated, `I haven't complained \n     to anyone about the jail because I am being treated very \n     well.' '' \\262\\\n       Realizing that the hearings had not provided all the \n     necessary information on the confinement issue, the DOJ later \n     provided several hundred pages of relevant documents. Much of \n     the discussion above has been drawn from these documents. The \n     Department also sent a letter, dated January 20, 2001, which \n     provided additional detail on the matter. Assistant Attorney \n     General Robert Raben explained that the manner in which Dr. \n     Lee had been treated flowed ``directly from a policy that \n     sets bright line rules that apply to all prisoners under \n     defined circumstances. These bright line rules are, in the \n     Department's view, better than an alternative that would \n     require detention facility personnel to make ad hoc decisions \n     in each individual prisoner's case. A rule allowing such \n     discretion would invite both favoritism and abuse.'' \\263\\ \n     Mr. Raben went on to explain that, because there is no \n     federal detention facility in New Mexico, Dr. Lee had been \n     housed at the Santa Fe County Detention Facility, under \n     its administrative segregation policies, with the \n     additional condition that he be allowed no unmonitored \n     communications. According to Mr. Raben:\n       ``While housed in the Santa Fe County Detention Facility, \n     Dr. Lee was subject to all of that facility's other \n     regulations for all prisoners in administrative segregation \n     in addition to the ban on unmonitored communications. One of \n     those requirements is that prisoners in administrative \n     segregation must be in ``full restraints'' (handcuffs, waist \n     chains, and leg irons) whenever they are outside of their \n     cells within the facility, including during exercise periods. \n     Dr. Lee was not in restraints while in his cell. In July \n     2000, after the issues was raised by Dr. Lee's attorneys, the \n     restraints policy was modified uniquely for Dr. Lee so that \n     he, unlike others in administrative segregation could \n     exercise without restraints.'' \\264\\\n       Mr. Raben further explained that Dr. Lee was transported \n     for all court appearances and meetings with his attorneys by \n     the U.S. Marshals, under standard procedures, which included \n     ``full restraints'' during transport, and at all times except \n     when Dr. Lee was in a holding area cell administered by the \n     Marshals Service and when he was meeting with his attorneys. \n     During such meetings, the leg irons remained on, but Mr. \n     Raben said that Dr. Lee's attorneys had never objected to \n     that procedure.\\265\\\n       After reviewing the documents and testimony on the \n     conditions of Dr. Lee's pretrial confinement, it is clear \n     that the reasonableness of the government's actions turns on \n     the question of whether or not it was really necessary to \n     restrict his ability to communicate. The government was \n     convinced that the only way to protect the national security \n     was to prevent Dr. Lee from communicating. Having taken that \n     position, the remainder of the government's actions were \n     simply to further the objective of limiting Dr. Lee's ability \n     to communicate. Although some of the government's responses \n     were not as prompt as one might like--for example, taking \n     more than a month to get the initial SAM guidelines signed by \n     the Attorney General--the government seems to have been \n     generally responsive to requests from Dr. Lee's attorneys.\n       That is not to say that the government's actions were \n     appropriate, however, because the government has not made a \n     showing as to why it was necessary to hold Dr. Lee under such \n     strict terms of confinement in the first place. If he had not \n     communicated the whereabouts of the tapes to a third party in \n     the period prior to his arrest, what made the government \n     believe he would do so from jail? None of the documents, \n     testimony or other information available to the subcommittee \n     provides a compelling answer to this question. While the \n     government may have believed such harsh conditions were \n     necessary, they have not made a convincing case. Judge Parker \n     was not convinced by the government's arguments, and granted \n     Dr. Lee's renewed motion for pretrial release on August 24, \n     2001. In his remarks at the plea hearing, Judge Parker \n     expressed his sentiments, telling Dr. Lee that ``since by \n     the terms of the plea agreement that frees you today \n     without conditions, it becomes clear that the Executive \n     Branch now concedes, or should concede, that it was not \n     necessary to confine you last December or at any time \n     before your trial.'' \\266\\\n       The Case Against Dr. Lee\n       Had the government not reached a plea agreement with Dr. \n     Lee, the case was scheduled for trial in late November 2000. \n     When the government settled, many questioned the \n     appropriateness of the plea agreement because it seemed to be \n     in such stark contrast with what the government had argued \n     all along. To ascertain whether the plea agreement was \n     appropriate, it is first necessary to examine the \n     government's case.\n       Although the government would likely have won a conviction \n     because many elements of the charged conduct were not \n     disputed Dr. Lee could not credibly deny that he had made the \n     tapes containing vast quantities of classified nuclear \n     weapons data this would not have been an easy case. The \n     government faced a number of obstacles, including: (1) \n     challenges to the government's claims about the importance of \n     the material on the missing tapes, (2) threats by Dr. Lee's \n     attorney to take the government on a ``long, slow death march \n     under CIPA,'' (3) claims that Dr. Lee was the victim of \n     selective prosecution based on racial profiling, and (4) the \n     issue of Dr. and Mrs. Lee's assistance to the government \n     during the 1980s. None of these obstacles would have been \n     unsurmountable. Each is discussed below.\n       The Importance of the Missing Tapes\n       As previously noted, government witnesses testified at Dr. \n     Lee's bail hearing that the information on the tapes was the \n     ``crown jewels'' of our nuclear secrets that could, in the \n     wrong hands, change the global strategic balance. When Dr. \n     Lee's lawyers renewed their motion for pretrial release in \n     July 2000, they made a direct assault on this claim. The \n     defense offered depositions from Dr. Harold Agnew, former \n     Director of LANL, and Dr. Walter Goad, a Fellow Emeritus at \n     LANL, both of whom took issue with the government's \n     characterization of the material on the tapes. Dr. Lee's \n     lawyers also noted that the information in question was not \n     classified at the highest level--Top Secret--and had, in \n     fact, been placed in a special category called ``Protect as \n     Restricted Data'' or PARD when Dr. Lee downloaded it.\n       When Judge Parker held three days of hearings in August \n     2000 to consider Dr. Lee's renewed motion for pretrial \n     release, he got testimony from Dr. John Richter that the \n     information on the tapes was 99% unclassified.\\267\\ The \n     government was also forced to acknowledge that the \n     information in question was classified as Secret \n     Restricted Data (SRD) rather than Top Secret Restricted \n     Data (TSRD), and could therefore be sent through certified \n     or registered mail, as demonstrated in the following \n     excerpt from the hearing on August 17:\n\n       Mr. Cline: SRD, unlike TSRD, can be, for example, double \n     wrapped and sent by registered mail from one classified \n     location to another, can it not?\n\n[[Page S13813]]\n\n       Dr. Robinson: That is true today, yes.\n       Mr. Cline: And TSRD can not be sent by mail?\n       Dr. Robinson: That is correct.\n       Mr. Cline: . . . . the information that we are talking \n     about here, which has been described as the crown jewels, \n     could be double wrapped and sent by registered mail from \n     Washington, D.C. to New Mexico, correct?\n       Dr. Robinson: Correct.\\268\\\n\n       The defense team also noted that the material Dr. Lee had \n     downloaded fell into a category called Protect As Restricted \n     Data, or PARD, when he made the tapes. The definition of \n     PARD, taken from the U.S. Department of Energy Office of \n     Security Glossary of Terms, is as follows: A handling method \n     for computer-generated numerical data or related information \n     which is not readily recognized as classified or unclassified \n     because of the high volume of output and low density of \n     potentially classified data.\\269\\\n       As described in the judge's order for Dr. Lee's pretrial \n     release, the effect of the expert opinions offered by Drs. \n     Agnew, Goad and Richter, the defense's showing that the \n     material was SRD as opposed to TSRD, and that the material \n     was marked as PARD when it was downloaded was to ``show that \n     the information Dr. Lee took is less valuable than the \n     government had led the Court to believe it was and less \n     sensitive than previously described to the Court. . . .'' \n     \\270\\\n       Judge Parker also raised a question as to whether the \n     missing tapes contained ``all the information needed to build \n     a functional thermonuclear weapon.'' \\271\\ He went on to say, \n     ``In sum, I am confronted with radically divergent opinions \n     expressed by several distinguished United States nuclear \n     weapons scientists who are on opposite sides of the issue of \n     the importance of the information Dr. Lee took.\\272\\ The \n     judge's findings on the sensitivity of the material on the \n     tapes were a principal factor in his decision to order Dr. \n     Lee's pretrial release, which he did on August 24, 2000.\n       When the government settled the case with a plea agreement \n     less than three weeks later, it gave the impression that it \n     was backing away from its claims about the importance of the \n     material. This had the unfortunate effect of reinforcing \n     the public perception that the government was persecuting, \n     rather than prosecuting Dr. Lee. Like the judge, the \n     subcommittee can only rely on the testimony of expert \n     witnesses, but it seems that the government's witnesses \n     made the stronger arguments in this regard.\n       The most concise description of the information Dr. Lee \n     downloaded is found in the government's public filing in \n     response to Dr. Lee's appeal of Judge Parker's initial denial \n     of bail, the relevant portions of which are excerpted below:\n       ``The source codes model and simulate every aspect of the \n     complex physics process involved in creating a thermonuclear \n     explosion. The source codes are written to design specific \n     portions of a nuclear weapon--either the primary or the \n     secondary.\n       ``Although nuclear weapons source codes contain all of the \n     physics involved in a thermonuclear weapon, the source codes \n     themselves require ``data files''--both classified and \n     unclassified--to run actual simulations. Data files contain \n     all of the physical and nuclear properties of materials \n     required for a nuclear explosion. . . . Data files become \n     classified as SRD [Secret Restricted Data] when the \n     properties of the materials are most directly relevant to \n     nuclear weapons, i.e., in environments involving very high \n     pressures and temperatures. . . .\n       `` `Input decks' are mathematical descriptions of the \n     actual geometry and materials within a nuclear device itself. \n     In essence, an input deck is an `electronic blueprint' of \n     either a primary or a secondary within a nuclear weapon.\n       ``. . . [Dr.] Lee down-partitioned and downloaded all of \n     LANL's significant nuclear weapon primary and secondary \n     design codes in their entirety. . . . In addition, Lee down-\n     partitioned and downloaded ``all of the data files required \n     to operate those codes,'' as well as multiple input decks \n     representing actual nuclear bomb designs that ranged in \n     sophistication from relatively simple to complex.\n       ``. . . . For a group or state that did not have the \n     indigenous scientific capability to do it alone, the \n     information would represent an immediate capability to design \n     a credible nuclear explosive. A country that had some \n     experience with nuclear explosives could use the information \n     to optimize its nuclear bombs. An advanced nuclear state \n     could use the information to augment their own knowledge of \n     nuclear explosives and to uncover vulnerabilities in the \n     American arsenal which would help them to defeat our weapons \n     through anti-ballistic missile systems or other means.'' \n     \\273\\\n       At the August detention hearings, government scientists \n     elaborated on the significance of the material and, \n     specifically the increased importance that came from the way \n     the files had been put together on the tapes. Dr. Paul \n     Robinson, president of Sandia National Laboratories, \n     testified that the tapes ``were very carefully designed to be \n     loaded with the subroutines that would be needed for each \n     design code to be placed right behind that design code. And \n     so I believe they should not require a lot of additional \n     instruction.\\274\\ In other words, the collection of files was \n     more than just a collection of files--it had been assembled \n     so as to ensure that the data files called for in the codes \n     were available at the right place, making it possible for the \n     codes to actually run when executed.\n       The government also explained its rationale for claiming \n     that the information on the tapes could change the global \n     strategic balance. After a lengthy discussion of the \n     technical aspects of ballistic missile defense and the \n     challenges presented by Multiple Independently Targeted \n     Reentry Vehicles (MIRVs), which are generally quite small, \n     Dr. Robinson expressed his concern that the tapes Dr. Lee \n     made could enable another nation to develop devices that \n     would have reentry vehicles approximately the size of \n     orange traffic cones. \\275\\ Such small warheads would \n     present an enormous challenge to U.S. ballistic missile \n     defenses, even more difficult than that of defending \n     against single warhead weapons which are larger (about the \n     size of a minivan or small bus).\n       While it might be tempting to simply state that one group \n     of scientist's arguments on this issue is most persuasive, it \n     is not necessary to do so. One of the key witnesses who \n     testified in support of Dr. Lee's position at the August 2000 \n     hearings, Dr. John Richter, subsequently modified his \n     position. The following exchange took place at an October 3, \n     2000 hearing before the Department of Justice Oversight \n     subcommittee:\n\n       Senator Specter: Dr. Richter, you have been quoted as \n     testifying before Judge Parker that at least 99 percent of \n     the nuclear secrets that Dr. Lee downloaded to tapes were \n     unclassified. Is that an accurate statement?\n       Dr. Richter: An accurate statement regarding the codes. I \n     still maintain that. The materials properties, I do not think \n     I was referring to that at that time, If I did say it that \n     way then I did not mean it and I erred.\\276\\\n\n       Dr. Richter also acknowledged that the input decks \n     contained important information, \\277\\ but ultimately took \n     the position that the loss of the information on the tapes \n     would be ``marginally harmful, at worst.'' \\278\\\n       In evaluating Dr. Richter's opinion on the value of the \n     information on the tapes, it is helpful to consider that ``in \n     1995, he was the first to suggest that the Chinese might have \n     significant information about the W-88 warhead. Even though \n     he eventually backed off that opinion, it helped start the \n     investigation that led to the discovery of Dr. Lee's download \n     and his jailing.'' \\279\\ Dr. Richter later put his dual roles \n     at the start and at the end of the Wen Ho Lee case in \n     perspective for a reporter when he said, ``If I had any \n     influence in getting him out, I figured that's a payback.'' \n     \\280\\\n       In sum, the information on the tapes was clearly important. \n     It does not necessarily follow, however, that the government \n     was right to hold Dr. Lee in harsh pretrial conditions on \n     that basis. In fact, in the August hearings, the judge was \n     only ruling on the question of whether not Dr. Lee should \n     remain in pretrial confinement--under conditions that were \n     considerably harsher than he would be subjected to if he had \n     been convicted. If the case had gone to trial, the government \n     would undoubtedly have prevailed on the matter of whether \n     or not the material on the tapes was important. The \n     government's error was not in claiming the material was \n     important, but in claiming that the only way to protect it \n     was to hold Dr. Lee under such harsh conditions.\n       The Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) issues\n       CIPA establishes a framework for handling trials involving \n     classified information, with the objective of protecting both \n     national security information and the rights of the \n     defendant. One of the key concepts in CIPA is the provision \n     permitting substitutions for classified information to \n     prevent the government from having to expose that information \n     at trial. Rather than show the actual material at trial, the \n     government is permitted to offer a document that conveys the \n     same information in unclassified form. The judge presiding \n     over the case reviews the material in question and the \n     government's proposed substitutions. If the judge finds that \n     the substitutions are an adequate representation of the \n     material in question, the case goes forward. If the judge \n     finds the government's substitutions lacking, the government \n     can make an interlocutory appeal of the judge's ruling, \n     meaning that the appeal is decided before the case goes \n     forward rather than after as is the usual fashion. If the \n     government loses a CIPA ruling, it can also simply drop the \n     case.\n       Although the prosecution of Dr. Lee ended before the CIPA \n     issues were fully tested in court, the defense clearly \n     intended to implement a classic graymail tactic of forcing \n     the government to dismiss the case by claiming that secret \n     information had to be revealed in open court to guarantee \n     their client a fair trial. According to U.S. Attorney Norman \n     Bay:\n       ``In late May, we met with defense counsel in this case. . \n     . . And the defense lawyer said that he would never take a \n     plea to any count in the indictment--that is, `he' being Dr. \n     Lee--and that if the Government wasn't willing to accept, the \n     defense was going to put the United States on a, quote, \n     `long, slow death march under CIPA.' '' \\281\\\n       Senator Specter replied, ``Mr. Bay, if somebody had told me \n     when I was a prosecuting attorney they were going to put me \n     on a long, slow death march, I would say let's start \n     walking.\\282\\\n       One of Dr. Lee's attorneys, Mr. John Cline, was the lead \n     attorney on CIPA issues. He told the judge that using \n     classified information in the trial: would be necessary for\n\n[[Page S13814]]\n\n     proving four central defense arguments: that most of the \n     downloaded material was already in the public domain; that \n     some of the computer codes contained flaws that made them \n     less useful; that the codes were related to Dr. Lee's work; \n     and that they were difficult to use without user manuals, \n     which were not on the tapes.'' \\283\\\n       The defense found a sympathetic ear with Judge Parker on \n     these issues. In an order filed August 1, 2000, the judge \n     gave the government two weeks to provide substitute language \n     for specified classified information. He agreed with Dr. \n     Lee (and opposed the government) as to the relevance of \n     particular information to the defense. For example, Judge \n     Parker said that:\n       ``Although the parties dispute the existence or magnitude \n     of any `flaws' or imperfections in the various codes at \n     issue, the Court nonetheless finds that evidence of those \n     alleged flaws or imperfections is relevant to the Defendant's \n     intent to secure an advantage to a foreign nation or to \n     injure the United States. Evidence of these alleged flaws and \n     imperfections is also relevant for use in the Defendant's \n     cross-examination of witnesses and in the Defendant's \n     rebuttal of Government witnesses' testimony on the issue of \n     the sensitive nature of these codes.'' \\284\\\n       The Court delivered another blow to the Government when he \n     ruled that:\n       ``Evidence making a comparison of the input decks of Files \n     1 through 19 and Tape N to a nuclear weapons blueprint is \n     relevant to the Defendant's intent. In addition, this \n     evidentiary comparison is relevant to the cross-examination \n     of witnesses and to the Defendant's rebuttal of Government \n     witnesses' testimony on the Government's assertion that the \n     input decks constitute an electronic blueprint of a nuclear \n     weapon.'' \\285\\\n       Consonant with these determinations, the judge ordered the \n     government to propose substitutions by August 14, with the \n     defense to respond by August 21. Any issues that could not be \n     agreed upon were to be resolved at a hearing on August \n     31.\\286\\\n       The government was perhaps most concerned that the argument \n     about flaws in the codes could force an in-depth discussion \n     of the codes in open court, something it was not prepared to \n     do. There was also a very real concern about permitting Dr. \n     Lee to make a comparison between an actual blueprint and the \n     electronic version of a weapon contained in the input deck. \n     These would have been challenges, but the government had not \n     taken any of its appeals when it made the plea deal, and was \n     a long way from having to cede the case on CIPA grounds.\n       Allegations of Selective Prosecution/Racial Profiling\n       Among the more sensational allegations of government \n     misconduct in this case are charges that Dr. Lee was selected \n     for investigation and prosecution based on his ethnicity. The \n     terms ``selective prosecution'' and ``racial profiling'' have \n     been used to describe how the government allegedly decided to \n     focus on Dr. Lee. The subcommittee's review of these \n     allegations shows that the evidence simply does not support \n     charges that Dr. Lee's ethnic heritage was a decisive factor \n     in the government's actions during any phase of this case.\n       In June 2000, Dr. Lee's defense team filed a motion ``for \n     discovery of materials relevant to establishing that the \n     government has engaged in unconstitutional selective \n     prosecution.'' \\287\\ As grounds for this discovery request, \n     the defense team claimed that Dr. Lee had ``concrete proof \n     that the government improperly targeted him for criminal \n     prosecution because he is 'ethnic Chinese.''' \\288\\ The \n     defense's memorandum cited four examples as proof of such \n     targeting:\n       ``A sworn declaration from a LANL counterintelligence \n     official who participated in the investigation of Dr. Lee \n     that Dr. Lee was improperly targeted for prosecution because \n     he was ``ethnic Chinese.''\n       ``Videotaped statements of the FBI Deputy director who \n     supervised counterintelligence investigations until last year \n     admitting that the FBI engaged in racial profiling of Dr. Lee \n     and other ethnic Chinese for criminal counterintelligence \n     investigations.\n       ``The sworn affidavit the U.S. Attorney's Office used to \n     obtain the warrant to search Dr. Lee's home, in which the FBI \n     affidavit incorrectly claimed that Dr. Lee was more likely to \n     have committed espionage for the People's Republic of China \n     (PRC) because he was ``overseas ethnic Chinese.''\n       ``A posting to the Los Alamos Employees Forum by a LANL \n     employee who assisted counterintelligence investigations and \n     personally observed that the DOE engaged in racial profiling \n     of Asian-Americans at Los Alamos during these \n     investigations.'' \\289\\\n       The memorandum went on to explain that even if Dr. Lee did \n     not have the direct evidence of bias, he had:\n       ``satisfied the stringent requirements of United States v. \n     Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456 (1996), which held that . . . a \n     defendant is nevertheless entitled to discovery if he \n     provides some evidence that similarly situated people have \n     not been prosecuted and that his investigation and \n     prosecution were caused by improper racial motivations.'' \n     \\290\\\n       At the plea hearing in September 2000, Judge Parker noted \n     from the bench that the government had made a deal with Dr. \n     Lee only a short time before it would have been required to \n     produce to the judge a substantial volume of material on the \n     selective prosecution issue,\\291\\ raising the inference that \n     the government reached the plea agreement to avoid its \n     discovery obligations on the selective prosecution issue. A \n     Department of Energy review of ethnic bias within the \n     department concluded that there was room for improvement on \n     ethnic sensitivity,\\292\\ but none of the survey's results \n     supported the allegations that Dr. Lee had been targeted \n     because of his ethnicity. An April 2001 review by DOE \n     Inspector General Gregory Friedman was even more direct, \n     concluding that ``information reviewed by the Office of \n     Inspector General did not support concerns regarding unfair \n     treatment based on national origin in the security processes \n     reviewed.'' \\293\\\n       Because these charges have not been rebutted, the public \n     may have been left with the impression that Dr. Lee's \n     allegations were correct, and that the government acted out \n     of racial or ethnic prejudice. Any such impression is \n     injurious to the public's trust in the institutions which are \n     charged with enforcing the nation's laws and must be properly \n     addressed.\n       In pleading the case that Dr. Lee was targeted for criminal \n     investigation because he is ethnic Chinese, Dr. Lee's lawyers \n     alleged that ``the troubling chain of events that led to Dr. \n     Lee's indictment began when the DOE's Chief Intelligence \n     Officer, Notra Trulock, incorrectly concluded in 1995 that \n     the PRC had obtained the design information for the W-88 \n     warhead from someone at the Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory.'' \\294\\ The defense memorandum further alleges \n     that the Administrative Inquiry which was issued by Mr. \n     Trulock in May 1996 listed Dr. Lee as the main suspect, \n     prompting the FBI to open a criminal investigation of Dr. \n     Lee.\\295\\\n       There is legitimate debate about the scope and conclusions \n     of the AI, and that subject is addressed elsewhere in this \n     report, but the defense's allegations are inaccurate in two \n     major ways. First, the memorandum overstates Mr. Trulock's \n     role in the development of the AI, which was written by Dan \n     Bruno and an FBI Special Agent who was assigned to the DOE \n     for the purpose of helping to conduct the AI. Although Mr. \n     Trulock was an aggressive advocate in the 1995-1996 period of \n     the argument that the Chinese nuclear weapons program had \n     successfully targeted the U.S. labs for espionage, he had \n     only a limited role in the investigation which resulted in \n     the list of names upon which Dr. and Mrs. Lee appeared. \n     Second, and more importantly, the defense memorandum fails to \n     acknowledge that the FBI was predisposed to focus on Dr. Lee \n     because he was already under investigation, albeit at a lower \n     level than what happened after the AI was issued.\n       The cumulative effect of these errors has been to create \n     the incorrect impression that somehow Mr. Trulock was \n     directly or primarily responsible for the government's focus \n     on Dr. Lee. The defense memorandum fails to even address the \n     question of how Mr. Trulock supposedly played a role in the \n     prosecution of Dr. Lee when Mr. Trulock left government \n     service in August 1999, nearly four months before Dr. Lee was \n     indicted.\\296\\\n       To bolster its case that Mr. Trulock was responsible for \n     focusing on Dr. Lee, the defense memorandum cites Mr. Robert \n     Vrooman, who was Chief Counterintelligence Officer at LANL \n     from 1987 until 1998. The defense quoted Mr. Vrooman as \n     saying that ``Mr. Trulock's office chose to focus \n     specifically on Dr. Lee because he is `ethnic Chinese.' \n     Caucasians with the same background and foreign contacts as \n     Dr. Lee were ignored,'' and that ``racial profiling was a \n     crucial component in the FBI's identifying Dr. Lee as a \n     suspect.'' \\297\\\n       The bevy of civil lawsuits that this case has spawned will \n     have to sort out whether anyone has violated anyone else's \n     rights or engaged in slander or defamation, but for the \n     purposes of this report, several observations about Mr. \n     Vrooman's allegations are appropriate. First, his statement \n     that ``Caucasians with the same background and foreign \n     contacts as Dr. Lee were ignored'' is factually incorrect. \n     While any fair reading of the document would suggest that \n     the authors of the AI were of the opinion that Dr. and \n     Mrs. Lee were the prime suspects, the document also listed \n     several other individuals, some of whom were Caucasian, \n     and recommended that the others be investigated as well. \n     Therefore, it is simply inaccurate to state that Mr. \n     Trulock's office focused specifically on Dr. Lee, for any \n     reason, let alone because he was ethnic Chinese.\n       Second, Mr. Vrooman raised questions in the late 1980s \n     about Dr. Lee's contacts with Chinese officials and \n     identified Dr. Lee to Energy Department officials as a \n     potential suspect in the W-88 case.\\298\\ He also formerly \n     subscribed to the theory that the Chinese had obtained \n     information about the W-88 through espionage, telling the FBI \n     at one point of a ``smoking gun'' in the case.\\299\\ Thus, \n     although Mr. Vrooman has become critical of the conclusions \n     of the AI and its focus on Dr. Lee, he was instrumental in \n     relaying the DOE analysis regarding the extent of the PRC \n     espionage to the FBI. Had Mr. Vrooman doubted the analysis of \n     the DOE's review group, he could have raised those concerns \n     then rather than saying that a smoking gun had been \n     discovered. When challenged on this point during a hearing, \n     Mr. Vrooman said that he had called Mr. Trulock's office in \n     May 1996, but Mr. Trulock was not in. He said that he did not \n     further pursue the matter because:\n       ``My supervisor, who was the lab's director, told me he \n     wanted me to improve my relationship with Mr. Trulock and \n     what I was about to say would not have done that.\n       ``So we decided, as a matter of course, to let the FBI have \n     this case. We had worked with the FBI for years. They had \n     always protected people's civil rights and did the case\n\n[[Page S13815]]\n\n     well and we thought they would quickly come to the same \n     conclusion we had.'' \\300\\\n       Mr. Vrooman also said that he met weekly with FBI agents on \n     the case and routinely expressed reservations, which came to \n     a head in December 1998 when ``we were basically thinking \n     that Lee was not the right man.'' \\301\\ Given that Mr. \n     Vrooman retired from Los Alamos on March 13, 1998,\\302\\ it \n     remains unclear as to how he was sufficiently informed on the \n     case in December of that year to make judgements of this \n     sort.\n       And, finally, it should be noted that Mr. Vrooman was one \n     of the three individuals disciplined for his role in failing \n     to remove Dr. Lee from access after the Director of the FBI \n     recommended twice in late 1997 that Dr. Lee's clearance be \n     removed.\\303\\ The subsequent discovery that Dr. Lee had been \n     engaged in massive illegal downloading reflects poorly on Mr. \n     Vrooman's conduct as the lab's counterintelligence chief and \n     gives him a strong motive to minimize Dr. Lee's conduct and \n     to allege government discrimination. Any assessment of Mr. \n     Vrooman's opinion of the government's handling of the \n     case against Dr. Lee must be made with these facts in \n     mind.\n       Furthermore, when pressed for examples of supposed bias on \n     the part of the government, Mr. Vrooman fell short. At an \n     October 3, 2000 hearing of the Judiciary subcommittee on \n     Department of Justice Oversight, Senator Grassley pursued \n     this line of questioning. Senator Grassley asked for \n     information to substantiate Mr. Vrooman's allegation that \n     whenever Dr. Lee's motive [for the alleged espionage against \n     the United States] was discussed, it came down to ethnicity. \n     The following exchange occurred:\n\n       Mr. Vrooman: Well, the Department of Justice representative \n     asked the FBI what Lee's motive was because it was not clear \n     to him and the response was an elaboration on how the Chinese \n     focus their efforts on ethnic Chinese. That is one example. \n     And there are others, conversations over the years since this \n     investigation proceeded, that that was the only motive.\n       Senator Grassley: Okay. Could you point to any \n     documentation that would back up the point that was just \n     made?\n       Mr. Vrooman: No, sir, I cannot.\n       Senator Grassley: Or the points that you are making about \n     ethnicity being of prime concern?\n       Mr. Vrooman: I do not believe there are any documents.\\304\\\n\n       In fact, there are documents which describe Dr. Lee's \n     motives, but they run counter to what Mr. Vrooman alleges. In \n     the November 10, 1998 request for electronic surveillance on \n     Dr. Lee, the newly appointed FBI case agent describes several \n     incidents from Dr. Lee's past and states their relevance to \n     the issue of motive. One section of this November 1998 FISA \n     request from the Albuquerque office describes how Dr. Lee \n     sent numerous documents to Taiwan's Coordinating Council of \n     North America (CCNA) in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and \n     says that Dr. Lee told the FBI that:\n       ``his motive for sending the publications was brought on \n     out of a desire to help in scientific exchange. During the \n     same interview, Dr. Lee stated that he helps other scientists \n     routinely, and had no desire to receive any monetary or any \n     other type of reward.''\\305\\\n       The memo continues, saying the Albuquerque Division of the \n     FBI believes that Dr. Lee's actions in sending these \n     documents to a foreign government without proper \n     authorization ``shows that Wen Ho Lee has the propensity to \n     commit and engage in the crime of espionage to include \n     willingly providing documentation to foreign officials. . . \n     .''\\306\\ This discussion of motive makes no mention of Dr. \n     Lee's ethnicity. If documents or information provided to a \n     foreign government could injure the United States or aid a \n     foreign country, the crime of espionage has still been \n     committed even if the transfer was motivated by a desire to \n     promote scientific exchange and in the absence of a desire \n     for monetary reward.\n       The November 10, 1998 memorandum also describes a meeting \n     at Los Alamos in early 1994 during which it became apparent \n     that Dr. Lee had a relationship with a top PRC nuclear \n     weapons scientist. A reliable source quoted this top PRC \n     nuclear scientist as saying of Dr. Lee, ``We know him very \n     well. He came to Beijing and helped us a lot.'' \\307\\ The \n     source further reported that Dr. Lee had helped the \n     Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics ``with various \n     computational codes used in fluid dynamics which is a very \n     important aspect of thermal nuclear [sic] weapons design \n     work.'' \\308\\ The Albuquerque memo cited these specific \n     acts as showing ``Wen Ho Lee's propensity to associate \n     with foreign governments and provide information to \n     foreign governments and therefore the propensity to aid in \n     and commit acts of espionage.'' \\309\\ These statements \n     demonstrate clearly that the government's assertions about \n     Dr. Lee's motives were based on specific acts he was known \n     to have committed rather than on the fact that he is \n     ethnic Chinese. These specific acts gave the government \n     ample reason to investigate him and the allegations of Mr. \n     Vrooman and others, that the government relied only on \n     ethnic profiling, are simply incorrect.\n       In fact, all of the arguments put forward by Dr. Lee's \n     lawyers on the racial profiling issue are a skewed \n     interpretation of the same point--namely the U.S. \n     government's recognition that the PRC intelligence services \n     focus on Chinese-Americans. Consider the second and third \n     examples cited in the discovery memorandum, where the defense \n     claims that former FBI Deputy Director Paul Moore has \n     confirmed that Dr. Lee was targeted by the FBI due to racial \n     profiling, and that the affidavit in support of a search \n     warrant for Dr. Lee's home claimed that Dr. Lee was more \n     likely to have engaged in espionage for the PRC because he \n     was ethnic Chinese. Neither of these claims stands up to even \n     the most minimal level of scrutiny because both are \n     misrepresentations of what was actually said.\n       The defense memorandum on selective prosecution quotes \n     former FBI Deputy Director Paul Moore as saying in a \n     televised interview with Jim Lehrer on December 14, 1999:\n       ``There is racial profiling based on ethnic background. \n     It's done by the People's Republic of China. . . . Now the \n     FBI comes along and it applies a profile, so do the other \n     agencies who do counter intelligence investigations they \n     apply a profile, and the profile is based on People's \n     Republic of China, PRC intelligence activities. So, the FBI \n     is committed to following the PRC's intelligence program \n     wherever it leads. If the PRC is greatly interested in the \n     activities of Chinese-Americans, the FBI is greatly \n     interested in the activities of the PRC as [regards] Chinese-\n     Americans.'' \\310\\\n       To say that the United States government is cognizant of \n     the fact that the PRC prefers to target individuals for \n     elicitation based on their ethnicity is completely different \n     from saying that an individual would be more likely to engage \n     in espionage because he or she is a member of a particular \n     ethnic group. The former statement about recruitment efforts \n     of PRC intelligence services would be a logical, relevant \n     and acceptable observation so long as it was based on \n     fact. The latter statement, implying that an individual \n     would be more likely to engage in espionage on the basis \n     of his or her race, would be an outrageous, biased and \n     unacceptable claim that would have no place in any law \n     enforcement or counterintelligence investigation.\n       In the Wen Ho Lee case, the government's assertions were \n     confined to acknowledging that the PRC focused on overseas \n     ethnic Chinese, without making inferences that the targeted \n     individuals would be more likely to respond positively \n     because of their Chinese heritage. The defense memorandum \n     cites FBI Special Agent Michael Lowe's April 9, 1999 \n     affidavit in support of a search warrant, saying that it \n     leaves no doubt that improper racial profiling was a \n     substantial basis for the targeting of Dr. Lee. The defense's \n     assertion on this point is incorrect. In relevant part, the \n     affidavit says:\n       ``. . . PRC intelligence operations virtually always target \n     overseas ethnic Chinese with access to intelligence \n     information sought by the PRC. Travel to China is an integral \n     element of the Chinese intelligence collection tradecraft, \n     particularly when it involves overseas ethnic Chinese. FBI \n     analysis of previous Chinese counterintelligence \n     investigations indicates that the PRC uses travel to China as \n     a means to assess closely and evaluate potential intelligence \n     sources and agents, as a way to establish and reinforce \n     cultural and ethnic bonds with China, and as a safehaven in \n     which to recruit, task, and debrief established intelligence \n     agents.'' \\311\\\n       This does not allege that Dr. Lee is likely to have engaged \n     in espionage because he is ethnic Chinese, only that he is \n     likely to have been targeted by the PRC intelligence services \n     on that basis. All the defense memorandum shows is that if \n     there is any ethnic profiling done, it is done by the PRC. \n     Since the PRC had no role in the decision to investigate or \n     prosecute Dr. Lee, any bias on their part would be \n     irrelevant.\n       It should be noted that Dr. Lee's request for discovery \n     related to selective prosecution contained several factual \n     errors, including an incorrect claim that no one else had \n     ever been prosecuted under the Atomic Energy Act, and an \n     incorrect claim that the Department of Justice had never \n     prosecuted anyone under the espionage statutes without \n     evidence that classified material had been transferred to a \n     third party. These claims were shown to be incorrect in the \n     government's response to Dr. Lee's discovery request.\\312\\\n     The Relationship Between the Lees and the Government\n       Shortly after Dr. Lee was fired from LANL, he retained Mark \n     Holscher as his counsel. On May 6, 1999, Mr Holscher released \n     the following statement, which clearly indicated that any \n     prosecution of Dr. Lee would have to deal with the \n     Lees' cooperation with the government:\n       ``Dr. Wen Ho Lee has dedicated himself to the defense of \n     this country for the last 20 years. His work, much of which \n     is classified, has led directly to the increased Safety and \n     national security of all Americans, and he is responsible for \n     helping this country safely simulate nuclear tests.\n       ``In 1986 and 1988, Dr. Lee went to Mainland China to \n     present papers at two technical conferences. Dr. Lee's \n     participation in these conferences was pre-approved and \n     encouraged by the Los Alamos Laboratory and the Department of \n     Energy. These same entities also cleared the texts of the \n     papers given at these conferences, which covered mathematics \n     and physics topics.\n       ``The press has incorrectly reported that Dr. Lee made \n     ``several'' trips to Mainland China and also has failed to \n     report that his two trips were approved in advance by the Los \n     Alamos Laboratory and the Department of Energy. These two \n     approved trips were the only times Dr. Lee has ever traveled \n     to\n\n[[Page S13816]]\n\n     Mainland China. These false press reports do a disservice \n     both to Dr. Lee and the Los Alamos Laboratory.\n       ``The press reports also fail to include the fact that Dr. \n     Lee presented similar papers at conferences in several \n     countries throughout Western Europe and other parts of the \n     world. The false insinuations that Dr. Lee went to Mainland \n     China in the late 1980s with an improper purpose are unfair. \n     Not only did Dr. Lee go to Mainland China to present a \n     technical paper, his and his wife's attendance were with the \n     full knowledge and approval of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation.\n       ``There have been inaccurate press reports regarding the \n     circumstances surrounding Dr. and Mrs. Lee's cooperation with \n     the government. Mrs. Lee agreed to the FBI's request that she \n     assists it as a volunteer without pay in the FBI's efforts to \n     monitor Chinese scientists. She agreed to help the FBI with \n     the full knowledge and approval of Dr. Lee and continued to \n     do so for a number of years.\n       ``At the request of the FBI, Dr. Lee's wife attended the \n     1986 conference with him, where she voluntarily provided \n     background information on Chinese scientists. Dr. and Mrs. \n     Lee supported and agreed with the FBI's request that Mrs. Lee \n     assist it in obtaining background information on Chinese \n     scientists. It simply defies logic for critics to now allege \n     that Dr. Lee was engaged in improper activities in Mainland \n     China while he and his wife were there.\n       ``At no time during or after the pre-approved 1986 or 1988 \n     trips did Dr. Lee ever provide any classified information \n     whatsoever to any representative of Mainland China, nor has \n     he ever given any classified information to any unauthorized \n     persons. As was anticipated and approved by the U.S. \n     government, Dr. Lee and his wife socialized with Chinese \n     scientists. It was fully understood by the Department of \n     Energy and the Los Alamos Laboratory that the conferences \n     included social events with the participants.'' \\313\\\n       Had the case gone to trial, the government would have had \n     to confront the issue of its relationship with Dr. and Mrs. \n     Lee over a long period of time. As previously noted, Dr. Lee \n     assisted the FBI in a 1983-1984 investigation of a Lawrence \n     Livermore scientist. Notwithstanding the FBI's denial of any \n     assistance when the FISA request went forward in 1997, Dr. \n     Lee had, in fact, helped the FBI. Mrs. Lee's relationship \n     with the government would have been a substantially more \n     difficult matter to contend with.\n       In one discovery request, Dr. Lee's defense team asked for, \n     among other things, all information related to ``Sylvia Lee's \n     Cooperation with the FBI and CIA.'' Citing grand jury \n     testimony of the FBI case agent on the Wen Ho Lee matter, the \n     defense memorandum said that:\n       ``Sylvia Lee served as an FBI ``Information Asset'' between \n     1985 and 1991 in connection with visits to LANL by PRC \n     scientists. Her principal FBI contact was FBI Special Agent \n     David Bibb. On at least two occasions, Dr. Lee \n     attended meetings between Sylvia Lee and her FBI contact. \n     Sylvia Lee also met with [name redacted] and \n     representatives of the LANL internal security office to \n     provide information concerning PRC scientists.'' \\315\\\n       In its response, the government claimed that it had \n     produced all documents related to Lee's cooperation with the \n     FBI. Further, the government argued that while Dr. Lee's \n     purported assistance to the government might be relevant to a \n     jury in considering his criminal intent pursuant to the \n     Atomic Energy Act counts, Mrs. Lee's ``affiliation with the \n     FBI and/or the CIA has no bearing on Lee's criminal intent.'' \n     \\316\\\n       In a July 13, 2000 order, Judge Parker said that he would \n     address this issue by reviewing, in camera: (1) documents \n     reflecting Sylvia Lee's cooperation with the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), \n     and the Department of Energy (DOE), and (2) certain FBI \n     memoranda regarding the propriety of prosecuting the \n     Defendant.\\317\\ After reviewing this information, the judge \n     ruled that it contained information relevant to the defense \n     in several categories of exculpatory information:\n       1. [redacted];\n       2. The Defendant's cooperation with and provision of \n     information to Government agencies;\n       3. The Government agencies' assessments of cooperation by \n     and reliability of Sylvia Lee and the Defendant;\n       4. The Defendant's actions that may be perceived to be \n     inconsistent with an intent to secure an advantage for a \n     foreign nation; and\n       5. The Government agencies' conclusions about the \n     Defendant's motives.\\318\\\n       The relationship between the government and the Lees would \n     not likely have been a major part of any trial, but it \n     certainly had the potential to embarrass the government. The \n     laws on intelligence oversight set out strict procedures for \n     establishing a reporting relationship or an asset \n     relationship with an American citizen. Press reports suggest, \n     for example, that Mrs. Lee provided information to both the \n     FBI and the CIA, including repeated contacts in the mid-1980s \n     where a CIA agent was present for the meetings and paid for \n     the hotel room where the meetings took place.\\319\\ If the \n     government had failed to conform to any of the laws or \n     regulations in these matters, it could expect the defense to \n     bring them up at trial.\n       The Plea Agreement\n       After Judge Parker ruled that Dr. Lee had to be released \n     pending trial, the landscape shifted markedly. By September \n     13, the government reached the plea agreement which has been \n     previously described. When the judge accepted the plea \n     agreement, Dr. Lee was set free, subject only to the \n     requirement that he undergo three weeks of intense \n     debriefing, subject himself to a polygraph on questions \n     related to the case, and remain available to cooperate with \n     the FBI for a period of one year.\n       During the plea hearing, Judge Parker asked the government \n     to explain why the government considered the agreement to be \n     in the best interest of the nation. The government's lead \n     prosecutor, Mr. Stamboulidis, answered that the plea provided \n     the ``best chance to find out with confidence precisely what \n     happened to the classified material and data'' on the missing \n     tapes, which he said had been the government's ``transcending \n     concern.'' \\320\\ He also explained that the cooperation \n     agreement would allow the government to verify Dr. Lee's \n     statements, and that Dr. Lee would be at great risk if he \n     failed to fully cooperate or to be truthful. And, finally, \n     Mr. Stamboulidis said, ``this disposition avoids the public \n     dissemination of certain nuclear secrets which would have \n     necessarily occurred on the way towards proceeding towards \n     conviction in this case at trial.'' \\321\\\n       The judge was not entirely convinced, asking ``why the \n     government argued so vehemently that Dr. Lee's release \n     earlier would have been an extreme danger to the government \n     at this time he, under the agreement, will be released \n     without any restrictions?'' \\322\\\n       Referring to two sworn statements Dr. Lee had provided on \n     the morning of the plea hearing, Mr. Stamboulidis said that \n     Dr. Lee had finally, ``for the first time, given us these \n     assurances that he never intended any harm to our nation by \n     his mishandling these materials in an unlawful way and that \n     he never allowed them to fall into harm's way and compromise \n     national security.'' \\323\\\n       Again, the judge was not persuaded, saying, ``Throughout \n     this case, the government has repeatedly questioned the \n     veracity of Dr. Lee. You're saying now, simply because he has \n     given a statement under oath, the government no longer \n     believes he is a threat to national security?'' \\324\\\n       The judge appeared to be not so much concerned that the \n     plea agreement was inappropriate, but that it could have been \n     reached much sooner. He noted that the government had \n     rejected a written offer from Dr. Lee's attorneys to have Dr. \n     Lee explain the missing tapes under polygraph exam, which was \n     essentially the same deal the government got in the end \n     (minus the felony count). Judge Parker also reminded counsel \n     for both sides that at the December detention hearing he had \n     asked the parties to pursue the offer made by Mr. Holscher, \n     but nothing came of it. Mr. Stamboulidis took issue with the \n     judge, saying that after the indictment, the offer had been \n     withdrawn, to which Judge Parker replied:\n       ``Nothing came of it, and I was saddened by the fact that \n     nothing came of it. I did read the letters that were sent and \n     exchanged. I think I commented one time that I think both \n     sides prepared their letters primarily for use by the media \n     and not by me. Notwithstanding that, I thought my request \n     was not taken seriously into consideration.'' \\325\\\n       The net effect of Judge Parker's questions and the \n     government's apparent reversal on the matter of the threat \n     posed by Dr. Lee created the impression that the case had \n     collapsed. This led to some sharp questions to the Attorney \n     General and FBI Director Freeh at the September 2000 hearing. \n     Director Freeh explained that serious negotiations about a \n     plea agreement had begun during the summer at the direction \n     of Judge Parker, and reiterated that the over-arching reason \n     for the government's decision to make the agreement was to \n     find out what happened to the tapes.\\326\\\n       After noting that he and the Attorney General were in total \n     agreement with the decision on the plea deal, Director Freeh \n     outlined five other factors which figured into the \n     government's decision which are summarized below:\n       1. Judge Parker's strong suggestion that the case was \n     appropriate for mediation rather than trial;\n       2. Judge Parker's rulings in favor of the defendant in \n     initial proceedings under CIPA, which made it appear that Dr. \n     Lee might succeed in his attempt at graymail because the \n     judge's reasoning left little room to expect that the \n     government would prevail;\n       3. Judge Parker's August ruling (although stayed by the \n     Tenth Circuit) that created the ``very real prospect that Dr. \n     Lee would soon be released in any event under conditions that \n     we pointed out to the judge were inadequate to prevent Dr. \n     Lee's communications with others.''\n       4. The potential that the trial would become a ``battle of \n     the experts'' with regard to the classification level and \n     importance of the material on the tapes; and\n       5. The fact that ``the FBI's lead case agent had had to \n     correct erroneous testimony from the initial detention \n     hearing,'' including the agent's misstatement about Dr. Lee \n     telling another scientist he wanted to use his computer to \n     download a resume (when Dr. Lee had actually said he wanted \n     to download some files), and the agent's overstatement of \n     evidence relating to whether Dr. Lee had sent letters to find \n     outside employment.\\327\\\n       Director Freeh's statements provide a compelling rationale \n     for the government's decision to accept the plea agreement. \n     What has not been adequately explained, however, is the \n     decision to keep Dr. Lee in such onerous conditions of \n     pretrial confinement. After\n\n[[Page S13817]]\n\n     careful review, it becomes apparent that the government was \n     right to reach a plea agreement with Dr. Lee, whose actions \n     did constitute a serious threat to the national security, but \n     was wrong to hold him virtually incommunicado in pretrial \n     confinement for more than nine months.\n\n\n                                Endnotes\n\n       1. ``Plea and Disposition Agreement,'' United States vs. \n     Wen Ho Lee, Criminal No. 99-1417 JP, 13 September 2000: 2.\n       2.

The initial plan was to commission a Task Force, which \n     I would chair. By October, Senator Hatch had prepared a \n     resolution transferring me from the Constitution Subcommittee \n     to the subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \n     Courts, and spelling out the areas of inquiry and special \n     procedures applicable to the investigation. In the end, the \n     subcommittee's investigation was conducted pursuant to two \n     subpoena resolutions which spelled out, in general terms, the \n     investigative mandate. The first subpoena resolution, adopted \n     by a vote of 18-0 on October 14, 1999, authorized the \n     charirman, in consultation with the ranking member, to issue \n     a subpoena requiring the Attorney General to produce certain \n     documents if they were not delivered voluntarily.

The FBI could tell from the text of the intercepted \n     call that Dr. Lee had heard of the other scientist through a \n     mutual friend. What the FBI could not learn from that call, \n     and what Dr. Lee did not fully explain until sometime later, \n     was that he had learned about the other scientist when he \n     visited LLNL in October, 1982.

FBI Director Freeh testified at a joint hearing of the \n     Senate Judiciary and Select Intelligence Committees on \n     September 26, 2000 that ``the FBI's investigation into this \n     1994 matter was still ongoing when Dr. Lee emerged as a \n     potential subject in the 1996 administrative inquiry.  .  .  \n     . Being aware of the potential interest in Dr. Lee, and \n     not wanting to take any steps that would interfere with \n     the inquiry or expose the FBI's interest in him, FBI \n     headquarters and FBI Albuquerque agreed to hold the \n     investigation of the 1994 investigation in abeyance.'' See \n     hearing transcript, 46-47.

Even if DOE computer personnel and counterintelligence \n     were unaware that Dr. Lee was under investigation by the FBI, \n     and that would have been possible in 1994, it would not have \n     been inappropriate for DOE to share records of systems like \n     NADIR with the FBI. This has the benefit of allowing the FBI \n     to find out if any individuals are being flagged by security \n     and monitoring systems, without alerting computer personnel \n     to the investigation.\n       55.

In his written statement to the Joint Hearing of the \n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Judiciary \n     Committee on September 26, 2000, Director Freeh said, ``One \n     approach that was taken during that interview was not \n     consistent with the conduct expected of agents during an \n     interview. Specifically, Dr. Lee was reminded of the fate of \n     Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed for espionage. \n     Confrontational interviews often call for tough statements by \n     investigators, but that implication was inappropriate. Again, \n     Dr. Lee ended the interview without providing any useful \n     information and without giving any indication of the actions \n     to which he has now pled guilty.'' When asked by Senator \n     Specter at the September 26 hearing about the Rosenberg \n     reference and the harsh conditions of confinement and the \n     inference that these measures might be intended to coerce a \n     confession, Director Freeh responded, ``I would disagree very \n     strongly with the suggestion or the notion that anything was \n     done with respect to confinement, or anything else in this \n     case, to improperly or unfairly treat Dr. Lee.'' See hearing \n     transcript, 81.\n       180. For a discussion of the issue of how Dr. Lee's name \n     was leaked to the press, see pages 53, 54, 64 and 65 of the \n     transcript of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Department \n     of Justice Oversight hearing on October 3, 2000, during which \n     Mr. Trulock says that NYT reporter James Risen told him that \n     Energy Secretary Richardson leaked Dr. Lee's name to the \n     media. Secretary Richardson vehemently denied being the \n     source of the leak, both in a letter to Senator Hatch on \n     October 3, 2000, in which he said he had received a letter \n     from Senator Specter requesting a hearing on the basis of Mr. \n     Trulock's statement. In reply, Secretary Richardson said, \n     ``Mr. Risen has denied that he made this statement to Mr. \n     Trulock, and I categorically deny that I shared Mr. Lee's \n     name with Mr. Risen.'' Secretary Richardson made the same \n     denials to Senator Specter in a meeting on October 5, 2000, \n     but a review of the articles in question shows that Secretary \n     Richardson gave an on the record interview in which he named \n     Dr. Lee and made several comments about his lack of \n     cooperation. Although Dr. Lee's name had first appeared in \n     the press in an AP article the day before, Secretary \n     Richardson confirmed on the record that Dr. Lee was the \n     individual who had been fired for security violations.\n       181. See, for example, the September 28, 1999 press release \n     from the FBI National Press Office which states that Special \n     Agent in Charge Steve Dillard ``has been appointed as \n     Inspector in Charge of a task force composed of FBI Special \n     Agents and analysts that will investigate the possible theft \n     or compromise of classified information from United States \n     nuclear laboratories. . . .''

According to a chronology prepared by the Justice \n     Department, the discovery occurred on March 23, 1999. That it \n     took more than two weeks after Dr. Lee had been dismissed \n     from LANL (and nearly three weeks after he gave permission to \n     search his office) to find this document is very troubling.\n       195.

Although the subcommittee has not had access to the \n     files from the criminal case against Dr. Lee, it should be \n     noted that none of the information otherwise available \n     suggests that the government applied for a Title III wiretap \n     between March and December 1999. If the government was \n     concerned that\n\n[[Page S13820]]\n\n     he might somehow communicate the existence of the tapes to a \n     third party, it should have requested a wiretap. It may be \n     that the wiretap was requested and received, but the absence \n     of any such request would strongly undermine the government's \n     claim that restricting his communications was necessary to \n     protect the tapes.\n       200. Unless otherwise noted, all the information in this \n     section is drawn from a chronology prepared by the Department \n     of Justice and forwarded to the Senate Judiciary Committee on \n     June 22, 2001.\n       201.

In view of DOJ's assertion that it never had any sort \n     of wiretap on Dr. Lee, this likely refers to FISA material \n     from the investigation of the other scientist to whom Dr. Lee \n     spoke by telephone in December 1982.\n       212.

No subpoenas were issued pursuant to these resolutions \n     because the investigation into the Wen Ho Lee case was \n     suspended in December at the request of Director Freeh and \n     the Department of Justice. The resolutions were intended as \n     temporary measures to ensure that the subcommittee could \n     continue its work during the congressional recess. When the \n     Senate returned the following January, several other \n     individual subpoenas on matters under investigation by the \n     subcommittee were, in fact, debated and voted on. No \n     subpoena requested by the subcommittee was defeated in the \n     full committee.\n       221. Walter Pincus and David A.

There are a number of other issues that raise \n     questions as to whether the government fully pursued all the \n     information it had available during the course of its \n     investigation. These questions were identified in a June 27, \n     2001 letter from senators Patrick Leahy and Arlen Specter to \n     Attorney General Ashcroft. With the exception of confirming \n     that Dr. Lee has told investigators that the tapes were still \n     in his office as of December 23, 1998, however, the \n     Department continues to refuse to answer these questions on \n     the ground that the case is still open.\n       227.

When questioned in an October 3, 2000 hearing about an \n     August 1995 FBI document quoting Mr. Vrooman as saying that \n     ``a `smoking gun' had been found,'' Mr. Vrooman testified \n     that he did not know what the memo referred to. After the \n     hearing, Mr. Vrooman refreshed his recollection and wrote to \n     me that the ``smoking gun'' quote referred to the analytical \n     team headed by Mr. Michael Henderson, otherwise known as the \n     Kindred Spirit Analytical Group.\n       300.

Mr. Vrooman furnished this retirement date in his \n     written testimony to the subcommittee on October 3, 2000.

The DOE press release does not name Mr. \n     Vrooman or the others who were disciplined, but an August 13, \n     1999 story by Vernon Loeb in the Washington Post identifies \n     the three officials as Sig Hecker, Robert Vrooman, and Terry \n     Craig.

United States Senate, Joint Hearing Before the Senate \n     Select Committee on Intelligence and the Judiciary Committee, \n     ``Joint Hearing on the Wen Ho Lee Case,'' 106th Congress, 2nd \n     Session, September 26, 2000: 41-43.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now turn to the report on the handling \nof the espionage case against Dr. Peter H. Lee: Again, I intend to read \nonly a sentence or two, as I have been advised that a sentence or two \nwould be sufficient to have the remainder of the report printed in the \nRecord.\n\n       On October 7th and 8th, 1997, Dr. Peter Hoong-Yee Lee \n     confessed to the FBI that he\n\n[[Page S13822]]\n\n     had provided classified nuclear weapons design and testing \n     information to scientists of the People's Republic of China \n     on two occasions in 1985 and had given classified \n     antisubmarine information to the Chinese in May of 1997. The \n     1985 revelations, which occurred during discussions with, \n     and lectures to, PRC scientists in Beijing hotel rooms, \n     involved his work on hohlraums, devices used to simulate \n     nuclear detonations in a process called Inertial \n     Confinement Fusion, or ICF.\\1\\ According to a 17 February \n     1998 ``Impact Statement'' prepared by experts from the \n     Department of Energy,\n       ``the ICF data provided by Dr. Lee was of significant \n     material assistance to the PRC in their nuclear weapons \n     development program. . . . For that reason, this analysis \n     indicates that Dr. Lee's activities have directly enhanced \n     the PRC nuclear weapons program to the detriment of U.S. \n     national security.'' \\2\\\n       The ``Impact Statement'' further notes that ``the ICF \n     Program, when developed in conjunction with an already \n     existing nuclear program, could assist in the design of more \n     sophisticated nuclear weapons.'' \\3\\\n       Dr. Lee's 1997 disclosures came in two lectures to PRC \n     scientists, again in China, where he discussed his work on \n     the joint U.S./U.K. Radar Ocean Imaging (ROI) project. The \n     objective of the project, which has been carried out over \n     several years at the cost of more than $100 million, is to \n     study the feasibility of using radars to detect submerged \n     submarines. After viewing videotapes of Dr. Lee's confession, \n     Dr. Richard Twogood, former Technical Program Leader for the \n     ROI project, stated that Dr. Lee's disclosures contained \n     classified information at the SECRET level which went right \n     to the heart of the most significant technical achievement of \n     the U.S./U.K. program up until 1995.\\4\\ Although Dr. Lee was \n     not charged for the 1997 disclosures of classified \n     information, a 9 March 2000 review by the Department of \n     Defense concluded that Dr. Lee's anti-submarine warfare \n     revelations were classified at the CONFIDENTIAL level,\\5\\ \n     which, by definition, would damage U.S. national security.\\6\\ \n     According to the Cox Committee Report, ``this research, if \n     successfully completed, could enable the [Chinese military] \n     to threaten previously invulnerable U.S. nuclear \n     submarines.'' \\7\\\n       Dr. Lee's confessed crimes caused serious harm to U.S. \n     national security, yet he was offered a plea bargain which \n     resulted in a sentence amounting to one year in a half-way \n     house, 3,000 hours of community service and a $20,000 fine. \n     Considering the magnitude of Dr. Lee's offenses and his \n     failure to adhere to the terms of the plea agreement which \n     called for complete cooperation and truthfulness, the \n     interests of the United States were not well served by this \n     outcome.\n       During the 106th Congress, I chaired a special subcommittee \n     of the Senate Judiciary Committee for the purposes of \n     conducting oversight on the Department of Justice's handling \n     of this case and several other matters. The Subcommittee's \n     review of the Dr. Peter Lee case identified a number of \n     shortcomings in existing procedures for handling espionage \n     investigations and prosecutions, particularly in cases \n     where highly technical classified information is revealed \n     verbally rather than through the transfer of documents. \n     Communications between and within the Department of \n     Justice and other Executive Branch organizations appear to \n     have broken down at critical points during the Peter Lee \n     case, with the result that several key decisions were made \n     on the basis of incomplete or incorrect information. Had \n     this case been handled more formally and deliberately, \n     with more of the critical information being communicated \n     in writing, the opportunities for misunderstandings would \n     have been greatly reduced, and the chances of Dr. Lee \n     receiving a long prison sentence commensurate with his \n     crimes would have been greatly increased. Specifically, \n     the Subcommittee's investigation showed that:\n       The classified nuclear weapons design and anti-submarine \n     warfare information that Dr. Lee revealed in 1985, 1997, and \n     on other occasions may have merited prosecution under 18 USC \n     794, the most serious of the espionage statutes.\n       Senior DoJ officials, including the Attorney General and \n     the Deputy Attorney General, were not sufficiently involved \n     in or aware of the case. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney \n     General John Keeney, the official with final approval \n     authority in the case, advised that he would not have \n     approved the plea bargain had he known the trial prosecutor \n     would ask for only a short period of incarceration and would \n     charge only an attempt to transmit classified information.\\8\\\n       The Department of Justice's ability to seek a tougher plea \n     agreement or to prosecute Dr. Lee under section 794 was \n     hampered by its failure to fully understand the \n     classification level of, and the damage to national security \n     from, Dr. Lee's nuclear weapons design revelations prior to \n     offering him a plea agreement.\n       DoJ failed to inform the court that Dr. Lee repeatedly \n     confessed to disclosing classified information to the PRC in \n     1997, allowing the defense to convince the judge during \n     sentencing that the only time Dr. Lee intentionally passed \n     classified information was more than 13 years prior.\n       DoJ did not have the DoE's ``Impact Statement,'' which \n     stated that Dr. Lee had provided significant material \n     assistance to the PRC nuclear weapons program, until February \n     1998, well after the plea agreement was concluded.\n       The reluctance of the Department of Defense, and the Navy \n     in particular, to support the prosecution of Dr. Lee for his \n     anti-submarine warfare revelations had an adverse impact on \n     the case.\n       The ambiguity of the 14 November 1997 memorandum authored \n     by Mr. J.G. Schuster, head of the Navy's Science and \n     Technology Branch, seriously undermined DoJ efforts to \n     prosecute Dr. Lee. This memorandum was based on incomplete \n     information, without knowing the details of what Dr. Lee \n     confessed to disclosing to PRC scientists.\n       DoJ prematurely determined that Dr. Lee could not be \n     prosecuted for the 1997 revelations, and the explanation that \n     the information Dr. Lee revealed was already in the public \n     domain is contradicted by two classified memoranda from \n     Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory which show that the \n     disclosures extended beyond what was publicly available.\n       DoJ's failure to prosecute on the 1997 disclosures, or at \n     least to add them as a separate count to the plea agreement, \n     had a material adverse effect on the disposition of the case. \n     Coupling the 1997 disclosures with the 1985 revelations would \n     have demonstrated that Dr. Lee's classified disclosures were \n     not limited to a single incident long ago, but were ongoing. \n     Obtaining a conviction on the 1997 disclosures would not have \n     been a foregone conclusion--pushing the matter risked \n     disclosing certain information that the FBI and the \n     prosecutor wanted very much to protect, and the Navy was \n     reluctant to assist in the prosecution--but these were not \n     insurmountable obstacles. At a minimum, an effort should have \n     been made to add a separate count to the plea agreement to \n     address these disclosures.\n       DoJ communications were confused on the critical question \n     of what authority the trial prosecutor had with regard to a \n     charge under Section 794. DoJ officials advised that the \n     Internal Security Section would have reconsidered a \n     prosecution under Section 794 if the plea agreement broke \n     down,\\9\\ which was unknown to the trial prosecutor who \n     thought he could only take the watered-down plea bargain or \n     get nothing at all.\\10\\\n       The fact that Dr. Lee was an espionage suspect while \n     working on the Joint U.S./U.K. Radar Ocean Imaging project \n     was not disclosed to the program's sponsors within the Office \n     of the Assistant Secretary of Defense/Command, Control, \n     Communications and Intelligence (OASD/C3I).\\11\\\n       Electronic surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act was terminated at a critical juncture in \n     September 1997, just when the FBI was stepping up its \n     activity with regard to Dr. Lee and electronic surveillance \n     could have yielded important counter-intelligence \n     information. Although the listening device in Dr. Lee's \n     home had been discovered in July, thereby decreasing the \n     utility of that particular device, the FBI Field Office \n     felt strongly enough about the need for continued \n     surveillance to make a verbal renewal request to FBI \n     Headquarters in August, but not strongly enough to ensure \n     the request was granted.\n       The problems which affected this case were serious enough \n     to require remedial steps. The Counterintelligence Reform Act \n     of 2000 (S.2089), which became law on 27 December 2000 as \n     Title VI of Public Law 106-567 (H.R. 5630), contained a \n     provision that will address many of the shortcomings in the \n     way the DoJ handled this case. That provision, Section 607, \n     amended the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) to \n     require that the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal \n     Division and the appropriate United States attorney provide \n     briefings to senior agency officials from the victim agency \n     in cases involving classified information. The section \n     further required that these briefings occur as soon as \n     practicable after the Department of Justice and the United \n     States attorney concerned determine that a prosecution could \n     result and at such other times thereafter as are necessary to \n     keep the affected agency fully and currently informed of the \n     status of the prosecution.\n       The Subcommittee's investigation revealed other problems \n     that have not yet been addressed through legislation, \n     primarily because it was not possible to reach a consensus on \n     how best to solve them. The Counterintelligence Reform Act \n     moved through the Judiciary Committee and the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence without a single vote in \n     opposition. The Judiciary Committee reported the measure \n     favorably on 23 May 2000 and the Intelligence Committee did \n     the same on 20 July 2000. As the bill's chief sponsor, I \n     opted to work toward a consensus measure to ensure that the \n     important reforms we had identified during oversight on this \n     case and the Dr. Wen Ho Lee case could be implemented in a \n     timely fashion. Rather than wait until we could work out \n     acceptable language on other proposals arising from the Peter \n     Lee case, I felt it more important to accomplish what could \n     be done in the time available and address the more difficult \n     matters later. I also withheld publication of this report \n     during the last Congress so as not to inject it into the \n     presidential election. Now that the election is over and the \n     107th Congress is well underway, it is appropriate to release \n     this report and begin working on legislation to solve the \n     other problems identified by our oversight but upon which we \n     were unable to achieve consensus.\n       Specifically, I am introducing legislation to require \n     victim agencies--the agencies whose classified information is \n     lost--to\n\n[[Page S13823]]\n\n     produce a written ``damage statement'' which specifies the \n     level of classification of the material alleged to have been \n     revealed, and justifies the classification level by \n     describing the potential harm to national security from such \n     revelations. The legislation further requires the prosecution \n     team to consider the ``damage statement'' before any final \n     decision is made as to whether the case should be taken to \n     trial or a plea bargain should be offered. I also strongly \n     believe, but will not attempt to mandate through legislation, \n     that key instructions from Main Justice (Internal Security \n     Section, etc.) to the U.S. Attorney's Office with \n     responsibility for prosecuting the case, including charging \n     authority and plea bargain authority, should be in writing. \n     These written instructions should be shared with the \n     investigating agency or agencies and the victim agency so \n     they have an opportunity for input before any final \n     decisions are made.\n       The findings and recommendations included in this report \n     are based on a review of more than 6,000 pages of documents \n     from the FBI, the Department of Defense and its sub- \n     components, the Department of Justice and information \n     submitted to the court during the sentencing process. The \n     Subcommittee conducted three open hearings, three closed \n     hearings, two ``on-the-record'' Senators' briefings, and \n     numerous staff interviews, which resulted in hearing from \n     more than 30 individuals who played key roles in the conduct \n     of the case. The information presented here is derived from \n     unclassified documents and testimony, or relies upon \n     unclassified extracts from classified documents.\n\n\n           summary of dr. peter h. lee's espionage activities\n\n       Dr. Peter Lee is a naturalized U.S. citizen who worked for \n     TRW Inc., a contractor to Lawrence Livermore National \n     Laboratory, from 1973 to 1976. Dr. Lee worked at Lawrence \n     Livermore from 1976 to 1984, and at Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory from 1984 to 1991. He returned to TRW from 1991 \n     until December 1997, when he was dismissed in the wake of his \n     plea agreement for passing classified information to the \n     Chinese.\\12\\\n       According to his October 1997 confession to the FBI, Dr. \n     Lee traveled to China from 22 December 1984 to 19 January \n     1985 (while he was employed by Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory).\\13\\ On 9 January 1985, Dr. Lee met with Chen \n     Nengkuan, a PRC scientist employed by the China Academy of \n     Engineering Physics (CAEP), in a hotel room in Beijing. Chen \n     told Dr. Lee that he had classified questions to ask, and \n     that Dr. Lee could answer just by nodding his head yes or \n     no.\\14\\ Chen drew a diagram of a hohlraum (a device in which \n     lasers are fired at a glass globe to ``create a small nuclear \n     detonation which is then studied and used in the design of \n     nuclear weapons),'' \\15\\ and asked the classified questions, \n     which Dr. Lee, by his own admission, knew were classified but \n     answered anyway.\\16\\\n       The following day, Dr. Lee accompanied Chen to a hotel in \n     Beijing where another group of PRC scientists was waiting. \n     These scientists were also from the China Academy of \n     Engineering Physics, which is ``responsible for all aspects \n     of the PRC's nuclear weapons program.'' \\17\\ Among the \n     scientists Dr. Lee briefed was Yu Min, who has been called \n     ``the `Edward Teller' of the PRC nuclear weapons \n     program.'' \\18\\ For two hours, Dr. Lee answered questions \n     and drew diagrams, including several hohlraums. Dr. Lee \n     also ``discussed problems the U.S. was having in its \n     nuclear weapons testing program.'' \\19\\ Dr. Lee further \n     admitted discussing with the Chinese scientists at least \n     one portion of a classified document he authored in 1982. \n     Although the document, titled ``An Explanation for the \n     Viewing Angle Dependence of Temperature from Cairn \n     Targets,'' was subsequently declassified in 1996,\\20\\ \n     revealing its contents in 1985 was an illegal act that \n     could be expected to provide substantial assistance to the \n     Chinese from 1985 to 1996 and to harm U.S. national \n     security.\n       Dr. Lee again visited China, while he was employed by TRW, \n     from 30 April to 22 May 1997.\\21\\ Although Dr. Lee claimed on \n     his travel request form, and in a 25 June 1997 interview with \n     FBI Agent Gilbert Cordova, that the visit to China had been a \n     pleasure trip for which he paid all his own expenses, the \n     truth was that Dr. Lee traveled as a guest of the Chinese \n     Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics \n     (IAPCM), which is part of the China Academy of Engineering \n     Physics.\\22\\\n       During this May 1997 trip, Dr. Lee gave a lecture at the \n     PRC Institute of Applied Physics and Computational \n     Mathematics in Beijing. The lecture covered his work for TRW \n     in support of the Radar Ocean Imaging Project, and was \n     attended by nearly 30 top PRC scientists.\\23\\ When asked \n     about the applicability of his work to anti-submarine \n     warfare, Dr. Lee showed the scientists a surface ship wake \n     image (which he had brought from the U.S. to show them), drew \n     a graph, explained the physics underlying his work, and told \n     the Chinese where to filter the data within the graph to \n     enhance the ability to locate the ocean wake of a vessel.\\24\\ \n     A few days later, Dr. Lee gave the same lecture in another \n     city, using the graphs that the Chinese had saved from his \n     first lecture and had brought to the second lecture for his \n     use.\\25\\\n       Upon his return from the PRC, Dr. Lee filled out a TRW \n     Post-Travel Questionnaire in which he denied that there \n     ``were any requests from Foreign Nationals for technical \n     information,'' and denied that there were any attempts to \n     persuade him to reveal or discuss classified information.\\26\\\n       On 5 August and 14 August 1997, Peter Lee was interviewed \n     by FBI agents at a Santa Barbara, California, hotel. During \n     these interviews, Dr. Lee admitted that he had lied on his \n     travel form about the purpose of his trip to China in May, \n     and that he had lied about receiving requests for technical \n     information. However, he continued to insist that he had paid \n     for the trip to the PRC with his own money.\\27\\\n       After the two FBI interviews, Dr. Lee contacted a Chinese \n     official named Gou Hong by e- mail on 25 August 1997, and \n     requested that Gou provide Lee with receipts indicating that \n     Lee had paid for the trip to the PRC, that the receipts \n     contain the names of Lee and his wife in English, and that \n     they show that Lee paid cash for the trip.\\28\\ On 3 September \n     1997, Dr. Lee provided the FBI with copies of hotel and \n     airline receipts for the May 1997 trip which stated that \n     Lee had paid for the trip in cash. Based on a review of e-\n     mail transmissions and telephone conversations between Lee \n     and Gou, however, the FBI concluded that these receipts \n     were false.\\29\\\n       On 7 October 1997, Dr. Lee was interviewed and polygraphed \n     by the FBI. The polygraph examiner believed that Lee showed \n     deception when he answered ``no'' to the following questions: \n     (A) Have you ever deliberately been involved in espionage \n     against the United States? (B) Have you ever provided \n     classified information to persons unauthorized to receive it? \n     (C) Have you deliberately withheld any contacts with any non-\n     U.S. intelligence service from the FBI? \\30\\ After being told \n     that he had failed the polygraph on these questions, Dr. Lee \n     made a videotaped confession in which he admitted ``having \n     passed classified national defense information to the PRC \n     twice in 1985, and to lying on his post-travel questionnaire \n     in 1997.'' \\31\\\n       During this same interview, Dr. Lee also repeatedly \n     confessed that he intentionally revealed classified \n     information during his 1997 anti-submarine lectures in China. \n     Dr. Lee was not prosecuted for these revelations, and the \n     judge was not adequately informed of these admissions at \n     sentencing.\n       On 8 December 1997, Dr. Lee pleaded guilty to a two count \n     information that he violated: (1) 18 USC 793(d)--Attempt to \n     communicate national defense information to a person not \n     entitled to receive it, and (2) 18 USC 1001--False statement \n     to a government agency.\\32\\ According to the press release \n     from the office of U.S. Attorney Nora Manella, Dr. Lee \n     ``admitted that he knew the information was classified, and \n     that by transmitting the information he intended to help the \n     Chinese.'' \\33\\ The offenses to which Lee pleaded guilty \n     could have resulted in a maximum sentence of 15 years in \n     federal prison and a fine of $250,000. Under the terms of the \n     agreement, the Government asked for a ``short period of \n     incarceration,'' a formulation that was negotiated by the \n     trial attorney and approved by Mr. John Dion in the Internal \n     Security Section, but was not approved by Principal Deputy \n     Assistant Attorney General Keeney, the DoJ official with \n     final authority, who advised the Subcommittee that he would \n     not have approved the plea agreement had he known that it \n     would request only a short period of incarceration as an \n     opening position.\\34\\\n       On 26 March 1998, Dr. Lee was sentenced by U.S. District \n     Court Judge Terry Hatter to one year in a community \n     corrections facility, three years of probation, 3,000 hours \n     of community service, and a $20,000 fine. The sentence was \n     based upon a sealed plea agreement from 8 December 1997.\\35\\ \n     The plea agreement and other key documents in the case were \n     unsealed at the request of the Subcommittee in late 1999.\\36\\\n       Every DoJ official interviewed by the Subcommittee expected \n     Dr. Lee to receive jail time, during which they planned to \n     seek his further cooperation. When he received no jail time, \n     all leverage was lost by the government.\n     Analysis of the Nuclear Weapons Design Revelations\n       The importance of Dr. Lee's 1985 disclosures is highlighted \n     by the 17 February 1998 ``Impact Statement'' from the \n     Department of Energy which concludes that:\n       ``the [Inertial Confinement Fusion] data provided by Dr. \n     Lee was of significant material assistance to the PRC in \n     their nuclear weapons development program. . . . For that \n     reason, this analysis indicates that Dr. Lee's activities \n     have directly enhanced the PRC nuclear weapons program to the \n     detriment of U.S. national security.'' \\37\\\n       The ``Impact Statement'' further notes that ``the ICF \n     Program, when developed in conjunction with an already \n     existing nuclear program, could assist in the design of more \n     sophisticated nuclear weapons.'' \\38\\\n       The trial attorney wanted to prosecute under Section 794 \n     for the 1985 revelations, but was overruled by Main Justice \n     as well as his supervising attorney.\\39\\ In his 12 April 2000 \n     written statement to the Subcommittee, the Internal Security \n     Section (ISS) line attorney with primary responsibility for \n     the Peter Lee case, explained why he did not feel it \n     appropriate to pursue a 794 charge on the 1985 disclosures.\n       ``In my estimation, both then and now, the sole weakness in \n     the case was the questionable significance of the information \n     Lee compromised, both in 1985 and in 1997. As to Lee's 1985 \n     disclosure, I knew, for instance, that the Department had \n     never prosecuted a case under 794 where the compromised \n     information, as in the case of Lee's 1985 disclosure, had \n     been declassified prior to the crime\n\n[[Page S13824]]\n\n     being discovered. Let me emphasize this: the information Lee \n     admitted disclosing in 1985 had been declassified.'' \\40\\\n       This analysis may be correct as far as it goes, but there \n     were other factors and issues that should have been \n     considered. Dr. Lee's confession, though carefully crafted to \n     limit his exposure, simply confirmed much, but not all, of \n     what the FBI already knew about his espionage activities. The \n     FBI knew well before they confronted Dr. Lee that he had \n     likely been compromising anti-submarine information since the \n     early 1990s,\\41\\ and that in the early 1980s Dr. Lee had \n     allegedly given the Chinese classified information that \n     greatly assisted their nuclear weapons program.\\42\\ One \n     scientist the FBI consulted in trying to evaluate the extent \n     of Dr. Lee's revelations said, ``It seems likely that Peter \n     Lee at least partially compromised every project, classified \n     or unclassified, he was involved with at Livermore, [Los \n     Alamos National Laboratory], and TRW.'' \\43\\\n       At a later stage of the proceeding, Dr. Lee admitted that \n     he had given the PRC scientists additional information which \n     had not been declassified. Had the Internal Security Section \n     awaited fuller development of the facts, it might not have \n     declined prosecution under 794 on grounds of subsequent \n     declassification. The Government would have been able to \n     corroborate Dr. Lee's confession and to prove that he had \n     done more than he confessed to. As the prosecuting attorney \n     noted during his 5 April 2000 appearance before the \n     Subcommittee, ``. . . in the many cases I had with a \n     cooperating defendant or a defendant who pled guilty who was \n     debriefed, I never had the kind of information to corroborate \n     what was said as I did in this case.'' \\44\\\n       The ISS line attorney's statement regarding the \n     ``questionable significance of the information Lee \n     compromised'' in 1985 is flatly contradicted by the DoE \n     ``Impact Statement'' of 17 February 1998 which states that \n     Dr. Lee did serious harm to U.S. national security. Had \n     the ISS line attorney waited for the experts to evaluate \n     the case, he would have known that a 794 charge should be \n     given much greater consideration than it got.\n       During testimony before the Subcommittee, the ISS line \n     attorney who handled the case stated that it would have been \n     impractical to wait for a damage assessment which, in his \n     experience, normally takes more than a year. In fact, \n     however, there were two assessments available within less \n     than 90 days of the start of plea negotiations. Dr. Thomas \n     Cook's ``Declaration of Technical Damage to United States \n     National Security Assessed in Support of United States v. \n     Peter Hoong-Yee Lee'' was available in February 1998, as was \n     the Department of Energy ``Impact Statement.''\n       The Government had spent six years and considerable amounts \n     of money investigating Dr. Lee's espionage activities, had \n     obtained a confession that substantiated much of the \n     information it already had from other sources, and had not \n     charged Dr. Lee with a crime and therefore did not have a \n     speedy trial issue to contend with. Consequently, there was \n     no reason why the Government could not wait for a complete \n     analysis by competent experts of Dr. Lee's espionage \n     activities. The failure to obtain such an analysis prior to \n     entering a plea agreement seriously undermined the \n     Government's ability to prosecute Dr. Lee under section 794, \n     and was a major factor in the unsatisfactory disposition of \n     the case.\n       In his testimony before the Subcommittee on 12 April 2000, \n     the ISS line attorney who handled the Lee case further argued \n     that the Government would have had a hard time proving that \n     the classified nuclear weapons design information that Dr. \n     Lee provided to the Chinese was related to the national \n     defense, an element of proof that would have been necessary \n     to sustain a charge under 18 USC 794. In response to a \n     question from Senator Sessions, the attorney said that the \n     information Dr. Lee revealed in 1985 ``was classified SECRET, \n     but I'm not sure it would have been ultimately found to be \n     national defense information at the time he compromised it.''\n       When pressed by Senator Sessions to explain how nuclear \n     weapons design information could be deemed not related to the \n     national defense, the attorney referred to the Supreme \n     Court's opinion in Gorin v. United States.\\46\\ Any reliance \n     on the Gorin decision in the context of the Peter Lee case is \n     misplaced. The Gorin case was decided in January 1941, well \n     before the advent of nuclear weapons. The Court's opinion, \n     written by Justice Reed, makes clear that the information in \n     the Lee case would have been found to be ``national defense \n     information.'' In the words of the Court:\n       ``National defense, the Government maintains, ``is a \n     generic concept of broad connotations, referring to the \n     military and naval establishments and the related activities \n     of national preparedness.'' We agree that the words \n     ``national defense'' in the Espionage Act carry that \n     meaning.'' \\47\\\n       When the Supreme Court held, as it did in Gorin, that \n     reports ``as to the movements of fishing boats, suspected of \n     espionage and as to the taking of photographs of American war \n     vessels'' \\48\\ constituted national defense information, \n     there can be no doubt that nuclear weapons design information \n     would be encompassed by the term.\n       The DoJ attorney also cited the decision of the Second \n     Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Heine.\\49\\ That \n     case has no applicability to this matter since all the \n     information given to a German automobile corporation was \n     publicly available at the time of disclosure.\\50\\\n       During the sentencing hearing, Dr. Lee's lawyer, Mr. James \n     Henderson, tried to downplay the significance of the 1985 \n     revelations through character witnesses who claimed that the \n     disclosures were not related to nuclear weapons but to energy \n     production.\\51\\ These witnesses did not have access to the \n     text or tape of Dr. Lee's confession which detailed the \n     extent of his revelations.\\52\\ Dr. Cook and the authors of \n     the 17 February 1998 DoE ``Impact Statement'' had access to \n     Dr. Lee's confession and were in a position to evaluate the \n     extent of damage and of the espionage. In view of these facts \n     it was surprising that the ISS attorney advanced the \n     argument:\n       ``that Lee could claim that he made the disclosures to \n     encourage China not to conduct nuclear weapons tests in the \n     field, and he would likely be supported by internal \n     Government documents or even testimony of former U.S. \n     Government or Livermore officials that that was actually one \n     of the reasons the U.S. Government declassified the \n     information beginning in 1990.\n       ``In other words, Lee would have been able to credibly \n     argue that his actions were in the national interest.'' \\53\\\n       Any claim by Dr. Lee that his actions were in the national \n     interest would be totally unfounded. Individual scientists do \n     not have the latitude to make determinations--during the \n     course of lectures in Beijing hotel rooms--as to whether or \n     not it is in the national interest to help the Chinese \n     develop more sophisticated nuclear weapons.\n       The prosecuting attorney made this very point at the \n     sentencing hearing when he said, ``It is not up to the whim \n     of an individual scientist to determine if something is \n     classified. . . . This is one of the nation's top scientists \n     from one of the nation's top research nuclear weapons \n     facilities giving a two hour lecture regarding classified \n     information to the top nuclear scientists of China.'' \\54\\\n       Dr. Lee very likely could have been prosecuted under 18 USC \n     794, the harshest of the espionage statutes, for his nuclear \n     weapons design revelations. As Senator Sessions said at the \n     Subcommittee's 5 April 2000 hearing:\n       ``I don't think [the prosecuting attorney] would have had a \n     problem getting a conviction on that. [Dr. Lee] confessed to \n     it, number one. Number two, I don't think any jury is going \n     to believe that he was there for his health and a casual \n     conversation to have two different meetings in Beijing hotel \n     rooms with top Chinese scientists. There is no business for \n     that, and anyone with common sense would understand it.'' \n     \\55\\\n       In the context of the prosecuting attorney's efforts to \n     proceed under 794 and Senator Sessions' strongly expressed \n     views, there is a strong argument that a 794 prosecution \n     should have been brought.\n     Internal DoJ Mis-communication and a Lack of High Level \n         Supervision\n       Unfortunately, the case never went to trial. By late \n     November 1997, the Internal Security Section attorney had \n     completed his analysis of the case, concluding that Dr. Lee \n     should be offered a plea under 18 USC 793 or section 224(b) \n     of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for the 1985 compromise, in \n     combination with a charge under section 1001 for the false \n     statements on his travel form.\\56\\ When it became apparent \n     that ``Lee was balking at a plea with a potential 10-year \n     exposure for the 1985 incident,'' the attorney recommended \n     to Mr. Dion that ``although the section 794 case for that \n     incident in 1985 had problems, it was sufficiently robust \n     that we could ethically use it as leverage.'' \\57\\ Mr. \n     Dion testified that he called the prosecuting attorney and \n     authorized him to:\n       ``seek a plea of guilty by Lee to a violation of 18 USC \n     Section 793(d) for his 1985 disclosures and to a violation of \n     the false statement statute, 18 USC Section 1001. As such a \n     plea would require Lee to waive the 10-year statute of \n     limitations, [the prosecuting attorney] was authorized to \n     advise counsel that no final decision had been made as to the \n     prospect of charging Lee with a violation of Section 794.'' \n     \\58\\\n       The prosecutor, who was emphatic in his testimony that his \n     instructions were to accept a plea under 793 and 1001, or \n     nothing,\\59\\ obtained a plea on both counts, but had to \n     concede to only a ``short period of incarceration'' to secure \n     Dr. Lee's agreement.\\60\\ Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney \n     General John Keeney told the Subcommittee that, ``. . . I was \n     not aware, so far as I recall, that it would call for only a \n     short period of incarceration or would charge only an \n     attempted 793 charge. Had this been our opening position in \n     plea negotiations, I doubt that I would have approved it, \n     particularly, the `short period of incarceration.' '' \\61\\ He \n     then tried to justify DoJ's handling of the case by saying \n     that ``this was the best that could be hoped for given the \n     sentencing practices of the courts in the Central District of \n     California.'' \\62\\\n       Had Dr. Lee cooperated, as he was required to do under the \n     plea agreement, it might have been possible to achieve an \n     acceptable disposition in the case even with the weak plea \n     agreement. Had Dr. Lee told the whole truth and provided \n     whatever counter-intelligence information he knew, that would \n     mitigate the need to punish him with a long sentence. It \n     might have been acceptable to balance counterintelligence \n     information gained from a cooperating defendant against the \n     need to punish wrongdoing. However, there is no benefit in \n     accepting a plea contingent upon the defendant's cooperation\n\n[[Page S13825]]\n\n     and then not getting that cooperation. Dr. Lee did not live \n     up to his obligation to be truthful. The ``Position with \n     Respect to Sentencing Factors'' that the Government submitted \n     to the court acknowledged ``concerns that defendant has still \n     not been completely forthcoming about the nature, quality and \n     extent of his improper contacts with scientists of the PRC.'' \n     \\63\\ Dr. Lee's lack of cooperation was further highlighted in \n     the February 1998 DoE ``Impact Statement'' where the authors \n     note that:\n       ``[W]e do not believe that Dr. Lee has been fully \n     cooperative in identifying or describing other classified \n     information he may have compromised. We believe that Dr. Lee \n     confessed to compromising selected classified information in \n     the hope his other, more damaging activities would not be \n     discovered or fully investigated.'' \\64\\\n       On 26 February 1998, Dr. Lee failed an FBI-administered \n     polygraph where he was asked whether he had lied to the FBI \n     since his last polygraph examination regarding passing \n     classified information.\\65\\ When interviewed by DoE \n     scientists in March 1998, Dr. Lee again failed to cooperate \n     fully. As Dr. Thomas Cook pointed out during his testimony \n     before the Subcommittee on 29 March 2000, when asked \n     questions about what he had done, Dr. Lee ``repeatedly denied \n     any knowledge or any interest in classified programs and \n     publications. He was, however, the author and/or the \n     technical editor of some of these publications which he \n     denied knowledge of.'' \\66\\ In view of these repeated lies \n     and lack of cooperation, there should be no doubt that Dr. \n     Lee did not comply with the terms of the plea agreement, and \n     the Government could have successfully sought to breach it.\n       When asked by Senator Specter why he did not breach the \n     plea agreement in view of this lack of cooperation, the \n     prosecuting attorney explained that he could not abrogate the \n     deal because he had nothing to fall back on,\\67\\ and because \n     doing so risked exposing extremely sensitive classified \n     information he had been instructed to protect.\\68\\ The \n     prosecutor advised that he was told that if there was a risk \n     of certain evidence coming out, he would have to drop the \n     case. As the case unfolded, however, there was no risk of \n     that evidence being disclosed. In the absence of any problem \n     as to disclosure of the sensitive information, and had the \n     prosecutor known he could have, or at least might have been \n     able to proceed with the 794 prosecution, then the better \n     course would have been to have abrogated the plea agreement \n     on the basis of Peter Lee's failure to cooperate which could \n     have been established without disclosing any classified \n     information.\n       Due to the significance of the sensitive information about \n     which the prosecutor was concerned, and the restrictions it \n     placed on the prosecution of the case, it is troubling that \n     at no time during the course of the Subcommittee's review of \n     the case did Mr. Dion or anyone else from DoJ ever brief \n     Congress about the information until after the prosecuting \n     attorney raised the subject in the context of explaining why \n     he had not sought to abrogate the plea agreement. The \n     Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) specifically \n     provides procedures whereby the Government can deal with the \n     risks of exposing such information, even to the extent of \n     permitting the Attorney General to decline prosecution if the \n     risk of exposing classified information is too high. There is \n     no evidence that the Department of Justice formally \n     considered this sensitive information in the CIPA context.\n       The prosecutor's understanding of his limited authority was \n     caused by a breakdown of communications. As he understood his \n     authority, since Dr. Lee had waived the statute of \n     limitations on the 793 count to accept the plea, breaching \n     the plea would leave the Government with only the 1001 count, \n     which was also in the plea. Therefore, the prosecutor felt he \n     had to stick with the plea agreement because it was that or \n     nothing.\\69\\ Even though the prosecutor knew Dr. Lee was \n     lying and was not cooperating, he felt he could not abrogate \n     the plea agreement because he thought he could not charge Dr. \n     Lee under Section 794 due to constraints imposed by the \n     Internal Security Section at Main Justice.\n       Mr. Dion conceded at the Subcommittee's 12 April 2000 \n     hearing that he did not recall discussing with the \n     prosecuting attorney that he (Dion) might reconsider a 794 \n     prosecution if the proposed plea agreement fell through:\n\n       Senator Specter: You say no final decision had been made . \n     . . as to whether he would be charged with 794?\n       Mr. Dion: That's correct, sir. . . .\n       Senator Specter: . . . Mr. Dion, when you say no decision \n     had been made and I interrupted you at that point as to what \n     would happen if the plea bargain broke down, [the prosecuting \n     attorney] testified very emphatically that he wanted to \n     proceed with 794 but was told that all he could do was do the \n     best he could under the authorized plea bargain, so that is \n     why he proceeded as he did, asking for only a short period \n     of incarceration and not taking action when Dr. Lee lied \n     on his polygraph and did not give further answers. But are \n     you suggesting, if that plea bargain had broken down, that \n     you might have reconsidered and authorized a 794 \n     prosecution?\n\n       Mr. Dion: We definitely would have reconsidered our course \n     of action, sir.\n       Senator Specter: Well, did you tell [the prosecutor] that?\n       Mr. Dion: I don't recall specifically if we discussed that \n     or not. We did discuss that no final decision had been made \n     on the 794 and that he should proceed with plea negotiations \n     on that basis.\\70\\\n\n       In the face of the prosecuting attorney's testimony that he \n     was authorized only to take the weak plea agreement or \n     nothing, it seems clear that he was correct on what authority \n     was communicated to him.\n       The prosecuting attorney was not the only one who did not \n     understand the Internal Security Section's position with \n     regard to a charge under Section 794. An FBI e-mail of 25 \n     November 1997, from an attorney in the National Security Law \n     Unit, to an FBI Supervisory Special Agent in the National \n     Security Division, noted in relevant part that ``According to \n     [the FBI Supervisory Special Agent], ISS/Dion said that if \n     [Dr. Lee] doesn't accept the plea proffer, then he gets \n     charged with 18 USC 794, the heftier charge.''\n       The Secretary of Defense was told the same thing. On 26 \n     November 1997, Colonel Dan Baur prepared a memorandum for the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Secretary of Defense, in \n     which he relayed information on the case he had received from \n     the FBI. Colonel Baur's memo stated that DoJ had granted the \n     U.S. Attorney authority to offer to let Lee plead guilty \n     under 18 USC 793 and 18 USC 1001 to avoid being charged under \n     Section 794.\\72\\ Furthermore, the memo noted that ``should \n     Lee decline the offer, the U.S. Attorney will seek an \n     indictment against him for violation of Section 794.'' When \n     read relevant portions of these communications at the \n     Subcommittee's 12 April 2000 hearing, however, Mr. John Dion \n     stated that they were incorrect.\\73\\ Clearly there was a mis-\n     communication on this very important issue, both within the \n     Department of Justice and between DoJ and DoD.\n       It is surprising and disturbing that a critical piece of \n     information in the case exactly what the Assistant U.S. \n     Attorney was authorized to do and under what terms he was \n     authorized to do it could be subject to such differing \n     interpretations and understandings. In an effort to \n     understand how such a fundamental point could be \n     misunderstood, the Subcommittee traced the information that \n     appeared in Colonel Baur's memo to Secretary Cohen back to \n     its origins. It appears that Mr. Dion spoke to the \n     prosecutor, who then spoke to the Los Angles case Agents. \n     Sometime thereafter, the FBI Supervisory Special Agent in Los \n     Angles was briefed by one of the two case agents, or by both. \n     One of these agents relayed the information to the attorney \n     in National Security Law Unit, who passed it on to the FBIHQ \n     Supervisory Special Agent, for subsequent relay to Colonel \n     Baur. Whatever the actual path of the information--and \n     wherever the mis-communication was introduced--it is clear \n     that the information did not pass, as one might expect, from \n     the Internal Security Section to the Department of Defense. \n     The ISS line attorney handling the case testified that he \n     never spoke to anyone in DoD about the plea discussions. As a \n     consequence of this failure to communicate, the victim agency \n     and officials within the Department of Justice were acting \n     without a clear understanding of the actual decisions that \n     had been made.\n       It is obvious that the case would have benefitted from more \n     direct supervision by high level Justice Department \n     officials, which would have likely reduced the confusion \n     within the Department of Justice and between DoJ and the \n     Department of Defense. Attorney General Reno was provided \n     with three ``Urgent Reports'' informing her of ``(1) Peter \n     Lee's admission on October 7, 1997, (2) his entry of a guilty \n     plea on December 9, 1997, and (3) the court's imposition of \n     sentence on March 26, 1998.'' \\75\\ On 31 October 1997, as \n     required by law, she also signed the document authorizing the \n     use of FISA-derived information for law-enforcement purposes. \n     She was not otherwise involved in the case, leaving the \n     matter to subordinates. The Deputy Attorney General, Mr. \n     Holder, was also uninvolved in the case.\n       Mr. John Dion was the supervisory attorney in the Internal \n     Security Section, but one of his subordinates made the \n     substantive decisions in this case. When questioned about \n     allegations that Dr. Lee's revelations extended beyond what \n     he confessed to, for example, Mr. Dion deferred, saying that \n     one of his subordinate attorneys was ``more directly familiar \n     with that information than I am. . . .'' \\76\\ More direct \n     supervision by key DoJ personnel may have ensured a better \n     outcome in this important espionage case.\n     Analysis of the Anti-Submarine Warfare Revelations\n       It also appears that Dr. Lee should have been prosecuted in \n     relation to the information he revealed in his May 11, 1997 \n     briefing of Chinese scientists. Charges should have been \n     filed under Section 794(a) which applies to ``any other major \n     weapons system or major element of defense strategy.'' The \n     U.S. nuclear submarine fleet, which comprises one leg of the \n     nation's strategic triad, would qualify as a major weapons \n     system. The potential harm from Dr. Lee's 1997 revelations \n     was described by the Cox Committee Report:\n       ``Lee admitted to the FBI that, in 1997, he passed to PRC \n     weapons scientists classified research into the detection of \n     enemy submarines under water. This research, if successfully \n     completed, could enable the PLA to threaten previously \n     invulnerable U.S. nuclear submarines.'' \\77\\\n       To determine whether or not the information Dr. Lee \n     revealed would qualify for prosecution under section 794, the \n     Government first needed to get an assessment of that \n     information. On 14 October 1997, the Assistant\n\n[[Page S13826]]\n\n     U.S. Attorney handling the case in Los Angeles contacted a \n     representative of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service. \n     He was referred to Dr. Donna Kulla in the Intelligence \n     Systems Support Office where she dealt with the Radar Ocean \n     Imaging (ROI) project on which Peter Lee worked. Dr. Kulla \n     informed the prosecuting attorney that the information that \n     Dr. Lee had revealed was classified CONFIDENTIAL.\\78\\\n       In mid-October, the FBI also contacted Dr. Richard Twogood, \n     of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and asked \n     for his opinion on the level of classification of Dr. Lee's \n     revelations. Dr. Twogood was the Deputy Associate Director \n     for Electronics Engineering at LLNL, and from 1988 until 1996 \n     had been the Program Leader for the Imaging and Detection \n     Program at LLNL. The Joint U.S./U.K. Radar Ocean Imaging \n     Program, for which Dr. Twogood was the Technical Program \n     Leader from 1990 through 1995, was the single largest \n     component of LLNL's Imaging and Detection Program, and it \n     was the one where Dr. Peter Lee worked and where he would \n     have had access at the DoD SECRET level to the important \n     discoveries and significant advances in the development of \n     methods to detect submarine signatures with remote sensing \n     radars.\\79\\\n       Dr. Twogood is an authorized derivative classifier, which \n     means that he can make appropriate judgements about \n     classification based on guidance written by others. Although \n     the Navy had primary jurisdiction over the anti-submarine \n     warfare information that Dr. Lee revealed to the Chinese, Dr. \n     Twogood had personally written some of the classification \n     guidance being used in the Joint U.S./U.K. program, and was \n     therefore familiar with the importance of the information. \n     When he reviewed the videotaped confession on 15 October \n     1997, Dr. Twogood noted that Dr. Lee himself admitted that he \n     had passed CONFIDENTIAL information. Furthermore, Dr. Twogood \n     informed the FBI that the information was at least \n     CONFIDENTIAL and likely DoD SECRET. More importantly, in Dr. \n     Twogood's view, Dr. Lee's disclosures went right to the heart \n     of the most significant technical achievement of the U.S./\n     U.K. program up until 1995.\\80\\\n       The prosecuting attorney was concerned that Dr. Twogood's \n     position could be said to have evolved, from saying it was \n     CONFIDENTIAL when first asked, to the later position that the \n     information was SECRET. The prosecutor was also aware that \n     the defense would be able to find competent scientists who \n     would take a different view about the level of classification \n     due to the similarity of some of the information to what was \n     already in the public domain. These are legitimate concerns, \n     but are not outside the realm of what prosecutors contend \n     with in all espionage cases. They are, by no means, \n     sufficient to justify not going forward with the prosecution.\n       On 28 October 1997, the ISS attorney handling the case \n     attended a meeting with DoD officials for the purpose of \n     determining whether there was publicly available information \n     that could undermine an espionage prosecution for the 1997 \n     compromise.\\81\\ At the meeting, the DoJ attorney provided DoD \n     officials with the draft Cordova affidavit, and made them \n     aware that the confession had been videotaped, but he did not \n     provide copies of the tapes and no DoD officials asked for \n     them.\\82\\ When asked about why he had not provided copies of \n     the tapes to DoD personnel, the ISS attorney replied:\n       ``Because at that point, at the initial meeting, the \n     purpose was not to get a final classification determination \n     or even a preliminary classification determination on this \n     information. It was only to find out one of two things: what \n     publicly available information might be out there that could \n     potentially compromise a Section 794 prosecution on the 1997 \n     compromise, and what could we say about the program \n     generally, as we have here today, in an open trial setting.'' \n     \\83\\\n       By 3 November 1997, the Department of Defense had compiled \n     an extensive list of publicly available information on the \n     topic of radar ocean imaging and provided it to the \n     Internal Security Section. Among the documents was a \n     printout from a LLNL website titled ``Radar Ocean \n     Imaging,'' and prepared remarks that Dr. Twogood had \n     presented in open session before the House Armed Services \n     Committee in April 1994. Both of these documents contained \n     general information about the use of radars to detect \n     submarines.\\84\\ Based on his assessment of these \n     documents, the ISS attorney concluded that Dr. Lee could \n     not be prosecuted under section 794 for the 1997 \n     compromise. As he put it in his 12 April 2000 appearance \n     before the Subcommittee:\n       ``The Web site and Dr. Twogood's testimony, coupled with \n     the fact that the underlying 1995 document was only \n     classified under a mosaic theory, convinced me that there was \n     no section 794 case on the 1997 compromise. In my opinion, \n     Senators, it was not even a close call.''\\85\\\n       The ISS line attorney was wrong in concluding that the \n     information was already publicly available.\\86\\ Subsequent \n     analysis showed that Dr. Lee's anti-submarine warfare \n     revelations extended beyond what was in the public domain and \n     therefore remained classified.\n       On 10 November 1997, in response to a 30 October request \n     from the prosecuting attorney, Lawrence Livermore employee Al \n     Heiman provided an FBI Special Agent with a copy of the \n     Security Plan covering the detection results in the U.K./U.S. \n     Radar Ocean Imaging program. The enclosed memorandum from Dr. \n     Twogood described the classification guidelines established \n     for the program. Paragraph 3 of Appendix A of the \n     classification guideline--indicating that ``processing \n     techniques which, when applied to unclassified or classified \n     data, yield a significant enhancement in signature \n     detectability which might apply to the submarine case'' \n     should be classified SECRET--was directly applicable to the \n     information that Dr. Lee revealed to the Chinese.\\87\\\n       On 14 November 1997, Mr. John G. Schuster, Jr., wrote the \n     following memorandum for Navy Captain Earl Dewispelaere:\n       ``The signal analysis techniques briefed by the subject are \n     UNCLASSIFIED when applied to environmental data and they have \n     been presented and published in several unclassified forums. \n     Any application of the technique to submarine wake \n     signatures, however, would be classified at the SECRET level, \n     as called out in current classification guides.\n       ``The material that was briefed appears to have been \n     extracted from a CONFIDENTIAL document. This classification \n     was applied based on concern that the document, taken as a \n     whole, might suggest a submarine application even though it \n     was not explicitly stated. Given that the CONFIDENTIAL \n     classification cannot be explicitly supported by the \n     classification guides and that material similar to that \n     briefed by the subject has been discussed in unclassified \n     briefings and publications, it is difficult to make a case \n     that significant damage has occurred. Further, bringing \n     attention to our sensitivity concerning this subject in a \n     public forum could cause more damage to national security \n     than the original disclosure.\n       ``Based on the above, it is recommended that the disclosure \n     of this material should not be considered as the sole or \n     primary basis for further legal action.'' \\88\\\n       On 19 November 1997, the Schuster memorandum was sent to \n     Mr. Dion from Navy General Counsel Steven S. Honigman, who \n     stated that he and the Vice Chief of Naval Operations \n     concurred with Mr. Schuster's conclusions. The Schuster memo \n     has been described by various DoJ officials as a ``body \n     blow'' to the prosecution because of their view that it might \n     be ``Brady material'' or in some way exculpatory as to Dr. \n     Lee. At minimum, it seriously complicated DoJ's case.\n       The ambiguous Schuster memorandum was apparently designed \n     to later enable the Navy to take virtually any position: the \n     signal analysis techniques are unclassified; they could be \n     classified SECRET; the material was extracted from a \n     CONFIDENTIAL document; significant damage may not be \n     provable; bringing the issue to a public forum could damage \n     national security; avoid legal action. When Mr. Schuster was \n     questioned by the Subcommittee, he was unable to explain why \n     the memo was written as it was or what it meant. The most \n     charitable view of the Schuster memo is that it was \n     misleading and should never have been written.\n       The Schuster memo was based on incomplete information since \n     neither Mr. Schuster nor any other Navy or DoD personnel \n     reviewed the video or audio tapes of Dr. Lee's confession. \n     When that confession was reviewed at the Subcommittee's \n     request, Mr. Schuster, along with Dr. Donna Kulla and Wayne \n     Wilson, signed a memorandum dated 9 March 2000 stating that \n     Dr. Lee's disclosures should have been classified \n     CONFIDENTIAL.\n       Two additional memoranda were made available to the \n     Department of Justice regarding Dr. Lee's 1997 disclosures, \n     but were apparently insufficient to change the view of the \n     ISS line attorney handling the case. A classified 17 November \n     1997 memorandum, referencing a conversation with Dr. Twogood, \n     stated that, contrary to Mr. Schuster's opinion, what Dr. Lee \n     revealed to the Chinese in 1997 should be considered SECRET. \n     The memo provides substantial technical detail to make the \n     case that Mr. Schuster was incorrect in his analysis. \n     Lawrence Livermore followed up with another classified \n     memorandum on 21 November 1997, citing the opinions of both \n     Dr. Twogood and Mr. Jim Brase, who was also knowledgeable of \n     the Radar Ocean Imaging project. Most importantly, these \n     memoranda explain, in considerable scientific detail, how the \n     information Dr. Lee provided to the Chinese differed in ways \n     that made it classified from what had been on the LLNL Web \n     site, in Dr. Lee's 1995 article, and in Dr. Twogood's April \n     1994 House Armed Services Committee testimony.\n       When questioned at a Subcommittee hearing on 29 March 2000, \n     Mr. Schuster conceded that Dr. Twogood was the person to \n     accurately evaluate Dr. Lee's disclosures:\n\n       Senator Specter: Dr. Twogood testified that [Dr. Lee] gave \n     away the heart, the core . . . of the information. Would you \n     disagree with that?\n       Mr. Schuster: He was talking about the information in the \n     program. That is not my program and I don't know that I could \n     speak to the heart or core of that program.\n       Senator Specter: So that is beyond the purview of your \n     expertise or knowledge?\n       Mr. Schuster: Yes, sir, relative to the program.\n       Senator Specter: So based on your knowledge, you wouldn't \n     have a basis for disagreeing with what Dr. Twogood said?\n       Mr. Schuster: Not in that sense. I couldn't comment.\\89\\\n       Mr. Schuster sought to explain his 14 November 1997 memo by \n     saying that it was his intent to give his assessment to \n     Captain\n\n[[Page S13827]]\n\n     Dewispeleare and not to the Department of Justice.\\90\\\n       Mr. Schuster testified that he never talked to anyone in \n     the Department of Justice and had never been briefed as to \n     how sensitive Navy and DoD information could be protected by \n     the Classified Information Procedures Act.\\91\\ This is in \n     contrast to the prosecuting attorney, who testified, ``We \n     assured the Navy that we could very confidently protect \n     any classified information primarily because it was my \n     analysis that the stuff was less classified, less \n     dangerous.'' \\92\\\n       On 21 May 1999, the Navy again weighed in on the subject, \n     writing to the Cox Committee to assert that ``the draft \n     report mischaracterizes the substance and significance of the \n     disclosure made by Lee during his trip to Beijing in 1997.'' \n     \\93\\ The letter further takes issue with the Cox Committee \n     Report draft for creating the:\n       ``erroneous impression that the technology Lee discussed \n     during his 1997 Beijing trip was highly sensitive and \n     previously unknown, and that his disclosure to the PRC caused \n     grave harm to the national security, imperiling our submarine \n     forces. In the considered judgement of the Navy, fortunately \n     that is not the case.'' \\94\\\n       When questioned about this letter, Mr. Preston had no facts \n     to support his disagreement with the conclusions of the Cox \n     Committee Report. He conceded that none of the individuals \n     who had been involved in responding to the Cox Committee \n     Report had ever had access to the tapes or transcripts of Dr. \n     Lee's confession, had made no effort to obtain them, and \n     therefore did not know the full extent of what he \n     revealed.\\95\\\n     FISA Issues\n       The loss of electronic surveillance on Dr. Lee occurred at \n     a critical juncture that may have seriously hampered the \n     Government's ability to collect important counter-\n     intelligence information. When the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act (FISA) court order expired on 3 September \n     1997, it was not renewed. The FBI stated during testimony on \n     29 March 2000 that the FISA had not been renewed for several \n     reasons, including concerns within the DoJ's Office of \n     Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR) that the information on \n     Dr. Lee was ``too stale,'' \\96\\ but OIPR disagrees with the \n     FBI's characterization of what happened.\\97\\ In view of the \n     disagreement as to what actually happened with the FISA \n     request, it is only possible to conclude that the FBI should \n     have pursued the matter by making a formal written request. \n     The Counterintelligence Reform Act, which became law at the \n     end of the 106th Congress, will prevent future disputes over \n     who is responsible for the loss of FISA coverage by providing \n     a mechanism for the Director of the FBI to raise the matter \n     directly with the Attorney General, who will be required to \n     reply in writing. In this way, senior officials in both the \n     FBI and the Department of Justice can be held accountable for \n     their judgements on important espionage cases.\n     Additional issues\n       In addition to the disclosures of classified information \n     for which Dr. Lee was charged, the Government knew that: (1) \n     Dr. Lee asked for and received falsified travel documents \n     from the Chinese, which he presented to the FBI on 3 \n     September 1997,\\98\\ (2) that his travel expenses in China \n     were paid for by the Chinese,\\99\\ (3) that he enlisted the \n     assistance of Chinese officials associated with the CAEP in \n     his attempt to deceive the FBI, and (4) that he confessed on \n     videotape to intentionally passing classified information \n     during his 1997 trip to China.'' \\100\\ The only charge \n     arising from the events of 1997, however, pertained to Dr. \n     Lee's false statements on his Post-Travel Questionnaire \n     submitted to TRW.\\101\\\n       It seems apparent that obtaining false documents from a \n     Chinese official would have warranted a separate count under \n     18 USC 1001, and would have shown that Dr. Lee's 1997 \n     transgressions extended beyond his lies to his employer. The \n     Government's failure to highlight Dr. Lee's collusion with \n     officials from the Chinese institutes where he visited \n     resulted in an inaccurate portrait of his activities, one \n     that was significantly less sinister than the reality of his \n     conduct. Had this case enjoyed better communication within \n     DoJ and better cooperation from the Navy, and a more \n     aggressive approach by senior DoJ officials, Dr. Lee should \n     have been charged or required to plead to at least four \n     counts: (1) a 794 charge for the 1985 hohlraum revelations, \n     (2) a 794 charge for the 1997 anti-submarine warfare \n     revelations, (3) a false statements charge under 18 USC 1001 \n     for his lies on the TRW Post-Travel questionnaire, and (4) a \n     1001 charge for submitting false travel documents that he got \n     from the Chinese. Had these charges been filed, there is \n     little doubt that the extent of Dr. Lee's espionage and \n     attempted cover-up would have been made known. As it \n     happened, the full range of Dr. Lee's felonious conduct was \n     never presented to the Court.\n       It should be noted that Judge Hatter could have requested \n     additional information to gain a better understanding of the \n     case, but he did not. DoE witnesses were present and prepared \n     to testify in camera at the sentencing hearing regarding Dr. \n     Lee's 1985 revelations. Had the Judge heard from these expert \n     witnesses, the harm done by Dr. Lee's significant material \n     assistance to the PRC nuclear weapons program could have been \n     made clear to the Court.\n\n\n                            recommendations\n\n       The single greatest problem the Government faced was its \n     failure to come to terms with the significance of the \n     information that Dr. Lee revealed to the PRC, both in 1985 \n     and in 1997. Important were decisions were made without an \n     adequate understanding of exactly what Dr. Lee had revealed \n     and what were the consequences of those revelations. To \n     prevent these problems from happening again, I am introducing \n     legislation that would require victim agencies to produce a \n     written ``damage statement'' which states the level of \n     classification of the material alleged to have been revealed, \n     and describes in detail the potential harm to national \n     security from such revelations. The prosecution team should \n     consider the ``damage statement'' before any decision is made \n     as to whether the case should be taken to trial or a plea \n     bargain should be offered.\n       The Department of Justice and the victim agency may wish to \n     consult informally before the damage assessment is reduced to \n     writing so that the victim agency will not unwittingly and \n     incorrectly create Brady \\102\\ problems and hamper any \n     ultimate prosecution. The risks of creating potential Brady \n     material--as might happen if an initial classification \n     assessment were later reviewed and changed--are obvious, but \n     the risks of proceeding to a plea without a clear written \n     statement, made by competent officials, as to the level of \n     classification of the material in question are even greater.\n       As noted previously, the Counterintelligence Reform Act, \n     which became law in December 2000, contains a provision \n     requiring that the Justice Department provide briefings to \n     victim agency officials regarding the manner in which the \n     Classified Information Procedures Act enables a \n     prosecution to go forward without revealing additional \n     secrets. Contemporaneous written records, particularly the \n     Schuster memo, make it clear that the Navy was reluctant \n     to proceed with a prosecution due to sensitivity about a \n     public discussion of anti-submarine warfare, but the \n     process established by CIPA could have ensured that no \n     sensitive information was disclosed. In the absence of any \n     risk of disclosing classified information, the Navy's \n     general unwillingness to have anti-submarine warfare \n     discussed in a public proceeding should have had no \n     bearing on the Government's decision to proceed with a \n     prosecution. The briefing process established by the \n     Counterintelligence Reform Act will ensure that any \n     legitimate concerns of the victim agency are addressed, \n     and that the Justice Department will be able to \n     distinguish between real security concerns and a general \n     unwillingness to support a prosecution.\n       Although I do not intend to introduce legislation requiring \n     it, I believe that key instructions from Main Justice \n     (Internal Security Section, etc.) to the U.S. Attorney's \n     Office with responsibility for prosecuting the case, \n     including charging authority and plea bargain authority, \n     should be in writing. These written instructions should be \n     shared with the FBI and the victim agency so they have an \n     opportunity for input before any final decisions are made. \n     There can be no doubt that key officials in this case were \n     operating under severe misunderstandings. The prosecuting \n     attorney thought his instructions were that he had to accept \n     a plea under Sections 793 and 1001 or nothing, while the \n     Internal Security Section claimed that it was still open to a \n     possible 794 prosecution. Key officials within the Department \n     of Defense, up to and including the Secretary, were informed \n     that if Dr. Lee refused the plea agreement, he would be \n     prosecuted under Section 794. With so much misunderstanding, \n     it is surprising that the prosecution did not suffer even \n     more.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       This was an important espionage case, yet remarkably little \n     was documented during the key weeks leading up to the plea \n     agreement in late 1997. Decision-makers within the Department \n     of Justice and the Department of Defense clearly have \n     discretion in executing their responsibilities, and should \n     not be second-guessed at every turn. However, the need to \n     strike a balance between protecting the national security--\n     which can conceivably be achieved by not prosecuting in \n     certain circumstances--and the equal application of the laws \n     to ensure justice is done, requires that when judgements are \n     made for which the reasons are not immediately apparent, the \n     decision-makers must offer some explanation for their \n     actions. In the absence of such a documented rationale for \n     what may be necessary exceptions, the result is what appears \n     to be arbitrary application of the laws, an outcome which \n     protects neither the national security nor the law. The \n     Government's handling of the Dr. Peter Lee case demonstrates \n     clearly that ongoing, thorough congressional oversight is \n     essential.\n\n\n                                Endnotes\n\n       1.

Mr. President and colleagues, while we are waiting some \nother colleagues to return to this Chamber to negotiate, I would like \nto make just a short comment on the economic stimulus package.\n  I would imagine that right now the political pundits of Washington, \nand really the political pundits all around the country, are already \nsharpening their pencils, and the editorial writers are already banging \naway on their typewriters, as well as the political consultants and all \nthe special-interest groups are preparing, already, their attack ads to \nblame someone for the failure of this Congress to complete and pass an \neconomic stimulus package.\n  Over the next several days, and possibly even over the next several \nweeks, we are going to hear some say: Well, it is Tom Daschle's fault \nthat we do not have an economic stimulus package because he did not \nbring the package to the Senate floor. We will also hear that, no, it \nis the Republican leader's fault because they only supported a package \nthat helped the rich special interests. Or perhaps we will hear that, \nno, it is the fault of the President of the United States for not \nproviding the leadership to bring both sides together.\n  The blame game has now begun. I have noticed the papers already this \nmorning.\n  The Wall Street Journal said: The White House and congressional \nleaders fail to reach a compromise and now turn their efforts instead \nto casting blame for its failure.\n  The front page of the Washington Post this morning said: Yesterday, \nas both sides began engaging in a furious legislative end game designed \nto assign blame to the other party for failure . . .\n  The front page of the New York Times said the same thing, in essence. \nThey said: The Bush administration, along with others, turned instead \nto partisan finger pointing over who was to blame for the impasse.\n  So, my colleagues and folks around the country, the blame game has \nalready begun.\n  But one thing is very certain, and that is Americans cannot go to the \ngrocery store and buy bread and buy milk with blame. It does not work.\n  When Congress fails to act, it is not our political parties that are \nhurt but the people we represent are truly the ones who are hurt.\n  Unfortunately, our political parties sometimes believe that they are \nactually helped when nothing is done so that they can blame the other \nside for failure and perhaps pick up a few congressional seats or \nperhaps even take over the White House.\n  Perhaps we, as members of the centrist coalition, should have gotten \ninvolved sooner. Maybe we should have offered our congressional \nproposal, blending the best ideas from both sides, earlier than we did. \nIt might have helped.\n  Perhaps the White House should have become engaged earlier than they \ndid. Maybe they should have been stronger in telling both sides to work \ntogether for an agreement.\n  Perhaps, perhaps, maybe, maybe, might have, might have, but in the \nend our biggest enemy was time. There simply was not sufficient time \nremaining to take up an extremely complicated package, only passed late \nlast night by the House of Representatives, and to try to explain it \nsufficiently to colleagues in the Senate in order for people to take a \nrational vote on that legislation.\n  To those who try to blame Leader Tom Daschle, I say, baloney. I was \nthere. I worked hard for an agreement. But we did not in the end--and \nwe do not now--have the votes to pass such a package in the Senate. I \nknow that. We all know that. And it serves no one to bring up, in the \nlast few hours, a very complicated package only for political purposes \nwhen we know the votes are not there.\n  The good news is that we came very close and can use the progress \nthat we made in these negotiations to pass a package when we return in \nJanuary. Both sides moved. We moved on taxes. We moved on health \ncoverage. But only if we allow the outside forces to poison the wells \nso badly that we cannot negotiate will we not be able to reach an \nagreement.\n  Both sides must realize in a divided government we must compromise or \nnothing will get done. Businesses will get no relief or incentives to \ngrow. Individuals will get no stimulus checks.\n  Unless we come together and reach an agreement, businesses will get \nno relief. They will get no incentives to grow. Individuals, on the \nother hand, will get no stimulus checks. They will get no extended \nunemployment compensation. They will get no Federal assistance to buy \ntheir health insurance.\n  For the first time in this country's history, we had the Federal \nGovernment paying for over one-half of an unemployed worker's health \ninsurance. Now they must pay 100 percent. We came close.\n  The special interests in both our Democratic Party and our Republican \nParty must realize that in representing their constituents, they need \nto be flexible. They cannot insist that those of us who care about them \nbe forced into a ``we want it all or nothing'' situation. In that case, \nthe ``all or nothing'' situation produces nothing.\n  Is ``nothing'' what they want for the people they represent? Can they \ntell the workers, over the holidays, that not getting $14 billion in \nstimulus checks and not getting $18 billion in unemployment money and \nnot getting $21 billion more in health assistance was the right thing \nfor them because there were other provisions that would not directly \nhelp them that was also part of the package?\n  Can business lobbyists say they are better off with no accelerated \ndepreciation because they wanted it for 3 years? Or are they really \nbetter off with no AMT relief because they wanted a permanent repeal \ninstead of only a partial repeal?\n  Is it not better to reach an agreement that you can get 70 percent of \nwhat you want and then fight for the remainder in the future?\n  Neither Medicare nor Social Security started out providing everything \nthey\n\n[[Page S13832]]\n\nprovide today. Government is a gradual thing, and that is not bad. It \nis what American Government does best. We evolve. We cannot be \nstagnant.\n\n  More and more Americans look at Washington and wonder why it does not \nwork as it should. Why do grown men and women fight and argue when \nsolutions need to be reached? Especially is this true as a feeling \namong younger voters.\n  Let me conclude by pointing out that in the height of the \nPresidential election squabble in Florida, the Gallup organization \nasked Americans at that time, in a national poll, about their political \naffiliation. Shockingly, for some Americans, the poll came back and \nsaid that 42 percent of Americans identified themselves as \nIndependents. That was more than who identified themselves as either \nDemocrats or Republicans.\n  There is a message there: Americans do not want blame as a theme song \nfor their Government. They want results. They want results that help \nthem, and they do not particularly care who produces it.\n  I hope we can all learn from this experience. The greater challenges \nahead can be solved only by working for the greater good. We can only \ndo that by working together in order to achieve it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MILLER addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The clerk will report the \nconference report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3338) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, agree to the \n     same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by all conferees on the part of the two Houses.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of December 19, 2001.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to offer my \nunqualified support for the conference agreement that was just \nreported. I am pleased to present the recommendations to the Senate \ntoday as division A of this measure. The recommendations contain the \nresult of lengthy negotiations between the House and Senate managers \nand countless hours of work by our staffs acting on behalf of all \nMembers.\n  The agreement provides $317.2 billion, the same as the House and \nSenate levels, consistent with our 302(b) allocations.\n  In order to accommodate Members of the Senate, may I request that I \nbe given the opportunity to now set aside my statement and yield to the \nSenator from Arizona for his statement. Upon his conclusion, I will \nresume my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am not ready to give my statement yet. I \nam still having my people come over with information. As a matter of \nfact, we haven't even gotten through the entire bill yet. I will be \nready shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join the distinguished chairman of the \ndefense subcommittee, Senator Inouye, in presenting the fiscal year \n2002 Department of Defense conference report to the Senate.\n  This bill enjoys my total support, and I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport this conference report, and the funds provided herein that are \nvital to our national security.\n  In addition to the base funding for the current fiscal year, this \nbill also includes the allocation of $20 billion in emergency \nsupplemental funding provided by Congress immediately after the \nSeptember 11 attack.\n  These funds fulfill the commitment made by Congress to respond to the \nneeds of the victims of the September 11 attack. I commend the Governor \nof New York, the Mayor of New York City, and the two Senators from New \nYork, for their stalwart work to ensure these funds meet the needs of \ntheir constituents.\n  The enhanced funding provided in Division B of this bill for homeland \ndefense will also have a significant effect on the security of this \nnation.\n  It is appropriate that the homeland defense funding be included in \nthis bill--in the war against terrorism, there are no boundaries.\n  The money in this bill to secure our borders, our airports, our \nports, to protect against bioterrorism and to assist first responders \nwill send a strong signal to our citizens, and our potential \nadversaries, of our determination to win this war on terrorism on every \nfront.\n  Turning more specifically to the underlying defense bill in Division \nA, there are two matters in particular I wish to address today: missile \ndefense and the tanker leasing initiative.\n  The Senate version of the bill provided the full $8.3 billion \nrequested by Secretary Rumsfeld for missile defense programs. The House \nbill provided approximately $7.8 billion.\n  During our conference, we were informed of two major program changes \nin missile defense.\n  The Undersecretary of Defense for acquisition, on behalf of Secretary \nRumsfeld, reported that the department would terminate the Navy area \ndefense system, and the SBIRS-low satellite program.\n  Funding for these two programs, totaling more than $700 million, was \nrealigned to other defense priorities within and outside missile \ndefense.\n  For example, of the Navy area program funds, $100 million was \nreserved for termination liabilities for the program and $75 million \nwas transferred to the airborne laser program.\n  From the SBIRS-low termination, $250 million is reserved for \nsatellite sensor technology development--which could all be used for \nfurther work under the existing SBIRS-low contracts, if the department \nso chooses.\n  Addressing the significance of protecting our deployed forces, the \nconference agreement provides an additional $60 million over the budget \nrequest to accelerate production of the Patriot PAC-3 missile.\n  In his statement, the chairman of the subcommittee articulated his \nsupport for the air refueling tanker initiative, and I appreciate his \nkind words on my role in that effort.\n  Contrary to some reports, this provision was not a last minute \nindustry bailout, hidden from public view. In fact, this responds to \nmilitary need,\n\n[[Page S13833]]\n\nand unforeseen economic circumstances--and opportunities.\n  The effort to lease these aircraft reflects an extensive review of \nthe Air Force's needs, and the crisis it faces in the air refueling \nfleet.\n  This lease provision, provides permissive authority for the Secretary \nof the Air Force to replace the 134 oldest KC-135E aircraft with new \ntankers.\n  These aircraft average 42 years of age, and have not received the \ncomprehensive ``R'' model refurbishment.\n  All of these aircraft are operated by the Air National Guard, at \nbases throughout the Nation. The lease will provide the new tankers to \nthe Air Force, and permit recently refurbished ``R'' models to cascade \nto the Guard.\n  This permits the National Guard to have a common fleet of aircraft, \nproviding significant training and maintenance cost savings. They daily \ndo the refueling operations for our Air Force planes nationally and \nthroughout the world.\n  The KC-135E aircraft require extensive depot maintenance. Once every \n5 years, we lose that aircraft for an average of 428 days, and many \nmore than 600 days.\n  That means a squadron loses that aircraft for at least 15 months, up \nto 2 years.\n  At any one time, one third of the fleet is unavailable for service--\nredlined--putting that much more pressure on the rest of the force.\n  During peacetime, one might argue we can survive with an inadequate \nair refueling fleet. Now, in wartime, the price for that failure \nbecomes clear.\n  Every sortie flown into Afghanistan requires at least two, and \nsometimes as many as four, aerial refuelings. This is the highest rate \nof sustained operations we have maintained since the gulf war.\n  In the 10 years since that conflict, we have not purchased one new \ntanker--we've watched the fleet age and deteriorate. I know the feeling \nof watching a fuel gauge determine the fate of an aircraft and crew. It \nis not a comfortable or pleasant one. I remember one time I ran out of \nfuel on landing and had to have the aircraft towed off the field.\n  This may sound like an arcane discussion, compared to the allure of \nnew F-22's, or B-2 bombers, but let me give you an old transport \npilot's perspective.\n  Our forces today have virtually no margin for error--an F-15 doesn't \nglide very long, and an F-18 that cannot make the carrier deck has \nlittle hope for survival.\n  We can buy the exciting, and needed, new weapons platforms but \nwithout the gas they'll never get home after the fight.\n  Some have suggested the leasing approach is not a good deal for the \nGovernment. That is simply wrong. This provision includes the most \nstringent requirements ever set for an aircraft leasing program.\n  The law states that the cost to the Air Force for the lease cannot \nexceed 90 percent of the fair market value of the aircraft. That means \nthe Secretary cannot sign a contract if the lease cost would exceed \nthat threshold.\n  The Secretary must report to the Congress all the details of any \nproposed contract in advance of signing any agreement. We will get to \nlook at this contract before the deal is set.\n  Mr. President, nothing in the leasing authority provided in this bill \nis directive--the discretion rests solely with the Secretary of the Air \nForce.\n  I have had extensive discussions about this initiative with the \nSecretary, with the former Commander of the Transportation Command, \nGen. Robertson, and other DOD officials.\n  All have endorsed this approach.\n  The language in this bill is the product of extensive discussions \nwith CBO and OMB. No objection has been raised.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld's letter on the bill did not object to this \ninitiative, nor did the Department's detailed appeals to the \nAppropriations Conference.\n  Since taking office, Secretary Rumsfeld has sought to chart a course \nto manage the Pentagon consistent with the best practices in the \nprivate sector.\n  This initiative seeks to do just that--give the Secretary all the \ntools we can to meet the Department's modernization needs, within the \ntight budget constraints he will face.\n  The airlines lease aircraft, private businesses lease aircraft, our \nally Great Britain currently leases U.S. built C-17 aircraft.\n  In addition, Great Britain has issued a solicitation to lease air \nrefueling tankers, and the Boeing 767 is the lead candidate.\n  We did not decide to choose the 767. The Air Force told us this is \nthe right aircraft for the mission.\n  Gen. Jumper, the Air Force Chief, envisions moving the Air Force to a \ncommon wide body platform for a range of missions--he determined the \n767 is the best platform.\n  Interestingly, two of our closest allies--Italy and Japan--have \nalready signed contracts to purchase 767 tankers on a commercial basis.\n  Some have suggested that this provision should have opened the door \nto competition with Airbus.\n  The problem is that Airbus does not have a tanker on the world \nmarket. More telling, two of the Airbus founding partners--Britain and \nItaly--have both opted for the American-built tanker for their \nmilitary.\n  Personally, I have complete confidence we can extend this authority \nto the Secretary of the Air Force, and he will only use it if he \nbelieves it is absolutely in the best interest of the Air Force.\n  I want to close by thanking again our Chairman, Senator Inouye, for \nhis leadership in moving this bill through committee, the floor and \nconference in only 15 days--an incredible achievement.\n  Also, our partners in the House, Chairman Lewis and Mr. Murtha, and \nthe full committee chairman, Congressman Bill Young and ranking member, \nDave Obey, deserve tremendous credit for managing their bill in the \nHouse, and working out this package in conference.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Stevens and Senator \nInouye for the hard work they did on this bill. Since this bill was \nleft to be the last appropriations bill passed this year, it had many \ndifficulties. During this time, our Armed Forces were prosecuting a war \non last year's budget. That is very serious and it is unacceptable. We \nmust pass this bill today. It is a good bill.\n  Our armed services need the extra help that is in this bill. It \nprovides $26 billion more in spending for the Department of Defense \nthan was appropriated last year. That gives us the added equipment we \nneed to be in Afghanistan and throughout the world, as we are today. It \nalso reduces the military/civilian paygap by funding a pay raise of 5 \npercent across the board and up to 10 percent for targeted ranks with \nlow-retention rates.\n  Thank goodness we are trying to address people who are leaving the \narmed services because we just can't compete with the private sector. \nAlso, I want to mention the TRICARE For Life; $3.9 billion in this bill \nimplements TRICARE For Life. This is something I worked on for a long \ntime to make sure that those who have served in our military, who have \ndone what we asked them to do for our country, will never be left \nwithout full medical care. That is something they deserve, it is \nsomething we promised, and it is a promise we must keep.\n  I am very pleased that, finally, Desert Storm veterans are getting \nthe notice they deserve for the symptoms that one in seven of them have \nshown after returning to our country after serving in Desert Storm. One \nin seven of the people who served in the Desert Storm operation came \nback with symptoms and different stages of debilitation that they did \nnot have when they went to serve our country.\n  But for years, the Department of Defense and the Department of \nVeterans Affairs have denied there was any kind of causal connection \nbetween these symptoms and their service. It just wasn't plausible.\n  I happened to learn about some research that was being done at the \nUniversity of Texas, Southwestern Medical School, that did find a \ncausal connection in a very small unit; it was the first research that \nreally showed the causal connection between actual brain damage and \nservice in the gulf war.\n  This last week, I am proud to say, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, \nSecretary Principi, released a study indicating that gulf war vets are \ntwice as\n\n[[Page S13834]]\n\nlikely to get ALS; that is, Lou Gehrig's disease. To his credit, \nSecretary Principi immediately widened the gulf war presumption to \ncover victims of Lou Gehrig's disease. I have also extended for 5 \nyears--and the President has signed the bill--the presumption that the \npeople with these symptoms would still be able to get the benefits to \nwhich they are entitled, even though it hasn't been settled exactly \nwhat Desert Storm disease is.\n  So the bill before us today does have $5 million to continue the \nresearch that shows that causal connection. That will not only help \nkeep our promise to the people who served in Desert Storm, but it will \nalso help us understand those whom we are sending today into places \nwhere there could be chemical warfare and what we might do to give them \nthe best protection against that chemical warfare. It will also help us \nto inoculate and treat those who might be affected by chemical warfare \nin the future. This is something I worked on in the bill, and I \nappreciate so much Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens supporting this \nparticular cause because I think these veterans have been ignored for \ntoo long. It is time we treated them the way they deserve to be \ntreated, and that is to give them the medical care and the research to \nfind the cause of the debilitating disease that we see in so many of \nthe people.\n\n  Finally, I am very pleased that the bill provides for missile \ndefense. Clearly, we now have a cause to go forward on missile defense. \nI have always thought it was better to err on the side of doing more \nfor defense, even if we weren't sure what the threats were. Now we know \nthere are people throughout the world who will attack Americans just \nbecause we are Americans. So we must defend against that. That is what \nthe missile defense system will prepare our country to do.\n  This bill provides for that. I close by saying there may be small \nthings in this bill that people don't like. I am sure there are some \nthings in this bill that some people would not support. But the big \nthings are done right. It would be inexcusable for us not to fully fund \nthe war, while we have troops on the ground fighting for the very \nfreedom that we have in this country and that we enjoy in this country.\n  As we are leaving Congress to go home for the holidays with our \nfamilies, we must show our appreciation to those who are in the caves \nin Afghanistan, in Uzbekistan and Pakistan, and who are on missions in \nSaudi Arabia and Kuwait, who are ready to go at the call of our \ncountry, if need be. We want to remember them. I think the most \nimportant way we can say thank you to those people is to fully fund \ntheir training, their equipment, and the support they deserve as they \nare going forward in the name of freedom and representing our country \nin the best possible way.\n  I thank Senator Inouye for being the great leader that he is and \nSenator Stevens for working in a bipartisan way to assure our troops \nthat we appreciate them and we are going to give them everything they \nneed to do the job they are doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. On behalf of Senator Stevens and I, I express our \ngratitude to the Senator from Texas for her kind remarks.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 1214\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate considers Calendar No. 161, S. 1214, the port security bill, the \nonly amendment in order be the Hollings-McCain-Graham substitute \namendment, which is at the desk; that there be a time limitation for \ndebate of 17 minutes to be divided as follows: 5 minutes each for \nSenators Hollings, McCain, and Murkowski, and 2 minutes for Senator \nHutchison; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the substitute \namendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time \nand passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with \nno further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to applaud a provision in the supplemental \nportion of the Defense appropriations conference report. This \nconference report includes a bill authored by myself and Senator Kyl \nthat will help honor the victims of the September 11 attacks. It is \ncalled the Unity in the Spirit of America Act, or the USA Act.\n  We all witnessed a great national tragedy 3 months ago. While the \ndeaths and damage occurred in New York, Washington, and in the fields \nof Pennsylvania, a piece of all of us died that day. Many people came \nup to me in Michigan after the attacks and asked: What can I do? I have \ngiven blood, I have donated to relief efforts, but I want to do more.\n  We all shared in the horror and now everyone wants to share in the \nhealing, but how? Then a constituent of mine, Bob Van Oosterhout, wrote \nme with an idea: Why not have the Federal Government devise a program \nthat will encourage communities throughout the Nation to create \nsomething that will honor the memory of one of the victims lost in the \nattack, one by one by one. Together these local memorials to honor \nindividuals would dot our Nation and collectively honor all of those \nwho were lost in the attacks. What could be simpler or more moving?\n  From that idea came the Unity in the Spirit of America Act. Here is \nhow it works:\n  Communities--they can be as small as a neighborhood block or \nnonprofit organizations, houses of worship, businesses or local \ngovernments--are encouraged to choose some kind of project that will \nunite and help their communities. It is a way they can give back to \ntheir community.\n  Applications and the assigning of names for each project will be \nhandled by the Points of Light Foundation. Basically, we will see a \nproject in a local community dedicated to one of the victims of \nSeptember 11. The Points of Light Foundation will set up a Web site, \napplications, and procedures for this. This is privately funded. It is \nan opportunity for our neighbors, coworkers, and communities across the \nUnited States to decide what will be a living legacy to those who died \nby helping each other.\n  The Points of Light Foundation will track each project's progress on \ntheir Web site. The only rule is that qualified projects should be \nstarted by September 11, 2002. Then on that day, as all over America we \ngather to grieve over the first anniversary of the attack that enraged \nthe world, we will be able to look over thousands and thousands of \nselfless acts that made our country better.\n  In our sadness, we can create thousands of points of light across our \nNation and show the world that our resolve was not fleeting and our \nmemories are not short. They will see the unity in the spirit of \nAmerica.\n  I have many Members to thank for making the USA Act happen. First and \nforemost, I thank my chief cosponsor, Senator Jon Kyl, for his \ncommitment and hard work. I thank the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, Senators Inouye and \nStevens, for their support. I also express my gratitude to Senators \nMikulski and Bond for their guidance in moving this legislation through \nthe process. Finally, I thank all the cosponsors, who include our \nSenators from New York and Virginia.\n  I am very pleased we have come together on our last day in a \nbipartisan way to put forward this important living legacy to the \nvictims of September 11.\n  Mr. President, I now yield to my colleague and friend who has been my \npartner in the USA Act, and that is Senator Jon Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for her \nleadership in this effort. It has been a pleasure to work with her on \nthis legislation. It demonstrates a couple of things: First, that all \nAmericans care about the victims of the tragedy of September 11. \nSecond, that the U.S. Government can be a facilitator but does not have \nto be the financier of good works on behalf of the people of the \ncountry.\n  At the conclusion of my remarks, I will ask to print in the Record a \nletter\n\n[[Page S13835]]\n\nfrom Robert K. Goodwin who is the president of the Points of Light \nFoundation.\n  The president of the Points of Light Foundation points out that there \nare no Federal funds used in this project but, rather, that money has \nbeen raised by people from around the country to support these projects \nthat literally will exist in every corner of this great country. Each \none of these projects will be named for one of the victims of the \nSeptember 11 tragedy.\n  What the Points of Light Foundation will do is help coordinate so \nthere is a common listing of all the different projects, in which part \nof the country they are located, and coordinating with the names of the \nvictims. This is a good project for the American people to demonstrate \ntheir support for the country, to do good works at the same time, and \nto memorialize the victims of the tragedy of September 11.\n  I compliment the cosponsor of the legislation and the chairman and \nranking member of the committee for including this legislation in the \nDefense appropriations bill. I appreciate our colleagues' support for \nthis important project.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \npresident of the Points of Light Foundation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Points of Light Foundation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 20, 2001.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: The Points of Light Foundation would like \n     to take this opportunity to sincerely thank you for your \n     support and leadership of the Unity in the Spirit of America \n     (USA). We were informed last evening that it will indeed be a \n     part of the FY 2002 Defense Appropriations Bill. We are \n     excited and humbled by this opportunity to create living \n     memorials through service and volunteering, to those who \n     perished as a result of the September 11th terrorist attacks.\n       Please also let me extend my gratitude to your Legislative \n     Director, Tom Alexander. His hard work in securing the \n     necessary support was particularly appreciated as the bill \n     made its way through several conference committees. His \n     continued accessibility and hands-on approach were \n     invaluable.\n       As the USA Act stipulates, no federal funds will be \n     utilized in carrying out its provisions. We are extremely \n     pleased to inform you that we have secured significant \n     private and corporate donations to fulfill this most worthy \n     project. In fact, The Walt Disney Company has made a \n     substantial commitment, paving the way for countless \n     community-based memorial service projects, as well as an \n     expansive national media campaign. We look forward to \n     continuing to work closely with yourself and Senator Stabenow \n     in cultivating this important initiative.\n       In closing, please accept our gratitude and best wishes for \n     a safe, happy and healthy holiday season.\n           Your very truly,\n                                                 Robert K. Goodwin\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan if I may be a sponsor of the amendment. It is a very exciting \namendment that we should be considering today.\n  Ms. STABENOW. It will be my honor, Mr. President, to add the \ndistinguished Senator's name.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, pursuant to the agreement, will the Chair \nrecognize the Senator from Arizona?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not yet seek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, since no one is seeking time, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from New Mexico be allowed to speak \nfor 5 minutes on the economic stimulus package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. What is the pending business? What is the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has asked to speak \nfor up to 5 minutes on the economic stimulus package.\n  Mr. REID. I reserve the right to object and ask the Senator to amend \nhis request so that the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Miller, and the \nSenator from Nebraska, Mr. Nelson, have 5 minutes to speak on the \neconomic stimulus package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time?\n  Mr. REID. Two Senators, 5 minutes each: Senators Nelson and Miller.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Economic Stimulus Package\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to express my sincere \ndisappointment with our seeming inability to consider a stimulus \npackage; that is, a job-creating piece of legislation, for our people. \nMillions of Americans have lost their jobs over the last year. My \nfellow New Mexicans, as do all Americans, want and deserve action on \nthis slowing economy.\n  Let me be very clear. While some would like a different stimulus \npackage than the one the House passed in the early morning hours today, \nthere are alternatives that were considered in this first session.\n  The House-passed bill will provide needed tax relief to millions of \nworking Americans. It will provide tax relief to those individuals who \nmake more than $28,000 and those who file joint returns making more \nthan $46,000.\n  These are not rich people. These are hard-working Americans.\n  Along with provisions to encourage business investment with 30 \npercent depreciation and extending businesses net operating losses \ncarry back for two years, and increasing expensing provisions for small \nbusinesses, the House-passed bill provides nearly $60 billion in tax \nrelief to encourage growth in this weakened economy.\n  Further, addressing many of the concerns raised on the other side of \nthe aisle, the House-passed bill is a significant improvement over an \nearlier bill in the area of providing needed help to the unemployed and \ndislocated workers.\n  The House-passed bill provides significant support for those who for \nreasons they do not control, find themselves without employment this \nholiday season--all totaled nearly $32 billion would be provided in the \nform of direct payments to low-income workers, extended unemployment \nbenefits and health insurance assistance.\n  The House-passed bill provides cash payments for those who filed a \ntax return in 2000 but did not receive a rebate check earlier this \nyear. These payments will be $300 for individuals and $600 for married \ncouples.\n  The House-passed bill provides 13 weeks of extended unemployment \ninsurance going back to those displaced from work from the beginning of \nthis recession last March.\n  And including $8 billion in National Emergency Grants and Emergency \nMedicaid funding to the states, over $21 billion would be assist \nindividuals and families with their health care costs immediately.\n  The House-passed bill is not perfect. But it is a major improvement \nover an earlier version, largely because of the input of a group of \nSenators know as the Centrists here and because of President Bush's \nwillingness to work with them in crafting this package.\n  I hope that we do not let ``one man rule'' prevent us from even \nhaving a vote on this bill.\n  We need to pass something. But if we don't assure you I will be the \nfirst to be back here in January asking that we consider the ``payroll \ntax holiday'' proposal.\n  I will take the remaining few minutes and talk to my fellow Senators. \nWhatever the case and whoever could not reach accord, I believe we have \nto tell our fellow Americans we did not do them right in the waning \ndays of this session. While Christmas is upon us and good will is \neverywhere, it is quite obvious the House and Senate, even with the \nPresident nudging and participating, did not and will not produce a \nstimulus package that will get America going again.\n  I wish we would have considered something in the Senate. I believe \nthere was time for us to consider amendments and even vote on a \nstimulus package. I think that could have been worked out, and we could \nhave passed something. I regret we have not. I say to the leadership in \nthe Senate, they could have done better.\n  While I have great respect and, in some cases, admiration for our \nleadership, I believe in this case one-man rule prevailed, the \nDemocratic majority\n\n[[Page S13836]]\n\nleader prevailed. He has what I would call a one-man rule because he \ncan keep us from debating and considering the House-passed measure. He \ncan do that all by himself. That is a very big undertaking by any one \nSenator, to say we are not going to consider a stimulus package this \nyear in this Senate. That is one-man rule. That is a very big exercise \nof power.\n  While the Democratic majority leader has a very difficult job in the \nwaning moments because of different ideas and different proposals and \nobviously some politics, I think we should have done better and he \nshould have done better.\n  I close by saying I proposed, along with about 10 Senators, an idea \nfor a holiday from the Social Security taxes imposed on both employee \nand employer, to do that for 1 month. Nobody suggested to me that is \nnot a very good stimulus, to put before the American people a month \nthat is picked in the near future to put $42 billion into the hands of \nevery working man and woman and every employer across this land in a \nrather instant payment to them, or nonpayment to the Government, of \nSocial Security withholding.\n  I believe if we start over with good will, and in a nonpartisan way, \nwhen we return because I do not believe the economy will improve and we \nwill be back at this--I urge we consider it at a high enough level to \nlet the country focus on this idea.\n  There is a lot of talk about the negative aspects of it, and most of \nthem are untrue. If we have a chance to get this issue before a \ncommittee, or debate it in the Senate, we would have a great starting \npoint to which we could add the social welfare aspects of the \nunemployment benefits, of some health care coverage, and all the other \nissues we are talking about. We would have as a basis a single powerful \nissue that would be building jobs and causing America to take a look \nand say we know how to do something very positive.\n  So I do not give up. If we are doing nothing, I assume this idea will \ncome back and I assume, when we start thinking about it and analyze it \nwell, it will be high on the agenda.\n  I say to all of my friends in the Senate, they worked very hard. I \ncongratulate them. They worked either as a centrist member of the \ncommittee or member of the leadership, put in a lot of time, a lot of \neffort. I am hopeful even in the last moment it will work and somehow \nit will come out of the forest and be sitting there for us to look at.\n  If not, then I urge when we come back and consider how we stimulate, \nthat we put this holiday back on the table with all the other things we \nhave been considering.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity \nto address the Chamber today and speak on a very important issue we \nhave all been concerned about and we all have had comments about, \ncontinue to have thoughts about, and will continue to have them into \nthe future. I speak of the stimulus package.\n  It is unfortunate we missed the opportunity to be able to conclude a \npackage of the type the centrists put together based on what was \nsupported by so many different individuals and groups. Unfortunately, \nthe blame has already begun. So we are in a position where we are \ntalking about would have, could have, should have. We will have an \nopportunity as time goes by over this holiday break to continue to talk \nand continue to look for solutions.\n  In January, something must in fact be done so we can move forward to \nprotect the jobs of those who currently have them, help those \nindividuals who have lost them, and help create new jobs. This is about \nthree things: Jobs, jobs, jobs. And it is about the people who support \nthem.\n\n\n                          Terrorism Insurance\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. In addition to being concerned about the \nfuture of the stimulus package, there is an aspect of stimulus that is \ninvolved in another proposal that hopefully will be brought up today, \nand that is the terrorism insurance issue. It is not about insurers, it \nis about insureds. It is about the ability to be able to insure one's \nproperty, one's house, one's home, one's apartment, one's automobile. \nIf one is a business owner, it is about insuring their storefront or \ntheir business. It is about having workers compensation insurance and \nliability insurance. It is about having insurance for the protection \none needs.\n  There is a very important timeframe we must in fact look at, and that \nis January 1 of this coming year. I am hopeful we will be able to \nsettle today on a bill and be able to pass something and send it on for \nreconciliation in conference, so we can match or in some way make it \nclose enough to the House version that a reconciliation of the \nconference committee is possible, because if we fail to do that, there \nis a possibility, and perhaps even a strong likelihood, that on January \n1 of this coming year 70 percent of the reinsurance that is currently \navailable to direct writers will be affected. It may not provide for \nterrorism in the future.\n  I know for many people it seems sort of esoteric. It seems sort of \ncomplex and perhaps eyes-glazed-over thinking about insurance and \nreinsurance and whether there will be protection for terrorism or not, \nbut it is a very real issue, a very real and present concern we must in \nfact have. It is not about simply insuring skyscrapers. It is about \ninsuring small businesses. It is about apartment buildings, \nstorefronts, and people's own personal residences, as well as their \nautomobiles. It is about whether or not money will be available for \nlending or whether or not it will continue to be available for \nconstruction.\n  If we are concerned, as I think we are, about a worsening economy and \nat what point we will be able to see the economy turn around and be \nstimulated so it can be a robust economy, one of the things we must in \nfact be concerned about is anything that tips the scales against the \neconomy we have today that can make it worse. In fact, failure to take \naction can make it worse by not taking the appropriate action to \nundergird and support it.\n  If we are unable to come together and make sure insurance continues \nto be available, as well as affordable, but certainly available to the \npublic, if we fail to take that opportunity, then we might expect \nconstruction will be impeded, if not stopped, and that we may in fact \nsee housing starts and other building starts stopped.\n  Unemployment can be affected. We could end up with more people \nunemployed, and the economic downturn could be accelerated. I say these \nthings not to provide a scare tactic but simply to impress as to how \nimportant it is we solve this problem of availability of terrorism \ninsurance in the near term so we can work for a longer term solution.\n\n  What has been offered to date is, in fact, a short-term solution, a \nbackup, a compromise to work in the immediate term, the short term, \nwith broad-based support. I hope we will take this up and move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, I, too, will have a few remarks on the \neconomic stimulus bill. I think a decision not to have a straight up-\nor-down vote on it and let the majority of this Senate prevail, \nregardless of the makeup of the majority, is a mistake. I know it is a \nloss for the country and the folks who need our help and need it \nimmediately.\n  Why do we always have to act as if we are in a football game where \none side, one team, has to win and the other team has to lose? Why \ncan't we have both parties the winners, along with the American people?\n  Myself, when it gets down to the block, I am kind of a half-a-loaf \nman. Whether it is 75 percent, 65 percent, or 50 percent, when you get \nright down to it, that is always better than zero percent. You can eat \nhalf a loaf. Having no loaf at all may make a political point, but in \nthe end somebody goes hungry.\n  This is not the House bill. I could never have supported that bill. I \nwould never have voted for it. This compromise package does not include \neverything either side wanted. Instead, it represents a reasonable \ncompromise.\n  Some say speeding up the reduction of the tax rates from 27 percent \nto 25 percent is just helping the wealthy. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. The folks who benefit from this are folks who earn as \nlittle as $27,000 a year, going up to $67,000 a year. For married \ncouples, this rate reduction would help those who earn between $47,000 \nto $120,000 a year. Those are not the wealthy or the rich. Those are \nmiddle-income Americans. Many are our\n\n[[Page S13837]]\n\nfriends and organized labor. This bill also includes a $300 rebate for \nthose who did not get anything from the earlier tax cut.\n  On the health insurance area, we recognize the need to help the \nunemployed by providing health insurance for them. This is a very \nsignificant change. This is a dramatic change and should be welcomed by \nboth Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  Some argue that the best way to give laid-off workers access to \nhealth care is to provide a 75-percent subsidy for COBRA premiums, as \nwell as access to State Medicaid Programs. Others disagreed and \npreferred a broader tax credit for health insurance premiums. This \npackage falls somewhere in between, providing a 60-percent advanceable, \nrefundable tax credit for all health insurance.\n  It is not a whole loaf for anyone, but it represents a practical \nsolution, and it is the best way to do what we all want; that is, to \nhelp the workers and help them before it is too late.\n  The package also includes help for State governments, something our \nGovernors and legislators desperately need right now. It provides \nalmost $5 billion in payments to State Medicaid Programs. This does not \nrepresent everything States or many of us wanted. I was hoping to get a \nfix for the upper payment limit but, again, it is half a loaf.\n  As it is, we have no loaf. We have no loaf at all. We do not even \nhave a slice. Who was it who said, Let them eat cake?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                         Defense Appropriations\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise, once again, to address the issue \nof wasteful spending in appropriations measures; in this case, the bill \nfunding the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2002.\n  In provisions too numerous to mention in detail, this bill, time and \nagain, chooses to fund porkbarrel projects with little, if any, \nrelationship to national defense at a time of scarce resources, budget \ndeficits, and underfunded urgent defense priorities.\n  The Web site of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, in its \nopening sentence, states the following:\n\n       Authorization laws have two basic purposes. They establish, \n     continue, or modify Federal programs, and they are a \n     prerequisite under House and Senate rules . . . for the \n     Congress to appropriate budget authority for programs.\n\n  I will not go through all of the unauthorized programs that are in \nthis legislation. I only mention those that relate to the committee of \nwhich I am proud to serve and be the ranking member, formally the \nchairman, the Commerce Committee. I and Senator Hollings and members of \nmy committee take our responsibilities very seriously.\n  Now we have seen, despite what apparently is the mission or the \nobligation of the Appropriations Committee--and that is to not \nappropriate funds for programs that are not authorized--just in the \nCommerce Committee alone, we have for the 2002 Winter Olympics, $93.3 \nmillion; port security grants, $90 million; airport and airways trust \nfund, payment to air carriers, $50 million; DOT Office of the Inspector \nGeneral, $1.3 million; FAA operations, taken from the aviation trust \nfund, without authorization, $200 million.\n  Just as the appropriators are now taking away highway money \nappropriated under a formula passed by the full Senate and House and \nviolating TEA-21, we are now taking away from the aviation trust fund \nfor pet projects $200 million worth, to pet projects of the \nappropriators.\n  We have FAA facilities and equipment, $108.5 million; Federal Highway \nAdministration, proposed operations, $10 million was requested by the \nadministration, $100 million; capital grants to the National Railroad \nPassenger Corporation, $100 million; Federal Transit Administration \ncapital investment gains, $100 million; restoration of broadcasting \nfacilities, $8.25 million; National Institutes of Standards and \nTechnology, $30 million; Federal Trade Commission, $20 million; FAA \ngrants and aid for airports, $175 million; Woodrow Wilson Bridge \nproject, $29 million.\n  Why did they have to do that? Because they took the money out of the \nhighway funds in the Transportation appropriations bill, thereby \nshorting the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, so they had to add another $30 \nmillion to make up for the shortfall. Unfortunately, that was about \n$500 million that they took, and every other State in America--by the \nway, not represented by a member of the Appropriations Committee--had \nhighway funds taken away from them.\n  Provision relating to Alaska in the Transportation Equity Act for the \n21st century--it will be interesting to see the impact that has on the \nrest of America. We have the U.S. 61 Woodville widening project in \nMississippi, $300,000; Interstate Maintenance Program for the city of \nTrenton, $4 million; international sports competition, $15.8, million, \nemergency planning assistance for 2002 Winter Olympics.\n  I have to talk for a minute before I get into the major issue, and \nthat is the Boeing lease, and discuss the Olympics issue. It is now up \nto well over $1.5 billion that the taxpayers have paid.\n  I refer my colleagues to an article that was in Sports Illustrated \nmagazine, December 10, 2001. The title of it is, ``Snow Job.''\n  I will not read the whole article. It is very instructive to my \ncolleagues in particular and to our citizens about what has happened in \nthe Utah Olympics. The headline is ``Snow Job.''\n\n       Thanks to Utah politicians and the 2002 Olympics, a \n     blizzard of federal money--a stunning $1.5 billion--has \n     fallen on the state, enriching some already wealthy \n     businessessmen.\n       Is this a great country or what? A millionaire developer \n     wants a road built, the federal government supplies the cash \n     to construct it. A billionaire ski-resort owner covets a \n     choice piece of public land. No problem. The federal \n     government arranges for him to have it. Some millionaire \n     businessmen stand to profit nicely if the local highway \n     network is vastly improved. Of course. The federal government \n     provides the money.\n       How can you get yours, you ask? Easy. Just help your \n     hometown land the Olympics. Then, when no one's looking \n     persuade the federal government to pay for a good chunk of \n     the Games, including virtually any project to which the magic \n     word Olympics can be attached.\n       Total federal handouts. The $1.5 billion in taxpayer \n     dollars that Congress is pouring into Utah is 1\\1/2\\ times \n     the amount spent by lawmakers to support all seven Olympic \n     Games held in the U.S. since 1904--combined. In inflation-\n     adjusted dollars.\n       Enrichment of private interests. For the first time, \n     private enterprises--primarily ski resorts and real estate \n     developments--stand to derive significant long-term benefits \n     from Games-driven congressional giveaways.\n       Most government entities tapped for cash. With all that \n     skill, grace and precision of a hockey team on a power play, \n     Utah's five-member congressional delegation has used the \n     Olympics to drain money from an unprecedented number of \n     federal departments, agencies and offices--some three dozen \n     in all, from the Office of National Drug Control to the \n     Agriculture Department.\n       Most U.S. tax dollars per athlete. Federal spending for the \n     Salt Lake City City Games will average $625,000 for each of \n     the 2,400 athletes who will compete. (Not a penny of it will \n     go to the athletes.) That's a 996% increase from the $57,000 \n     average for the 1996 Olympics. It's a staggering 5,582% jump \n     from the $11,000 average for the 1984 Summer Games in Los \n     Angeles.\n       Parking lots are costing you $30 million. Some $12 million \n     of that is paying for two 80-acre fields to be graded and \n     paved for use as two temporary lots, then returned to meadows \n     after the flame is extinguished.\n       Housing for the media and new sewers are each costing you \n     $2 million.\n       Repaved highways, new roads and bridges, enlarged \n     interchanges and an electronic highway-information system are \n     costing you $500 million.\n       Buses, many brought in from others states, to carry \n     spectators to venues are costing you $25 million.\n       Fencing and other security measures at the Veterans \n     Administration Medical Center in northeast Salt Lake City--to \n     protect patients and staff from the Olympia hordes--are \n     costing you $3 million.\n       A light-rail transit system that will ferry Olympic \n     visitors around Salt Lake City is costing you $326 million.\n       Improvement at Salt Lake City-area airports are costing you \n     $16 million.\n\n  The list goes on and on:\n\n       Recycling and composting are costing you $1 million, and \n     public education programs for air, water and waste management \n     are costing you another $1 million.\n       A weather-forecasting system being set up for SLOC is \n     costing you $1 million. The money is going to the University \n     of Utah to enable its Meterorology Department to provide data \n     that will supplement forecasts provided to SLOC by the \n     National Weather Service.\n       New trees planted in Salt Lake City and other communities \n     ``impacted'', as the funding legislation put it, by the \n     Olympics are\n\n[[Page S13838]]\n\n     costing you $500,000. Said Utah Senator Robert Bennett, who \n     arranged for the money. ``We do the Olympics because it gets \n     us together doing thinks like planting trees.''\n\n  ``We do the Olympics because it gets us together, doing things like \nplanting trees.''\n  Wow.\n  I want to repeat, I am all for whatever expenditure for security for \nthe Salt Lake City Olympics. A good part of this $1.5 billion--and \nthere is more in this appropriations bill--has nothing to do with \nsecurity. It has to do with roadbuilding. It has to do with land swaps, \nworthless land for valuable land. It has to do with wealthy developers; \nit has to do with the enrichment of billionaires; and it really is \nquite a story. I hope every American will read that story that is in \nSports Illustrated dated December 10 entitled ``Snow Job''--aptly \nentitled ``Snow Job.''\n  As I pointed out before, our nation is at war, a war that has united \nAmericans behind a common goal--to find the enemies who terrorized the \nUnited States on September 11 and bring them to justice. In pursuit of \nthis goal, our service men and women are serving long hours, under \nextremely difficult conditions, far away from their families. Many \nother Americans also have been affected by this war and its economic \nimpact, whether they have lost their jobs, their homes, or have had to \ndrastically cut expenses this holiday season. The weapons we have given \nthem, for all their impressive effects, are, in many cases, neither in \nquantity nor quality, the best that our government can provide.\n  For instance, stockpiles of the precision guided munitions that we \nhave relied on so heavily to bring air power to bear so effectively on \ndifficult, often moving targets, with the least collateral damage \npossible, are dangerously depleted after only 10 weeks of war in \nAfghanistan. This is just one area of critical importance to our \nsuccess in this war that underscores just how carefully we should be \nallocating scarce resources to our national defense.\n  Yet, despite the realities of war, and the responsibilities they \nimpose on Congress as much the President, the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee has not seen fit to change in any degree its usual blatant \nuse of defense dollars for projects that may or may not serve some \nworthy purpose, but that certainly impair our national defense by \ndepriving legitimate defense needs of adequate funding.\n  Even in the middle of a war, a war of monumental consequences and \nwith no end in sight, the Appropriations Committee, Mr. President, \nstill is intent on using the Department of Defense as an agency for \ndispensing corporate welfare. It is a terrible shame that in a time of \nmaximum emergency, the U.S. Senate would persist in spending money \nrequested and authorized only for our Armed Forces to satisfy the needs \nor the desires of interests that are unrelated to defense needs.\n  The Investor's Business Daily, on December 18, 2001, had this to say \nin an article titled At the Trough: Welfare Checks to Big Business Make \nNo Sense:\n\n       Among the least justified outlays is corporate welfare. \n     Budget analyst Stephen Slivinski estimates that business \n     subsidies will run $87 billion this year, up a third since \n     1997, Although President Bush proposed $12 billion in cuts to \n     corporate welfare this year, Congress has proved resistant. \n     Indeed, many post-September 11 bailouts have gone to big \n     business. Boeing is one of the biggest beneficiaries. \n     Representative Norm Dicks, Democrat from Washington, is \n     pushing a substantial increase in research and development \n     support for Boeing and other defense contractors, the \n     purchase of several retrofitted Boeing 767s and the leasing \n     of as many as 100 767s for purposes ranging from surveillance \n     to refueling. Boeing has been hurt by the storm that hit \n     airlines, since many companies have slashed orders. Yet China \n     recently agreed to buy 30 of the company's planes, and \n     Boeing's problems predate the September 11 attack. It is one \n     thing to compensate the airlines for forcibly shutting them \n     down; it is quite another to toss money at big companies \n     caught in a down demand cycle. Boeing, along with many other \n     major exporters, enjoys its own federal lending facility, the \n     Export-Import Bank. ExIm uses cheap loans, loan guarantees \n     and loan insurance to subsidize purchases of U.S. products. \n     The bulk of the money goes to big business that sell \n     airplanes, machinery, nuclear power plants and the like. Last \n     year alone, Boeing benefitted form $3.3 billion in credit \n     subsidies. While corporate America gets the profits, \n     taxpayers get the losses. . . .\n\n  As I mentioned last week when the Senate version of the Defense \nAppropriations bill was being debated--and now carried through the \nConference Committee--is a sweet deal for the Boeing Company that I'm \nsure is the envy of corporate lobbyists from one end of K Street to the \nother. Attached is a legislative provision to the Fiscal Year 2002 \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations bill that would require the Air \nforce to lease one hundred 767 aircraft for use as tankers for $26 \nmillion apiece each year for the next 10 years. Moreover, in Conference \nCommittee the appropriators added four 737 aircraft for executive \ntravel--mostly benefitting Members of Congress. We have been told that \nthese aircraft will be assigned to the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Air \nForce Base.\n  Since the 10-year leases have yet to be signed, the cost of the \nplanes cannot be calculated, but it costs roughly $85 million to buy \none 737, and a lease costs significantly more over the long term.\n  The cost to taxpayers?\n  $2.6 billion per year for the aircraft plus $1.2 billion in military \nconstruction funds to modify KC-135 hangars to accommodate their larger \nreplacements, with a total price tag of more than $30 billion over 10 \nyears when the costs of the 737 leases are also included. This leasing \nplan is five times more expensive I repeat, five times more expensive \nto the taxpayer than an outright purchase, and it represents 30 percent \nof the Air Force's annual cost of its top 60 priorities. But the most \namazing fact is that this program is not actually among the Air Force's \ntop 60 priorities--it was not among their top 60 priorities--nor do new \ntankers appear in the 6-year defense procurement plan for the Service!\n  That's right, when the Air Force told Congress in clear terms what \nits top priorities were tankers and medical lift capability aircraft \nweren't included as critical programs. In fact, within its top 30 \nprograms, the Air Force has asked for several essential items that \nwould directly support our current war effort: wartime munitions, jet \nfighter engine replacement parts, combat support vehicles, bomber and \nfighter upgrades and self protection equipment, and combat search and \nrescue helicopters for downed pilots.\n  Let me say that again, within its top 30 programs, the Air Force has \nasked for several essential items that would directly support our \ncurrent war effort: wartime munitions, jet fighter engine replacement \nparts, combat support vehicles, bomber and fighter upgrades and self \nprotection equipment, and combat search and rescue helicopters for \ndowned pilots.\n  This leasing program also will require $1.2 billion in military \nconstruction funding to build new hangars, since existing hangars are \ntoo small for the new 767 aircraft. The taxpayers also will be on the \nhook for another $30 million per aircraft on the front end to convert \nthese aircraft from commercial configurations to military; and at the \nend of the lease, the taxpayers will have to foot the bill for $30 \nmillion more, to convert the aircraft back--pushing the total cost of \nthe Boeing sweetheart deal to $30 billion over the ten-year lease. Mr. \nPresident, that is waste that borders on gross negligence.\n  I wrote a letter to the Director of OMB. Here is the answer I \nreceived:\n\n       Dear Senator McCain:\n       Thank you for your inquiry regarding the costs associated \n     with the conversion of 767 aircraft tankers. According to the \n     Air Force, the total cost for a program to lease 100 tankers \n     is approximately $26 billion.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Mr. Mitchell Daniels, \nDirector of OMB, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                Washington, DC, December 18, 2001.\n     The Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for your inquiry regarding \n     the costs associated with the conversion of 767 aircraft to \n     tankers. According to the Air Force, the total cost for a \n     program to lease 100 tankers is approximately $26 billion. I \n     have attached a summary of assumptions and costs they have \n     identified. Please let me know if you require any additional \n     information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr.,\n                                                         Director.\n\n\n[[Page S13839]]\n\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to read a letter that I received \nrecently. This letter is from the Americans for Tax Reform, Council for \nCitizens Against Government Waste, Congressional Accountability \nProject, Ronnie Dugger, Ralph Nader, National Taxpayers Union, Project \non Government Oversight, Public Citizen, and Taxpayers for Common \nSense.\n  All of these organizations are on the right and the left of the \npolitical spectrum.\n  They wrote the following letter:\n\n                                                December 19, 2001.\n       Dear Senator: Even as veteran observers of the \n     Congressional appropriations process, we are shocked, and \n     outraged, by the provision in the Defense Appropriations bill \n     that would have the Air Force lease Boeing 767s at a price \n     dramatically higher than the cost of direct purchase. We are \n     writing to urge you to take to the floor to speak and vote \n     against this specific siphoning of taxpayer money to the \n     Boeing company.\n       Leave aside the serious questions about whether the Air \n     Force wants or needs the 767s, and simply consider the \n     economics of this sugar-coated deal:\n       Under the Boeing lease provision, the Air Force will lease \n     100 Boeing 767s for use as tankers, at a pricetag of $20 \n     million per plane per year, over a 10-year period. This $20 \n     billion expenditure is far higher than the cost of direct \n     purchase. The government will accrue extra expenses because \n     it will be obligated not only to convert the commercial \n     aircraft to military configurations; when the 10-year lease \n     is over, it will be required to convert them back to \n     commercial format, at an estimated cost of $30 million \n     apiece. Senator John McCain says the cost of the lease plan \n     is five times higher than an outright purchase would be. \n     Senator Phil Gramm says, ``I do not think, in the 22 years I \n     have been here, I have ever seen anything to equal this.''\n\n  ``I don't think, in the 22 years I have been here, I have ever seen \nanything to equal this.''\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       There is no conceivable rationale for such a waste of \n     taxpayer resources. If some in Congress believe Boeing needs \n     to be subsidized, then they should propose direct subsidies \n     to the company, and let Congress fully debate and vote on the \n     issue before the American people, following comprehensive \n     public hearings on the proposal.\n       This is not a partisan issue. It is a basic test of whether \n     Congress views itself as fundamentally accountable to the \n     public interest, both procedurally and substantively.\n       There will obviously be a Defense Appropriations bill \n     passed for the coming fiscal year. But it must not be one \n     that includes such a gross exhibition of corporate welfare. \n     We urge you to speak and vote against the bill; and to force \n     consideration of a revised bill, stripped of this \n     grotesquery.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Ralph Nader,\n\n                                                  Grover Norquist,\n                              President, Americans for Tax Reform.\n\n  I have never seen Ralph Nader and Grover Norquist on the same letter \nin all the years I have been in this town.\n  The letter is also signed by the following:\n\n     Thomas A. Schatz,\n       President, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste.\n\n     Gary Ruskin,\n       Director, Congressional Accountability Project.\n\n     Ronnie Dugger,\n     Alliance for Democracy (organization listed for \n     identification only).\n\n     Pete Sepp,\n       Vice President for Communications, National Taxpayers \n     Union.\n\n     Danielle Brian,\n       Executive Director, Project on Government Oversight.\n\n     Joan Claybrook,\n       President, Public Citizen.\n\n     Joe Theissen,\n       Executive Director, Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n\n  Mr. President, I guess the obvious question that would then be asked \nis, How did this happen? On its face it is incredible.\n  Let me try to illuminate my colleagues on an article of December 12 \nin the New York Times entitled ``Boeing's War Footing; Lobbyists Are \nIts Army, Washington Its Battlefield.''\n  I will not read the entire article.\n  It says:\n\n       Staggered by the loss of the largest military contract in \n     history and the collapse of the commercial airline market, \n     Boeing has sharply intensified its efforts in Congress and \n     the Pentagon to win an array of other big-ticket military \n     contracts.\n       Mobilizing an armada of well-connected lobbyists, \n     sympathetic lawmakers and Air Force generals, the company \n     argues that by financing its contracts Congress would reduce \n     the need for thousands of layoffs and help keep Boeing, the \n     second-largest military contractor, healthy in a time of war:\n\n  It talks about losing the joint strike fighter to Lockheed Martin.\n\n       Those events sent Boeing reeling. But like battle-tested \n     generals on the retreat, Boeing executives swiftly moved to \n     recover their losses in a time-tested Washington way: wooing \n     Congress and the Pentagon to support other contracts.\n       Few companies can rival Boeing influence in the capital. \n     Its Washington office, headed by Rudy F. de Leon, the deputy \n     secretary of defense in the final year of the Clinton \n     administration, employs 34 in-house and more than 50 outside \n     lobbyists.\n       One of the Boeing lobbyists' first moves after Sept. 11 was \n     to prod the Air Force to reconsider the 767 lease deal, which \n     had stalled months before. Though the Air Force has said it \n     plans to replace its 40-year-old KC-135 tankers in the next \n     decade or two, it has preferred to spend its money on elite \n     fighter jets like the F-22.\n       But the war in Afghanistan has kept dozens of KC-135's in \n     the air almost constantly, putting pressure on the Air Force \n     to accelerate its replacement program. James Roche, the \n     secretary of the Air Force, and Gen. John P. Jumper, the Air \n     Force chief of staff, signed into the lease-purchase idea \n     because it would spread the cost out into the future, \n     Pentagon documents show.\n       Boeing next had to break down resistance to lease \n     arrangements in Congress. According to one internal Pentagon \n     study, a lease-purchase deal for 100 767's would cost 15 \n     percent more than simply buying the planes. Moreover, federal \n     rules discourage such deals by requiring that most of the \n     entire contract cost be paid in the first year. To get around \n     that, Boeing proposed having the Air Force simply lease the \n     aircraft without a purchase option. But that would not cover \n     the cost of adapting them for refueling and surveillance, or \n     of ultimately buying them, as the Air Force is expected to \n     do.\n       The company recruited the Congressional delegations from \n     Washington and Missouri--the two states where it assembles \n     most of its aircraft--to support the plan. And in the Senate, \n     it found a powerful ally in Ted Stevens of Alaska, the \n     ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee, who is a \n     fan of lease-purchase deals for the military.\n       Boeing lobbyists with Congressional experience--including \n     Mr. de Leon, who also was a staff director for the House \n     Armed Services Committee, and Denny Miller, a former chief of \n     staff to the late Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington--\n     help negotiate the lease language.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Staggered by the loss of the largest military contract in \n     history and the collapse of the commercial airline market, \n     Boeing has sharply intensified its efforts in Congress and \n     the Pentagon to win an array of other big-ticket military \n     contracts.\n       Mobilizing an armada of well-connected lobbyists, \n     sympathetic lawmakers and Air Force generals, the company \n     argues that by financing its contracts Congress would reduce \n     the need for thousands of layoffs and help keep Boeing, the \n     second-largest military contractor, healthy in a time of war. \n     ``You've got the nation's leading exporter, and one of its \n     leading military contractors, who has been hit hard,'' said \n     Representative Norm Dicks, a Washington State Democrat who \n     has led the charge for Boeing on Capitol Hill. ``We can \n     really help them.''\n       The push underscores a broader trend for Boeing, company \n     officials and analysts say. The company, with most of its \n     production in the Seattle area, has suffered a sharp downturn \n     in commercial aircraft business, which last year generated \n     two-thirds of its $51.3 billion in sales. Boeing is expected \n     to announce this week that production of its 717 commercial \n     airliners will be cut by half, to as little as one plane a \n     month from two, company executives said. As recently as a \n     month ago, analysis predicted that the company would end all \n     717 production, in part because the Sept. 11 attacks have \n     slowed demand for commercial jets.\n       As a result, Boeing is looking more than ever to its \n     military and space divisions to bolster sagging revenue.\n       Last week, it won a big lobbying battle when the Senate \n     approved a sharply contested plan for Boeing to lease to the \n     Air Force 100 new 767 wide-body jets for use as refueling \n     tankers and reconnaissance planes. The proposal next goes \n     before a House-Senate conference committee.\n       At an estimated cost of more than $20 billion over 10 \n     years, that plan has been attacked as a costly corporate \n     bailout by critics led by Senator John McCain, a Republican \n     from Arizona. But supporters say that it would not only \n     significantly offset Boeing's loss of orders from ailing \n     commercial airlines but also help the Pentagon by \n     accelerating the replacement of aging midair refueling \n     tankers and reconnaissance aircraft that both have been worn \n     down by heavy use in the war in Afghanistan.\n       ``Near term, it's a very nice financial salve to an \n     immediate wound,'' said Howard Rubel,\n\n[[Page S13840]]\n\n     a military industry analysis at Goldman Sachs.\n       The 767 plan is just one of several major Pentagon programs \n     that Boeing is prodding Congress to sustain, expand or \n     accelerate. The company is the lead contractor on more than a \n     dozen major contracts accounting for well over $10 billion in \n     the 2002 Pentagon budget alone. Those include the F/A-18 \n     fighter jet for the Navy, the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft \n     for the Marine Corps, the AH-64 Apache Longbow helicopter for \n     the Army and the airborne laser for the Pentagon's Ballistic \n     Missile Defense Organization.\n       In addition, Boeing has been trying for years to become the \n     dominant player in an array of new businesses, including \n     unpiloted aircraft, battlefield and cockpit communications, \n     surveillance technology and precision-guided numitions. The \n     war on terrorism has only underscored the Pentagon's need for \n     more of those systems, Boeing and its allies assert.\n       ``What we're about to see was the reason for the merger \n     with McDonnell Douglas in the first place,'' said Gerald E. \n     Daniels, president of Boeing's military aircraft and missile \n     systems division. ``With the cyclical nature of the \n     commercial business, building strong military and space units \n     serves to tamp down those gigantic swings.''\n       In 1999, two years after the merger with McDonnell Douglas, \n     Boeing delivered 620 commercial aircraft, for revenue of \n     $38.5 billion. By next year, analysts estimate, deliveries \n     are expected to tally only 367, with revenue down to $26 \n     billion.\n       The collapse in the commercial market resulted, of course, \n     from the suicide hijacking attacks of Sept. 11. Air travel \n     plummeted and airlines canceled dozens of jet orders, \n     prompting Boeing to announce plans to lay off 30,00 \n     workers over the next two years.\n       Just when it seemed Boeing's fortunes could not be worse, \n     in October the Pentagon awarded a $200 billion contract for \n     the Joint Strike Fighter to Boeing's larger rival, Lockheed \n     Martin. The stealthy jet is expected to become the mainstay \n     fighter for the Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps in the next \n     two decades, raising doubts about Boeing's future in the \n     tactical fighter business.\n       Those events sent Boeing reeling. But like battle-tested \n     generals on the retreat, Boeing executives swiftly moved to \n     recover their losses in a time-tested Washington way: wooing \n     Congress and the Pentagon to support other contracts.\n       Few companies can rival Boeing's influence in the capital. \n     Its Washington office, headed by Rudy F. de Leon, the deputy \n     secretary of defense in the final year of the Clinton \n     administration, employs 34 in-house and more than 50 outside \n     lobbyists.\n       One of the Boeing lobbyists' first moves after Sept. 11 was \n     to prod the Air Force to reconsider the 767 lease deal, which \n     had stalled months before. Though the Air Force has said it \n     plans to replace its 40-year-old KC-135 tankers in the next \n     decade or two, it has preferred to spend its money on elite \n     fighter jets like the F-22.\n       But the war in Afghanistan has kept dozens of KC-135's in \n     the air almost constantly, putting pressure on the Air Force \n     to accelerate its replacement program. James Roche, the \n     secretary of the Air Force, and Gen. John P. Jumper, the Air \n     Force chief of staff, signed onto the lease-purchase idea \n     because it would spread the cost out into the future, \n     Pentagon documents show.\n       Boeing next had to break down resistance to lease \n     arrangements in Congress. According to one internal Pentagon \n     study, a lease-purchase deal for 100 767's would cost 15 \n     percent more than simply buying the planes. Moreover, federal \n     rules discourage such deals by requiring that most of the \n     entire contract cost be paid in the first year. To get around \n     that, Boeing proposed having the Air Force simply lease the \n     aircraft without a purchase option. But that would not cover \n     the cost of adapting them for refueling and surveillance, or \n     of ultimately buying them, as the Air Force is expected to \n     do.\n       The company recruited the Congressional delegations from \n     Washington and Missouri--the two states where it assembles \n     most of its aircraft--to support the plan. And in the Senate, \n     it found a powerful ally in Ed Stevens of Alaska the ranking \n     Republican on the Appropriations Committee, who is a fan of \n     lease-purchase deals for the military.\n       Boeing lobbyists with Congressional experience--including \n     Mr. de Leon, who also was a staff director for the House \n     Armed Services Committee, and Denny Miller, a former chief of \n     staff to the late Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington--\n     helped negotiate the lease language.\n       With Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, the \n     Boeing president, Philip A. Condit, has repeatedly met with \n     senior lawmakers like Daniel Inouye, the chairman of the \n     Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the military, and the \n     Senate majority leader, Thomas Dashle. Last week, Mr. Condit \n     returned to discuss the deal with several leading skeptics in \n     the House, including the speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, and \n     Representative Jerry Lewis of California, the influential \n     chairman of the House subcommittee on defense appropriations.\n       A spokesman for Mr. Lewis, Jim Specht, said the Congressman \n     remained undecided on the lease deal, but added: ``There is \n     the concern that because of the Joint Strike Fighter \n     contract, something has to be done to make sure we support \n     all of our industrial base.''\n       All the work, however, did not win over Senator McCain, who \n     last week accused Boeing of ``playing victim, blaming its own \n     job cuts, many of which occurred before Sept. 11, on the \n     tragedy itself.''\n       Boeing seems to have won Congressional support for \n     accelerating purchases of C-17's, the all-purpose cargo \n     planes it builds in Long Beach, Calif., at a former McDonnell \n     Douglas plant. Last spring, Boeing formally asked that the \n     Pentagon buy 60 more planes at a cost of about $150 million \n     each. Without that increase, the Long Beach production line \n     is scheduled to close later this decade.\n       Boeing has also tried to wiggle its way into the Strike \n     Fighter deal. The company has quietly hinted that it could \n     urge Congress to buy more unmanned aircraft or its F/A-18 to \n     take the place of Navy and Air Force versions of the Joint \n     Strike Fighter if Lockheed did not agree to give it a \n     substantial piece of the work.\n       It has urged Senator Christopher S. Bond, a Missouri \n     Republican, to continue promoting legislation requiring \n     Lockheed to split the Strike Fighter work with Boeing. \n     Senator Bond withdrew his bill for lack of support, but on \n     Friday he won Senate funds for a study into whether the \n     Pentagon should have two manufacturers of tactical fighter \n     aircraft.\n       ``I want to make sure we maintain that production line in \n     St. Louis, because it's in the national interest,'' Mr. Bond \n     said in an interview.\n       Lockheed, however, notes that it already has two major \n     partners, the British military contractor BAE Systems and \n     Northrop Grumman. ``There is only so much work to go \n     around,'' said Charles Thomas Burbage, director of the \n     fighter project for Lockheed.\n       Boeing, with the help of Senator Bond and Representative \n     Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, who comes \n     from the St. Louis area, is also pushing the Navy to replace \n     its aging EA6-B Prowler radar-jamming planes with an \n     electronic-warfare version of the F-18, a move that could \n     help keep Boeing's St. Louis plant open longer.\n       Unmanned aircraft are another focus of Boeing lobbying. \n     Last month, Boeing organized a new division headed by a \n     senior executive from its Strike Fighter program, Mike Heinz, \n     to help it expand into a market the company estimates will \n     top $1 billion a year.\n       Boeing is already building a prototype unmanned fighter for \n     the Air Force, a project that many industry officials say is \n     Boeing's to lose. At a recent meeting of industry executives, \n     Darleen A. Druyun, the principal deputy assistant secretary \n     of the Air Force for acquisition and management, spoke \n     glowingly about the future of unmanned aerial vehicles.\n       ``I see a very bright future for Boeing when it comes to \n     aviation,'' she said, ``particularly in the areas of UAV's \n     and in sales of C-17's.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, when the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill was on the floor, Senator Gramm of Texas, I, and \nothers decided that we would do what we could to oppose this being \nincluded in the legislation.\n  We were prepared to engage in extended debate on this and many of the \nother provisions of the Defense appropriations bill. After \nconversations with Senator Gramm and Senator Stevens, I agreed to an \namendment on my behalf along with Senator Gramm that would give the \nPresident the authority not to spend the money if we found other more \ncompelling needs for national defense, which seems like a reasonable \nsolution to the dilemma in which we found ourselves.\n  (Mr. CLELAND assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will admit to a certain degree of naivety. I believed \nthat provision would be held in conference. Obviously, I was incredibly \nnaive. That provision, I am told, was the first to go.\n  So now we have a situation--even though the Air Force in its top 60 \npriorities did not request additional tankers, but did have plans in \nthe next 10 years or so to purchase aircraft with refueling \ncapability--we now have a provision in law, which I obviously will not \nbe able to reverse, without competition.\n  Maybe Airbus could have provided some tankers. Maybe some airlines \nwith excess aircraft could have provided some tankers. But no \ncompetition is allowed. It directs that it be 767s.\n  Now, of course, to sweeten the pot, we have four 737s which will go \nout to Andrews Air Force Base and be part of the aircraft that are used \nfor ferrying VIPs and Members of Congress around the world.\n  I think you could make an argument that Boeing needs to be bailed \nout, that they are in trouble. They are a major manufacturing company. \nThey lost out on a new fighter aircraft competition. There may be some \nargument to that. I might even consider cutting them a check for some \nmoney. We cut checks for a lot of other interests around here.\n  But there was never a hearing in the Armed Services Committee--never \na\n\n[[Page S13841]]\n\nhearing in the Armed Services Committee--of a $30 billion purchase \nhere. It was never considered by the Armed Services Committee--not \nonce. Never did it come up. No. No, Mr. President. Again, it was stuck \nin an appropriations bill, stuck into an appropriations bill without a \nsingle hearing. Not even in the Appropriations Committee did they have \na hearing on this.\n\n  What I am saying is, this system has run amok. This system has run \namok. We are now in the situation where anyone who is not on the \nAppropriations Committee becomes irrelevant, particularly at the end of \nthe year.\n  Where is the relevancy of the Commerce Committee when $310 million in \nappropriations is added on a Defense appropriations bill? Where is the \nrelevancy when billions of dollars on a Defense appropriations bill are \nput in that have nothing to do with defense?\n  Where is the relevancy of the authorizing committees when billions \nand billions and billions of dollars are added without a hearing, \nwithout consideration, and without authorization?\n  I suggest that the Appropriations Committee change their Web site, \nthe one I quoted earlier, that says that only authorized appropriations \nwill be made. It says:\n\n       Authorization laws have two basic purposes. They establish, \n     continue, or modify federal programs, and they are a \n     prerequisite under House and Senate rules . . . for the \n     Congress to appropriate budget authority for programs.\n\n  I strongly recommend that the Appropriations Committee remove that \nfrom or at least add: However, in practice, that is not the case.\n  We now have disabled veterans who are not receiving the money that \nthey need. It is an effort that I and the Presiding Officer have \nengaged in for several years now. They do not have a very big lobby \naround here. They do not have Rudy de Leon and Denny Miller, and a lot \nof high-priced lobbyists. So veterans who have disabilities are being \ndeprived money they should rightly have, that any other person stricken \nwith a similar disability, under any other circumstance, would receive.\n  We still have men and women in the military living in barracks that \nwere built during World War II and the Korean war.\n  We still have a situation, at least up until the surge of patriotism \nas of September 11, where there has been enormous difficulty in \nmaintaining our noncommissioned officers and our midlevel career \nofficers.\n  A recent study by the U.S. Army showed the greatest exodus of Army \ncaptains in the history of the U.S. Army, which is quite interesting, \nto say the least.\n  We will not take care of these veterans, but we will put about $3 \nbillion out of the Commerce Committee--under the Commerce Committee \njurisdiction--into this Department of Defense appropriations bill. We \nwill take care of the special interests. We will take care of the big \ncampaign contributors.\n  I am sure Boeing will be extremely generous at the next fundraisers \nthat both the Republican and Democrat Parties have. They have already \nbeen incredibly generous. And, by the way, they are very schizophrenic \nin their political outlook because they give pretty much the same \namount of money to both parties, which shows how ideologically driven \nthey are.\n  And we will get 767s. I am sure they are nice airplanes. But who is \ngoing to pay? Who is going to pay for it? The average taxpayer, because \nthe cost to the taxpayer of this little backdoor, backroom maneuver is \nbillions of dollars more than it should have been.\n  I remind you, the average lifespan of a tanker is around 35 to 40 \nyears. That is the average lifespan because they are relatively simple \nairplanes. They are really flying gas stations. So they last a long \ntime.\n\n  So what are we going to do? Pay 90 percent of the cost of the \nairplane and, after 10 years, pay to have it de-engineered as a tanker \nand give it back to Boeing, at a minimum of one-third of the life of \nthe tanker. With a straight face, how can we possibly do this?\n  I had a lot of other concerns about the porkbarreling, but I want to \nsay this. One of two things is going to happen around here in the \nSenate: Either the Appropriations Committee controls the entire agenda \nand does the things that we continue to see in ever increasing \nnumbers--and I have been tracking it for many years; every year the \nAppropriations Committee adds more and more projects that are not \nauthorized every year; and this year it is a big jump--or we are going \nto stop it; or we are going to have a change in the rules that comports \nwith the Web site of the Appropriations Committee; that is, that no \nappropriation will be made that is unauthorized and no appropriation \nwill exceed the authorized level either in an appropriations bill or in \na conference report.\n  It is a pretty simple rule. And it would be subject to a point of \norder.\n  Now, there are times where appropriations have to be made, and that \nis where the point of order would come in. But unless we change the \nrules the way this body goes--I suggest to my colleagues that they \nunderstand we can have nice hearings.\n  We have some very interesting hearings in the Commerce Committee on a \nbroad variety of subjects. It is great. It is the most intellectually \nstimulating experience I have ever had in my service on the Commerce \nCommittee and on the Armed Services Committee, of which I have been a \nmember since 1987.\n  I find it extremely enjoyable. The discussions are wonderful. I learn \nmore about how our military is conducting their operations, how we are \nplanning for the future. But do not think, as members of the \nauthorizing committee, you will have the slightest effect on what is \ndone in this body.\n  I am not going to take too much longer, but I will just make a \nreference. In 1997--since the Senator from Hawaii is here--there was a \nproposal put in an appropriations bill to build two ships in \nMississippi. And certain waivers were made in those requirements. In \nreturn for that, those ships would operate from the State of Hawaii. \nAbout $1 billion worth of taxpayers' money was on the line.\n  I said, this is crazy. You can't do this. This is outrageous. Do you \nknow what happened a few weeks ago? The company went bankrupt. There \nare two hulls sitting in the State of Mississippi. The taxpayers are \nalready on the hook for $300-some million, and it will probably rise to \n$1 billion.\n  If that proposal had gone through the Commerce Committee, it never \nwould have seen the light of day because, on its face, it was crazy. To \ngive a 30-year or 20-year, or whatever it is, exclusivity to a cruise \nline in return for them being built with taxpayers' dollars, there was \nno way it was going to succeed. And I said so at the time.\n  So now the taxpayers are on the hook for $1 billion.\n  We are talking about real money. What is going on here? It is because \nwe are violating the process and the rules for the way we should \noperate. Perhaps this Boeing deal would have gotten some consideration \nin a very different fashion. Probably what would have resulted is that \nwe would have authorized the purchase of three or four 767s and then in \nthe following year we would have authorized some more, depending on \nwhat the administration wanted. But now we are putting in 100 airplanes \nthat weren't in the top 60 requirements the Air Force told the Congress \nand the American people they needed. After 10 years, one-third to one-\nfourth of their lifespan, we give them back. How does anybody justify \nthis kind of procedure?\n  I suggest that the Senate look at itself. I can't speak for the \nHouse. The Senate ought to look at itself. What are we doing? What do \nwe do here? I think I may be one of four or five Senators who has \nexamined this bill. I may be one of four or five who has looked at this \nbill because I have about 10 staffers leafing through it trying to \nfigure out what is in it. Everybody certainly wants to go home. I \nunderstand that. That is why I will not talk too much longer.\n  I said on the floor of the Senate that the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill would be the last bill we considered because it \nwould have the most pork in it because everybody would want to go home \nand nobody would want to look at it. This is a bill that we received \nsometime this afternoon or late morning, this is the legislation, $343 \nbillion. What is it full of? Does anybody know? I have had about 10 \nstaffers trying to leaf through it and find out. We have already found \nbillions of dollars of unauthorized projects.\n\n[[Page S13842]]\n\n  This kind of behavior cannot go on. It can't go on. You will lose the \nconfidence of the American people. You will lose their faith that you \nare representing them and their tax dollars and their priorities.\n  This is called war profiteering: On the 21st of December, the last \nbill, the last train loaded up, nobody has read it, and we vote for it. \nWe all vote for it because, of course, we are in a war. We can't not do \nthat. I won't. But the fact is, we better change the way we are doing \nbusiness, and we ought to look at ourselves and see if we are proper \nstewards of the taxpayers' dollars.\n  More importantly, are we proper stewards of our Nation's defense? Are \nwe placing our national priorities for our military and the men and \nwomen in the military and their needs first?\n  This is going to be a long war on terrorism. We can't afford to put \nall this stuff in a Defense appropriations bill that has nothing to do \nwith defense. We can't load it up with all this pork for the Salt Lake \nCity Olympics. We can't give sweetheart deals to cruise lines.\n  Early next year when we come back, I will propose a change in the \nrules of the Senate. I hope it will be considered by many of my \ncolleagues. I know it probably won't be considered by those on the \nAppropriations Committee because now they have all the power. But I \nbelieve that this is a body of equals, of 100 equal Senators. Some are \nelected to our majority; some are chairmen and ranking members of \ncommittees and, obviously, have more power than others. But we are \nequals when it comes time to do what we should be able to do with the \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  The power is now in the hands of the Appropriations Committee and \nthose members of the Appropriations Committees. You read these things. \nFirst you laugh, and then you cry. It is really unbelievable. I laughed \nwhen I saw $75,000 for the Reindeer Herders' Association. I cried when \nI saw $6 million for the airport in Juneau. We need to upgrade airports \nall over America.\n\n  I was very disturbed when I saw that for the byways program, last \nyear 40 States got money for the Scenic Byways Program; this year it is \n11. I was very disturbed when I saw the Transportation Appropriations \nCommittee took $453 million out of the formula for highway fund \ndistribution to the States and distributed it among the States of the \nappropriators. How do you justify that?\n  We debated for a week in the Senate on that formula. I didn't like \nthe result because Arizona receives less money from Washington in our \ntaxpayers' dollars than we send, but I accepted the verdict of the \nentire 100 Senators. Now hundreds of millions of dollars that should be \nfairly distributed under that formula were taken by the Transportation \nappropriators without a debate, without a hearing, and distributed to \nthe States of the appropriators.\n  That kind of thing cannot continue. It cannot continue or it renders \nmeaningless not only the nonappropriators but the debate we had. Why \ndid we waste a week debating the TEA-21 formula. Because we thought it \nwas important. We thought that was the way the money would be \ndistributed. Then the Appropriations Committee takes that money and \nredistributes it, coincidentally, to the States of the members of the \nAppropriations Committee. We can't continue doing this.\n  I know the hour is late. I apologize to my colleagues if I have \ninconvenienced them. But I warned them weeks ago that the last train \nwould be the Defense appropriations bill, and everybody would want to \nvote for it and leave.\n  I just hope that a document this big, with this much money, $343 \nbillion in taxpayers' money, that before we vote on something such as \nthis again, at least let's look at it and see what it contains.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to set the \nrecord straight with respect to a good deal of misinformation which has \nbeen circulating about Federal support for the 2002 Winter Olympic \nGames in Salt Lake City, Utah. In fact, earlier today, one of our \ncolleagues took the floor to condemn the funding Congress has provided \nfor the 2002 Olympics. I listened carefully to his remarks. I have to \nsay that if his understanding of the situation were true, I could \nunderstand how he feels. Unfortunately, however, I believe he and \nothers have relied on incomplete and distorted press accounts which \nare, simply, a disservice to the Olympic spirit that a majority of \nAmericans have raced to embrace. Most of these distortions seem to have \noriginated with an article in the December 10, 2001 edition of Sports \nIllustrated. The article, ironically entitled ``Snow Job,'' is in fact \na snow job itself.\n  The thrust of the criticisms to which I refer appears to be an \nincorrect assumption that, in seeking support for the Olympic Games, \nthe State of Utah is somehow attempting to enrich itself unfairly at \nthe expense of American taxpayers. Nonsense. Poppycock. Malarky. What \nthose who race to criticize our Olympic games fail to consider is that \nthese are the world's Olympic Games, a time-honored tradition which our \nnation is so fortunate to be hosting in February. I find these slams \nagainst the Olympic Games particularly discouraging given the fact that \ntomorrow the Olympic torch will arrive on Capitol Hill. And I cannot \nfail to note that it was this very body, only days ago, that \nunanimously authorized the torch to be carried to our Capitol, and some \nare here today questioning our support for that effort.\n  Enthusiasm has been building across the country as the torch makes \nits way from Athens to Atlanta, and now from Atlanta to Washington to \nSalt Lake. Hundreds of thousands of spectators have been lining the \nstreets, cheering on the torch-bearers as they carry the Olympic flame \nthroughout the country. We have all been so heartened to see citizens \nfrom all walks of life passing the torch, honoring everyday heroes. The \nmessage of the Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Torch Relay is ``Light the Fire \nWithin.'' The flame symbolizes the spirit and passion of individuals \nwho inspire others. The young people who make great sacrifices to \nbecome Olympic champions are certainly heroes. The flame celebrates not \nonly the Olympians, but people of all walks of life who have inspired \nothers.\n  While the Torch Relay is only a part of the Olympics, it is symbolic \nof the fire and passion for excellence that the games are all about. it \nis ironic that a publication which has staked its reputation on \nAmerica's passion for athleticism now just weeks before the opening \nceremony seeks to diminish the glory of the games by sensationalizing \nan issue that has been scrutinized and laid to rest months ago. It is \nalso personally discouraging to me that one of our colleagues would \nseize this one article, one story among a vast sea of positive \njournalism on the Olympics, as a populist club in a years-long crusade \nto curb unwise and unneeded Federal spending. Good motive. Wrong \ntarget.\n  Those of our colleagues who are interested in a fair and balanced \nanalysis of Olympic spending should consult the November, 2001 General \nAccounting Office, GAO, report, ``Olympic Games Costs to Plan and Stage \nthe Games in the United States.'' And if you have any problem getting a \ncopy of the report, let me know and I'll send it right over. The GAO \nstudy debunks many of the criticisms and draws an accurate picture \nwhich should put into proper perspective many of the misconceptions \nthat are circulating. As any fair-minded reader can glean from the \nextensive GAO analysis, the Sports Illustrated article compares apples \nto oranges when calculating the costs of the various Olympic planning \nevents that have taken place in this country. For example, critics of \nOlympic spending often compare transportation improvements in Utah to \nthose in Lake Placid, a small rural community.\n  The article also fails to take into consideration the passage of time \nand the changing scope of the Olympics as the international \ncommunities' participation in the Olympics has grown. Most \ndisappointing, the article to fails to demonstrate an understanding of \nfederal funding of state highway projects and the costs associated with \nhighway projects already in the planning stages for federal funding.\n  Earlier, our colleague decried that the Olympic Games will cost about \n$1.5 billion. Wrong again. Actually, it is over that amount. But as the \nGAO report makes perfectly clear, Federal support only accounts for 18 \npercent of that total. In truth, as the GAO analysis makes clear, the \ntotal projected cost, both public and private, of staging the 2002 \nWinter Olympic and\n\n[[Page S13843]]\n\nParalympic Games, excluding additional security requirements resulting \nfrom the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, is $1.9 billion. Of this \ntotal, GAO estimates that $342 million will be provided by the federal \ngovernment, 18 percent. GAO also documents that the State of Utah will \nprovide $150 million. That is eight percent, or almost half the Federal \namount provided by the 50 States for this international effort.\n  Local governments alone are providing four percent, or $75 million. \nAnd the Salt Lake Organizing Committee has raised the vast majority of \nthe funding, $1.3 billion. That is 70 percent. This represents the hard \nwork of hundreds of people who have spent weeks and months raising \nprivate donations. This is a true public-private partnership, which \nshows America at its best. So why are we not racing to praise this \neffort, rather than condemn it? The GAO report levels the playing field \nby making more accurate funding comparisons with previous Olympic Games \nheld in the United States. Rather than using a dollar to dollar \ncomparison, a distorted calculation, the GAO report uses a percentage \ncomparison, a better gauge to assess the true costs to the Federal \ngovernment.\n  For the edification of my colleagues, I would like to point out that \na second report will be published shortly that compares the 2002 Winter \nSalt Lake Winter Olympics with Olympic games in other countries. This \nreport will be even more enlightening with regard to total cost growth \nfor the Olympic games and to the extent other governments have \nsubsidized the Olympics. The GAO report indicates that while the total \ncosts for staging the U.S. Olympic games, particularly the winter \ngames, have grown, the percentage of federal participation has remained \nfairly constant taking into consideration increasing security \nrequirements due to the bomb incident in Atlanta and events since \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  In fact, the Sports Illustrated article attempts to throw a negative \nspin on security spending for the Olympics by stating that \n``Surprisingly, all but $40 million of the $240 million in security \nspending was approved before September 11.'' Authors of the article \nfail to appreciate that a great majority of the security money was \ndedicated before September 11 because the intelligence community had \nknowledge of the growing terrorist threat in the world.\n  After September 11, the fact that security required little revision \nis testimony to the thoroughness in Olympic security planning and \npreparation. For any of my colleagues who still remain unconvinced, I \nurge you to review the GAO report and obtain a true picture of federal \nsupport for the Olympic Games.\n  I also want to address specifically the issue of federal funding for \nan area that has received the most attention in the press and \nelsewhere, yet is perhaps the least understood. This concerns federal \nfunding for Utah transportation projects over the last five years. It \nhas been a popular parlor game to criticize funding for Olympic \ntransportation costs. Many naysayers have rushed to judgment incorrect \njudgment I might add assuming that any construction project underway in \nUtah must be a direct result of the Olympic Games and that the funding \nmust be coming from sources outside Utah.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. The indiscriminate and \narbitrary inclusion of all transportation costs in federal funding \nfigures for the 2002 Olympics have dramatically skewed the numbers to \nincorrectly support the allegation that Utah has gotten more than its \nfair share of Federal transportation dollars because of the Olympics. \nIn fact, the Sports Illustrated article is particularly guilty of this \nerroneous assumption.\n  The article's $1.5 billion price tag for the Salt Lake Olympics \nincludes well over $800 million in transportation projects that were \nnot designed specifically for the Olympics. Let me address the three \nlargest projects that have attracted considerable attention and set the \nrecord straight.\n  First, let me address the North/South Light Rail in Salt Lake City. \nSince 1983, the Utah Transit Authority has planed a light rail system \nto handle the increased traffic in and around Salt Lake City on a daily \nbasis. The system design calls for two connected light rail lines one \nrunning north and south from downtown Salt Lake City south to Sandy \nCity, and a second east/west line connecting downtown with Salt Lake \nInternational Airport and the University of Utah. The system is \ndesigned to be built in phases with the first phase winning approval by \nthe Federal Transit Administration, FTA, through a rigorous competitive \nprocess, in 1996.\n  Under this process, FTA is required to rank proposed projects \naccording to a number of objective criteria and to select those \nprojects that are ranked highest. The criteria address such areas as \nridership, mobility improvements, environmental benefits, operational \nefficiencies, and cost effectiveness. It is important to remember that \nthe project must meet the FTA criteria before it is ever considered for \nfederal funding and must compete with other projects. The first phase \nof the program, the North/South line, was found worthy and funded by \nboth Federal and state transportation monies. This action was \ncompletely independent of the Olympics.\n  The North/South line was completed in December 1999 at a total \nproject cost of $312.5 million, of which $241.3 million was paid by the \nfederal government. The State of Utah paid $61.2 million which \nrepresents 20 percent of the bill. This is in keeping with the \ntraditional split for state transportation projects, the state can fund \nas little as 20 percent and the federal as much as 80 percent of the \nproject costs.\n  It is important to note that this light rail project benefits all \nSalt Lake City citizens. Not only does it help the poor who are unable \nto afford cars but it also draws commuters out of cars thus helping the \nenvironment. Everyone benefits from greater mobility and better air \nquality. From the opening of the line in 1999, ridership has far \nexceeded expectations and it has continued to rise. Again, this project \nwas not built or funded as an Olympic project--it was approved by the \nAdministration and Congress based on a detailed analysis of the merits \nof the project itself and the long-term transportation needs of the \nSalt Lake Valley.\n  The University Connector Light Rail is the second phase of the light \nrail program. It will run from downtown Salt Lake City to the \nUniversity of Utah. In 2000, the Administration and Congress approved a \nfull funding grant agreement, allowing the Utah Transit Authority to \nbegin construction. The tremendous success of the North/South light \nrail line was a key factor in the decision by Congress and the \nAdministration to approve construction. Like the first phase, this \nphase was approved by FTA pursuant to a rigorous evaluation process. \nHowever, once the project was deemed to qualify under the normal \nFederal guidelines, the Administration did choose to accelerate it \nbased on a possibility that it could be completed before the Olympics. \nNevertheless, everyone, including the Congress, recognized that there \nwas a possibility that the segment would not be completed in time for \nthe Olympic Games and, therefore, the agreement included provisions \nallowing for the temporary halt of construction with resumption \nfollowing the Games.\n  Fortunately, UTA is on schedule to complete the project and therefore \nthe extension will be operating during the Olympics. However, it is \nimportant to note that this project was never deemed necessary for the \nOlympic Games by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee; in fact, \noperations on the line will be suspended for opening and closing \nceremonies at Rice-Eccles Olympic Stadium, which is served by the \nUniversity Connector. The cost of the project will be $118.5 million \nwith $84.0 million federally funded. Without a doubt, the most \nmisunderstood of all the Utah transportation projects is the I-15 \nreconstruction. This $1.59 billion project has been characterized as an \nOlympic project funded by the Federal government. Not true.\n\n  It must be remembered that Utah is a crossroads of the West and the \nI-15 interstate highway is critical to regional shipping and other \ntransportation needs. It benefits everyone in the region, including \nthose in California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Idaho. The \nproject was planned long before the Games, in the mid-1980s in fact. \nThe I-15 improvements address additional capacity needs resulting from \nnormal growth in the Salt Lake Valley and correct some deplorable \ninfrastructure problems such as cracks in\n\n[[Page S13844]]\n\nroadbeds and crumbling bridges. Critics also fail to recognize that the \nI-15 project has been a bargain for the Federal government by any \nanalysis. The Federal taxpayer is only funding $210 million out of a \n$1.59 billion project. While the Federal government has authorized \nanother $243 million in spending for this project in Utah for advance \nconstruction authority, these additional Federal funds may not be used.\n  Based on current projections, the most the Federal government may \ncontribute is 25-30 percent of the project cost well below the \ncustomary 80 percent Federal share. Instead of criticizing our State, \nwe should be applauded. Some here today might ask, ``Why did Utah pick \nup the lion's share of the I-15 reconstruction?''\n  Utah, though a relatively small state, is seriously committed to \ntransportation improvements as demonstrated by the dedication of state \nfunds for transportation projects. The Utah State Legislature, during \nthe 1997 session, established an aggressive state funding program. The \nprogram, known as the Centennial Highway Fund, CHF, will provide for \nover $3 billion for transportation improvements across the entire state \nover a ten year period. The I-15 reconstruction project is the premier \nproject funded under the CHF program. Clearly, the annual allocation of \nabout $200 million per year in federal highway funds is insufficient to \naddress all of the transportation needs of the state.\n  I want to point out that these three transportation projects, rather \nthan a grab of federal money based on some loose association with the \nOlympics, are in fact long-planned and well thought-out projects to \nbenefit the local community. The light rail system has been nationally \nnoted as a shining example of urban/suburban Smart Growth. And \ninterestingly, all three projects were considered and planned as a \nJoint Transportation Corridor which was one of the first in the country \nsubmitted for an environmental impact assessment. Today such joint \ncorridors are common, but the Utah projects were first among this \ntrend.\n  Finally, I take great exception with the Sports Illustrated article's \nsensational innuendos about some Utah businessmen. Did these \nbusinessmen benefit from road improvements due to the Olympic venues \nheld on or near their property? Undoubtedly. However, we must remember \nthat these are businessmen who have invested in property and \ninfrastructure over the course of many years. They have taken risks by \ninvesting in the growth of the community.\n  As a result, many others have benefitted from their efforts. When \nfederal money is spent on any state transportation project, the \ncitizens of that state benefit. Some are richer; some are poorer than \nothers. The Sports Illustrated article holds the rest of the United \nStates to one standard and Utah to another. I do not consider this \nresponsible journalism.\n  In closing, I want to express to my colleagues and the American \npeople my appreciation for their overwhelming support of the Olympic \nGames. The Salt Lake Games promise to be a fantastic family event, one \nthat I hope that the whole nation will enjoy. We should not let \npopulist politics in Washington douse the Olympic flame in Utah.\n\n\n                Procurement of Smokeless Nitrocellulose\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I would like to take the opportunity to thank Senator \nInouye and Senator Stevens and the Defense Appropriations Staff for \ntheir cooperation in securing $2 million for the procurement of \nsmokeless nitrocellulose in this year's Department of Defense, DoD, \nAppropriations Bill. Indeed, the provision included in this legislation \nwill help ensure that our nation will continue to have at least two \ndomestic suppliers of smokeless nitrocellulose.\n  The $2 million direct procurement for this vital product will \nreestablish Green Tree Chemical Technologies of Parlin, New Jersey as a \nviable competitor for the DoD industrial base. Furthermore, this \npurchase will enable Green Tree to be viable for the long term. It will \ncontinue to produce the qualified material for DoD programs and provide \nthe only other production base in the United States for what is a \nvolatile product.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I concur with my colleague with regard to the importance \nof the smokeless nitrocellulose provision included in this year's \ndefense spending bill. In fact the importance of this provision cannot \nbe overemphasized because Green Tree now produces the qualified \nnitrocellulose for the Trident II, LOSAT, TOW and HELLFIRE missile \nprograms. Had the provision providing the $2 million procurement of \nnitrocellulose been omitted, these important missile programs could \nhave been disrupted because re-qualifying DoD materials can be costly \nand time consuming.\n  Mr. CARPER. My two colleagues from New Jersey are correct in their \nassessment of the importance of this $2 million appropriation for \nsmokeless nitrocellulose. Earlier this year, an anti-competitive joint \nventure, which would have centralized the production of this key \ningredient in Defense Department programs, threatened Green Tree. \nIndeed, had the Federal Trade Commission not found the joint venture to \nbe monopolistic, Green Tree would have been forced to close its New \nJersey plant. The provision was inserted to the conference report to \nserve the same purpose as an amendment added to the Senate DoD \nappropriations bill to provide Green Tree with a $2 million production \ngrant.\n  By including this vital provision, Congress will ensure the survival \nof Green Tree and enhance and sustain the competitive domestic \nproduction base for smokeless nitrocellulose which plays a key role in \nmany DoD weapons programs.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I join my colleagues in thanking Senator Inouye and \nSenator Stevens for their assistance in keeping this funding in the \nfinal bill. As my colleagues have indicated, smokeless nitrocellulose \nis a critical precursor for the ammunition of a number of vital weapons \nsystems. By ensuring that more than one company produces it here in the \nUnited States, we are being both fiscally responsible and prudent.\n\n\nSOUTHEAST MICHIGAN HEALTH ASSOCIATION DEVELOPMENT OF A HAND HELD WATER \n                        QUALITY DETECTION DEVICE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Fiscal Year \n2002 Appropriations Act for the Department of Defense, I would like to \nemphasize the importance of portable water quality detection equipment \nin homeland security. Such devices are a important tools for ensuring a \nsafe water supply for all Americans.\n  In Michigan, like the rest of the country, there is a vital need to \nimplement responsible water quality monitoring and tracking due to \nserious threats to public health through raw sewage discharges into its \nlakes and the industrial outfalls that pollute lakes such as Lake St. \nClair. Since September 11, this need is even more important. We must \nprotect sources of drinking and recreational water for our citizens by \ndeveloping technologies that can identify and quantify hazardous water \npollutants in near ``real time''.\n  Four county health departments, Wayne, Oakland, Macomb and St. Clair, \ntogether with the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research and Development \nCenter, TARDEC, and Wayne State University, along with the support of \nthe Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, comprise a consortium \nthat is proposing to prove/develop methodologies to develop field \nportable equipment to detect chemical and biological contaminants \nincluding warfare agents. These technologies will accomplish the \nobjectives of protecting public health and the health of our military \nby providing a valuable tool that can determine water quality.\n  September 11 has placed a new urgency on the need to implement a \nfield detection program to ensure safe potable drinking water supplies \nfor civilians as well as military personnel. Funding provided in this \nbill is essential to the Southeast Michigan Health Association's \nresearch and I would urge the Environmental Protection Agency to make \nthis project a priority when distributing the funds provided in this \nbill.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator from Michigan has a very important point. I \nhope that the people at the Environmental Protection Agency will take \nnote of his remarks.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from West Virginia and the committee for \ntheir hard work in putting together this important legislation.\n\n[[Page S13845]]\n\n                       office of justice programs\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the supplemental spending portion of the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2002, H.R. \n3338, including funding for the Department of Justice Office of Justice \nPrograms' Justice Assistance account. Among the authorized uses of \nthese funds are research and development to support counter-terrorism \ntechnologies, training for first responders, and grants for State and \nlocal domestic preparedness support. The scope of events for which our \ncommunities are attempting to prepare is broad, including release of \nradiological, chemical or biological agents, explosions, armed \nconfrontations, and hostage-taking. While the details of how these \nsituations would affect a community and the appropriate responses \ndiffer due to local circumstances, weather, and topography, similar \nmethods for planning for, detecting, and monitoring these events may \napply nationwide.\n  It has come to my attention that technology and supporting online \nservices are available to communities to provide emergency responders \nwith the information necessary to manage and mitigate damage from such \nterrorist acts that have the potential to endanger individuals and \nentire communities. These systems are capable of monitoring from a \nremote location the release of radiological, chemical, and biological \nagents over open terrain or urban environments. Taking into \nconsideration real-time weather conditions from multiple meteorological \nsensors, these systems can assess the need for evacuations and the \npotential for human loss or harm and physical damage.\n  I appreciate that the Office of Justice Programs works hard, both \nwithin its research and development arm, the National Institute for \nJustice, and in coordination with other Departments and agencies, to \ndevelop new technologies and standardized equipment and training to \nassist State and local responders with their preparations for these \ntype of events. It seems an appropriate use the funds provided by this \nbill to the Office of Justice Programs to assess the capabilities of \nsuch systems and their utility for State and local entities with \ndomestic terrorism responsibilities, and to work with other departments \nand agencies to include such systems in standard equipment lists for \ndomestic terrorism response. I ask the Senator from New Hampshire, who \nis the ranking member on the appropriations subcommittee overseeing the \nDepartment of Justice, whether he agrees with that assessment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree that new technologies of the type described by the \nRepublican Leader may indeed prove useful to local responders. I \nencourage the Office of Justice Programs to consider such systems and \nwork to include such systems in its standard equipment list for \ndomestic terrorism response if such systems prove effective.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my distinguished colleague for his assistance in \nthis matter.\n\n\n                      boeing 767 leasing provision\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I rise to engage the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nSenate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in a colloquy regarding the \nBoeing 767 leasing provision included in the fiscal year 2002 Defense \nAppropriations bill.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I rise to join my colleague from the State of \nWashington to discuss this matter.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I would be pleased to discuss this matter with the \nSenators.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As would I.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. This is a matter that is important to the Nation, our \nnational security, and the great State of Kansas. I, too, would like to \njoin with my colleagues to review the leasing issue.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I agree with my colleague from Kansas. The aging of our \nmilitary air refueling tanker fleet has become a critical military \noperations issue-one that requires a bold solution now. The Air Force's \nfleet of over 500 KC-135 air refueling tankers is, on average, more \nthan 40 years old. In fact, the oldest of these tankers--100 KC-135E \nmodels--are close to 45 years in age. New 767 air refueling tankers are \nalready under development and could begin replacing the KC-135 Es \nwithin 2 years. There would be no up-front development costs to the \nmilitary.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Of equal importance is the need to support our \ncommercial and military industrial base in the wake of the September 11 \nterrorist attacks. The provision included in the fiscal year 2002 \nDefense Appropriations bill will allow the Air Force to meet a pressing \nmilitary need and ensure continued, strong demand for the Boeing 767 \naircraft. In this regard, it is my understanding that the provision \nincluded in the bill permits the leasing of up to 100 purpose Boeing \n767 aircraft in a commercial configuration for up to 10 years. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. INOUYE. That is correct. And contrary to some reports, this \nprovision is permissive in nature. I believe this provision provides \nthe right solution at the right time to address the Air Force's needs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree with Senator Inouye's remarks. Not only with \nthis provisions allow for timely delivery of critical military assets, \nbut it requires that the leasing costs be 10 percent less than the life \ncycle costs of the aircraft were they to be purchased outright.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. It is my understanding that Italy and Japan have \nselected the 767 tanker for their air forces and that 767s are being \nmodified in Wichita already. Italy intends to buy four of the tankers \nand Japan intends to purchase at least one. I also know that this same \ntanker configuration is being offered commercially to other countries \nto meet their in-flight fueling requirements. Is that the Senator from \nAlaska's understanding as well?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is. There are a number of other nations and at least \none private company who have expressed an interest in procuring general \npurpose, commercially configured tanker aircraft.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Then would you say that a commercial market exists for \nthese aircraft?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask the Senator from Hawaii, would you agree that a \ngeneral purpose aircraft that will meet the general requirements of \nmany customers; that can operate as a passenger aircraft, a freighter, \na passenger/freighter ``combination'' aircraft, or as an aerial \nrefueling tanker; and is available to either government or private \ncustomers meets the definition of a general purpose, commercially \nconfigured aircraft?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I believe that assessment makes sense.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The opportunity has been presented to the Air Force and \nthe Boeing company to come together to make this leasing provision work \nfor the benefit of our national security and our industrial base. I \nurge them to do so quickly and cooperatively.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I agree and pledge my support to making this effort a \nsuccessful one.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senators for their remarks and for their \npledges of support.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I join with my friend, the Senator from Alaska, to thank \nyou for your remarks and let you know that Senator Stevens and I will \nclosely follow the progress of this new program.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record a \npreliminary scoring by the Budget Committee of the conference report to \nH.R. 3338, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year \n2002. I will be submitting a final, official statement for the record \nafter CBO completes its scoring of the conference report.\n  Preliminarily, the conference report provides $317.207 billion in \nnonemergency discretionary budget authority, almost all of which is for \ndefense activities. That budget authority will result in new outlays in \n2002 of $212.907 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority \nare taken into account, nonemergency discretionary outlays for the \nconference report total $309.256 billion in 2002. By comparison, the \nSenate-passed bill provided $317.206 billion in nonemergency budget \nauthority, which would have resulted in $309.365 billion in outlays.\n  In addition, H.R. 3338 includes $20 billion in emergency-designated \nfunding. That funding represents the second $20 billion previously \nauthorized by and designated as emergency spending under Public Law \n107-38, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from \nand Response to Attacks on the United States. An estimate of the impact \non outlays from the\n\n[[Page S13846]]\n\nemergency funding is not available at this time.\n  The conference report to H.R. 3338 violates section 302(f) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 because it exceeds the subcommittee's \nSection 302(b) allocation for both budget authority and outlays. \nSimilarly, because the committee's allocation is tied to the current \nlaw cap on discretionary spending, H.R. 3338 also violates section \n312(b) of the Congressional Budget Act. The bill includes language that \nraises the cap on discretionary category spending to $681.441 billion \nin budget authority and $670.206 billion in outlays and the cap on \nconservation category outlays to $1.473 billion. However, because that \nlanguage is not yet law, the budget committee cannot increase the \nappropriations committee's allocation by the amount of the pending cap \nincrease at this time, putting it in violation of the two points of \norder.\n  In addition, by including language that increases the cap on \ndiscretionary spending, adjusts the balances on the pay-as-you-go \nscorecard for 2001 and 2002 to zero, and directs the scoring of a \nprovision in the bill, H.R. 3338 also violates section 306 of the \nCongressional Budget Act. Finally, the bill violates section \n311(a)(2)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act by exceeding the spending \naggregates assumed in the 2002 budget resolution for fiscal year 2002.\n  The conference report to H.R. 3338 violates several budget act points \nof order; however, it is good bill that addresses the Nation's defense \nneeds, including the defense of our homeland. The President and \nCongressional leaders from both parties agreed in the wake of the \nSeptember 11 attack that more money was needed to respond to the \nterrorists and to protect our homeland. This report follows that \nbipartisan agreement and includes language that raises the cap on \ndiscretionary spending. I urge its adoption.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget committee \nscoring of H.R. 3338 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nH.R. 3338, CONFERENCE REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS\n                      ACT, 2002 PRELIMINARY SCORING\n    [Spending comparisons--Conference Report, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                   purpose \\2\\   Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report:\n  Budget Authority...............      317,207          282      317,489\n  Outlays........................      309,256          282      309,538\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............      181,953          282      182,235\n  Outlays........................      181,616          282      181,898\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............      319,130          282      311,224\n  Outlays........................      310,942          282      311,224\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............      317,207          282      317,489\n  Outlays........................      308,873          282      309,155\nSenate-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............      317,206          282      317,488\n  Outlays........................      309,365          282      309,647\n \n  CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............      135,254            0      135,254\n  Outlays........................      127,640            0      127,640\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............

An estimate of the outlay impact from the\n  emergency spending is not available at this time.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise once again to address the issue of \nwasteful spending in appropriations measures, in this case the bill \nfunding the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2002. In provisions \ntoo numerous to mention in detail, this bill, time and again, chooses \nto fund pork barrel projects with little if any relationship to \nnational defense at a time of scarce resources, budget deficits, and \nunderfunded, urgent defense priorities.\n  As I pointed out previously to this body on December 7th, the massive \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Bill Conference Report, totaling \n$343 billion, would be the last business in the Senate and so it is. \nNot because of its level of difficulty, but because it is so easy to \nhide the mother of all pork projects in a large massive bill or maybe \nit wasn't because we found it as well as many other groups. For \nexample, let me read a few comments.\n  Our Nation is at war, a war that has united Americans behind a common \ngoal--to find the enemies who terrorized the United States on September \n11th and bring them to justice. In pursuit of this goal, our servicemen \nand women are serving long hours, under extremely difficult conditions, \nfar away from their families. Many other Americans also have been \naffected by this war and its economic impact, whether they have lost \ntheir jobs, their homes, or have had to drastically cut expenses this \nholiday season. The weapons we have given them, for all their \nimpressive effects, are, in many cases, neither in quantity nor \nquality, the best that our government can provide.\n  For instance, stockpiles of the precision guided munitions that we \nhave relied on so heavily to bring air power to bear so effectively on \ndifficult, often moving targets, with the least collateral damage \npossible, are dangerously depleted after only 10 weeks of war in \nAfghanistan. This is just one area of critical importance to our \nsuccess in this war that underscores just how carefully we should be \nallocating scarce resources to our national defense.\n  Yet, despite the realities of war, and the responsibilities they \nimpose on Congress as much the President, the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee has not seen fit to change in any degree its usual blatant \nuse of defense dollars for projects that may or may not serve some \nworthy purpose, but that certainly impair our national defense by \ndepriving legitimate defense needs of adequate funding.\n  Even in the middle of a war, a war of monumental consequences, the \nAppropriations Committee is intent on using the Department of Defense \nas an agency for dispensing corporate welfare. It is a terrible shame \nthat in a time of maximum emergency, the United States Senate would \npersist in spending money requested and authorized only for our Armed \nForces to satisfy the needs or the desires of interests that are \nunrelated to defense needs.\n  The Investor's Business Daily, on December 18, 2001, had this to say \nin an article titled At the Trough: Welfare Checks To Big Business Make \nNo Sense, ``Among the least justified outlays is corporate welfare. \nBudget analyst Stephen Slivinski estimates that business subsidies will \nrun $87 billion this year, up a third since 1997, Although President \nBush proposed $12 billion in cuts to corporate welfare this year, \nCongress has proved resistant. Indeed, many post-September 11 bailouts \nhave gone to big business. Boeing is one of the biggest beneficiaries. \nRepresentative Norm Dicks, Democrat from Washington, is pushing a \nsubstantial increase in research and development support for Boeing and \nother defense contractors, the purchase of several retrofitted Boeing \n767s and the leasing of as many as 100 767s for purposes ranging from \nsurveillance to refueling. Boeing has been hurt by the storm that hit \nairlines, since many companies have slashed orders. Yet China recently \nagreed to buy 30 of the company's planes, and Boeing's problems predate \nthe September 11 attack. It is one thing to compensate the airlines for \nforcibly shutting them down; it is quite another to toss money at big \ncompanies caught in a down demand cycle. Boeing, along with many other \nmajor exporters, enjoys its own federal lending facility, the Export-\nImport Bank. ExIm uses cheap loans, loan guarantees and loan insurance \nto subsidize purchases of U.S. products. The bulk of the money goes to \nbig business that sell airplanes, machinery, nuclear power plants and \nthe like. Last year alone, Boeing benefitted from $3.3 billion in \ncredit subsidies. While corporate America gets the profits, taxpayers \nget the losses. . . .The Constitution authorizes a Congress to promote \nthe general welfare, not enrich Boeing and other corporate behemoths. \nThere is no warrant to take from Peter so Paul can pay higher corporate \ndividends. In the aftermath of September 11, the American people can \nill afford budget profligacy in Washington. If Congress is not willing \nto cut corporate welfare at a time of national crisis, what is it \nwilling to cut?''\n\n[[Page S13847]]\n\n  As I mentioned last week when the Senate version of the Defense \nAppropriations bill was being debated and--now carried through the \nConference Committee there is a sweet deal for the Boeing Company that \nI'm sure is the envy of corporate lobbyists from one end of K Street to \nthe other. Attached is a legislative provision to the Fiscal Year 2002 \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations bill that would require the Air \nForce to lease one hundred 767 aircraft for use as tankers for $26 \nmillion apiece each year for the next 10 years. Moreover, in Conference \nCommittee the appropriators added four 737 aircraft for executive \ntravel mostly benefitting Members of Congress. We have been told that \nthese aircraft will be assigned to the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Air \nForce Base. Since the 10-year leases have yet to be signed, the cost of \nthe planes cannot be calculated, but it costs roughly $85 million to \nbuy one 737, and a lease costs significantly more over the long term.\n  The cost to taxpayers?\n  Two billion and six hundred million dollars per year for the aircraft \nplus another $1.2 billion in military construction funds to modify KC-\n135 hangars to accommodate their larger replacements, with a total \nprice tag of more than $30 billion over 10 years when the costs of the \n737 leases are also included. This leasing plan is five times more \nexpensive to the taxpayer than an outright purchase, and it represents \n30 percent of the Air Force's annual cost of its top 60 priorities. But \nthe most amazing fact is that this program is not actually among the \nAir Force's top 60 priorities nor do new tankers appear in the 6-year \ndefense procurement plan for the Service!\n\n  That is right, when the Air Force told Congress in clear terms what \nits top priorities were tankers and medical lift capability aircraft \nweren't included as critical programs. In fact, within its top 30 \nprograms, the Air Force has asked for several essential items that \nwould directly support our current war effort: wartime munitions, jet \nfighter engine replacement parts, combat support vehicles, bomber and \nfighter upgrades and self protection equipment, and combat search and \nrescue helicopters for downed pilots.\n  Let me say that again, within its top 30 programs, the Air Force has \nasked for several essential items that would directly support our \ncurrent war effort: wartime munitions, jet fighter engine replacement \nparts, combat support vehicles, bomber and fighter upgrades and self \nprotection equipment, and combat search and rescue helicopters for \ndowned pilots.\n  This leasing program also will require $1.2 billion in military \nconstruction funding to build new hangars, since existing hangars are \ntoo small for the new 767 aircraft. The taxpayers also will be on the \nhook for another $30 million per aircraft on the front end to convert \nthese aircraft from commercial configurations to military; and at the \nend of the lease, the taxpayers will have to foot the bill for $30 \nmillion more, to convert the aircraft back--pushing the total cost of \nthe Boeing sweetheart deal to $30 billion over the ten-year lease. Mr. \nPresident, that is waste that borders on gross negligence.\n  But this is just another example of Congress' political meddling and \nof how outside special interest groups have obstructed the military's \nability to channel resources where they are most needed. I will repeat \nwhat I've said many, many times before--the military needs less money \nspent on pork and more spent to redress the serious problems caused by \na decade of declining defense budgets.\n  This bill includes many more examples where congressional \nappropriators show that they have no sense of priority when it comes to \nspending the taxpayers' money. The insatiable appetite in Congress for \nwasteful spending grows more and more as the total amount of pork added \nto appropriations bills this year--an amount totaling over $15 billion.\n  This defense appropriations bill also includes provisions to mandate \ndomestic source restrictions; these ``Buy America'' provisions directly \nharm the United States and our allies. ``Buy America'' protectionist \nprocurement policies, enacted by Congress to protect pork barrel \nprojects in each Member's State or District, hurt military readiness, \npersonnel funding, modernization of military equipment, and cost the \ntaxpayer $5.5 billion annually. In many instances, we are driving the \nmilitary to buy higher-priced, inferior products when we do not allow \nforeign competition. ``Buy America'' restrictions undermine DoD's \nability to procure the best systems at the least cost and impede \ngreater interoperability and armaments cooperation with our allies. \nThey are not only less cost-effective, they also constitute bad policy, \nparticularly at a time when our allies' support in the war on terrorism \nis so important.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld and his predecessor, Bill Cohen, oppose this \nprotectionist and costly appropriation's policy. However, the \nappropriations' staff ignores this expert advice when preparing the \nlegislative draft of the appropriations bills each year. In the defense \nappropriations bill are several examples of ``Buy America'' pork--\nprohibitions on procuring anchor and mooring chain components for Navy \nwarships; main propulsion diesel engines and propellers for a new class \nof Navy dry-stores and ammunition supply ships; supercomputers; carbon, \nalloy, or armor steel plate; ball and roller bearings; construction or \nconversion of any naval vessel; and, other naval auxiliary equipment, \nincluding pumps for all shipboard services, propulsion system \ncomponents such as engines, reduction gears, and propellers, shipboard \ncranes, and spreaders for shipboard cranes.\n  Also buried in the smoke and mirrors of the appropriations markup is \nwhat appears to be a small provision that has large implications on our \nwarfighting ability in Afghanistan and around the world. Without debate \nor advice and counsel from the Committee on Armed Services, the \nappropriators changed the policy on military construction which would \nprohibit previous authority given to the President of the United \nStates, the Secretary of Defense, and the Service Secretaries to shift \nmilitary construction money within the MILCON account to more critical \nmilitary construction projects in time of war or national emergency. \nThe reason for this seemingly small change is to protect added pork in \nthe form of military construction projects in key states, especially as \nsuch projects have historically been added by those Members who sit on \nthe Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittee, at the expense, \nMr. President, of projects the Commander-in-Chief believes are most \nneeded to support our military overseas.\n  Does the appropriations committee have any respect for the \nauthorizing committees in the Senate?\n  I look forward to the day when my appearances on the Senate floor for \nthis purpose are no longer necessary. There is nearly $2.5 billion in \nunrequested defense programs in the defense appropriations bill and \nanother $1.1 billion for additional supplemental appropriations not \ndirectly related to defense that have been added by the Chairman of the \nCommittee. Consider what $3.6 billion when added to the savings gained \nthrough additional base closings and more cost-effective business \npractices could be used for. The problems of our armed forces, whether \nin terms of force structure or modernization, could be more assuredly \naddressed and our warfighting ability greatly enhanced. The public \nexpects more of us.\n  But for now, unfortunately, they must witness us, blind to our \nresponsibilities in war, going about our business as usual.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of earmarks from the fiscal \nyear 2002 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill Conference Report \nbe placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                  FY 2002 Defense appropriations pork\n\n                             [In millions]\n\n      DIVISION A....................................................\n\nOperation and Maintenance, Army:\n  Fort Knox Distance Learning Program...............................2.1\n  Army Conservation and Ecosystem Management........................4.3\n  Fort Richardson, Camp Denali Water Systems........................0.6\n  Rock Island Bridge Repairs........................................2.0\n  Memorial Tunnel, Consequence Management..........................16.5\n  FIRES Programs Data...............................................6.8\n  Skid Steer Loaders................................................7.5\n  USARPAC Transformation Planning...................................8.5\n\n[[Page S13848]]\n\n  USARPAC Command, Control, and Communications Upgrades.............3.2\n  Hunter UAV........................................................2.5\n  Field Pack-up Systems.............................................2.5\n  Unutilized Plant Capacity........................................17.5\n  SROTC--Air Battle Captain.........................................1.0\n  Joint Assessment Neurological Examination Equipment...............2.6\n  Repairs Ft.

Mr. President. I rise to lend my strong support to the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Conference Report.\n  And I do so with great admiration and respect for the leadership \ndemonstrated by Chairman Daniel Inouye and Senator Ted Stevens. They \nhave done great work, and I encourage the Senate to embrace this \nappropriations conference report.\n  I do want to briefly address the issue of tanker replacement which \nhas been hotly debated here on the floor. I support the tanker leasing \nprovisions in the bill, and I am again grateful to Senator Inouye and \nSenator Stevens for their work on the Boeing 767 leasing provisions. \nMany Senators worked on this issue. There were many hurdles to address \nand overcome. And we worked through them all together in a bipartisan \nfashion.\n  I want to again quote the Secretary of the Air Force from a letter he \nwrote to me in early December. Secretary James Roche says and I quote,\n\n       The KC-135 fleet is the backbone of our Nation's Global \n     Reach. But with an average age of over 41 years, coupled with \n     the increasing expense required to maintain them, it is \n     readily apparent that we must start replacing these critical \n     assets. I strong endorse beginning to upgrade this critical \n     warfighting capability with new Boeing 767 tanker aircraft.\n\n  The record is clear. The Air Force has been a contributing partner \nand fully supports the tanker replacement program contained in this \nappropriations bill.\n  The existing tankers are old and require costly maintenance and \nupgrades. The K-135s were first delivered to the Air Force in 1957. On \naverage, they are 41 years old. KC-135s spend about 400 days in major \ndepot maintenance every 5 years.\n  The tanker replacement program contained in this bill will save \ntaxpayers $5.9 billion in upgrade and maintenance costs.\n  The record is clear. We need to move forward on tanker replacement. \nOur aging tankers have flown more than 6000 sorties since September 11. \nOur ability to project force depends on our refueling capabilities. We \ncan no longer ignore these old and expensive aircraft.\n  The record is also clear on my State of Washington. This will help \nthe people of my state. Washington now has the highest unemployment \nrate of any state in the nation. I am here to do everything I can to \nhelp my constituents. Any Senator, including critics of the leasing \nprovisions in this bill, would do the same thing.\n  But this is not just about my State. Every state involved in aircraft \nproduction will benefit.\n  In addition, it is in our national interest to keep our only \ncommercial aircraft manufacturer healthy in tough times, to keep that \ncapacity and to keep that skill set.\n  The Air Force has identified this as a critical need. We rely on \nrefueling tankers. Now is the time to move forward with tanker \nreplacement. I again commend Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, Senator \nCantwell, Senator Conrad, Senator Roberts and the many others who \nworked so hard to move this program forward.\n  Shortly, we are all going to go home for the holidays to be with our \nfamilies. Senators can go home knowing that they have sent a very \npowerful message to the families of our service members. We have acted \ntoday with this bill to equip our personnel now and in the future with \nbest equipment and the best technology available to our armed forces. I \nwill proudly vote for this conference report.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my Senate colleagues \nfor their support of two important aviation needs and to express my \ndisappointment that the House did not support those decisions. I know \nthat it is always difficult to reconcile the decisions made in the \nSenate with those made in the House, but this case, I am very sorry to \nsee that the Senate's wisdom was not sustained.\n  When the Defense Appropriations bill left the Senate, it included \nfull-funding for two important aviation assets--C-5 avionics \nmodernization and 10 additional Blackhawks for the Amy National Guard. \nUnfortunately, the bill that we have before us does not include those \nitems. Instead, the C-5 avionics funding is cut by $70.50 million and \nthere are only 4 Blackhawks going to the Army National Guard.\n  Let me first review the importance of the C-5 Avionics Modernization \nProgram which was not only fully funded in the Senate's Defense \nAppropriations bill, but which both the House and Senate Armed Services \nCommittees fully supported in their bills.\n  The C-5 is what the military uses when it needs to deploy quickly \nwith as much equipment as possible. This was confirmed once again in \nOperation Enduring Freedom where the Air Force reports that C-5s have \nhauled forty-six percent of the cargo during the operation while only \nflying approximately twenty-eight percent of the sorties. This plane is \na vital part of our military success. It is also a key player in our \nnation's humanitarian efforts, so critical to the long-term success of \nour national security strategy.\n  Taking $70.5 million from the President's funding request means that \ncritical Secretary of Defense directed Flight and Navigation Safety \nmodifications and Global Air Traffic Management modifications will be \ndelayed by up to a year or more. Delays in installing the safety \nequipment continue to place aircrews at risk at a time when they are \nengaged around the world in the war on terrorism and humanitarian \nmissions. Delays also prevent the C-5 from being fully employed in \ncertain parts of the world as AMP modifications are necessary to comply \nwith new GATM regulations.\n\n  At a time when we are asking our military to do so much, to deny our \naircrews and military planners C-5s that have the safety upgrades and \noperational improvements that the AMP will provide does not make sense. \nAgain, I am sorry that the House did not agree with the Senate. I hope \nwe can reverse this problem next year by accelerating the program with \nincreased funding. I will certainly fight to do that and I hope that \nother colleagues who have been supportive in the past will join me in \nthat fight next year.\n  My other concern with this bill is that the Army National Guard's \nneed for additional UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters has not been properly \naddressed. Today, the Army National Guard comprises fifty percent of \nthe Army's total utility airlift capability. Unfortunately, only \ntwenty-seven percent of the fleet is usually flyable. On a regular \nbasis a full seventy-three percent of the utility helicopters in the \nGuard are grounded because of a lack of parts or safety of flight \nconcerns! Virtually every state confronts significant shortages, and \nsome states, like Delaware, have absolutely no modern helicopters, \nrelying instead on one or two Vietnam-era helicopters.\n  This means that regular state missions cannot be executed. Pilots and \nmaintenance personnel cannot remain proficient. These skilled personnel \nare\n\n[[Page S13851]]\n\nnot able to do their job, get frustrated, and decide not to stay in the \nmilitary. Meanwhile, the Army is simply unready in this area. In normal \ntimes, these are unacceptable realities. Today, when the Guard has been \nasked to do so much more, it is unfathomable to me that we would not do \nmore to fix these problems.\n  The Senate recognized the need to do more and provided a first \ninstallment of ten new Blackhawk helicopters for the Army Guard. \nUnfortunately, this bill only provides four. Today, many in utility \naviation units do not have even the bare minimum they need to stay \nproficient, let alone do their missions. This is certainly true in \nDelaware and I know it also true for at least five other states. This \nbill does not even allow the Guard Bureau to put one new Blackhawk in \neach state that needs seven to ten!\n  The men and women who serve in the Guard every day, both in their \nstates and overseas, deserve to have the equipment they need to perform \ntheir missions. I am sorry the House did not agree to do more to \naddress their aviation needs this year and I will work with my \ncolleagues again next year to try to improve this situation.\n  Mr. President, this bill includes a number of important items that \nwill benefit our military and I support it. But, I want to put my \ncolleagues on notice that next year I will be fighting to accelerate C-\n5 modernization and to get additional UH-60s for the Army National \nGuard. The Senate spoke wisely last week in fully funding both of these \naviation needs and I am sorry that the House was unwilling to sustain \nthat wisdom.\n  Mr. Allard. Mr. President, being that I was not able to discuss the \nFiscal Year 2002 Defense Authorization Act last Thursday, I wanted to \ntake a few minutes to discuss a few aspects of this very important \nbill.\n  I strongly support the Fiscal Year 2002 Defense Authorization Act. I \nwant to congratulate Chairman Levin and the Ranking Member Warner for \nthe good work and the way they have moved this important bill for our \nmen and women in the military. I believe this is a balanced bill which \nprovides a much needed and deserved increase for our military men and \nwomen. After years of declining budgets, this bill continues the \nincrease in resources which started 2 years ago.\n  The bill provides $343.3 billion in budget authority, plus authorizes \nthe $21.2 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations as requested \nby the President in order to respond to the terrorist attacks. The bill \nalso adds over $779.4 million above the request for the Department of \nEnergy's environmental cleanup programs and nuclear weapons activities.\n  When I became the Personnel Subcommittee Chairman in 1999, the \nsubcommittee provided the first major pay raise for our troops in over \n20 years and I am glad that this year's bill continues this trend. The \nbill provides a targeted pay raise effective January 1, 2002, ranging 5 \nto 10 percent, with the largest increase going to junior officers and \nnon-commissioned officers.\n  While no member enjoys having bases closed in their State, or even \nthe possibility of closure, it is that time that we recognize we do \nhave excess capacity and that is time to consider another round of base \nclosings as requested by the administration. After much negotiating, \nthe conferees authorized a round of base closings in 2005, with \nestablished criteria based on actual and potential military value that \nthe Secretary of Defense must use to determine which bases to \nrecommend.\n  As the rulemaking member of the Strategic Subcommittee, I would like \nto congratulate my chairman, Senator Reed, for his good work on this \nbill. He worked in a bipartisan and even handed manner. While we \ndisagreed on the missile defense programs, Senator Reed and I were in \nagreement on most of the remaining major issues before the \nsubcommittee.\n  While many in Congress may disagree on funding levels of missile \ndefense, no one can argue that ballistic missiles, armed with nuclear, \nbiological, or chemical warheads, present a considerable threat to U.S. \ntroops deployed abroad, allies, and the American homeland. The \nconsequences of such an attack on the United States would be \nstaggering; yet the United States currently has no system capable of \neffectively stopping even a single ballistic missile headed toward the \nAmerican homeland or depolyed U.S. troops.\n  To end this vulnerability, the President requested a significant \nincrease in funding for ballistic missile defense programs which was an \nimportant first step toward protecting all Americans against ballistic \nmissile attack. The conference provided up to $8.3 billion, $3 billion \nmore than the fiscal year 2001 level, for the continued development of \nballistic missile defenses. In addition, the conferees provided \nflexibility for the President to use up to $1.3 billion of these funds \nfor programs to combat terrorism.\n  In an effort to increase the efficiency and productivity of the \nmissile defense programs, the administration requested to fundamentally \nrestructure the nation's ballistic missile defense programs into six \nprimary areas: Boost, Midcourse, Terminal Defenses, Systems \nEngineering, Sensor, and Technology Development. This new approach will \nprovide the flexibility to allow programs that work to mature but the \nability to cancel programs that do not. Plus, the program will provide \nenhanced testing and test infrastructure.\n  A major testing initiative included in the President's request is the \n2004 Pacific missile defense test bed, the conferees supported the \nrequest, for $786 million for the including $273 million for \nconstruction primarily at fort Greely, Alaska and other Alaska \nlocations. Beginning in 2004, the Pacific missile test bed will allow \nmore challenging testing in a far wider range of engagement scenarios \nthan can be accommodated today.\n  The conferees provided the following levels for the restructured \nprograms: $780 million for BMD system activities including battle \nmanagement, communications, targets, countermeasures, and system \nintegration; $2.2 billion (matching the President's request) for \nterminal defense systems, including Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-\n3), Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), Navy Area (which has \nnow been cancelled by the Administration), Theater High Altitude Air \nDefense (THAAD), and international missile defense programs, including \nthe Arrow program; $3.9 billion (matching the President's request) for \nmid-course defense systems, including ground-based (formerly known as \nnational Missile Defense) and sea-based (formerly known as Navy Theater \nWide Defense) missile defense programs; $685 million (matching the \nPresident's request) for boost phase systems, including the Airborne \nLaser (ABL) and Space-Based Laser (SBL); $496 million (matching the \nPresident's request) for the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and \ninternational sensor programs, including the Russian-American \nObservation Satellite project; $113 million (matching the President's \nrequest) for development of technology and innovative concepts \nnecessary to keep pace with evolving missile threats;\n  However, the conferees did not support the President's request to \ntransfer PAC-3, Medium Extended Air Defense System, and Navy Area \nprograms from BMDO to the military services. The bill requires the \nSecretary of Defense to establish guidelines for future transfers, and \nto certify that transferred programs are adequately funded in the \nfuture year defense program.\n  Just as the President moves to reduce our nuclear forces the \nconferees repealed the statute that prohibits the U.S. from retiring or \ndismantling certain strategic nuclear forces until START II enters into \nforce. As part of this effort, the conferees increased funding for the \nretirement of the Peacekeeper ICBM.\n  The Strategic Subcommittee also has oversight over two-thirds of the \nDepartment of Energy's budget as it relates to our nuclear forces and \ndefense nuclear cleanup programs.\n  During the subcommittee's hearings, we heard from DOE that one of the \nmajor shortfalls of the Department is the conditions of the \ninfrastructure of our DOE labs and plants, the need for a principal \ndeputy administrator at the National Nuclear Security Administration, \nand an increase in DOE's environmental cleanup programs and nuclear \nweapons activities.\n  Therefore the conferees provided $6.2 billion for DOE environmental \ncleanup and management programs including: $3.3 billion for work at \nfacilities with\n\n[[Page S13852]]\n\ncomplex and extensive environmental problems that will be closed after \n2006; $1.1 billion for the Defense Facilities Closure Project; $959.7 \nmillion for construction and site completion at facilities that will be \nclosed by 2006; $216 million ($20 million more than the President's \nrequest) for the Defense Environmental Restoration and Waste Management \nScience and Technology programs; and $153.5 million ($12 million more \nthan the President's request) for Defense Environmental Management \nPrivatization.\n  In regards to the National Nuclear Security Administration conferees \nprovided $7.1 billion for managing the nation's nuclear weapons, \nnonproliferation and naval reactor programs, including: $1 billion for \nstockpile life extension and evaluation programs; $2.1 billion for \nfocused efforts to develop the tools and knowledge necessary to ensure \nthe safety, reliability, and performance of the nuclear stockpile in \nthe absence of underground nuclear weapons testing. Included in this, \nthe conferees provided $219 million to fully fund plutonium pit \nmanufacturing and certification; $200 million to begin to recapitalize \nthe nation's nuclear weapons complex infrastructure, much of which \ndates to the post-World War II era; $688 million for the naval reactors \nprogram, which supports operation, maintenance and continuing \ndevelopment of Naval nuclear propulsion systems.\n\n  There is one issue that I am very proud to say is included in this \nbill and that is the creation of the Rocky Flats National Wildlife \nRefuge. This effort has been done in a bipartisan manner with \nCongressman Udall and more than 2 years worth of work by local \ncitizens, community leaders, and elected officials. Its passage has \nensured that our children and grandchildren will continue to enjoy the \nwildlife and open space that currently exists at Rocky Flats. However, \neven with its passage, my primary goal remains the safe cleanup and \nclosure of Rocky Flats.\n  I would like to mention a few of the following high points of the \nbill.\n  Rocky Flats will remain in permanent federal ownership through a \ntransfer from the Department of Energy to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService after the cleanup and closure of the site is complete;\n  Secondly, we understand the importance of planning for the \ntransportation needs of the future and have authorized the Secretary of \nEnergy and the Secretary of the Interior the opportunity to grant a \ntransportation right-of-way on the eastern boundary of the site for \ntransportation improvements along Indiana Street;\n  The third point is one of the most important directives in this Act \nand it states that ``nothing . . . shall reduce the level of cleanup \nand closure at Rocky Flats required under the RFCA or any Federal or \nState law.'' I believe it is important to reiterate that the cleanup \nlevels for the site will be determined by the various laws and \nprocesses set forth in the Rock Flats Cleanup Agreement and State and \nFederal law; and\n  Fourth, we firmly believe that access rights and property rights must \nbe preserved. Therefore, this legislation recognizes and preserves all \nmineral rights, water rights and utility rights-of-ways. This act does, \nhowever, provide the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Interior \nthe authority to impose reasonable conditions on the access to private \nproperty rights for cleanup and refuge management purposes.\n  I would also like to highlight another section of the bill which \nencourages the implementation of the recommendations of the Space \nCommission, which concluded that the Department of Defense is not \nadequately organized or focused to meet U.S. national security space \nneeds. There are four major sections of the provision.\n  The first provision requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a \nreport on steps taken to improve management, organization and oversight \nof space programs, space activities, and funding and personnel \nresources.\n  The second provision requires the Secretary of Defense to take \nactions that ensure space development and acquisition programs are \njointly carried out and, to the maximum extent practicable, ensure that \noffers of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force are assigned to \nand hold leadership positions in such joint program offices.\n  Third, the conferees request that the Comptroller General report back \nto Congress on the actions taken by the Secretary of Defense to \nimplement the recommendations contained in the Commission report.\n  Fourth, due to the concerns of the ``tripled hatted'' nature of the \nCommander-in-Chief, U.S. Air Force Space Command, the bill states that \nthe position should not serve concurrently as commander of the North \nAmerican Air Defense Command and as Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Space \nCommand. Plus, the bill provides the needed flexibility in general \nofficer limits to ensure that the commander of Air Force Space Command \nwill serve in the grade of general.\n  Finally, even though I strongly support the Fiscal Year 2002 \nAuthorization Act, I am very disappointed that this bill ignored real \nshortcoming as it relates to our military's voting rights.\n  While my original bill went much further in implementing the Space \nCommission report, I believe this is a first good step and, if needed, \nI hope we can revisit this issue next year to ensure that space \nmanagement and programs get the senior level support it deserves.\n  Finally, even though I strongly support this bill, I am very \ndisappointed that this bill ignored a real shortcoming as it relates to \nour military voting rights.\n  When I introduce S. 381, my Military Voting Rights Bill, I sought to \nimprove the voting rights of overseas military voters in six key ways. \nAnd this Senate agreed to include that bill in our version of the \ndefense authorization. But I am severely dismayed that the conference \nreport contained none of the most important provisions relating to \nmilitary voting.\n  Considering the egregious acts of last November, with the memory of \ncampaign lawyers standing ready with pre-printed military absentee \nballot challenge forms, we needed to respond. And yet the House of \nRepresentatives, led by the House Administration Committee, refused to \naccept the sections of the Senate passed bill that would most \neffectively ensure the voting rights of our military men and women and \ntheir families.\n  In September, the GAO released a 92-page report entitled ``Voting \nAssistance to Military and Overseas Citizens Should Be Improved.'' I \nwill not read the entire thing, but let me read one of the summary \nheaders: ``Military and Overseas Absentee Ballots in Small Countries \nWere Disqualified at a Higher Rate Than Other Absentee Ballots.''\n  I also have an article from the Washington Post, page A17, November \n22, 2000 that reads in part `` . . . lawyers spent a contentious six \nhours trying to disqualify as many as possible of the absentee ballots \nsent in by overseas military personnel.''\n  Let me also read from a Miami Herald article, November 19, 2000: \n``Forty percent of the more than 3,500 ballots in Florida were thrown \nout last week for technical reasons, and elections observers are \nwondering whether the State's election laws are fair, especially to \nmilitary personnel.''\n  Two main flaws in the military voter system--flaws that we have \nconcrete proof were exploited--could have been fixed last week by \nsections of the Military Voting Rights bill that the House refuses to \naccept.\n  The first section prohibits a State from disqualifying a ballot based \nupon lack of postmark, address, witness signature, lack of proper \npostmark, or on the basis of comparison of envelope, ballot and \nregistration signatures alone--these were the basis for most absentee \nballot challenges.\n  There has been report after report of ballots mailed--for instance \nform deployed ships or other distant postings--without the benefit of \npostmarking facilities. Sometimes mail is bundled, and the whole group \ngets one postmark, which could invalidate them all under current law. \nMilitary ``voting officers'' are usually junior ranks, quickly trained, \nand facing numerous other responsibilities. We can not punish our \nservice personnel for the good faith mistakes of others.\n  And military voters who are discharged and move before an election \nbut after the residency deadline cannot vote through the military \nabsentee ballot system, and sometimes are not able\n\n[[Page S13853]]\n\nto fulfill deadlines to establish residency in a State. There are \nroughly 20,000 military personnel separated each month. Our section \nallowed them to use the proper discharge forms as a residency waiver \nand vote in person at their new polling site. This brings military \nvoters into their new community quicker. But the House rejected this \nsection as well.\n  The Senate moved to address these problems. The Houses refuses to do \nso. This is an issue I, and those who feel as strongly as I do, such as \nour nation's veteran and active duty service organizations, will \ncontinue to press.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President. I rise to raise some significant concerns \nabout S. 1389, the Homestake Mine Conveyance Act of 2001, which has \nbeen attached to the Department of Defense-Supplemental conference \nreport.\n  This legislation will have serious adverse implications for the \nFederal Government most notably, the National Science Foundation (NSF) \nand the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)--due to its unprecedented \nlegal protections provided to the State and the Homestake Mining \nCompany and its potentially significant budgetary costs.\n  While some modifications to the original have been made to the bill \nto address many of the problematic legal and programmatic issues, these \nchanges were modest at best and the bill as a whole still has \nsignificant legal, budgetary, and policy implications that could \nnegatively impact NSF and EPA. This bill is an improvement over the \noriginal legislation introduced by the senators from South Dakota, but \nit is still problematic and troubling.\n  As the ranking member of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, I \nbelieve in deferring to the scientific expertise and judgment of the \nNSF and its Science Board in determining which projects had scientific \nmerit and deserved funding. The Congress should not be in the business \nof legislating what is scientifically meritorious. The Homestake \nlegislation totally circumvents the merit review process long-\nestablished and followed by the agency.\n  The reality of this matter is that the South Dakota Senators are \nusing NSF as a means to save jobs that will be lost from the closing of \nthe mine. While I appreciate the effort to save people's jobs, it \nshould not be done by undermining the scientific merit review process. \nThis is simply the wrong approach and creates a new, dangerous \nprecedent.\n  Further, the broad indemnification provisions in the bill, even with \nthe proposed modifications, are sweeping. The Federal Government would \nalso be required to provide broad indemnification to both the Homestake \nMining Company and the State for PAST and FUTURE claims related to the \nsite. The sweeping and unprecedented language is in conflict with, and \ngreatly expands, the Federal Government's potential tort liability well \nbeyond provided in the Federal Tort Claims Act. The Federal \nGovernment's liability with respect to environmental claims would also \nbe potentially unlimited. It is unclear whether the bill affects \nHomestake's obligations under court-approved Consent Decrees (CD) that \nthe Federal Government has already entered into. These CDs address \ncertain remediation and natural resource damage claims. There are \nadditional legal issues related to the Anti-Deficiency Act and tort law \nconcerning compensation after the fact of injury.\n  Funding this costly project would also potentially sap funding for \nother current and new initiatives that have scientific merit and which \nthe Congress and Administration fully support. Critically important \nscientific research initiatives such as nanotechnology, information \ntechnology, and biotechnology initiatives may be significantly \nimpaired. Major research projects related to astronomy, engineering, \nand the environment could be cut back or not funded.\n  I hope my colleagues will be sensitized to the dangerous legal, \nbudgetary, and policy implications of the Homestake legislation. I am \nextremely troubled by this legislation and hope that political pressure \ndoes not influence the ultimate outcome of the proposed project in the \nHomestake bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Congress has \nincorporated S. 1389, the Homestake Mine Conveyance Act of 2001, as \namended, into the fiscal year 2002 Department of Defense Appropriations \nconference report.\n  This important legislation will enable the construction of a new, \nworld-class scientific research facility deep in the Homestake Mine in \nLead, SD. Not only will this facility create an opportunity for \ncritical breakthroughs in physics and other fields, it will provide \nunprecedented new economic and educational opportunities for South \nDakota.\n  Just over a year ago, the Homestake Mining Company announced that it \nintended to close its 125-year-old gold mine in Lead, SD, at the end of \n2001. This historic mine has been a central part of the economy of the \nBlack Hills for over a century, and the closure of the mine was \nexpected to present a significant economic blow to the community.\n  In the wake of this announcement, you can imagine the surprise of \nSouth Dakotans to discover that a committee of prominent scientists \nviewed the closure of the mine as an unprecedented new opportunity to \nestablish a National Underground Science Laboratory in the United \nStates. Because of the extraordinary depth of the mine and its \nextensive existing infrastructure, they found that the mine would be an \nideal location for research into neutrinos, tiny particles that can \nonly be detected deep underground, where thousands of feet of rock \nblock out other cosmic radiation.\n  Earlier this year, I met with several of these scientists to \ndetermine how they planned to move forward. They told me they intended \nto submit a proposal to the National Science Foundation for a grant to \nconstruct the laboratory. After a thorough peer review, the National \nScience Foundation would determine whether or not it would be in the \nbest interests of science and the United States for such a laboratory \nto be built. The scientists also explained that since the National \nScience Foundation normally does not own research facilities, the mine \nwould need to be conveyed from Homestake Mining Company to the State of \nSouth Dakota for construction to take place. For the company to be \nwilling to donate the property, and for the state to be willing to \naccept it, both would require the Federal Government to assume some of \nthe liability associated with the property.\n  The purpose of the Homestake Mine Conveyance Act of 2001 is to meet \nthat need. It establishes a process to convey the mine to the State of \nSouth Dakota, and for the Federal Government to assume a portion of the \ncompany's liabilities. This Act will only take effect if the National \nScience Foundation selects Homestake as the site for an underground \nlaboratory. Only property needed for the construction of the lab will \nbe conveyed, and conveyance can only take place after appropriate \nenvironmental reviews and after the Environmental Protection Agency \ncertifies the remediation of any environmental problems. If the mine is \nconveyed, the State of South Dakota will be required to purchase \nenvironmental insurance for the property and set up an environmental \ntrust fund to protect the taxpayers against any environmental liability \nthat may be incurred.\n\n  I believe this process is fair and equitable to all involved. It will \nenable the laboratory to be constructed and the environment to be \nprotected.\n  I am not a scientist, and the decision to build this laboratory must \nbe made by the scientific community. However, it is helpful to review \nsome of the information I have received from the team of scientists \nsupporting this project to better understand why we would take the \nunusual step of conveying a gold mine to a state with federal \nindemnification.\n  Dr. John Bahcall is a scientist at the Institute for Advanced Study \nin Princeton, NJ. He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1998. \nHe is a widely recognized expert in neutrino science and an authority \non the scientific potential of an underground laboratory. Recently, I \nreceived a letter from him explaining the research opportunities \ncreated by an underground laboratory. In the letter, he explained, \n``There are pioneering experiments in the fields of physics, astronomy, \nbiology, and geology that can only be carried out in an environment \nthat is\n\n[[Page S13854]]\n\nshielded from the many competing phenomena that occur on the surface of \nthe earth. These experiments concern such fundamental and applied \nsubjects as: How stable is ordinary matter? What is the dark matter of \nwhich most of our universe is composed? What new types of living \norganisms exist in deep underground environments from which sunlight is \nexcluded? How are heat and water transported underground over long \ndistances and long times?''\n  As Dr. Bahcall's letter makes clear, the laboratory would provide an \nopportunity for a wide variety of important research. For that reason, \nit is receiving strong support in the scientific community. For \nexample, every six to seven years, the Nuclear Science Advisory Board \nand the Nuclear Physics Division of the American Physical Society \ndevelop a Long Range Plan that identifies that the major priorities of \nAmerican nuclear physicists for coming years. After a series of \nmeetings, these scientists ranked the creation of a National \nUnderground Science Laboratory as one of their top priorities in their \nLong Range Plan.\n  In a recent letter to the National Science Foundation, members of the \nNuclear Science Advisory Committee explained their support for the \ncreation of an underground laboratory at Homestake: ``[T]here is \npresently an outstanding opportunity for the United States to assume \nworld leadership at the frontier of underground science through the \nacquisition and development by the National Science Foundation of the \nHomestake mine in South Dakota to create a deep underground (7000 meter \nof water equivalent (m.w.e.)) laboratory. . . . In the last decade, \nfundamental progress has been made in underground experiments in such \ndiverse areas as nucleon decay, atmospheric neutrino oscillations, \nsolar neutrino oscillations, and searches for dark matter. These \nstudies not only have increased our understanding of the fundamental \nproperties of the universe, but have pointed to new and even more \nchallenging frontiers of compelling scientific interest. To explore \nthese frontiers, the next generation of experiments (e.g. solar \nneutrino, double beta decay, etc.) will require a deep underground \nlaboratory to reduce cosmic ray-related backgrounds, which constitute \nthe limiting factor for high sensitivity experiments. A National \nUnderground Science Laboratory at a depth of 7000 m.w.e., at the \nHomestake Mine site would constitute a world class facility, with a \ndedicated infrastructure to insure [sic] U.S. leadership in underground \nstudies well into the next century.''\n\n  While there are two other locations under consideration in the United \nStates for the construction of an underground laboratory, scientists \nhave stated that the Homestake Mine, because of its unique \ncharacteristics, is the best location in the country to conduct this \nresearch. Dr. Wick Haxton of the Institute for Nuclear Theory put \ntogether the team's findings in a report entitled, ``The U.S. National \nUnderground Science Laboratory at Homestake: Status Report and \nUpdate.''\n  I'd like to share some of their report: ``The announcement on \nSeptember 11, 2000, that the historic Homestake Gold Mine would soon \nclose presented a remarkable opportunity for creating a dedicated \nmultipurpose deep underground laboratory in the U.S. Among its \nattributes are:\n  Homestake has very favorable physical properties. It is the deepest \nmine in the U.S. The rock is hard and of high quality: even at depth \nthere is an absence of rock bursts common at sites of comparable depth. \nLarge cavities built at depths of 7400 and 8000 feet have been shown to \nbe stable over periods of a decade or more. The mine is dry, producing \nonly 500 gallons/minute of water throughout its 600 km of drifts.\n  Homestake has shafts that can be adapted to provide unprecedented \nhorizontal access. The replacement cost of the Ross and Yates shafts \nand the No. 6 winze, which access the proposed laboratory site, is \napproximately $300 million. The shaft cross sections are unusually \nlarge, 15 x 28 feet, and the Yates hoist, powered by two 1250 hp \nNordberg motors, can lift nearly 7 tons. This makes it possible to \nlower cargo containers directly to the underground site. Finally, there \nare several existing ventilation shafts as well as an extensive set of \nramps that connect the levels, providing important secondary escape \npaths.\n  Homestake is a site with remarkable flexibility. There are drifts \napproximately every 150 feet in depth, allowing experiments to be \nconducted at multiple levels and opening up possibilities for an \nunusually broad range of science. Coupled with the extensive \nventilation system--including a massive cooling plant with four York \ncompressors and 2300 tons of refrigeration--this allows a wide range of \nexperiments to be mounted, including those involving flammables, \ncryogens, or other substances best sequestered and separately vented.\n  The flexibility to accommodate a very wide range of science is \nimportant because significant advantages will accompany a single \nmultipurpose national laboratory. There are economies of scale in \ninfrastructure and safety, including the development of common \nspecialized facilities (like a low-background counting facility). This \nreduces costs and saves human scientific capital. Concentration also \nproduces a stronger scientific and technical environment. It allows \nsynergisms between disciplines to grow.\n  The proposed principle site of the laboratory is the region at 7400 \nft between the Ross and Yates shafts. The site is accessible now: \nextensive coring studies of the site will be performed to verify its \nsuitability, prior to any expenditures for major construction.\n  The mine is fully permitted for safety and rock disposal on site, and \nis located in a state supportive of mining.\n  The mine includes surface buildings, extensive fiber optics and \ncommunications systems, a large inventory of tools and rolling stock \nthat may be transferable to the laboratory, and skilled engineers, \ngeologists, and miners who know every aspect of the mine.''\n  This is not the first time that Homestake, or other mines, have been \nused to support this kind of research. In fact, underground scientific \nresearch at the Homestake mine dates back to 1965, when a neutrino \ndetector was installed in the underground mine at the 4850-foot level. \nResearch from that experiment is acknowledged as critical to the \ndevelopment of neutrino astrophysics. Similar experiments have \ncontinued in the Soudan mine in Minnesota, and in underground \nlaboratories outside of the United States, leading to important \ndiscoveries and developments in particle physics and theory.\n  As I've stated, the purpose of the legislation passed by the Senate \nis to allow the conveyance of the property needed for the construction \nof the laboratory from Homestake Mining Company to the State of South \nDakota. I'd like to take a moment to explain why it is necessary for \nthe Federal Government to transfer the mine to the State, and to \nindemnify the company and the State in order for this conveyance to \ntake place.\n  The National Science Foundation, which is reviewing a $281 million \nproposal to construct this laboratory, does not operate its own \nresearch facilities. Instead, it provides grants to other entities to \noperate facilities or to conduct experiments. In keeping with this \ntradition, the proposed laboratory would not be owned by the Federal \nGovernment, but instead would need to be operated by an entity other \nthan the NSF. Since it is not practical for the company to retain \nownership of the site as it is converted into a laboratory, Homestake \nexpressed a willingness to donate the underground mine and \ninfrastructure to the State of South Dakota, together with certain \nsurface facilities, structures and equipment that are necessary to \noperate and support the underground mine, provided that it could be \nreleased from liabilities associated with the transfer and the future \noperation of its property as an underground laboratory.\n  Relief from liability is necessary because the construction of the \nlab will require the company to forgo certain reclamation actions that \nit would normally take to limit its liability in the mine. For example, \nin connection with closing the underground mine, Homestake planned to \nremove electric substations, decommission hoists and other equipment, \nturn off the pumps that dewater the mine, and seal all openings. Were \nthe pumps to be turned off, the mine workings would slowly\n\n[[Page S13855]]\n\nfill with water, rendering the mine unusable laboratory.\n  The Act establishes a specific procedure that will be followed in \norder for conveyance to take place and Homestake to be relieved of its \nliability. First, the Act does not become effective unless the National \nScience Foundation selects Homestake Mine as the site for a National \nUnderground Science Laboratory. This means that conveyance procedures \nwill not begin until it is clear that the NSF supports the construction \nof a laboratory. Second, a due diligence inspection of the property \nwill be conducted by an independent entity to identify any condition \nthat may pose an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health \nor the environment. Third, any condition of the mine that meets those \ncriteria must be corrected before conveyance takes place. Homestake may \nchoose to contribute toward any necessary response actions. However, \nSection 4 of this Act includes a provision that limits Homestake's \ncontribution to this additional work, if necessary, to $75 million, \nreduced by the value of the property and equipment that Homestake is \ndonating. In addition, the State, or another person, may also assist \nwith that action. Only after the administration of the Environmental \nProtection Agency has certified that necessary steps have been taken to \ncorrect any problems that are identified can the conveyance proceed.\n  Since some of the steps required to convert the mine into a \nlaboratory go above and beyond normal reclamation, the company is not \nobligated to deliver the property in a condition that is suitable for \nuse as a laboratory. However, those portions of the mine that require \nthe most significant reclamation, including the tailings pond and waste \nrock dumps, are specifically prohibited from being conveyed under this \nAct and will remain Homestake's responsibility to reclaim.\n  Under normal circumstances, the mine would close in March of 2002. \nSince it must be kept open beyond that date to leave open the option to \nconstruct the laboratory, Congress has already appropriated $10 million \nin the VA-HUD Appropriations bill to pay for expenses needed for that \npurpose.\n  It is important that all aspects of the conveyance process be \ncompleted in a timely fashion. To facilitate the construction of the \nlaboratory, the inspections, reports and conveyance will need to \nproceed in phases, with the inspections being initiated after Homestake \nhas completed the reclamation work that may otherwise have been \nrequired. While the Act sets no specific deadline for the completion of \nthese procedures, it is important that the entire process be completed \nin no more than eight months from the date of passage of the Act. The \ntimeframes in the Act for public comment on draft reports and on EPA's \nreview of the report are intended to emphasize the need for timely \naction.\n  S. 1389 also contains important provisions to protect taxpayers from \nany potential liability once the transfer of the mine takes place. \nFirst, South Dakota must purchase property and liability insurance for \nthe mine. It may also require individual experiments to purchase \nenvironmental insurance. Second, the bill requires that South Dakota \nestablish an Environment and Project Trust Fund to finance any future \nclean-up actions that may be required. A portion of annual Operations \nand Maintenance funding must be deposited into the fund, and the state \nmay also require individual projects to make a deposit into the fund. \nThe insurance and trust fund provisions of this bill will help to \nprovide a firewall between the taxpayers and any future environmental \nclean-up that may be required.\n  I want to thank all of those who have been involved in the \ndevelopment of this legislation. I particularly appreciate the hard \nwork and support of Governor Bill Janklow of South Dakota. I also want \nto thank my colleague, Senator Johnson, a cosponsor of this bill, for \nall of his work, particularly to secure the $10 million in transition \nfunds that will bridge the gap between Homestake's closure and the \nestablishment of the laboratory. And, I would like to thank officials \nfrom Homestake and Barrick.\n  This legislation will provide an opportunity for the United States to \nconduct scientific research and will provide important new educational \nand economic opportunities for South Dakota. I thank my colleagues in \nCongress for their support of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both a letter from the Nuclear Science \nAdvisory Committee to the National Science Foundation and a section-by-\nsection analysis of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nFiscal Year 2002 Department of Defense Appropriations Conference Report\n\n\n                  Division E--Miscellaneous Provisions\n\n                   Title I--Homestake Mine Conveyance\n\n     Section-by-Section Analysis\n       Section 101.

While \n     Homestake Mining Company is willing to transfer the mine to \n     the State of South Dakota, both must be indemnified against \n     future liability in order to do so.\n       Section 103. Definitions. Defines the following terms: \n     Administrator, Affiliate, Conveyance, Fund, Homestake, \n     Independent Entity, Laboratory, Mine, Person, Project \n     Sponsor, Scientific Advisory Board and State.\n       The term ``Mine'' refers to the property to be conveyed \n     from Homestake to South Dakota pursuant to the Act. This \n     property consists of only a portion of Homestake's property \n     in Lawrence County, South Dakota. The ``Mine'' is defined to \n     include the underground workings and infrastructure at the \n     Homestake Mine in Lawrence County, South Dakota and all real \n     property, mineral and oil and gas rights, shafts, tunnels, \n     structures, in-mine backfill, in-mine broken rock, fixtures, \n     and personal property to be conveyed for establishment and \n     operation of the laboratory, as agreed upon by Homestake and \n     the State. ``Mine'' is also defined to include any water that \n     flows into the Mine from any source. The real and personal \n     property that is to be conveyed will be subject to further \n     discussions among Homestake, the State and the laboratory. \n     The laboratory has identified parts of the surface, real \n     property, equipment, facilities and structures that will be \n     necessary or useful in the operation of the laboratory. \n     Homestake will determine if the identified property can be \n     included in the conveyance. The definition of ``Mine'' \n     excludes certain features, including the ``Open Cut,'' the \n     tailings storage facility and existing waste rock dumps. \n     These are not part of the ``Mine'' and cannot be conveyed \n     under the Act. Homestake remains responsible for reclamation \n     and closure of all property that is not conveyed under this \n     Act.\n       Section 104. Conveyance of Real Property. The bill \n     establishes several requirements as conditions for \n     conveyance. Once conveyance is approved, the mine is \n     transferred to the state ``as-is'' via a quit-claim deed.\n       Inspection. Prior to the conveyance, the Act provides for a \n     due diligence inspection to be conducted by an independent \n     entity. The independent entity is to be selected jointly by \n     the Administrator of the EPA, the South Dakota Department of \n     Environment and Natural Resources and Homestake. In \n     consultation with the State and Homestake, the Administrator \n     of the EPA will determine the methodology and standards to be \n     used in the inspection, including the conduct of the \n     inspection, the scope of the inspection and the time and \n     duration of the inspection. The purpose of the inspection is \n     to determine whether there is any condition in the Mine that \n     may pose an imminent and substantial endangerment to public \n     health or the environment. The inspection will not attempt to \n     document all environmental conditions at the Mine, and will \n     not inspect or evaluate any environmental conditions on \n     property that is not part of the conveyance.\n       Report. After conducting the inspection, the independent \n     entity must prepare a draft report on its findings that \n     describes the results of its inspection and identifies any \n     condition of or in the mine that may pose an imminent and \n     substantial endangerment to public health or the environment.\n       This draft report must be submitted to the EPA and made \n     available to the public. A public notice must be issued \n     requesting public comments on the draft within 45 days. \n     During the 45-day comment period, the independent entity \n     shall hold at least one public hearing in Lead, South Dakota. \n     After these steps are taken, the independent entity must \n     submit a final report that responds to public comments and \n     incorporates necessary changes.\n       Review to Report. Not later than 60 days after receiving \n     the report, the EPA shall review it and notify the state of \n     its acceptance or rejection of the report. The Administrator \n     may reject the report if one or more conditions are \n     identified that may pose an imminent and substantial \n     endangerment to public health or the environment and require \n     response action before conveyance and assumption by the \n     Federal Government of liability for the mine. The \n     Administrator may also reject the report if the conveyance is \n     determined to be against the public interest.\n       Response Action. If the independent entity's report \n     identifies no conditions that may pose an imminent and \n     substantial threat to human health or the environment, and \n     EPA\n\n[[Page S13856]]\n\n     accepts the report, then the conveyance may proceed. If the \n     report identifies a condition in the Mine that may pose an \n     imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or the \n     environment, then Homestake may, but is not obligated to, \n     carry out or permit the State or other persons to carry out a \n     response action to correct the condition. If the condition is \n     one that requires a continuing response action, or a response \n     action that may only be completed as part of the final \n     closure of the laboratory, then Homestake, the State or other \n     persons must make a deposit into the Environment and Project \n     Trust Fund established in Section 7 that is sufficient to pay \n     the costs of that response action. The amount of the deposit \n     is to be determined by the independent entity, on a net \n     present value basis and taking into account interest that may \n     be earned on the deposit until the time that expenditure is \n     expected to be made. Homestake may choose to contribute \n     toward the response actions. However, Section 4 includes a \n     provision that limits Homestake's contribution to this \n     additional work, if necessary, to $75 million, reduced by the \n     value of the property and equipment that Homestake is \n     donating. Funds deposited into the Fund to meet this \n     requirement may only be expended to address the needs \n     identified in the inspection.\n       Once any necessary response actions have been completed, or \n     necessary funds have been deposited, then the independent \n     entity may certify to the EPA that the conditions identified \n     in the report that may pose an imminent and substantial \n     threat to human health or the environment have been \n     corrected.\n       Final Review. Not later than 60 days after receiving the \n     certification, the EPA must make a final decision to accept \n     or reject the certification. Conveyance may proceed only if \n     the EPA accepts the certification.\n       Section 105. Assessment of Property. Section 5 sets forth \n     the process for valuing the donated property and services. \n     For purposes of determining the amount of Homestake's \n     potential contribution toward response actions identified in \n     Section 4(b)(4)(C), the property being donated by Homestake \n     is to be valued by the independent entity according to the \n     Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisition. To \n     the extent that some property, such as underground tunnels, \n     only has value for the purpose of constructing a laboratory, \n     that entity is directed to include the estimated costs of \n     replacing the facilities in the absence of Homestake's \n     donation, and the cost of replacing any donated equipment. \n     The valuation is to be submitted to the Administrator of the \n     EPA, the state and Homestake in a separate report that is not \n     subject to the procedures in Section 4(b). If it is \n     determined that the conveyance can most efficiently be \n     processed in several phases, then the valuation report is to \n     accompany each of the due diligence reports.\n       Section 106. Liability\n       Assumption of liability. Upon conveyance, the United States \n     shall assume liability for the mine and laboratory. This \n     liability includes damages, reclamation, cleanup of hazardous \n     substances under CERCLA, and closure of the facility. If \n     property transfer takes place in steps, then the assumption \n     of liability shall occur with each transfer for those \n     properties.\n       Liability protection. Upon conveyance, neither Homestake \n     nor the State of South Dakota shall be liable for the mine or \n     laboratory. The United States shall waive sovereign immunity \n     for claims by Homestake and the State, assume this liability \n     and indemnify Homestake against it. However, in the case of \n     any claim against the United States, it is only liable for \n     response costs for environmental claims to the extent that \n     response costs would be awarded in a civil action brought \n     under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Solid \n     Waste Disposal Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \n     Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 or any other Federal \n     environmental law. In addition, claims for damages must be \n     made in accordance with the Federal Tort Claims Act.\n       Exceptions. Homestake is not relieved of liability for \n     workers compensation or other employment-related claims, non-\n     environmental claims that occur prior to conveyance, any \n     criminal liability, or any liability for property not \n     transferred, unless that property is affected by the \n     operation of the lab.\n       Section 107. Insurance Coverage\n       Requirement to Purchase Insurance for mine. To the extent \n     such insurance is available, the state shall purchase \n     property and liability insurance for the mine and the \n     operation of the laboratory to provide coverage against the \n     liability assumed by the United States. The requirement to \n     purchase insurance will terminate if the mine ceases to be \n     used as a laboratory or Operations and Maintenance funding is \n     not sufficient to operate the laboratory.\n       Terms of Insurance. The state must periodically consult \n     with the EPA and the Scientific Advisory Board and consider \n     the following factors to determine the coverage, type and \n     policy limits of insurance: the nature of projects in the \n     laboratory, the cost and availability of commercial \n     insurance, and the amount of available funding. The insurance \n     shall be secondary to insurance purchased by sponsors of \n     individual projects, and in excess of amounts available in \n     the Fund to pay any claim. The United States shall be an \n     additional insured and will have the right to enforce the \n     policy.\n       Funding of insurance purchase. The state may finance the \n     purchase of insurance with funds from the Fund or other funds \n     available to the state, but may not be compelled to use state \n     funds for this purpose.\n       Porject insurance. In consultation with the EPA and the \n     Scientific Advisory Board, the State may require a project \n     sponsor to purchase property and liability insurance for a \n     project. The United States shall be an additional insured on \n     the policy and have the right to enforce it.\n       State insurance. The State shall purchase unemployment \n     compensation insurance and worker's compensation insurance \n     required under state law. The State may not use funds from \n     the Fund for this purpose.\n       Section 108. Environment and Project Trust Fund\n       Establishment of fund. On completion of conveyance, the \n     State shall establish an environment and Project Trust Fund \n     in an interest-bearing account within the state.\n       Capitalization of Fund. There are several streams of money \n     that will capitalize the fund, some of which have \n     restrictions on the way they may be spent.\n       Annual Portion of Operation and Maintenance Spending. A \n     portion of annual O funding determined by the State in \n     consultation with the EPA and the Scientific Advisory Board \n     shall be deposited in the Fund. To determine the annual \n     amount, the State must consider the nature of the projects in \n     the facility, the available amounts in the Fund, any pending \n     costs or claims, and the amount of funding required for \n     future actions to close the facility.\n       Project Fee. The state, in consultation with NSF and EPA, \n     shall require each project to pay an amount into the Fund. \n     These funds may only be used to remove projects from the lab \n     or to pay claims associated with those projects.\n       Interest. All interest earned by the Fund is retained \n     within the Fund.\n       Other funds. Other funds may be received and deposited in \n     the Fund at the discretion of the state.\n       Expenditures from Fund. Funds within the Trust Fund may \n     only be spent for the following purposes: waste and hazardous \n     substance removal or remediation, or other environmental \n     cleanup; removal of equipment and material no longer used or \n     necessary for use with a project or a claim association with \n     that project; purchases of insurance by the State (except for \n     employment related insurance; payments for other costs \n     related to liability; and the closure of the mine.\n       Federal Authority. To the extent the United States is \n     liable, it may direct that amounts in the Trust Fund be \n     applied toward costs it incurs.\n       Section 109. Waste Rock Mixing. If the State, acting in its \n     capacity overseeing the laboratory, determines to dispose of \n     waste rock excavated for the construction of the laboratory \n     on land owned by Homestake that is not conveyed under this \n     legislation, then the State must first receive approval from \n     the Administrator before disposing such rock.\n       Section 110. Requirements for Operation of Laboratory. The \n     laboratory must comply with all federal laws, including \n     environmental laws.\n       Section 111. Contingency. This Act shall be effective \n     contingent upon the selection of the Mine by the National \n     Science Foundation as the site for the laboratory.\n       Section 112. Obligation in the Event of Nonconveyance. If \n     the conveyance does not occur, then Homestake's obligations \n     to reclaim the mine are limited to the requirements of \n     current law.\n       Section 113. Payment and Reimbursement of Costs. The United \n     States may seek payment from the Fund or insurance as \n     reimbursement for costs it incurs as the result of the \n     liability it has undertaken.\n       Section 114. Consent Decrees. Nothing in this title affects \n     the obligation of a party to two existing consent decrees.\n       Section 115. Offset. Offset for title.\n       Section 116. Authorization of appropriations. Such funds as \n     are necessary to carry out the Act are authorized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13856-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13856-S13864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2884\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there is a matter that has some urgency \nassociated with it only because I know the House is waiting to receive \nthe language. So in the interest of expediting consideration of this \nparticular piece of legislation, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nChair lay before the Senate a message from the House on H.R. 2884, that \nthe Senate concur in the amendment of the House with a further \namendment which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, what is 2884?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 2884 is the Victims Relief Fund, the \nlegislation dealing with victims of terrorism.\n  Mr. GRAMM. What is the amendment, Mr. President?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the majority leader for yielding. When the \nSenate unanimously passed this legislation\n\n[[Page S13857]]\n\npreviously, we included waiving income taxes and payroll taxes for \nfamilies of the victims of September 11. The House of Representatives \nin their bill included only income taxes and not payroll taxes.\n  When the House repassed the bill and sent it to us, they included a \nprovision that did not include payroll taxes but set a minimum of \n$10,000 so lower income people would receive some tax refund. The House \nwanted to retain the principle of not waiving payroll taxes but did \nwant to give some refund to low-income families. This was seen as \nagreeable to both sides and fair.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, it \nis my understanding there were additional provisions such as extended \nunemployment, provisions of that nature. Are they in this bill?\n  Let me suggest the absence of a quorum so we could look at that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request that \nis pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, is this the victims relief \nbill, I ask the majority leader?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I answer to the Senator from Montana it is the victims \nrelief bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, \nthere is a disaster in the State of Montana and other higher plain \nStates, which is a drought. I have been seeking agricultural disaster \nassistance. I see that is not going to happen. I ask my friend from \nSouth Dakota if he can assure me that at the first opportunity next \nyear we will take up and consider the agricultural disaster assistance \nbill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Montana for \nhis efforts over the course of the last several months. I have been \nimpressing the Senate to act on disaster relief. Many farmers in South \nDakota share this problem, and I have applauded the efforts made by the \nSenator from Montana. I appreciate his interest and his determination \nto see that it adequately responds to the Great Plains, the Midwest, \nand elsewhere.\n  I assure the Senator from Montana that at the first appropriate \nopportunity we will find a way to address the legislation and find a \nway in which to respond. As he recalls, we did some of that last \nsummer. We had a good debate about how much was necessary. I think the \nSenator from Montana is correct in his observations that there is still \na great deal more to be done. I will work with him to see that that \nhappens.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from South Dakota. \nI add that this bill is very necessary to the victims relief bill, as \nit was reported to the Committee on Finance. I will not belabor it by \ngoing through the provisions. According to the rules, there is not time \nto do so. Suffice to say, this bill must pass in the next several hours \nbecause it will give much-needed relief. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I would like to just say that some of the provisions that \nare not in this bill--first, the victims relief part of the bill is \nvery necessary. We did not want to stand in the way of that. \nOriginally, when the victims relief bill came over to the House, it had \nprovisions to benefit Lower Manhattan. We all know that Lower Manhattan \nis in real trouble because of what happened on September 11. The great \nfear is that businesses, large and small, will leave. The fear factor \nis enormous.\n  Over on the House side, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee \nworked out a package that would help bring some relief. On this side, \nSenator Clinton and I worked out a package that had tremendous support \nin our version of the stimulus bill from the majority leader, as well \nas the chairman of the Finance Committee. We had spent a great deal of \ntime after it looked as though the stimulus bill was not going to \nhappen, starting yesterday, and finishing about an hour and a half ago, \ntrying to come to a compromise between the House version and the Senate \nversion.\n  The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the other body and \nour staffs worked long and hard to come up with the compromise we have \ncome up with. There are a few changes here and there that he might \nlike, I might like, and Senator Clinton might like, and others in New \nYork might like, but we did come to an agreement. Unfortunately, the \nagreement we came to was not able to be reviewed by the Senators in \nthis body. We just came up with it about an hour, hour and a half ago.\n  Unfortunately, because time is late and because the victims package \nhas achieved that agreement, we will not stand in the way and object to \nremoving the New York part from the bill and bringing up this other \nbill.\n  But I say this to my colleagues: We have a tremendous problem in \ndowntown Manhattan. We are getting FEMA relief, and it is working well. \nThe Senator from West Virginia has helped us in other areas. But tax \nrelief to companies, big and small, to individuals, to nonprofits that \ndon't have space right now, or that have space but are wondering \nwhether they can stay in Lower Manhattan, is vital to New York's \nreblooming quickly.\n  I am hopeful that when we come back in January, the package that has \nbeen agreed to and worked on by the chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee and many of his people, Senator Baucus, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Clinton, and myself will serve as a basis for bringing \nsomething up quickly then.\n  We had hoped to get something now. We have come really close--close \nbut no cigar, they say. We are going to try to gain that cigar as soon \nas we come back. But make no mistake about it, we will be back. We very \nmuch need the help, and we appreciate everybody's cooperation to help \nus get there.\n  Mr. LOTT. Has the unanimous consent request been agreed to?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I say to the Members, this final victims \npackage is a good package. I earlier introduced a measure to make sure \nwe included the provisions of S. 1433,which is supported by Senator \nWarner, Senator Campbell, and Senator Craig. I am glad these ideas have \nbeen recognized, that this war we are fighting is against terrorists \nwho target defenseless men, women, and children. The areas in which \nthese attacks occur are combat zones.\n  I am glad this package has been worked out, because the last thing \nthe families of these victims need to be worrying about is paying \ntaxes, whether income taxes or other types of taxes--this bill \naddresses those concerns.\n  While my colleague from New York may want to add some other items to \nthis measure--but at this late hour will not--I commend to my \ncolleagues the fact that the police officers and firefighters who first \nresponded to the World Trade Center attacks, as well as the Pentagon, \nrisked their lives in hazardous conditions, breathing toxic gases, to \nsave the lives of their fellow citizens.\n  In my view, those who are serving in those terrorist attack zones \nought to be looked upon as the same as those who work in combat zones, \nand the taxes of those first responders for that month ought not be \nsubject to income taxes. I am going to work next year to get this \nproper recognition for our firefighters, law enforcement officers, and \nrescue personnel, but I do not want to hold up this good victims' \nrelief package which means a good deal to a lot of families who feel a \nvery big hole in their hearts during this holiday season.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S13858]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Allen, for \nhis comments. I also thank my colleague, Senator Torricelli, for his \nwork and the work we did in the Finance Committee. We also included the \nvictims from the Oklahoma City bombing disaster 6 years ago in which \n189 people lost their lives. Likewise, they should not have to pay \ntaxes for that year or the preceding year. The amount of income is \nalmost de minimis, but it is only fair.\n  I thank my colleagues from New York and New Jersey for their \ncooperation. My colleagues from New York had many additional, very \ninteresting items--accelerated depreciation and other ideas to \nstimulate the economy. We are happy to work with them to try to make \nthat happen in the near future.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support, and I shall not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  If there is no objection, without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe conference report to accompany H.R. 3338 occur immediately \nfollowing the remarks made by the senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the majority leader yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is objection heard?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I seek recognition, but in view of what we \nhave just agreed to, I know the Senator from New Jersey wants to be \nheard. I yield the floor to him.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Republican leader for his \ncourtesy. I want to say a word of thanks to all of my colleagues. I was \nproud to have offered this provision in the Finance Committee and again \non the Senate floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair needs to ascertain if there is \nobjection to the preceding unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is withdrawn. Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  The Chair laid before the Senate a message from the House, as \nfollows:\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives:\n\n  Resolved, That the House agree to the amendments of the Senate to the \nbill (H.R. 2884) entitled ``An Act to amend the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to provide tax relief for victims of the terrorist attacks \nagainst the United States on September 11, 2001'', with the following \nHouse amendment to senate amendments:\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted by the Senate \n     amendment to the text of the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

I express my thanks to Senator Daschle, Senator Lott, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Grassley, Senator Nickles, and so many Members \nof the Senate who made this possible. I know during this Christmas \nseason that the plight and distress of the families of those who lost \ntheir lives in Virginia, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania will be \nin all of our thoughts. That really is not enough.\n  Charities have raised an enormous amount of money, but it has not \ngotten to the victims' families. There is a victims' fund this \nGovernment has raised, but it has not yet gotten to these victims' \nfamilies. This tax relief offers real and immediate benefits. It has \nthe promise that as American citizens give funds to charities, the \nfunds from those charities will not in turn be taxed as they get to the \nwidows, the parents, or other relatives. It holds the promise that \nthere will be a refund given to many of these families.\n  Offering financial relief is little solace given such enormous pain, \nbut it is of some help. Families who have buried their loved ones are \nalso paying mortgages, tuition, and buying groceries. This is real \nhelp.\n  I am grateful to the Members of the Senate who have helped pass this \nlegislation. I am grateful to Chairman Thomas of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee who has been with us as an architect in its passage.\n  I express on behalf of all the families for whom this means so much \nin this holiday season their gratitude to all of you who have made this \npossible. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I thank both Senators from New Jersey \nfor their extraordinary work in getting us to this point. This was not \neasy, and I am grateful to them for their persistence, their \nleadership, and their efforts. This would not have happened were it not \nfor their direct involvement to this moment. I say the same to the \nSenators from New York for the tremendous work they have done assisting \nus in getting to this point as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I will be brief because I know we want to \nfinish up the debate on the Defense appropriations conference report \nand get a recorded vote. There are Senators who would like that to \noccur sooner rather than later, so I will not belabor the point.\n  I am glad we worked out the agreement on the victims' disaster of \nSeptember 11. I appreciate the cooperation all the way around. One can \ntell by the discussion that one of the reasons some of these other \nmeritorious items were not added is that once we had one, there would \nbe two, three, four, and we could not get all those worked out in the \nshort time we had, and we stood the chance of losing the victims' tax \nprovisions. I am glad we did that.\n  Also, I understand many of these provisions, including the New York \nprovision, are in the stimulus package that has been voted on by the \nHouse. We are going to eventually get a stimulus package, and I hope \nand expect that provision will be in the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I, too, thank the Senate and the leadership of \nSenator Daschle, Senator Lott, the chairman of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, Senator Baucus, and others who have worked with us to allow \nthis victims' relief effort to come to pass.\n  Nothing can be more sincere and heartfelt during this holiday season \nthan to respond with this legislation for families who have lost so \nmuch.\n  I thank the Senate for its efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13864-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13864-S13865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002--CONFERENCE REPORT--\n                               Continued\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

There have been a lot of great ideas on both sides of the \naisle as to how we could improve it or change it. You have been \ntenacious, you stuck with it, and you produced a good piece of \nlegislation that is important for our country, important for our men \nand women in uniform.\n  This very morning the President called and said he was pleased with \nthe result and he appreciates the leadership the Senate gave in this \narea.\n\n[[Page S13865]]\n\n  I commend all of you, Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and Senator \nByrd, for the work that has been done here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I concur in the comments made by the \nRepublican leader. We should note that this completes our work on all \n13 appropriations bills. I commend both the chair and the ranking \nmember for their work in getting us to this point. This was not easy, \nespecially this year. It would not have happened were it not for the \ntremendous effort made by each of the subcommittee chairs. I note \nespecially the efforts of the Senator from Hawaii on the Defense \nappropriations bill, the largest of all bills with which we had to \ncontend.\n  I congratulate them. I thank them. I note, again, the great work they \nhave done in getting us to this point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13865-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3210\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I have a unanimous consent request to \npropound at this time. There will be many other unanimous consent \nrequests made over the course of this afternoon. We will certainly \nnotify Senators as they are propounded so that those who have an \ninterest in a particular issue can be in the Chamber when we make them. \nLet me begin.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 252, H.R. \n3210, and the only amendment in order be a Dodd-Sarbanes-Schumer \nsubstitute amendment, that the substitute be considered and agreed to, \nthe bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object--I will \nobject--I have a different approach in mind on this which I would like \nto propound.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, the Republican leader and I have agreed \nthat we would keep the remarks involving these unanimous consent \nrequests to a minimum at this point to accommodate those Senators who \nare still waiting to speak on the Defense appropriations conference \nreport. I would like to respect our earlier commitment to them that \nthey would have the opportunity to make their remarks. But we will \ncertainly entertain these unanimous consent requests without extended \ncomments. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in that regard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was simply going to suggest that he modify his \nunanimous consent request. I was not going to make a speech.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to entertain the modification.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was going to suggest the majority leader modify his \nunanimous consent request to adopt one amendment on each side with \nregard to liability only.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I appreciate the recommendation and \nproposal made by the Senator from Kentucky. I know this has been the \nsubject of a good deal of discussion. There is no doubt the issue of \nliability will be a matter that will have to be addressed. But if we \nopen it up to any amendment at this late hour, there is little \nlikelihood we can complete our work in time for us to be able to go to \nconference before the holidays begin.\n  For that reason, I would have to object.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13865-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3529\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3529, which is the stimulus \npackage received from the House. I further ask unanimous consent that \nthere be 60 minutes for debate equally divided in the usual form; \nfurther, I ask that at the expiration or yielding back of that time, \nthe bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on \npassage of the bill, with points of order waived.\n  Before the Chair rules on this unanimous consent request, I add that \nif there is any additional debate time--if 2 or 3 hours would be \nneeded--I will certainly amend my unanimous consent request to \naccommodate more debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I offer an alternative and make it a \nproposal that we amend the unanimous consent request made by the \ndistinguished Republican leader as the following: That the amendment \ninclude a substitute amendment that I have at the desk which would \nextend unemployment insurance coverage for 13 weeks, and that the bill, \nas amended, be read a third time and passed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nmake sure I understand the proposal: That we would not have a vote on \nthat addition but to just include it in the package. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we have already indicated, of course, \nto all of our colleagues that we would not have any additional rollcall \nvotes today. We would have to accommodate this request with simply a \nvoice vote on the substitute.\n  Basically, what we are suggesting is that since we cannot reach \nagreement on the overall economic stimulus, the one piece for which \nthere is general agreement is the need to extend unemployment \ninsurance. We did it three times in the early 1990s, recognizing that \nthe limited regular benefit period of time was inadequate for a lot of \nthose who are out of work.\n  Again, without getting into extended remarks, I would simply, by \nexplanation, note that would be the intent of this unanimous consent \nrequest, which is to substitute economic stimulus with the 13-week \nextension.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, under those conditions, I would have to \nobject.\n  Let me just say that if we can set it up in a way to have a rollcall \nvote on that rather than a voice vote to make that very substantial \nchange, I think we need to do both, and therefore I would have to \nobject to that modification.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, pursuant to the unanimous consent \nagreement, I would like to proceed with my statements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I am happy to rise today to offer my \nunqualified support for the conference agreement on H.R. 3338, the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  I am pleased to present the recommendations to the Senate today, as \ndivision A of this bill.\n  The recommendations contained herein are the result of lengthy \nnegotiations between the House and Senate managers and countless hours \nof work by our staffs acting on behalf of all members.\n  The agreement provides $317.2 billion, the same as the House and \nSenate levels, consistent with our 302b allocations.\n  As in all conference agreements, neither side, nor any individual \nmember had every issue go his or her way. It represents a compromise.\n  It is one that protects the interests of both houses while clearly \nmeeting our national defense reponsibilities.\n  For the information of all Senators, I should point out that the bill \nprovides more funding for our men and women in uniform than was \nrecommended by either body.\n  I want to note to all my collegues that this would not have been \npossible without the tremendous cooperation that I have received from \nSenator Stevens and his able staff led by Steve Cortese with Ms. \nMargaret Ashworth, Kraig Siracuse, Alycia Farrell, and Mr. John Kem, on \ndetail from DOD.\n\n[[Page S13866]]\n\n  The Senate owes all of them a debt of gratitude. I want to also note \nthe efforts of my staff, Charlie Houy, David Morrison, Gary Reese, \nSusan Hogan, Tom Hawkins, Bob Henke, Lesley Kalan, and Mazie Mattson \nwho have devoted so much time to preparing the committee's \nrecommendations for this bill.\n  The Defense appropriations bill as recommended by the conference \ncommittee provides a total of $317,623,747,000 in budget authority for \nmandatory and discretionary programs for the Department of Defense. \nThis amount is $1,923,633,000 below the President's request.\n  The recommended funding is below the President's request by nearly $2 \nbillion because the Congress has already acted to reallocate $500 \nmillion for military construction and $1.2 billion for nuclear energy \nprograms under the jurisdiction of the Energy Water Subcommittee.\n  The total discretionary funding recommended in division A of this \nbill is $317,206,747,000. This is less than $2 million below the \nsubcommittee's 302B allocation.\n  This measure is consistent with the objectives of this administration \nand the Defense Authorization Conference Report which passed the \nSenate.\n  In addition, we believe we have accommodated those issues identified \nby the Senate which would enhance our nation's defense while allowing \nus to stay within the limits of the budget resolution.\n  Our first priority in this bill is to provide for the quality of life \nof our men and women in uniform.\n  In that vein, we have fully funded a five percent pay raise for every \nmilitary member as authorized.\n  We recommend additional funding for targeted pay raises for those \ngrades and particular skills which are hard to fill.\n  We believe these increases will significantly aid our ability to \nrecruit, and perhaps more importantly, retain much needed military \npersonnel.\n  We have also provided $18.4 billion for health care costs. This is \n46.3 billion more than appropriated in FY 2001 and nearly $500 million \nmore than requested by the president.\n  This funding will ensure that tricare costs are fully covered.\n  It will also increase our military hospital funding to better provide \nfor their patients and, by providing funding for ``TRICARE FOR LIFE'', \nwe fulfill a commitment made to our retirees over 65.\n  This will ensure that those Americans who were willing to dedicate \ntheir lives to the military will have quality health care in their \nolder years.\n  This is most importantly an issue of fairness.\n  It fulfills the guarantee our nation made to the men and women of our \nmilitary when they were on active duty.\n  We also believe it will signal to those willing to serve today that \nwe will keep our promises. In no small part we see this as another \nrecruiting and retention program.\n  In title two, the bill provides $105 billion for readiness and \nrelated programs. This is $8.2 billion more than appropriated for \nfiscal year 2001. The bill reallocates funding from the Secretary of \nDefense to the military services for the costs of overseas deployments \nin the Balkans.\n  This is the way the Pentagon funds the Middle East deployments. The \nconferees have agreed to leave a small amount in the appropriation for \nunforeseen emergencies.\n  For our investment in weapons and other equipment, the recommendation \nincludes $60.9 billion for procurement, nearly $500 million more than \nrequested by the President. The funding here will continue our efforts \nto recapitalize our forces.\n  The agreement fully supports the Army's transformation goals and \npurchases much needed aircraft, missiles and space platforms for the \nAir Force.\n  For the Navy, the bill provides full funding for those programs that \nare on track and ready to move forward.\n  In the case of shipbuilding, the conferees strongly support the need \nto address our growing shortfalls in ship construction. The agreement \nprovides more funding that in either House or Senate bill and $150 more \nthan requested.\n  In some cases, contract delays have allowed the conferees to \nrecommend reallocating funds for other critical requirements.\n  Included in that, the committee has recommended $700 million for \nprocurement to support our national guard and reserve forces.\n  The conference funds 10 UH-60 helicopters for the National Guard and \nArmy Reserve. It also provides four C-130's for our Air National Guard \nand Reserves.\n  The agreement adds funding for additional trainer aircraft for the \nNavy. It fully funds the requirements for the F-22, the JSF and the F/\nA-18.\n  In funding for future investment for research and development, the \nmeasure recommends $48.9 billion, nearly $1.5 billion more than the \namounts appropriated for fiscal year 2001. Regarding missile defense, \nthe bills is very close to the level requested by the President.\n  Last week, the Pentagon announced that it was terminating the Navy' \narea wide missile defense program. Additionally, we were informed that \nthe Pentagon is restructuring its space based on infrared--low program. \nThese two adjustments allowed the conferees to reduce funding for \nmissile defense.\n  However, similar to the provision in the Senate and the authorization \nbill, the committee provides $478 million in additional funding that \ncan be used for counter terrorism programs.\n  This is a balanced bill that supports the priorities of the \nadministration and the Senate.\n  In order to cut spending by nearly $2 billion, some difficult \ndecisions were required. The bill reduces funding for several programs \nthat have been delayed or are being reconsidered because of the \nsecretary's strategic review, the nuclear posture review, and the \nquadrennial defense review.\n  The bill also makes adjustments that are in line with the reforms \nchampioned by the administration:\n  A concerted effort was made at reducing reporting requirements in the \nbill;\n  The bill also reduces funding for consultants and other related \nsupport personnel as authorized by the Senate.\n  As requested, the bill provides $100 million for DOD to make \nadditional progress in modernizing its financial management systems.\n  Finally, the bill places a cap on legislative liaison personnel which \nthe Secretary of Defense has indicated are excessive.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to discuss an item that some have \nmis-characterized.\n  The bill provides discretionary authority to the Defense Department \nto lease tankers to replace the aging KC-135 fleet. This is a program \nthat is strongly endorsed by the Air Force as the most cost effective \nway to replace our tankers.\n  Despite what has been claimed, the language in the bill requires that \nthe lease can only be entered into if the Air Force can show that it \nwill be 10 percent cheaper to lease the aircraft than to purchase them. \nIn addition, it stipulates that the aircraft must be returned to the \nmanufacturer at the end of the lease period.\n  No business sector has suffered more from the events of 9-11 than has \nour commercial aircraft manufacturers. The tragic events of that day \nhave drastically reduced orders for commercial aircraft.\n  We have been informed that Boeing, for example, will have to lay off \napproximately 30,000 people as a direct consequence of the terrorist \nattack. We have provided funding to support the aircraft manufacturers \nas a result of that tragedy.\n  We are including funds elsewhere in this bill to help in the recovery \nin New York and the Pentagon. The leasing authority which we have \nincluded in Division A allows us to help assist commercial airline \nmanufacturers while also solving a long-term problem for the Air Force.\n  I strongly endorse this initiative which was crafted by my good \nfriend Senator Stevens with the support of several other Members, \nincluding Senators Cantwell, Murray, Roberts, and Durbin. I believe it \ndeserves the unanimous support of the Senate.\n  Today is December 20th. Nearly one quarter of the fiscal year has \npassed.\n  The Defense Department is operating under a continuing resolution \nwhich significantly limits its ability to efficiently manage its \nfunding.\n  I don't need to remind any of my colleagues that we have men and \nwomen\n\n[[Page S13867]]\n\nserving half way around the world defending us.\n  Less than one percent of Americans serve in today's military. These \nfew are willing to sacrifice themselves for us. They deserve our \nsupport.\n  One hundred days ago our Nation was shocked and hurt by a surprise \nattack. This is the bill, Mr. President, that allows us to respond to \nthat attack.\n  It is also the measure we need to show our military forces that we \nsupport them.\n  This bill is urgently needed to fight and win this war and to \ndemonstrate to the world our resolve.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I add my congratulations to the chairman \nof the subcommittee and the ranking member for their hard work on a \nvery important piece of legislation.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nby Air Force Chief of Staff John Jumper and Secretary of the Air Force \nJames Roche basically explaining in detail their need for the 767 \ntanker fleet and why the activities and events after September 11 have \naccelerated the interest in the replacement options that were a part of \nthis legislation.\n\n                                                December 18, 2001.\n     Editor-in-Chief,\n     The Washington Post,\n     Washington, DC.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Dear Editor: Robert Novak's Dec 16, 2001 column, ``Boeing \n     Boondoggle,'' wrongly implies the Air Force doesn't have a \n     position on leasing Boeing 767s for use as tanker aircraft. \n     Our position, previously explained to Mr. Novak, is clear: we \n     need to modernize our aging tanker fleet, and we owe it to \n     our warfighters and taxpayers to consider all reasonable \n     options, including leasing or buying 767s.\n       Air refueling enables America to project power anywhere in \n     the world. Today, in the US-led global war on terrorism, that \n     mission is mostly done with an aircraft designed and first \n     built during the Eisenhower administration. We have flown \n     more than 3500 refueling sorties in Operation Enduring \n     Freedom and more than 2700 refueling sorties in support of \n     air patrols over American cities since the September 11 \n     attacks. These operations, along with a mission focus on \n     homeland security, are forcing the Air Force to assess \n     accelerating replacement options.\n       Incorporating new 767 aircraft into our fleet will \n     dramatically enhance America's aerial refueling capability. \n     Benefits include increased fuel offload, near-term aircraft \n     availability, and mission realiability--all with far lower \n     support costs. The 767 has also attracted the interest of \n     Italy and Japan, allies with similar needs.\n       Should Congress approve a leasing option to put new tankers \n     in service, we will analyze business conditions and determine \n     the most cost-effect modernization path available. Leasing \n     may enable the Air Force to avoid significant up-front \n     acquisition cash outlays, and it could allow us to accelerate \n     retirement of the oldest, least reliable tankers in the \n     fleet, saving more than $3 billion in repair and maintenance \n     costs. If a cost-benefit analysis favors another approach, we \n     would pursue that alternative.\n       America's air refueling fleet is indispensable, and \n     modernization is essential to future mission success. The 767 \n     is the right platform to jumpstart tanker modernization, and \n     we are committed to leveraging our resources to make the best \n     overall arrangement for our citizens.\n\n     John P. Jumper,\n       General, USAF, Chief of Staff.\n     James G. Roche,\n       Secretary of the Air Force.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record information about how the DOD process for \nreviewing the need for the 767 tanker replacement was started over 2 \nyears ago, culminating in a report and analysis of, February 2001 that \nthese tankers were in fact needed and not done behind closed doors but \nthe process was followed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record. as follows:\n\n       Planning for the Air Force replacement of its KC-135 tanker \n     fleet has been ongoing for years. The DoD's Joint \n     Requirements Oversight Committee (JROC) has validated a \n     Mission Needs Statement for this replacement, culminating a \n     two year DoD review process.\n       In response, Boeing in February of 2001 submitted a \n     proposal to the Air Force for the purchase of new 767 \n     tankers--this is neither a new, nor a ``behind closed doors'' \n     issue.\n       The Air Force Secretary and Chief of Staff have been \n     visible and vocal (letters, press statements) is their \n     support for the need to begin to modernize the tanker fleet. \n     More specifically, they have been clear on the desirability \n     of leasing 767 tankers in order to get them deployed (and old \n     high cost tankers retired) in operationally significant \n     quantities and within projected budgets over the next decade.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise because we have passed the 13th \nconference report on the 13 appropriations bills.\n  As we prepare to return to our home States, everyone here in the \nChamber and everyone in the Senate can find some aspect of the \nconference report on Defense to which to object.\n  In the end, what we have to do is consider the work as a whole--as a \ncomplete body of work--and make our judgments on it as not any one \nsingle item or issue but the whole notion of how we protect our \nNation's interests across the globe. On that, this measure deserves my \nsupport, and has gotten my support, and obviously the support of a \nmajority of our colleagues.\n  As we dispose of the conference report on the Defense appropriations \nbill, I regret that we leave behind other issues involving security for \nour country at home. I want to mention those today.\n  I hope before we adjourn at the end of this day, we will have had the \nopportunity to bring to this floor several measures that will be \nbrought up by unanimous consent, and I hope with no objection. One of \nthose deals with the security of our ports. As it turns out, for the \nhundreds of ports across and around our Nation where ships travel in \nand out of them every single week, the security we provide for those \nports and for the people who live in the areas around those ports is \ninadequate.\n  The opportunity for someone to bring terrorist devices into our ports \nand into heavily populated areas possibly is very real. It is one that \nwe currently do not address well, and we need to.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee, under the leadership of Senator \nHollings, has reported out legislation, I believe unanimously, on port \nsecurity. It needs to come before this body and to be considered before \nwe ultimately adjourn.\n  Secondly, on the issue of airport security, aircraft security has \nbeen debated and I think satisfactorily addressed by the House and \nSenate and by the President.\n  Many people in this part of the country, and around the country, \ntravel by railroad. We leave undone, at least at this moment, issues \nthat ought to be addressed with respect to rail security, the security \nof people who are traveling on railroads as passengers around our \nNation.\n  Again, the Commerce Committee, under the leadership of Senator \nHollings, has reported out, I believe unanimously, legislation dealing \nwith rail security. It is an important issue, and not just for those of \nus in the Northeast corridor; it is an important issue for our Nation. \nAnd we know, as the Presiding Officer does, there are hundreds of \nthousands of people who travel literally every day through tunnels that \ngo in and out of New York, under Baltimore, and under this city that \nare not too secure, are not well ventilated or well lit, and are not \nwell protected.\n  This measure would help to address that, along with better \nsurveillance of our bridges, providing better and more adequate \nsecurity aboard our trains. My hope is that before we leave this day, \nbefore the Senate sets this day, we will have taken up this measure by \nunanimous consent and approve it in the Senate.\n  There was objection a few moments ago to another unanimous consent \nrequest which was made with respect to antiterrorism reinsurance. Other \nnations around the globe have been the target of terrorist attacks, and \ndamage has been suffered from those attacks for many years. For us, \nfortunately, the experience of September 11 had never visited this \ncountry before. We have not had to trouble ourselves with determining \nhow we provide adequately for insurance in the event of a terrorist \nattack.\n  Other countries deal with this differently. In Israel and the United \nKingdom, which have had terrorist attacks\n\n[[Page S13868]]\n\nfor many years, those countries have their own approach. In Israel, for \nexample, the country provides the insurance for the terrorist attacks. \nThe Banking Committee and the Commerce Committee both have sought to \ncraft legislation to say there ought to be a backstop with respect to \nantiterrorism legislation, that initially the insurance companies \nthemselves should put up money and absorb the losses, to the tune of \n$10 or $15 billion, but after that there should be a sharing of the \ncosts that grow out of terrorist attacks. The Federal Government should \nshare that. It is unfortunate we were not able to proceed with this \nlegislation today, and it is imperative we take it up as soon as we \nreturn.\n  The last point is with respect to other unfinished business. When \nterrorists attacked us on September 11, they didn't just take people's \nlives in New York, the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania; they struck a \nbody blow to our economy. We are still reeling, to some extent, from \nthat body blow. The work of the Federal Reserve on monetary policy \nhelps us with respect to that body blow.\n  The fact that energy prices have fallen so much helps us with respect \nto that body blow. The fact that we are spending, frankly, a lot of \nmoney with deficit spending, in order to fight terrorism here and \nacross the country and around the world, provides stimulus to the \neconomy and helps to reduce the length of time under which we will \nlikely have a recession.\n\n  There is one other thing we could have done, and ought to have done, \nbesides the terrorism reinsurance proposal that has been objected to, \nand that was to pass an economic recovery plan. That, I think, had \nbroad bipartisan support by Democrats and Republicans. It would have \naccelerated depreciation and gotten businesses back into the business \nof making capital investment. It would have provided a payroll tax \nholiday for businesses and employees as well. It would have provided \nextensions of unemployment insurance and helped folks on the health \ninsurance side. It would have helped States that are reeling at this \npoint in time. Unfortunately, we have not had the opportunity to debate \nthat today and to pass a true bipartisan plan.\n  So we go home with half a loaf. We go home with half a loaf, but, as \nthe Presiding Officer knows, we will come back next month. And as we \ncome back next month, my hope is, if we have not dealt satisfactorily \nwith railroad security and port security today, if we have not dealt \nwith antiterrorism reinsurance today, as it appears we will not, that \nonce we return we will take that up.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when I complete \nmy request for the unanimous consent, the Senator from West Virginia be \nrecognized. He has time under the previous bill already, but I would \nlike him to be recognized as soon as I finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Reserving the right to object, I have one unanimous \nconsent request I would like to make regarding an immigration bill \nbefore, if possible, the Senator from West Virginia speaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, the Senators may be unaware, \nbut under the previous order, I was to be recognized after the vote; \nright?\n  Mr. REID. Right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was the understanding of the Chair that \nSenators Inouye and Stevens were to be recognized after the vote. And \nthe Senator agreed to delay his statement, but the time had not been \nallotted to him specifically.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I know what my rights are, and I know what \nthe order said. I just have not pressed my rights. But I have no \nobjection to the Senator making his request.

Is there objection to proceeding to the \nmeasure at this time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I shall not object. I thank my colleague from West \nVirginia for his patience and tolerance, and also my colleague from \nNevada for his assistance in moving this forward, as well as Senator \nDaschle and Senator Lott. And I congratulate Senator Frist and Senator \nKennedy for the work they have done in putting together this bipartisan \nBioterrorism Preparedness Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to proceeding to this \nmeasure at this time?\n  Without objection, the Senate will proceed to the measure.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say also that the Senator from West \nVirginia and I worked very hard on homeland security, which featured a \nlot of these matters in this legislation that will quickly be approved. \nAnd it was real money. This is not; this is an authorization. I am glad \nwe are going to get this, but it would have been better had we done \nSenator Byrd's bill and mine.\n  Mr. President, I understand Senators Frist, Kennedy, and Gregg have a \nsubstitute amendment at the desk, which is the text of S. 1765. I ask \nunanimous consent that the amendment be considered and agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, that the bill, as amended, \nbe read three times and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. I do not know \nwhat this bill is about.\n  Mr. REID. Did the Senator from West Virginia hear my statement I just \nmade?\n  Mr. BYRD. I could hardly hear anything, as a matter of fact.\n  Mr. REID. What I did say, I say to Senator Byrd, is that this is the \nauthorization on which Senators Kennedy and Frist have worked. And I \ndid say that the legislation you offered--with me being second in \ncharge of that legislation--was real money, appropriated money, which \nwould have done these things that this only authorizes. I am glad this \nis going to be authorized, but it is too bad we are not here \ncelebrating real money for the people.\n  Mr. BYRD. I object to this bill. I object to this being considered at \nthis time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my consent to \nlay this bill down be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will just state to my friend and \ncolleague from West Virginia, he is very much my friend, and I know he \nhas a Defense appropriations speech, and I look forward to hearing his \ncomments on that, and then I look forward to working with him to kind \nof show him some of the provisions on which Senators Frist, Kennedy, \nand Gregg, and others have worked. I believe there are 75 or more \ncosponsors on this bill. I think it is a good bill, a bipartisan bill, \nstrongly supported by both sides.\n  I will work with my colleague from West Virginia to acquaint him with \nthat. I hope and expect we can pass it a little later this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton).

Mr. President, I have been more than patient. Under the \nmajority leader's order earlier, I was to\n\n[[Page S13869]]\n\nhave spoken on this subject, the Defense Department appropriations \nbill. Under his order, I was to be recognized after the vote so as to \naccommodate Senators that they might catch their planes.\n  Now there were other consents offered which I heard. I didn't object \nto them, but I believe the record will show that I was to be recognized \nimmediately after the vote for the statement which I wanted to make on \nthe homeland defense section of the DOD appropriations bill. I have \nbeen very patient.\n  I understand the problems of the two leaders. I have been majority \nleader before I have been minority leader, and I have been majority \nwhip. I understand all their problems. This is the end of the year. \nEverybody wants to get away for Christmas. I don't want to interject \nmyself in between someone's wish to catch a plane. But I have been very \npatient. I have let other consent orders come up without objecting \nbecause my speech isn't all that important. But I wanted to make it.\n  Now we are hearing consents offered for bills. I don't know who is \nwatching the place on this bill. The distinguished Senator from Kansas \nis going to make a request on a bill. I want to be here when he makes \nit. He is entitled to make his request. But time is fast fleeting when \nthis Senator is going to stand aside and just continue to wait and let \neverybody else speak, let everybody else object to the order of \nspeaking, and just stand aside and let it be done.\n  That is not a big thing. It won't change the history of the world one \nway or the other. But I just want to say this: Next year, the chairman \nof the Senate Appropriations Committee is not going to stand aside for \nevery other Senator's convenience in times like this.\n  I shall proceed.\n  The Senate has considered the conference report for the fiscal year \n2002 Defense Department appropriations bill. It is a good bill, but it \ncould have been much better. As Senators are aware, included in this \nlegislation is the final allocation of the $40 billion emergency \nsupplemental funding approved by this Senate just 3 days after the \ntragic attacks on the World Trade Center Towers and on the Pentagon. \nQuite simply, we wanted to respond to the attacks that occurred on \nSeptember 11 and take steps to prevent attacks from occurring in the \nfuture. We didn't just want to respond to the attacks that had already \noccurred, but we wanted to take steps that could prevent attacks from \noccurring in the future.\n  Just a few days ago, the Senate had before it a broader package, one \nthat fulfilled the $20 billion commitment made by the President and the \nCongress to New York and the other attacked communities; one that \nprovided the Defense Department with substantial funding for its \nmission overseas--we wanted to give the President every dollar he asked \nfor, $21 billion--and one that met the many pressing needs for our \nhomeland defense: Improved hospital capacity to respond to terrorist \nattacks, wide distribution of smallpox vaccine, more border agents, \nimproved safety at airports and train stations, safer mail, better \ntrained and equipped police and firefighters.\n  That package, which was supported by a majority of this Senate in \ndirect response to the September 11 disaster, succumbed to partisan \npolitics. It fell when Republicans in this Chamber raised a procedural \n60-vote point of order against the provision because they believed it \nwas too expensive. They were within their rights to object. They were \nwithin their rights to propose a 60-vote point of order. But I don't \nunderstand how we can place an arbitrary price tag on protecting the \nsafety of our citizens.\n\n  Never in my memory can I recall a time when Congress became so \npartisan over a disaster response, whether it be from earthquakes, \nfloods, tornados, fires, never before can I remember our lining up so \nrigidly along political party lines when it came to providing the \nAmerican people with funds to recover from disaster.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate minority and the White House used the 60-\nvote point of order against the homeland defense package. As I say, \nthey have a perfect right to make that point of order. That is within \nthe rules.\n  We all recognize that you can't beat 60 votes when you only have 51 \nat most on this side. Our Republican friends didn't want to help us get \nthe 60 votes. So it must be dismaying to the people who have heard so \nmuch about the pledges of bipartisanship, so much about a new tone in \nWashington, to see what should have been a united, bipartisan approach \nto defending our homeland dissolve into a partisan dispute.\n  That is truly a shame. Since that vote, however, we have stepped back \nand worked on the smaller compromise plan that is before the Senate \nthis afternoon. While it is not as comprehensive as the plan first \nproposed earlier this month, the allocation of the $20 billion \nemergency supplemental funding in this legislation provides support and \nresources that are needed right now for homeland defense, for national \nsecurity, and for the recovery of New York City and the other \ncommunities directly affected by the September 11 attacks.\n  For those communities, the supplemental provides $8.2 billion. This \nbrings the total commitment to the recovery effort to $11.2 billion, \nwhen previously released funds are included. The bulk of this funding, \n$4.35 billion, will fund debris removal at the World Trade Center site, \nrepair public infrastructure such as the damaged subways and commuter \ntrains, and assist individuals with expenses for housing, burial, and \nrelocation. Another $2 billion will work to restore the economic health \nof the area.\n  This funding, to be provided in the form of community development \nblock grants, will give businesses a much needed hand as they attempt \nto recover from the terrorist attacks. Other funding will improve \nsecurity at transportation hubs and reimburse hospitals in New York \nthat provided critical care on September 11 and for many days after.\n  Some of the money will help children who continue to be haunted by \nthe ghosts of the terrorist attacks. As do the businesses and the \ncommunities, these children need to be made whole again. This money \nwill assist in that effort.\n  As part of this supplemental allocation, the Defense Department will \nreceive an additional $3.5 billion. When included with the funding in \nthe regular Defense Appropriations bill, the Pentagon will receive a \n$43 billion increase over last year. This is the single largest one-\nyear increase in Defense spending in more than two decades. It gives \nthe military the resources necessary to battle terrorism overseas. It \nmakes sure that our brave men and women who put themselves in harm's \nway will not fall short because of fiscal constraints. This package \nalso provides for $775 million for repairs and reconstruction efforts \nat the Pentagon. As we rebuild Lower Manhattan, we must also repair the \nPentagon.\n  Finally, we have provided in this allocation $8.3 billion for defense \nefforts here at home. In the days and weeks that have followed the \nterrorist attacks, committees on both sides of this Capitol have heard \nfrom experts, from federal, state, and local officials, and from \nregular Americans who are concerned for their safety at home. We cannot \nignore the gaps in our homeland defenses. We cannot put off until \ntomorrow investments that must be made today. The $8.3 billion for \nhomeland defense that is included in this legislation takes immediate \nsteps to bolster our local police and fire departments. It provides \ncritical funding to expand hospital capacity and to train doctors and \nnurses on what to do in case of a biological, chemical, or nuclear \nattack. The funding closes some of the holes in our Northern Border and \nin our seaports. Under the leadership of the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Mr. Holdings, we had $50 billion for port security. \nThese things were knocked out under that 60-vote point of order. We are \nnot going to forget that. It provides funds for improved cockpit \nsecurity, to hire additional sky marshals and to purchase explosives \ndetection equipment. It provides funds for the Postal Service to \nprotect postal workers and purchase equipment to make our mail safer. \nThe funding that we have included in this package will help Americans \nto know that we are not standing idly by, ignoring what are such \nobvious needs in our homeland defenses. We will take steps today to \nprotect Americans and to try to prevent the tragedy we witnessed in \nSeptember from occurring again.\n\n[[Page S13870]]\n\n  This package is a compromise. It is not a be-all and end-all package. \nThis money will not fill all of the gaps that exist. But what this \npackage will do is move us forward. It will fund those initiatives that \nwe need to begin now, and lay the groundwork for priorities that every \nSenator knows await us in the spring.\n  I want to thank my good friend, Senator Stevens, for his work on this \npackage. We would not be standing here today if not for his steadfast \nefforts. I also want to thank our House counterparts, Chairman Bill \nYoung of Florida. My, what a fine Congressman he is and a fine chairman \nof the Appropriation Committee now. I am sure that Bill Young wanted to \ndo more, but under the constraints that were upon him, he could not do \nmore.\n  I also thank Congressman David Obey of Wisconsin. He is always a \nstalwart. He stood up for homeland defense. He tried in the House to \nmove it forward and increase it, but he didn't have the votes. They and \ntheir staffs, led by Jim Dyer and Scott Lilly, worked closely with us \nto develop this package, and I appreciate their commitment to this \nsuccessful conclusion.\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, with the Senate's passage of this conference \nreport, Congress will have completed work on each of the 13 individual \nappropriations bills. I congratulate Senator Inouye and Senator \nStevens, and their staffs, Charlie Houy and Steve Cortese, for crafting \nwhat I believe is a good Defense bill. I also am pleased that we were \nable to pass the thirteen individual bills on a partisan basis, with an \naverage vote in the Senate of 91-6. We did not have to resort to an \nomnibus bill as has been the case in some years past. And we worked to \nprotect the prerogatives of Congress. We did not invite the White House \nto sit at the table and negotiate these bills. That is not the role of \nthe executive branch, nor should it be. The Constitutional Framers \nvested the power of the purse in this legislative branch--the people's \nbranch--and we have a firm grasp on the strings. I only hope that \nCongress never sees fit to loosen that hold and give away what is the \ngreatest single power afforded to this branch of government by the \nFramers, in their great wisdom.\n  Mr. President, before closing, I want to thank the members of my \ncommittee staff who have been so earnest and dedicated in their efforts \nthis year. My staff director, Terry Sauvain, and my deputy staff \ndirector, Charles Kieffer, have done a remarkable job on these bills. \nThey stayed at night. They stayed into the wee hours of the morning. \nThey worked on the nuts and bolts. They worked and they grappled with \nproblems and answered questions from disgruntled Senators and people on \nthe outside and people on the inside. I don't see how they have been \nable to maintain their sanity. I congratulate them for the good work \nthey did. This is their first year in these positions, and they have \ncertainly set a high standard for the years to come.\n  I also want to thank Edie Stanley and Kate Eltrich for their \nassistance, as well as the staffs of our 13 subcommittees. These \nappropriations bills are not written by magic. Rather they are the \nproduct of hard work, determination, and an understanding of the \nintricacies of each piece of legislation. The Senate is blessed to have \nsuch a fine group of men and women dedicated to the service of the \nnation.\n  I also want to thank members of my personal staff who have been \ninvaluable to me. My Chief of Staff, Barbara Videnieks, may \nAdministrative Assistant, Ann Adler, my Legislative Director, Jane \nMellow, my Press Secretary, Tom Gavin, my legislative assistant, David \nMcMaster, and the entire Byrd team have done an outstanding job on \nthese bills.\n  Mr. President, the fiscal year 2002 Department of Defense \nappropriations bill is a good bill. I urge all Senators to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na document entitled ``Compromise on $20 Billion Defense/New York/\nHomeland Defense Funding.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Compromise on $20 Billion Defense/New York/Homeland Defense Funding\n\n       The amendment allocates $20 billion as follows:\n       Defense: $3.5 billion ($3.8 billion below President).\n       New York/NJ/DC/MD/VA: 8.3 billion ($1.9 billion above the \n     President).\n       Homeland Defense: 8.3 billion ($3.9 billion above the \n     President).\n       UI/COBRA: 0.0 billion ($2 billion below President).\n       When combined with the $20 billion allocated by the \n     President, the amendment results in the following allocation \n     of the $40 billion approved in the September 18th \n     supplemental (P.L. 107-38):\n       Defense: $17.5 billion ($3.5 billion below the President).\n       New York/NJ/DC/MD/VA: 11.2 billion ($1.8 billion above the \n     President).\n       Homeland Defense: 9.8 billion ($4.0 billion above the \n     President).\n       Foreign Aid allocated by President: 1.5 billion (same as \n     the President).\n       UI/COBRA: 0.0 billion ($2 billion below the President--in \n     stimulus).\n       Unallocated: 0.0 billion ($0.3 billion below the \n     President).\n       Highlights of the $20 billion:\n       New York and other communities directly impacted by \n     September 11th attacks ($8.2 billion): Examples follow:\n       FEMA Disaster Relief, which funds debris removal at the \n     World Trade Center site, repair of public infrastructure such \n     as the damaged subway, the damaged PATH commuter train, all \n     government offices and provides assistance to individuals for \n     housing, burial expenses, and relocation assistance, receives \n     $4.35 billion.\n       Community Development Block Grants--$2 billion to help New \n     York restore their economy.\n       Amtrak Security--$100 million for security in Amtrak \n     tunnels.\n       Mass Transit Security--funding of $105 million for \n     improving security in the New York and New Jersey subways.\n       New York/New Jersey Ferry Improvements--$100 million for \n     critical expansion of interstate ferry service between New \n     York and New Jersey.

Like Horatio at the bridge, he stood there against \nall forces, particularly with respect to the executive branch, and \notherwise, and made sure we at least got some semblance of homeland \nsecurity started. It is on account of Senator Byrd of West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his kind words.

If that ever happened to me, I would say: Senator Hollings, \nwhere is he? He is the man I want with me in a tough situation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. And if I were lost on a lonely, dusty road amongst the \nhills, I would want Senator Byrd with me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13871-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13871-S13884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PORT AND MARITIME SECURITY ACT OF 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will state the bill by title.\n\n       A bill (S. 1214) to amend the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 \n     to establish programs to ensure greater security for U.S. \n     Seaports, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. In my 5 minutes, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, my ranking member--this is really a bipartisan initiative--\nSenator Graham of Florida who has been a leader in this regard and also \nSenator Hutchison of Texas.\n  I also thank the distinguished director of the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee, Mr. Kevin Kayes; Mr. Carl Bentzel, the expert \non port security who has been working on this over the past several \nyears; and Mr. Matthew Morrissey.\n  We actually reported the bill before September 11 of this year. We \nhave been working diligently to take care of the concerns on both sides \nof the aisle and both sides of the Capitol. We think this measure can \npass expeditiously, as soon as the House returns.\n  Following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, we have worked hard to \nimprove the security of America's transportation system, starting with \nthe airline security bill just signed into law. However, protecting \nAmerica from terrorist threats is only as effective as the weakest line \nof defense. That means every mode of transportation must be secured, \nincluding maritime transportation.\n  The United States has more than 1,000 harbor channels and 25,000 \nmiles of inland, intracoastal, and coastal waterways. Those waterways \nserve 361 ports and have more than 3,700 terminals handling passengers \nand cargo. The U.S. marine transportation system each year moves more \nthan 2 billion tons of domestic and international freight, imports 3 \nbillion tons of oil, transports 134 million passengers by ferry, and \nhosts more than 7 million cruise ship passengers. Of the more than 2 \nbillion tons of freight, the majority of cargo is shipped in huge \ncontainers from ships directly onto trucks and railcars that \nimmediately head onto our highways and rail systems. However less than \n2 percent of those containers are ever checked by Customs or law \nenforcement officials. The volume of maritime trade is expected to more \nthan double by the year 2020, making maritime security even more \nimportant for the future. This is a gaping hole in our national \nsecurity that must be fixed--and it must be fixed before enemies of the \nUnited States try to exploit our weakness.\n  Before discussing the specifics of our bill, I want to read an \nexcerpt from a chilling story published October 8 in the The Times of \nLondon:\n\n       Intelligence agencies across the world are examining Osama \n     bin Laden's multimillion [dollar] shipping interests. He \n     maintains a secret fleet, under a variety of flags of \n     convenience, allowing him to hide his ownership and transport \n     goods, arms, drugs, and recruits with little official \n     scrutiny.\n       Three years ago, nobody paid much attention to a crew \n     unloading cargo from a rusting freighter tied up on the \n     quayside in Mombasa, Kenya. The freighter was part of Osama \n     bin Laden's merchant fleet and the crew were delivering \n     supplies for the team of suicide bombers who weeks later \n     would blow up the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Bin \n     Laden's covert shipping interests were revealed at the trial \n     of the bombers, but until now security services have been \n     slow to track down how many vessels he operates.\n\n  Lloyd's List International reported that a NATO country's \nintelligence service has identified more than 20 merchant vessels \nbelieved to be linked to Osama bin Laden. Those vessels are now subject \nto seizure in ports all over the world. Some of the vessels are thought \nto be owned outright by bin Laden's business interests, while others \nare on long-term charter.\n  Several weeks ago, a suspected member of the Al Qaeda terrorist \nnetwork\n\n[[Page S13872]]\n\nwas arrested in Italy after he tried to stow-away in a shipping \ncontainer heading to Toronto. The container was furnished with a bed, a \ntoilet, and its own power source to operate the heater and \nrecharge batteries. According to the Toronto Sun, the man also had a \nglobal satellite telephone, a laptop computer, an airline mechanics \ncertificate, and security passes for airports in Canada, Thailand and \nEgypt.\n\n  These two stories really bring home this issue of seaport security. \nExcept for those of us who live in port cities like Charleston, \nAmericans often do not think about their ports--the ports that load \nindustrial and consumer goods onto trucks and railroad cars heading \ndirectly to their hometowns. Therefore, security provided through our \nseaports ultimately affects landlocked communities in the heartland of \nthe United States. Of the cargo imported and exported into the United \nStates, 95 percent arrives through our seaports; the balance is shipped \nthrough land and air borders. The potential damage and destruction that \ncan be accomplished through security holes at our seaports potentially \nexceeds any other mode of transportation. And yet we have failed to \nmake seaport security a priority.\n  Many of our busiest seaports are not only near large cities, they are \nin the core of cities like Charleston, Boston, Miami, and Seattle. \nThese seaports have been the historic hubs of economic growth, and, in \nsome cases, they have existed for close to four centuries. By \ncomparison, our rail infrastructure is 150 years old and most of our \naviation infrastructure is less than 60 years old. The port areas in \nmany cities have become increasingly attractive places to live because \nmany people want a view of the water, and to live near the coast. So we \nare facing a major problem: the number of people who want to live close \nto the waterfront is growing rapidly, but the open nature of our \nseaports exposes them to risks associated with maritime trade, \nincluding the transport of hazardous materials.\n  Most Americans would be surprised to discover there is no unified \nfederal plan for overseeing the security of the international borders \nat our seaports. And that's what seaports are: international borders \nthat must be protected as well as our land borders with Canada and \nMexico. Yet we have failed to make them secure. The U.S. Coast Guard \nand Customs Service are doing an outstanding job, but they are \noutgunned. In the year 2000, we imported 5.5 million trailer truckloads \nof cargo. Due to that volume, seaports, according to the Customs \nService, are only able to inspect between 1 to 2 percent of containers. \nIn other words, potential terrorists and drug smugglers have a 98 \npercent chance of randomly importing illegal and dangerous materials.\n  When traveling by airplane, we walk through metal detectors, our \nluggage is X-rayed, and Customs officials may interview us and check \nour bags. The inspection rate is 100 percent. At our land border \ncrossings, every single car and truck driver is stopped and \ninterviewed, or at least reviewed by the federal government. Again, the \ninspection rate is 100 percent. However, at a U.S. seaport, a person \nhas a 98 percent chance of importing a 48-foot truckload of cargo with \nno inspection at all. One marine container can carry more heroin than \nis used in the United States in one year. Some of these containers can \ncarry as much as 30 tons, or 60,000 pounds of cargo. A medium sized \ntanker can carry as much as 32 million gallons of petroleum or \nhazardous materials. Nearly one-quarter of all hazardous materials are \nmoved via water, most of it in bulk form via huge tankers. These \nshipments of oil or hazardous materials--most of them carried by \nforeign vessels--are especially dangerous targets for terrorists. \nFollowing the terrorist attacks of September 11, we must take action to \nbetter secure our maritime borders.\n  The Congress recently approved a new law that spends $3.2 billion to \nimprove security at our airports. The highway reauthorization bill--\nTEA-21 passed in 1998--directed $140 million a year for five years to \nimprove roads and security infrastructure at our land borders. We \nannually fund the Border Patrol to guard against illegal entry at our \nland borders. At U.S. seaports, the federal government provides \nofficers from the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs Service, and the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service--but the federal government \ninvests nothing in security infrastructure at our seaports. We leave \nthat up to the state-controlled port authorities and private marine \nterminal operators. Thus, we have essentially abrogated the federal \nresponsibility of our international seaport borders to states and the \nprivate sector.\n\n  Like airline security, seaport and international border security is \none of the prime responsibilities of the federal government. We must \nmeet the challenge head-on with enough resources to address these \nserious issues of national security, and to help our partners at the \nstate and local levels protect their own communities. While these \nsecurity holes at our seaports may be less obvious to the public, they \ndo exist. Because of the magnitudes of the cargoes, the proximity of \ncargo delivery to large populations, and the transportability that \nwater confers to certain hazardous materials or oil, seaports lacking \nadequate security are more vulnerable to attack and sabotage than our \nairports or land borders.\n  A couple years ago, Senator Bob Graham convinced President Clinton to \nappoint a commission to look at seaport security. At the time, the main \nfocus of port security was stopping illegal drugs, the smuggling of \npeople, and cargo theft. While those problems still exist, the new--and \nvery real--threat of terrorism strikes right at the heart of our \nnational defense.\n  The Interagency Commission on Crime and Security at U.S. Seaports \nissued a report in September 2000 that said security at U.S. seaports \n``ranges from poor to fair.'' Let me repeat that: 17 federal agencies \nreviewed our port security system and found that it is in poor shape.\n  According to the Commission:\n\n       Control of access to the seaport or sensitive areas within \n     the seaports is often lacking. Practices to restrict or \n     control the access of vehicles to vessels, cargo receipt and \n     delivery operations, and passenger processing operations at \n     seaports are either not present or not consistently enforced, \n     increasing the risk that violators could quickly remove cargo \n     or contraband. Many ports do not have identification cards \n     issued to personnel to restrict access to vehicles, cargo \n     receipt and delivery operations, and passenger processing \n     operations.\n       At many seaports, the carrying of firearms is not \n     restricted, and thus internal conspirators and other \n     criminals are allowed armed access to cargo vessels and \n     cruise line terminals. In addition, many seaports rely on \n     private security personnel who lack the crime prevention and \n     law enforcement training and capability of regular police \n     officers.\n\n  The report also found that port-related businesses did not know where \nto report cargo theft and other crimes, and that federal, state and \nlocal law enforcement agencies responsible for a port's security rarely \nmeet to coordinate their work.\n  That is what our legislation does--it creates mechanisms to integrate \nall these different security agencies and their security efforts at our \nseaports and the railways and highways that converge at our seaports. \nOur seaport security bill also directly funds more Customs officers, \nmore screening equipment, and the building of important security \ninfrastructure.\n  Each agency is good at what they do individually. But they will be \neven stronger working together, sharing information and tactics, and \ncoordinating security coverage at our seaports. More teamwork between \nthese federal, state and local agencies--along with our security \npartners in the private sector--will produce a more secure seaport \nenvironment that is stronger than the sum of each agency's individual \nefforts.\n  S. 1214, the Port and Maritime Security Act of 2001, requires the \nSecretary of Transportation to chair a National Maritime Security \nAdvisory Committee. The Secretary is required to request participation \nof the U.S. Customs Service and invite the participation of other \nfederal agencies with an interest in crime or threats of terrorism at \nU.S. seaports. The bill also authorizes the establishment of \nsubcommittees, including a subcommittee comprised of Federal, State, \nand local government law enforcement agencies to address port security \nissues, and law enforcement-sensitive matters.\n  The Committee is required to advise on long-term solutions for \nmaritime and port security; coordination of information-sharing and \noperations\n\n[[Page S13873]]\n\namong federal, state and local governments, and area and local port and \nharbor security committees; conditions for maritime security loan \nguarantees and grants; and the development of a National Maritime \nSecurity Plan. Given the varied nature and geographical structure of \nour port system, it will be important to consider private sector input. \nA one-size-fits-all approach will not work because we are looking at a \nwide variety of waterside facilities and maritime transportation-\nrelated infrastructure.\n  The bill will mandate, for the first time ever, that all ports and \nwaterfront facilities have a comprehensive security plan approved by \nthe Secretary of Transportation. An element of port security often \noverlooked are the intermodal means for transporting cargo from the \nships: railroads, highways, and barges. The bill requires that all the \nmodes of transportation converging at the port be covered by a port's \nsecurity plan. To make the entire waterfront environment more secure, \nany facility that might pose a threat to the public must tender \nsecurity plans to the Coast Guard for review and approval.\n  However, we will do more than just mandate security plans. We will \nhave security experts to assess waterfront and port security, and \nprovide those assessments to the individuals in charge of making \nsecurity plans. Assessment information will be invaluable in helping \nthe industry use the best information in order to complete effective \nsecurity plans. The bill requires the Secretary to incorporate existing \nprograms and practices when reviewing and approving security plans. The \nDepartment of Transportation will have to take into account the \ndifferent security practices of our different ports. The Department \nmust recognize and harmonize existing security practices to avoid \nduplicating costs. However, recognition of existing practices should \nnot require the Department to endorse or approve faulty security.\n  At the seaport level, the bill will establish local port security \ncommittees at each U.S. seaport. The section would require membership \nof these committees to include representatives of the port authority, \nlabor organizations, the private sector, and Federal, State, and local \ngovernments and law enforcement. The Committees would be chaired by the \nCoast Guard Captain of the Port, and meet 4 times per year. The \nCommittees would be responsible for coordinating planning and other \nport security activities; making recommendations for the port security \nevaluations; annually reviewing security plans; and conducting a field \nsecurity exercise at least once every 3 years. These committees will \nplay a vital role--day to day and month to month--coordinating the \nactions of law enforcement and the private sector in combating threats \nof terrorism and crime.\n\n  The bill requires the Secretary of Transportation, in coordination \nwith the Director of the FBI, ensure that all area maritime counter-\nterrorism and incident contingency plans are reviewed, revised, and \nupdated no less than once every three years. The Secretary shall ensure \nthat local port security committees conduct annual simulation exercises \nfor all such plans, and actual practice drills at least once every \nthree years. The plans should be comprehensive and address terrorist \nthreats to waterfront facilities and adjacent areas, and also cover \nelements of prevention and protection as well as response. I would hope \nthat the Secretary would take steps to ensure that area maritime \ncounter-terrorism and incident contingency plans are coordinated with \nsecurity plans.\n  The bill creates standards and procedures for training and certifying \nmaritime security professionals. The bill requires the Secretary of \nTransportation and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, \n``FLETC,'' to establish a Maritime Security Institute for training \nsecurity personnel, in accordance with internationally recognized law \nenforcement standards. I look forward to working with the Department of \nTransportation and the FLETC to establish an Institute to strengthen \nand professionalize maritime law enforcement and security forces. I \nhave worked with FLETC to establish a facility in Charleston, South \nCarolina to train Border Patrol personnel. I also look forward to \nworking with the Secretary and FLETC to establish the Maritime Law \nInstitute.\n  The legislation requires the Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of \nthe Treasury, Secretary of Transportation, and the Attorney General to \nwork together to establish shared dockside inspection facilities at \nseaports for Federal and State agencies. At some U.S. ports, federal \ninvestigators and inspectors do not have any space available to conduct \ninspections, and they have to route the cargo to other places before \ninspection. In other words, it would be similar to Customs officials at \nJFK airport asking arriving international passengers to take a cab to \nthe Customs headquarters downtown in order to have their bags \ninspected. That is just not right.\n  To improve seaport security tactics, the bill directs the Secretary \nof Transportation to immediately establish domestic maritime safety and \nsecurity teams for the purpose of responding to terrorist activity, \ncriminal activity, or other threats to U.S. ports, especially in \nstrategically important ports. The units shall consist of personnel \ntrained in anti-terrorism, drug interdiction, navigation assistance, \nand facilitating responses to security threats. I want to thank Senator \nEdwards for his work on this security team initiative. I was pleased \nthat we were able to include in the bill two other amendments authored \nby Senator Edwards: one promotes research and development funds for \nnon-intrusive scanning technology; the second establishes standards for \nlocking marine containers. These amendments will contribute greatly to \nincreasing security at our seaports.\n  Ports, terminals, waterfront facilities, and adjacent facilities will \nbe required to immediately implement interim security measures, \nincluding securing their perimeters. The Secretary of Transportation \nwill then prescribe regulations for the aforementioned parties to \nfollow when designing the required maritime security plans. An \nimportant point is that the regulations will require ports to control \nand limit personnel access to security-sensitive areas. Ports also will \nbe required to limit cars and trucks in security-sensitive areas, \nrestrict firearms and other weapons, coordinate local and private law \nenforcement, and develop an evacuation plan. While the bill requires \nsecurity programs to be individually tailored due to the varied nature \nof different ports, the Department of Transportation regulations will \nstill require certain elements to be incorporated. In implementing new \nregulations, I would hope that the Department would review the \nfeasibility of establishing a nationwide credentialing process. If we \ncan harmonize identification procedures, we can eliminate duplication \nand reduce costs.\n\n  The Secretary of Transportation will write regulations to designate \ncontrolled access areas in the Maritime Facility Security Plan for each \nwaterfront facility and other covered entities, and require ports to \nlimit access to security-sensitive information, such as passenger and \ncargo manifests. The regulations may require physical searches of \npersons entering controlled access areas or exiting such areas, \nsecurity escorts, and employment history and criminal background checks \nfor individuals with unrestricted access to controlled areas or \nsensitive information. An individual will be eligible to work in such \npositions if they meet the criteria established by the Secretary, and a \nbackground check does not reveal a felony conviction within the \nprevious 7 years, or release from prison during the previous 5 years. \nAn individual that otherwise may have been disqualified from a \nsecurity-sensitive position may still be hired if the employer \nestablishes alternate security arrangements acceptable to the \nSecretary. The bill would allow the Secretary to access FBI, \nfingerprint, and other crime data bases to conduct the background \ninvestigations, and transmit the results to port authorities or other \ncovered entities. The bill also would require the Secretary and the \nAttorney General to establish and collect reasonable fees to pay \nexpenses incurred for the background checks.\n  The intent of conducting criminal background checks of port \nemployees, employers and other maritime transportation-related \nemployees or employers, is not to upset any of the existing work \nrelationships or dynamics. Rather the background checks are intended to \nidentify legitimate criminal\n\n[[Page S13874]]\n\nand national security risks. The Secretary of Transportation will write \nregulations outlining how background checks should be conducted, and \nwill be responsible for conducting the background checks. In the \naviation security bill, we created a Deputy Secretary for \nTransportation Security. The person in that position should be \nresponsible for implementing the national security check program.\n  The Secretary also will determine which areas are controlled-access \nareas. Clearly, not all areas in ports are security risks areas \njustifying designation as such. I would suggest that controlled access \nareas include areas where ships tie up carrying combustibles, or \nstorage areas for combustibles or explosives, areas where security \nadmit credentialed persons into the port or terminal areas, or areas in \nthe port or terminal where containers are opened or exposed. However, \nthe Secretary should determine where risk or threat resides, and create \na way to check the backgrounds of individuals who pose a national \nsecurity or criminal threat by virtue of their presence in areas \nrequiring a greater degree of control. Individuals subject to potential \ndisqualification from positions with access to ocean manifests or \nsegregated controlled access areas must be given full and adequate due \nprocess, and collected information must be protected from disclosure \nand only revealed to the extent that it is pertinent to security \nconsiderations.\n  The bill would give the Secretary of Transportation additional \nauthority to address security risks arising from foreign ports, such as \nenhanced enforcement against vessels arriving from such port, travel \nadvisories for passengers, suspension of the right of a United States \nvessel to enter such port, and authority to assist foreign port \nauthorities to maintain an appropriate level of security. The Secretary \nof Transportation would be authorized to work through the Secretary of \nState to notify foreign countries of security problems with their \nports, and to publish a list of ports with insufficient security that \nwould be posted prominently at U.S. ports, on passenger tickets, and as \na travel advisory by the State Department. The Secretary of \nTransportation, after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, \nmay prohibit or prescribe conditions of port entry into the U.S. for \nany vessel arriving from a port listed as not secure. In particular, I \nwould like to commend both Senator Kerry, who chairs the Coast Guard \nSubcommittee, and Senator Breaux, who chairs the Surface Transportation \nand Merchant Marine Subcommittee, for their efforts on this front.\n\n  Senators Kerry and Breaux authored another critical section of this \nbill: the Sea Marshal program. The bill would authorize the Coast Guard \nto board vessels in order to deter, prevent, or respond to acts of \nterrorism or otherwise provide for the safety and security of the port \nand maritime environment. We would authorize $13 million over five \nyears for this new Coast Guard enforcement. The provision in question \nalso requires the Secretary to evaluate the potential of using licensed \nU.S. merchant marine personnel to supplement the law enforcement \nefforts of the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  The bill would authorize the President, without prior notice or a \nhearing, to suspend the right of any vessel or person of the United \nStates to enter from a foreign port or depart to a foreign port in \nwhich a condition exists that threatens the safety or security of \npassengers, vessels, or crew traveling to that port, or if a public \ninterest requires the suspension of trade between the United States and \nthat port. The bill would authorize the imposition of civil penalties \nof up to $50,000 for violating the law.\n  S. 1214 will require that we know more in advance about the cargo and \ncrew members coming into the United States. The more we know about a \nship's cargo, and where it originated, the better our Customs agents \nand other law enforcement officers can target the most suspicious \ncontainers and passengers. Even with more screening equipment, we are \nstill going to have an inadequate number of inspections. So targeting \nthe highest risk cargo will be crucial.\n  The bill requires ships to electronically send their cargo manifests \nto the port before gaining clearance to enter. While denying vessel \nclearance to land is within the authority of Customs, I would urge that \nit be used only in the most extreme cases, and that enforcement \nalternatives for handling offending cargo interests be pursued in order \nnot to disrupt all the other legal cargoes on-board a vessel. Unloading \ncargo will be prohibited if it is not properly documented. Advanced \nimport information is regularly transmitted by nearly 90 percent of the \nocean shippers. But for the shippers who are not transmitting that \ninformation, we will require it. By giving Customs advance cargo \ninformation, we can better screen imported cargo.\n  Specifically, the legislation requires carriers, including non-\nvessel-owning common carriers, to provide by electronic transmission, \ncargo manifest information in advance of port entry or clearance. \nHowever, the Secretary of Treasury may exclude classes of vessels for \nwhich the Secretary concludes these manifest requirements are not \nnecessary, and in some cases such as trucking, where the electronic \ntransmission may not be possible. Customs should use its authority to \nrequire electronic transmission, but recognize, because of the nature \nof certain categories of transport, that it may not be possible to \nconduct electronic transmissions in every situation. The bill also \noutlines the cargo and route information that must be transmitted to \nCustoms.\n  The bill prohibits the export of cargo unless properly documented, \nand no marine terminal operator may load, or cause to be loaded, any \ncargo that is not documented. The bill requires the U.S. Customs \nService to be notified of improperly documented cargo that has remained \nin a marine terminal for more than 48 hours, and authorizes that cargo \nto be searched, seized, and forfeited. Undocumented cargo should not \nsit in port areas for extended periods of time. Specifically, shippers \nwho file Shippers Export Declarations (SED) by paper shall be required \nto provide a copy of the SED to the carrier; shippers who file their \nSEDs electronically shall be required to provide the carrier with a \ncomplete master bill of lading or equivalent shipping instructions, \nincluding the Automated Export System number. While it is important \nthat we obtain certain crucial pieces of information about cargo, \nCustoms should recognize that certain elements of cargo information, \nsuch as weight discrepancies, may fluctuate and shippers should not be \nheld responsible for 100 percent accuracy. The bill creates civil \npenalties for violating documentation requirements.\n  An important part of the legislation creates new requirements for the \ndocumentation and electronic transmission of passenger information in \nadvance of entry or clearance into a port. It is imperative that the \nUnited States have advanced information on foreign passengers and crew \nmembers to ensure that we are not admitting security risks. Evidence \nindicates that materials used in terrorist attacks in Kenya and \nTanzania were shipped by vessels owned and operated by Osama bin Laden. \nMore information--and more credible information--about foreign entrants \nwill be vital given the volume of vessels, cargo and crew members \nentering into U.S. waters. In establishing such regulations, Customs \nshould work with all federal agencies to harmonize data reporting \nrequirements to ensure that entrants into the United States only need \nto file one form. Policies such as INS pre-qualification of crew \nmembers between specific pre-approved train routes between the United \nStates and Canada should be allowed to continue. Such policies ensure \nadvance compliance, and stimulate regular cross-border operation, while \nnot jeopardizing security.\n  I am also pleased that we were able to accept an amendment authored \nby Senator Cleland to allow the Commissioner of Customs to develop a \npilot program to pre-clear cargo coming into the United States if it is \ndetermined that such program would improve the security and safety of \nU.S. ports. However, before implementation of such a program, Customs \nmust determine that it would not compromise existing procedures for \nensuring the safety of these ports and the United States. The pilot \nprogram should be used to determine whether we can successfully shift \nthe evaluation of cargo and cargo security to points outside the United \nStates, and also ensure that the subsequent delivery of cargo is \naccomplished in a\n\n[[Page S13875]]\n\nway that protects against tampering and maintains the integrity of the \ncargo seal.\n  The bill directs the Customs Service to improve reporting of imports, \nincluding consigned items and goods, of in-bond goods arriving at U.S. \nseaports. Current policies can sometimes allow goods to travel into the \nUnited States, and travel for, in some instances, up to 37 days, \nwithout recording formal entry. The bill will require the reporting of \nin-bond movements prior to arrival to ensure advance filing of \ninformation identifying the cosignor, consignee, country of origin, and \nthe 6-digit harmonized tariff code. The new information must be \nelectronically filed by the importer of record, or its agent. This \ninformation will better enable Customs to track cargo and to intercept \nany suspicious cargoes in a more timely fashion. This reporting is not \nintended to reflect formal entry, but will allow Customs to use their \ntargeting system on in-bond cargoes, where current policies make it \ndifficult to enter relevant targeting data.\n  Within 6 months of the bill's enactment, the bill would require a \nreport that evaluates the feasibility of establishing a general \ndatabase to collect information about the movements of vessels, cargo, \nand maritime passengers in order to identify criminal threats, national \nand economic security threats, and threats of terrorism. The Secretary \nwould submit a report of the findings to Congress. Among several \nrequirements, the report must estimate potential costs and benefits of \nusing public and private databases to collect and analyze information, \nincluding the feasibility of establishing a Joint Inter-Agency Task \nForce on Maritime Intelligence. Additional information, and \ncoordination of information will be crucial in allowing law enforcement \nto evaluate threats in advance of U.S. arrival, ultimately, policies \nallowing us to identify risks abroad will help us avoid being forced to \nrely on policies of deterrence and prevention on U.S. soil.\n  Perhaps most importantly, we need to give seaport authorities the \nresources to get the job done. It would be great if we could simply \ndeclare our ports to be more secure. However, it takes money to make \nsure the international borders at our seaports are fully staffed with \nCustoms, law enforcement, and Immigration personnel. It takes money to \nmake sure they have modern security equipment, including the latest \nscanners to check cargo for the most dangerous materials. And it takes \nmoney to build the physical infrastructure of a secure port.\n  Our bill will provide $219 million over four years directly to these \nimportant national security functions. Cargo ships currently pay a tax \non the gross registered tonnage the ship can carry. That tax rate, in \ncurrent law, is scheduled to decline beginning in 2003. Our bill will \nsimply extend the existing tax rate--which has been imposed since \n1986--until 2006. All those revenues will be directed to help beef up \nsecurity. These tax revenues will have to be appropriated, but they can \nonly be spent on the programs authorized by this seaport security bill.\n  However, the funds provided directly by the tonnage tax extension are \ninsufficient to cover all of the port security needs. So the bill \nincludes additional authorizations of $965.5 million that Congress can \nappropriate as our colleagues come to realize the important security \nneeds that must be met in the defense of our nation. Absent the \nrealization of these authorized funds, Congress will be imposing an \nunfunded mandate on states and the private sector to secure our \nnation's maritime border.\n  The money will help pay for many of the items previously mentioned, \nand additionally will be focused on building infrastructure at our \nseaports, including gates and fencing, security-related lighting \nsystems, remote surveillance systems, concealed video systems, and \nother security equipment. The bill will directly fund and authorize \n$390 million in grants to local port security projects. Specifically, \nthe bill amends the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 to provide grants for \nsecurity projects, of which the federal government will pay up to 75 \npercent. Projects under $25,000 would not have a matching requirement, \nand the Secretary may approve federal contributions above 75 percent to \na project the Secretary deems to have high merit.\n  The bill also will fund loan guarantees that, according to regular \ncredit risk premiums for federal loans, could cover as much as $3.3 \nbillion in long term loans to port authorities acting to improve their \nsecurity infrastructure. The loans could not cover more than 87.5 \npercent of the actual cost of a security infrastructure project, and \ncan extend for up to 25 years. The loan guarantee mechanism allows the \nfederal government to leverage funds by extending credit to cover loans \nfor security infrastructure, and can help port authorities reduce their \ncapital costs for security infrastructure by amortizing it over time. \nUltimately, this policy will help us build an infrastructure at our \nmaritime borders in the most cost-effective way. The bill makes \ndirectly available and authorizes $166 million to cover the credit \nrisks of loans extended under this provision.\n\n  U.S. Customs officers must be able to screen more than just 2 percent \nof the cargo coming into our seaports. Investing in new screening \ntechnologies will help human screeners inspect more cargo, and detect \nthe most dangerous shipments. To increase the amount of cargo screened, \nthe bill authorizes $145 million for FY02 for additional Customs \npersonnel, and to help Customs update their computer systems consistent \nwith the requirements of this bill. Especially important is that the \nbill directly funds and authorizes $168 million to purchase non-\nintrusive screening and detection equipment for the U.S. Customs \nService.\n  While we cannot expect to screen every marine container entering into \nthe United States, we need to provide some expectation of inspection, \nor create some level of deterrence to dissuade smugglers from using the \nintermodal system to smuggle cargo. We are so busy investing in a anti-\nballistic missile defense system, we fail to see perhaps even a greater \nthreat: a cargo container equipped with a digital global positioning \nsystem can be delivered anywhere in the United States for less than \n$5,000. Why would the enemies of America spend millions on a rocket \nlauncher and go up against the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy when they \ncould spend $5,000 to ship a container full of explosives or other \ndangerous materials that has only a two percent chance of being \ninspected?\n  The bill also will authorize $75 million to establish a grant program \nto fund the development, testing, and transfer of technology to enhance \nsecurity at U.S. seaports. The screening technology would focus on \nfinding explosives or firearms, weapons of mass destruction, chemical \nand biological weapons. The grants may not exceed 75 percent of the \nresearch program.\n  This bill is the product of bipartisan compromise. I want to thank \nthe Administration for their efforts to produce this legislation. The \nMaritime Administration, Coast Guard and Office of the Secretary all \nplayed a vital role in helping draft the bill. I had intended to work \nto include legislation that would increase various maritime criminal \nstatutes. Unfortunately, in the crush of time we were unable to clear \nthese amendments. I think that both Senator McCain and I agree that \nthese amendments are really important to be included in final \nlegislation on seaport security, and I will work with him, and Chairman \nLeahy and Ranking Member Hatch of the Judiciary Committee to include \nprovisions updating our maritime criminal laws.\n  The bill would require the Secretary of Transportation to prepare and \npublish a National Maritime Transportation Security Plan for prevention \nand response to maritime crime and terrorism. The plan would include an \nallocation of duties among federal departments and agencies and among \nstate and local governments and agencies; procedures and techniques for \npreventing and responding to acts of crime or terrorism; and \ndesignation of the federal official who shall be the Federal Maritime \nSecurity Coordinator for each area for which an Area Maritime Security \nPlan is required and prepared. Additionally, the bill would also \nrequire the Secretary of Transportation to establish Area Maritime \nSecurity Committees comprised of members appointed by the Secretary. \nEach Area Maritime Security Committee would be required to prepare a \nmaritime security plan, and work with state and local officials to \nenhance contingency\n\n[[Page S13876]]\n\nplanning. Each Area Maritime Security Plan must be submitted to the \nSecretary of Transportation. The plans are required to outline how to \nrespond to an act of maritime crime or terrorism in or near the area, \ndescribe the area covered by the plan, and describe in detail how the \nplan is integrated with other security plans. This requirement is \nsimilar to the planning requirements that we mandated in the Oil \nPollution Act for oil spill response, and will help ensure that we have \nlocal, regional and national level responses to maritime crime and \nterrorism. The bill would also authorize the Secretary of \nTransportation to issue regulations establishing requirements for \nvessel security plans and programs for vessels calling on United States \nports, would also authorize the Secretary of Transportation, in \nconsultation with the Attorney General, to require crewmembers aboard \nvessels calling on the United States ports to carry and present upon \ndemand such identification as the Secretary determines.\n\n  The bill would require the Secretary of Transportation and the \nSecretary of Treasury to establish a joint task force to work with \nocean shippers in the development of a system to track data for \nshipments, containers, and contents. The Secretaries also would work \nwith the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop \nenhanced performance standards for in-bond seals and locks for use on \nor in containers used for water-borne cargo shipments.\n  The bill includes a number of reporting requirements to assess our \nprogress on seaport security. I would like to thank Senator Nelson of \nFlorida for his amendment asking for a Coast Guard and Navy study on \nthe feasibility of creating a Center for Coastal and Maritime Security. \nWe all look forward to the results of this important study.\n  We have made dramatic improvements to this bill since it was first \napproved by the Commerce Committee before the terrorist attacks. And I \nwant to thank Senator McCain for working with me to co-sponsor this \nmanager's amendment to the previous version of our seaport security \nbill, S. 1214. Senator McCain does not have many seaports in Arizona, \nbut he understands that the cargo, materials and people who come \nthrough our seaports make their way quickly inland on trains and \nhighways. So even if you are living in the desert, the security of our \nseaports affects all of us. I also would like to recognize and thank \nRob Freeman of Senator McCain's staff, who invested hours of time and \neffort to finalize this product.\n  I also must recognize the extraordinary efforts of Senator Bob \nGraham, who began working to improve port security long ago and put \nthis issue on our radar screen. Senator Graham's home state of Florida \nhas been wrestling with issues of crime, theft and drug smuggling at \nits seaports for many years. And while the federal government failed to \naddress these problems, the state of Florida invested millions of \ndollars of its own resources to improve port security, which has helped \nthe communities surrounding those ports. But they will still need much \nmore. The states should not carry the entire burden of protecting the \ninternational boarders at our seaports. And yet, the problems had \nbecome so severe, that the state of Florida, led in part by Bob Graham, \ndecided it had to act on its own. Senator Graham's leadership was vital \nas we developed this seaport security bill long before the terrorist \nattacks of September 11. I would also like to thank the fine work of \nSenator Graham's staffer, Tandy Barrett, she also worked very hard on \nthis legislation.\n  The initiatives in S. 1214 can help protect America and its citizens \nfrom potential terrorist threats against seaports and intermodal \nconnections throughout the country. These initiatives will not make \nmaritime transportation immune from attack. But this bill takes the \nnecessary preventative steps to better protect the American public. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation that is vital to \nprotecting our national security.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, once again I thank Chairman Hollings for \nhis efforts to address identified safety and security problems at our \nNation's seaports. The legislation before us today is designed to \naddress port security lapses that have been under review by the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation for the past two \nyears. After hearings earlier this year and last year, the Commerce \nCommittee reported out S. 1214 in August. The bill is intended to \nprovide both the guidance and funding needed to improve seaport \nsecurity. I commend Chairman Hollings' leadership on this very \nimportant issue to transportation safety and security.\n  It is widely reported that transportation systems are the target of \n40 percent of terrorist attacks worldwide. Since September 11, we have \nbeen working on a bipartisan basis to address the nation's most \npressing needs in the wake of the terrorist attacks. The Senate \nCommerce Committee has been conducting a series of hearings to gain the \ninformation we need to help us evaluate potential transportation \nsecurity risks and determine how best to respond to those potential \nrisks.\n  While it is impossible to precisely quantify, there is no question \nthat an attack on any one of our nation's 361 seaports would have far-\nreaching effects. With 95 percent of our Nation's foreign trade moving \nthrough our seaports, the impact of such an attack would ripple through \nour Nation. Businesses nationwide would face problems getting supplies \nand exporting finished goods. Our entire economy would be impacted.\n  Both the Hart-Rudman Report on Homeland Security and the Interagency \nCommission on Crime and Seaport Security found our seaports to be \nvulnerable to crime and terrorism. While there is no way to make our \nNation's seaports completely crime free and impenetrable to terrorist \nattacks, the bill before us today is a very strong first step in \nclosing the gaps in national security that now exist at our seaports.\n  I want to point out to my colleagues that the Commerce Committee had \nacted on S. 1214 prior to the September 11 attacks. As a result of the \nattacks, members of the committee and others have worked together to \nfurther modify the legislation to provide direction and funding to the \nagencies involved to focus their efforts not only on decreasing crime \nin our seaports, but to also increase protection against terrorist \nattacks.\n  In our efforts to increase our nation's seaport security, we have \nworked to take into account not only the wide range of threats and \ncrimes surrounding our seaports, but also the unique nature of our \nports. As I have said before, a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach will not \nwork. Our ports are complex and diverse in both geography and \ninfrastructure. This is why we have worked to ensure this provides for \ndirect local input into the development of security plans for their \nports, as well as for response plans for local responders should an \nattack occur.\n  S. 1214 would help address a wide range of security shortcomings at \nour Nation's seaport that were identified in the Interagency Commission \non Crime and Security in U.S. Seaports that was issued September 2000. \nAccording to the Commission's report, seaport crime encompasses a broad \nrange of crimes, including the importation of illicit drugs, \ncontraband, and prohibited or restricted merchandise; stowaways and \nalien smuggling; trade fraud and commercial smuggling; environmental \ncrimes; cargo theft; and the unlawful exportation of controlled \ncommodities and munitions, stolen property, and drug proceeds. These \ncrimes are violations of federal law, and therefore, the primary \nresponsibility for enforcement falls to Federal agencies. This bill \nwould give those agencies the authority and funding needed to make up \nfor these shortcomings.\n  Additionally, the bill would provide much needed improvements in \npreventing terrorist attacks at our Nation's seaports. While seaports \nrepresent an important component of the nation's transportation \ninfrastructure, seaports' level of vulnerability to attack is high, and \nsuch an attack, as I just mentioned, has the potential to cause \nsignificant damage. The commission found little control over the access \nof vehicles and personnel to vessels, cargo receipt and delivery \noperations, and passenger processing operations. The main problem they \nwere able to identify was the lack of a generally accepted standard for \nphysical, procedural, and personnel security at\n\n[[Page S13877]]\n\nseaports that left seaports wide open for attack. This bill will allow \nthe Department of Transportation, along with Federal, state and local \nlaw enforcement to take actions to close the security holes at ports \nnationwide.\n  The bill would authorize $1.18 billion for seaport safety and \nsecurity. The bill would require, for the first time ever, the \nDepartment of Transportation to assess the security status of U.S. \nseaports and require each port and related facility to submit security \nplans for review and approval. The bill would also improve advance \nreporting requirements for entry into the United States, provide more \nfunding for screening equipment, facilitate law enforcement \ncoordination at U.S. seaports, and authorize grants and loan guarantees \nto seaports and marine terminal operators to help finance the purchase \nof security equipment and defray the costs of security infrastructure.\n  I want to mention that while the Congress has already worked to \napprove aviation security legislation, and we are now moving forward on \nport security, both Chairman Hollings and I remain committed to \ncontinuing our agenda during the next session to address transportation \nsecurity issues in all modes of transportation, including railroads and \nbuses.\n  I urge my colleagues swift approval of this critical legislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, allow me to congratulate our distinguished \nchairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, for his \noutstanding work in putting together S. 1214, The Maritime and Port \nSecurity Improvement Act. I also wish to congratulate Senators Graham \nand McCain for all of their hard work in moving this very important \nlegislation that is crucial to homeland defense.\n  I also wish to recognize Carl Bentzel of the Commerce Committee for \nhis years of hard work in putting this legislation together.\n  I thank Senator Hollings for including several provisions from S. \n1589, the Port Threat and Security Act of 2001, in the final version of \nhis bill. If I may, I would like to discuss the provisions from S. 1589 \nthat were included in the final version of S. 1214.\n  Senator Breaux and I recently held oversight hearings before our \nrespective Subcommittees on the Coast Guard and its role in improving \nmaritime security after the terrible attacks of September 11. As \nSenators Hollings and Breaux well know, even before September 11 our \nmaritime and port security was in sorry shape. However, the attacks on \nNew York and Washington made it clear we need to go farther afield to \nguard against terrorism and other crimes.\n  We need to improve our base of information to identify bad actors \nthroughout the maritime realm. A provision of the bill would help us \nidentify those nations whose vessels and vessel registration procedures \npose potential threats to our national security. It would require the \nSecretaries of Transportation and State to prepare an annual report for \nthe Congress that would list those nations whose vessels the Coast \nGuard has found would pose a risk to our ports, or that have presented \nour government with false, partial, or fraudulent information \nconcerning cargo manifests, crew identity, or registration of the \nvessel. In addition the report would identify nations that do not \nexercise adequate control over their vessel registration and ownership \nprocedures, particularly with respect to security issues. We need hard \ninformation like this if we are to force ``flag of convenience'' \nnations from providing cover to criminals and terrorists.\n  This is very important as Osama bin Laden has used flags of \nconvenience to hide his ownership in various international shipping \ninterests. In 1998 one of bin Laden's cargo freighters unloaded \nsupplies in Kenya for the suicide bombers who later destroyed the \nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania. To that end, the bill requires the \nAdministration to report on actions they have taken, or would \nrecommend, to close these loopholes and improve transparency and \nregistration procedures, either through domestic or international \naction--including action at the International Maritime Organization.\n  This legislation would also establish a national Sea Marshal program \nto protect our ports from the potential use of vessels as weapons of \nterror. Sea Marshals have recently been used in San Francisco and Los \nAngeles, and is supported strongly by the maritime pilots who, like \nairline pilots, are on the front lines in bringing vessels into U.S. \nports. Sea Marshals would be used in ports that handle materials that \nare hazardous or flammable in quantities that make them potential \ntargets of attack. The Coast Guard has taken a number of steps \nincluding using armed Coast Guard personnel to escort a Liquid Natural \nGas, LNG, tankers into Boston since September 11. Prior to September 11 \nthese vessels were escorted by Coast Guard vessels into the port but no \narmed guards were present on the vessel. I strongly believe that having \narmed personnel, such as Sea Marshals, on these high interest vessels \nis very important and will considerably increase security in our \nnation's ports, including Boston. The ability of terrorists to board a \nvessel and cause a deliberate release of LNG or gasoline for that \nmatter is very real. Sea Marshals will make it much more difficult for \nthis to happen. The Secretary of Transportation would be responsible \nfor evaluating the potential use of Federal, State, or local government \npersonnel as well as documented United States Merchant Marine personnel \nto supplement Coast Guard personnel as Sea Marshals. In addition it is \nmy hope that the Secretary will establish training centers around the \ncountry for the Sea Marshal program. I further believe that the U.S. \nMerchant Marine Academy or any of the State maritime academies would \nmake excellent locations for such training centers.\n  Lastly, this legislation would allow the President to prohibit any \nvessel, U.S. flagged or foreign, from transporting passengers or cargo \nto and from a foreign port that does not have adequate security \nmeasures as determined by the Secretary of Transportation. I would like \nto remind my colleagues that a similar provision exists in the airline \nindustry and I see no reason why the President should not have the \npower to suspend vessel traffic to and from ports with inadequate \nsecurity, just like he can now do with international airports. The \nstakes are simply too high Mr. President, we cannot allow shipping \ncontainers to enter this country unless adequate security exists in \nforeign ports to prevent weapons of mass destruction from being loaded. \nIn addition we should not allow cruise ships carrying U.S. passengers \nto visit foreign passenger ports that do not have adequate security.\n  I again wish to congratulate Senator Hollings on this landmark \nlegislation and to thank him for including several provisions from S. \n1589. This legislation will ensure that the United States has the \ntools, the information, and the personnel to guard against waterborne \nthreats to our Nation and our citizens.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues might know, my \nState of Louisiana depends heavily on maritime trade and \ntransportation. After all, Louisiana is darn near close to being \nunderwater, so I always have had an affinity for things that float.\n  Louisiana is fortunate to have the Mississippi River, along which \nbarges haul grain, wheat and corn from the heartland of America, and \ncoal from Wyoming. Our fortune extends to the fisheries resources of \nthe Gulf of Mexico and our oil and gas resources in the outer \ncontinental shelf. We have invested in maritime-related oil and gas \ntechnologies to make that exploration as safe as possible. The Port of \nNew Orleans, Lake Charles, and South Louisiana--as well as the other \nLouisiana ports--are major seaports handling containerized bulk and \nbreakbulk cargoes, as well as passengers. The shipbuilding and repair \nindustries employ thousands, as does the marine construction and \ndredging industry.\n  My constituents live close to waterways and the the Gulf of Mexico, \nand in many cases earn their living from our marine transportation \nsystem and its associated industries. So, as the Chairman of the \nSurface Transportation and Merchant Subcommittee--and as a resident of \na State that relies so much on the smooth operation of its waterways \nand ports--maritime security is one of my primary concerns.\n  The security of our commercial sea and river ports has rarely been \nthe focus of our national security plans. We have invested millions of \ndollars to\n\n[[Page S13878]]\n\nprotect our airports and our land borders, but very little toward \nmaking sure that the goods and people arriving at our ports do not \njeopardize our security. We know that Osama bin Laden controls a \nnetwork of ships that hides his ownership. We have to assume that other \nterrorists and terrorist networks do, too. Therefore it is imperative \nthat we take a more active Federal role in protecting the international \nboundaries of our seaports.\n  There is no unified Federal plan for overseeing security at the \ninternational borders of our sea ports. Right now the responsibility of \nbuilding secure sea and river ports rests with states like Louisiana, \nits port authorities, and the private sector. That was a poor model for \nnational security when we were fighting drugs and international \nsmuggling--and it is totally inadequate after September 11 as we face \nthe threat of terrorism.\n  That is why we must pass S. 1214, the Port and Maritime Security Act.\n  For the first time we will require Federal approval of port security \nprograms. These plans will have to meet rigorous standards for security \ninfrastructure, screening equipment, evacuation plans, access controls, \nand background checks for workers in security-sensitive areas.\n  We also will require more information about the cargo and passengers \narriving at our ports. Right now we do not know enough about the ships \nand the cargo that call 24 hours a day. We need to change that \nimmediately. We will require that ships electronically transmit their \ncargo manifests--and if the manifest does not match the cargo, it will \nnot be unloaded. We also will check crew and passenger manifest \ninformation to identify people who could pose a security threat. My \nSubcommittee held a hearing on rail and maritime security in the \naftermath of the events of September 11. At that hearing we heard \ntestimony that the Republic of Panama had issued more than one thousand \nfalse documents that allow unauthorized personnel to operate on-board \ntheir vessels.\n  More information--and more reliable information--is the key to \nfighting crime and terrorism. The more we know about these ships, \nincluding who owns them and where they have been, the better we can \ntarget our law enforcement resources at our ports to check on the most \nsuspicious loads. We need to know who is on these ships, and, \neventually, be able to quickly check the names with a computer database \nof known terrorists or other associates of international criminal \norganizations.\n  This bill will require Federal, State and local law enforcement \nofficials to better coordinate the sharing of that information. If a \nlocal police officer arrests someone for breaking into a secure area of \nthe port, timely sharing of that information with State and Federal \nofficials might help identify the person as part of a larger \ninternational network. It is critical that Customs agents work with the \nlocal police, that the State police work with Immigration officials, \nand that the FBI work with local port authorities. That type of \ncooperation will dramatically improve port security. Seaports have many \ndifferent agencies and jurisdictions. So this bill attempts to \nharmonize their efforts, and will require the Coast Guard, in their \nrole as Captain of the Port, to lead the coordination of law \nenforcement.\n  The businesses that operate in seaports also play a crucial security \nrole. They must be brought into a cooperative environment in which a \nport's law enforcement information is communicated and shared \nconfidentially with privately-hired security officers. In return, \nprivate security officers must have a direct line to share information \nwith Federal, State, and local authorities.\n  To verify that the cargo loads match the manifests, we will need more \nCustoms officials to check that cargo. Incredibly, only 2 percent of \nthe cargo containers arriving at our ports are ever checked by Customs \nofficials. That is a huge hole in our national security system that \nmust be fixed. We seek to close this security hole by directly granting \nand authorizing more than $168 million for the purchase of non-\nintrusive screening and detection equipment to be used by U.S. Customs \nofficers. These Customs officers are on the front lines of protecting \nour country from the importation of illegal and dangerous goods. We \nmust give them the latest technology and the most modern cargo \nscreening equipment available.\n  We also must help the private sector and the port authorities meet \nthese national security challenges. This problem would be must more \nsimple to solve it the United States had national seaports under the \ncontrol of the Federal Government--or if the Federal Government \ndirectly funded seaport infrastructure. However, that is not the case. \nMaritime infrastructure is owned by States and by the private sector. \nBut the Federal Government has a role to play here for homeland \nsecurity. We cannot force States and the private sector to comply with \nsecurity mandates, yet not provide funding. The legislation will \ndirectly fund and authorize $390 million in grants to local port \nsecurity projects. The bill also will fund loan guarantees that could \ncover as much as $3.3 billion in long term loans to port authorities \nacting to improve their security infrastructure. Upgrading that \ninfrastructure means installing modern gates and fencing, security-\nrelated lighting systems, remote surveillance systems, concealed video \nsystems, and other security equipment that contributes to the overall \nlevel of security at our ports and waterfront facilities.\n  Some of our shipping companies may worry that these new procedures \nrequiring more security and customs checks will slow the flow of \ninternational commerce. But as we did in the airline security bill, we \ncan strike the balance between increased security and the convenience \nof our open country and economy. In Louisiana, our sea and river ports \nare a way of life, and an integral part of our economy. We have some of \nthe largest seaports in America, and the Mississippi River runs through \nthe heart of Louisiana. The river is a super-highway of commerce that \nhelps drive our State's economy.\n  Security and the protection of our people from harm always will be \nour primary goal. However, we must do it in a way that does not \ndramatically slow the movement of goods that run our just-in-time-\ndelivery economy. The answer to that problem is technology.\n  New scanners are now on the market that can x-ray and scan an entire \n48-foot cargo container. Customs currently depends primarily on gamma-\nray systems that are adequate for seeing through small vehicles or \nloosely-packed crates. But more powerful X-ray based machines--already \nused in Israel, the Netherlands, and Hong Kong--can pierce several \ninches of steel and peer through more densely packed boxes. These \nmachines can see everything from false compartments down to the buttons \non a remote control. And they can be programmed to spot ``density \nsignatures'' that indicate explosive and nuclear materials. The more \nthe Federal Government, ports and the private sector invest in using \nthis new scanning technology, the fewer cargo containers and boxes will \nhave to be opened and searched by hand. That will increase the \nefficiency of international commerce and trade--while at the same time \nmaking our nation more secure.\n  Investing in scanners is even more critical when you consider that \nthe expanding global economy raises the volume of seaborne shipping by \n7 to 10 percent each year. In other words, the amount of goods arriving \nand departing through our seaports is expected to double by 2020. While \nthat increased trade will benefit our economy, it also poses a national \nsecurity threat if we are unable to keep pace with the growing volume \nof goods and people passing through our ports.\n  That is why the private sector must get behind our efforts--and \nbehind this bill. Before September 11, port security was something of \nan afterthought. We are now facing new threats. The more we invest in \nthe infrastructure of making our ports secure, the less likely that \nyour key products and supplies will be delayed at the ports due to \nincreased security. As public officials, our primary duty is to protect \npublic safety and national security. If the private sector engages and \ncooperates with our efforts, there will be less impact from that \ntightened security upon the free flow of goods and supplies through our \nmajor seaports. That is a public-private partnership that can work--and \nprotect America at the same time.\n\n[[Page S13879]]\n\n  We have made the investments at our airports and at our land borders \nto counter threats of terrorism and other international criminal \norganizations. It is now time to invest in the security of the \ninternational borders at our seaports, in order to protect our nation \nand our local seaport communities.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to thank Chairman \nHollings and ranking member McCain for agreeing to include in S. 1214, \nthe Port and Maritime Security Act, a Coast Guard and Navy study to \nevaluate the merits of establishing a Center for Coastal and Maritime \nSecurity.\n  The events of September 11 cruelly illustrated the challenges we face \nin providing comprehensive and reliable security for our homeland. \nThere is no challenge more daunting than the integration of our \nFederal, State and Local law enforcement agencies and their coordinated \nefforts with our Armed Forces to protect our vast and complex maritime \nand industrial areas.\n  My amendment directs the administration to seriously consider \nestablishing an institution that can provide integrated and coordinated \ntraining for the organization, planning and execution of security \nsystems necessary to protect our vulnerable ports and coasts from \npotential terrorist attacks.\n  I am grateful for the inclusion of language directing this study \nbecause the U.S. Navy's Coastal Systems Station in Panama City, Florida \nis uniquely staffed with coastal security experts to help the Coast \nGuard conduct this assessment. In analyzing the costs and benefits of a \nCoastal and Maritime Security Center, I urge the Coast Guard to work \nclosely with the Coastal Systems Station to ensure the best possible \nrecommendation for the Administration and Congress.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that the study directed by this \nlanguage will conclude that an investment in interagency integrated \neducation and training to improve the protection of our ports and \nharbors is in the very best interests of our national security.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this bill would take a significant step \ntoward securing our Nation against future terrorist actions.\n  Just as we have unanimously decided to bolster security at our \nairports, we must also improve the overall security and cargo \nprocessing operations at U.S. seaports.\n  If nothing else, September 11 has demonstrated the need to do more to \nsecure our Nation from terror--whether it comes from land, sky or sea. \nBefore discussing the specifics of this legislation, it is important to \ndescribe the circumstances that have caused the security crisis at our \nseaports.\n  Seaports represent an important component of the Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  Each year, thousands of ships, and millions of passengers, enter and \nleave the United States through seaports.\n  It is estimated that 95 percent of the cargo that enters the country \nfrom noncontiguous countries does so through the Nation's 361 coastal \nand inland ports.\n  Alarmingly, less than 2 percent of this enormous number of cargo \ncontainers are actually inspected.\n  Over the next 20 years, the total volume of imported and exported \ngoods at seaports is expected to increase threefold.\n  Waterborne cargo alone contributes more than $750 billion to the U.S. \ngross domestic product and creates employment for 13 million people.\n  Despite the massive volume of cargo that moves through our Nation's \nports, there are no Federal security standards or guidelines protecting \nour citizens from potentially lethal cargo.\n  The Federal Government does not provide the resources for technology \nthat an adequately screen cargo moving through our ports, leaving them \nvulnerable to criminal activity--from smuggling to cargo theft to \nterrorism.\n  Security at our maritime borders is given substantially less Federal \nconsideration than airports or land borders.\n  At U.S. seaports, the Federal Government invests nothing in \ninfrastructure, other than the human presence of the U.S. Coast Guard, \nU.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, \nand whatever equipment those agencies have on-hand to accomplish their \nmandates.\n  Physical infrastructure is provided by State or local controlled port \nauthorities, or by private sector marine terminal operators.\n  There are no controls, or requirements in place, except for the \nminimal standards promulgated by the Coast Guard for the protection of \ncruise ship passenger terminals.\n  Essentially, where seaports are concerned, we have abrogated the \nFederal responsibility of border control to the State and private \nsector.\n  In the face of these new challenges, it appears that the U.S. port \nmanagement system has fallen behind the rest of world.\n  We lack a comprehensive, nation-wide strategy to address the security \nissues that face our seaport system.\n  In early 1998--in response to the almost daily reports of crime and \nnarcotics trafficking at Florida seaports, and following the day I \nspent working with the Customs Service at Tampa's Port Manatee on \nOctober 14, 1997--I began an investigation of the security situation at \nseaports throughout the nation. At that time, and perhaps even more so \ntoday, I was very concerned that our seaports, unlike our airports, \nlacked the advanced security procedures and equipment that are \nnecessary to prevent acts of terrorism, cargo theft and drug \ntrafficking.\n  Based on this workday, and subsequent investigation, I asked \nPresident Clinton to establish a Federal commission to evaluate both \nthe nature and extent of crime and the overall state of security in \nseaports and to develop recommendations for improvement.\n  In response to my request, President Clinton established the \nInteragency Commission on Crime and Security in U.S. Seaports on April \n27, 1999.\n  In October 2000, the Commission issued its final report, which \noutlines many of the common security problems discovered in U.S. \nseaports. Among other conclusions, the Commission found that: one, \nintelligence and information sharing among law enforcement agencies \nneeds to be improved at many ports; two, that many ports do not have \nany idea about the threats they face, because vulnerability assessments \nare not performed locally;\n  Three, that a lack of minimum security standards at ports and at \nterminals, warehouses, and trucking firms leaves many ports and port \nusers vulnerable to theft, pilferage, and unauthorized access by \ncriminals; and four, advanced equipment, such as small boats, cameras, \nvessel tracking devices, and large scale X-rays, are lacking at many \nhigh-risk ports.\n  Our legislation addresses the problems of our seaports by instructing \nthe Attorney General to coordinate the reporting of seaport related \ncrimes with State law enforcement officials, so as to harmonize the \nreporting of data on cargo theft.\n  The bill would also increase the criminal penalties for cargo theft.\n  To address the lack of minimum security standards at America's \nseaports, the bill would require security programs to be developed by \neach port or marine terminal.\n  Each security program will be submitted to the Security of \nTransportation for review and approval.\n  These security programs would require maintenance of both physical \nand procedure security for passengers, cargoes, crew members, and \nworkers; provisions for establishing secure areas within a waterfront; \ncreation of a credentialing process to limit access to restricted areas \nso only authorized individuals gain admittance; restriction of \nvehicular access; development of an evacuation process from port areas \nin the event of a terrorist attack or other such emergency; and \nestablish security awareness for all employees.\n  Our bill requires the Coast Guard, in consultation with the \nappropriate public and private sector officials and officials and \norganizations, develop a system of providing port security-threat \nassessments for U.S. seaports. The bill would authorize $60 million \nover 4 years to carry out this provision.\n  The Seaport Commission report found that current inspection levels of \ncontainerized cargo are insufficient to counter potential security \nrisks.\n  This bill will authorized $168 million over five yeas, for the \nCustoms Service to purchase non-intrusive screening and detection \nequipment for use at U.S. seaports.\n  It would also authorize $145 million for 1,200 new customs inspector \npositions, and 300 new customs agent positions.\n\n[[Page S13880]]\n\n  The bill would also create a research and development grant program \nto provide grants up to 75 percent of the cost of construction, \nacquisition or deployment of technology to help develop non-intrusive \ninspection technologies.\n  The bill would authorize $15 million annually for fiscal year 2002 to \nfiscal year 2006 for this purpose.\n  Implementing the provisions of the Port and Maritime Security Act of \n2001 will produce concrete improvements in the efficiency, safety, and \nsecurity of our Nation's seaports, and will result in a demonstrable \nbenefit for those who are currently pay tonnage duties.\n  This legislation is long overdue--that became all too apparent the \nmorning of September 11. Not only is it required to facilitate future \ntechnological advances and the anticipated increases in international \ntrade, but it would ensure that we have the sort of security controls \nnecessary to protect our borders from threats of illegal aliens, drug \nsmuggling and terrorism.\n  As we work to lift our Nation's fear of travel in our skies, we must \nalso move to guarantee their safety on our seas.\n  This bill does not affect just those states with ports.\n  Each day 16,000 containers arrive in the United States. A single \ncontainer can hold 30 tons.\n  These containers are either transported by truck or by rail \nthroughout the United States.\n  To illustrate my point, I have a chart here which depicts a normal \nroute of a cargo container entering the Port of Los Angeles and \narriving in New York.\n  These containers travel across America, often more than a dozen \nStates before reaching their destination.\n  Our seaports are our first line of defense in preventing a potential \ntragedy.\n  Seaports play one of the most critical roles in expanding our \ninternational trade and protecting our borders from international \nthreats.\n  The ``Port and Maritime Security Act'' recognizes the importance of \nour seaports and devotes the necessary resources to move ports into the \n21st century.\n  I urge my colleagues to look towards the future by supporting this \ncritical legislation--and by taking action to protect one of our most \nvaluable tools for promoting economic growth.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor S. 1214, the Port Security and Improvement bill. This legislation \nis overdue and absolutely needed in broadening our response to the \nthreat of terrorism.\n  The Report of the Interagency Commission on Crime and Security in \nU.S. Seaports, issued in the fall of 2000, indicates that ``the state \nof security in U.S. seaports generally ranges from poor to fair, and in \na few cases, good.'' Now that this country is acutely aware of the \nrepercussions of overlooking transportation security weaknesses, \nCongress would be severely remiss if we did not act promptly to improve \non the ``poor to fair'' rating at our ports.\n  I believe that technology can play an important role in ensuring the \nintegrity, safety, and security of goods coming into this country via \nship. To that end, my amendment that is included in S. 1214 establishes \na pilot program run and defined by the Customs Service to examine \ndifferent technologies and how they can be employed to verify that a \ncontainer's contents are what they say they are and that they have not \nbeen tampered with during transport. Shippers and transporters using \neffective such technologies could then enter U.S. ports on an expedited \nbasis. With 95 percent of foreign trade entering or leaving the U.S. \nvia ship, allowing a quicker entrance by certain ``trusted shippers'' \nwill allow a quicker conveyance to American consumers.\n  Already, I have seen outstanding demonstrations from people all over \nthis country of their detection technologies and how they can be used \nto improve security. My amendment is a challenge to these innovators to \ndevelop such technologies for use in the shipping world.\n  Additionally, I have heard testimony from maritime experts that \nAmerica needs to find ways to ``push its borders back.'' By ``pushing \nback'' our borders the intention is to ensure the integrity and \ninspection of goods entering the country at points farther out from our \nphysical borders. If this process can be taken care of in a foreign \nport, confidence in the integrity of the goods increases and time is \nsaved by domestic inspectors who can use their resources elsewhere. My \namendment would allow the securing of goods in the port of origin so \nthat when these goods arrive in the U.S. we can be assured of their \nsafety.\n  I thank Senator Hollings for his help with my amendment, and I look \nforward to working with Customs to implement this program, which I \nbelieve will be helpful to get goods to market in safe but timely \nmanner.\n\n\n                       nuclear devices detection\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am encouraged that the Senate is \npoised to pass legislation bolstering security at our Nation's 361 \nseaports. I thank the members of the Senate Commerce Committee for \ntheir hard work on this bill.\n  While often out of the public eye, ports and harbors across the \nUnited States are America's economic gateways. Every year, U.S. ports \nhandle over 800 million tons of cargo, valued at approximately $600 \nbillion. If you exclude border commerce with Mexico and Canada, our \nports handle 95 percent of U.S. trade. Two of the busiest ports of the \nnation are in California, at Long Beach and Oakland.\n  Yet, just 1 or 2 percent of the 11 million shipping containers \nreaching our ports are inspected each year. The Federal Government has \ntaken steps to beef up security along our northern and southern \nborders. And we are addressing aviation security. But just about \neverything that arrives by ship is waved through.\n  This bill will strengthen law enforcement at our ports by \nestablishing a federal port security task force and providing more \nfunding for local efforts to boost port security. It is crucial that we \nincrease cargo surveillance and inspections. And it is crucial that we \nprovide our Customs agents and other port security forces with the \nequipment needed to detect chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons of \nmass destruction, WMD.\n  Osama bin Laden has stated that he considers it his ``religious \nduty'' to obtain such weapons.\n  Earlier this month, the director general of the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency warned, ``The willingness of terrorists to commit suicide \nto achieve their evil aims makes the nuclear terrorism threat far more \nlikely than it was before September 11th.'' According to the Agency, \nthere have been 175 cases of trafficking in nuclear material since 1993 \nand 201 cases of trafficking in medical and industrial radioactive \nmaterial. Sadly, it is no longer beyond the pale to imagine that bin \nLaden and his associates might try to smuggle a nuclear device or so-\ncalled ``dirty bomb'' onto a cargo ship entering one of our busy \nseaports and then detonate it.\n  I was prepared to offer an amendment to make it quite clear that \nreferences in the bill to chemical, biological, or other weapons of \nmass destruction include nuclear devices.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the senior Senator from California will yield, I \nassure her that is our intent. Where was authorize activities or \nfunding to step up survelliance, inspection, and detection of WMDs at \nour seaports, we would want to target any kind of nuclear devices as \nwell as chemical and biological weapons.\n  So, for instance, any authorizations in the bill for the purchase of \ndetection equipment could be used to buy radiation pagers for the \nCustoms agents who inspect cargo, or for radiation detectors on cargo \nX-ray machines, or to retrofit existing X-ray machines with sensitive \nsodium iodide detectors.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the chairman for his clarification. It is \nabsolutely vital that we upgrade our detection technology. Oakland's \nHoward Marine Terminal, for instance, is less than once-half mile from \nJack London Square, a major tourist attraction. Ships that travel into \nand out of the Port of Oakland terminal pass within 400 yards of the \nSquare.\n  Immediately following the September 11th attacks, a 920-foot tanker \ncarrying 33 million gallons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was \nprevented from entering Boston Harbor. The tanker was kept 6 to 8 miles \noffshore while authorities figured out a way to safeguard the Harbor. \nIt was not until November 4--with Coast Guard escorts--that the tanker \nwas allowed into the harbor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator from California has raised good points. I \nappreciate her interest in the matter and\n\n[[Page S13881]]\n\nher willingness to reach an accommodation with the Commerce Committee. \nWe certainly want to interdict any nuclear devices as assuredly as we \nwant to interdict other WMDs.\n\n\n                PORT AND MARITIME SECURITY ACT COLLOQUY\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we worked hard with the Administration \nto incorporate many of their suggested changes in this bill to sharpen \nthe policy and create a better legislative product. I had intended to \nwork with Chairman Leahy of the Judiciary Committee to modernize and \nupdate some of our maritime criminal laws to reflect the realities \nfollowing the attacks of September 11th, and to strengthen our laws to \nprotect against maritime terrorism. Unfortunately, the Administration \ndid not consult or share with the Judiciary Committee the changes in \ncriminal laws and other matters within the Judiciary Committee's \njurisdiction that were provided to me. I would like to ask the Chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, if he would be willing to work to work with \nme and Senator McCain next year to consider whether new criminal \nprovisions are necessary to enhance seaport security?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am also very concerned that we develop \npolicies to more adequately protect our maritime vulnerabilities and \nprotect the public from the threats emerging as a result of maritime \ntrade. I would be happy to work with Chairman Hollings and Ranking \nMember McCain next year to evaluate whether any gaps in our criminal \nlaws to protect our maritime safety and seaport security exist and the \nappropriate steps we should take to close those gaps and at the same \ntime ensure that the rights of port employees are protected.\n  Mr. President, I have also expressed to Chairman Hollings my concerns \nthat we properly limit access to and use of sensitive law enforcement \ninformation relating to background checks which are provided for in \nthis bill. Chairman Hollings has assured me that the bill sets strict \nand appropriate limits as to both when such access will be required and \nhow the information will be used once obtained. Additionally, the \nChairman understands my continuing concern over the need for \nappropriate due process protections for employees of ports at all \nlevels who may be subject to background checks. These would include a \nhearing that would consider mitigating and extenuating circumstances \nrelated to the individual in question. Am I correct that it is the \nintent of the Chairman to ensure that the Department of Transportation \nand the nation's ports carry out background checks with proper \nsafeguards in place that ensure due process protections for employees. \nAnd will the Chairman commit to work with me to that end? I would like \nto ask Chairman Hollings if he could explain these provisions?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we have included the important \nprotections and limitations for such use in access in the bill. \nBackground checks will be limited to those employees who have access to \nsensitive cargo information or unrestricted access to segregated \n``controlled access areas,'' that is defined areas within ports, \nterminals, or affiliated maritime infrastructure which present a \ncritical security concern. Such controlled access areas could be: \nlocations where containers will be opened, points where vessels \ncontaining combustible or hazardous materials are berthed and port \nsecurity stations. In addition, under this bill the use of background \ninformation, once it is obtained, will be restricted to the minimum \nnecessary to disqualify an ineligible employee. In other words, only \nthe minimum amount of law enforcement information necessary to make \neligibility decisions will be shared with port authorities or maritime \nterminal operators.\n  Moreover, this legislation ensures appropriate due process \nprotections for port employees who may be subject to a background \ncheck. In the legislation the Secretary is required to establish an \nappeals process that includes notice and an opportunity for a hearing \nfor individuals found to be ineligible for employment as prescribed in \nSection 106. I also agree that this process should evaluate any \nextenuating and mitigating circumstances. I will work to ensure that we \naccomplish these objectives as the port security legislation moves \nforward.\n\n\n                      Security of Inland Waterways\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished chairman \nof the Commerce Committee in a colloquy on very important legislation \nhe has sponsored--the Port and Maritime Security Act of 2001. This \nlegislation, which I am pleased to have cosponsored, would establish \nnew Federal safeguards for the security of our ports and maritime \ncommerce. I would appreciate the chairman clarifying whether the intent \nof this legislation is to cover not only the security of ports but also \ninland waterways such as the Columbia-Snake River system. This is an \nimportant issue for the Pacific Northwest region because dams on the \nColumbia and Snake Rivers are not only critical for maritime \ntransportation in our region but also a major source of our region's \nenergy. Barges pass through the locks on these dams every day carrying \ngasoline and other explosive cargoes that could disrupt our waterways \nor energy production and even put residents downstream at risk of \nflooding if these cargoes exploded while in transit through one of the \nnavigation locks. So I would ask my Chairman whether the authority \nprovided to the Coast Guard and S. 1214 includes evaluating not just \nsecurity for ports but also inland waterways like the Columbia/Snake \nRiver system?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate the Senator helping to clarify this point. \nI know it is especially important for the Senator's home State of \nOregon and the Pacific Northwest region. The answer to the Senator's \nquestion is yes, the intention is to cover all areas affected by \nmaritime transportation and commerce. The legislation covers not only \nseaports but also ``public or commercial structures located within or \nadjacent to the marine environment'' including navigation locks.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator for his clarification. I also ask him \nwhether under his legislation, the Coast Guard would have authority to \noversee dangerous cargoes transported along the Columbia/Snake River \nsystem as well as cargoes in port?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Under the legislation, the Secretary of Transportation \nwould issue regulations for security programs for cargo as well for \nprotecting passengers, crew members and other workers. The authority \nfor security of cargo is broad enough to cover not only cargoes in port \nbut also dangerous cargoes anywhere in the maritime navigation system \nincluding those in transit through navigation locks.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the chairman again for answer and commend him for \nhis leadership on this important issue.\n\n\n                         FREIGHT RAIL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, will my friend, the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, the Senator from South \nCarolina, yield for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will be happy to yield for the purpose.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from South Carolina if \nhe would agree that in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11th, this nation came to a number of stark realizations \nabout our vulnerabilities and the overall state of our security?\n  We have become aware that glaring security gaps exist throughout our \nnation's transportation system. The Senator from South Carolina has \nbeen a leader in focusing the Senate's attention on the need to improve \nthe safety of our ports, and he has been steadfast in his support for \nadditional protections for our nation's rail passengers. I hope that he \nwill agree with me that as important as improving the security in those \nareas is, our job is not complete until we pay similar attention to the \nsecurity of our freight rail system.\n  One of the most serious vulnerabilities in the nation's \ntransportation system is possibility that terrorists may target \nhazardous materials being transported across this nation's vast and \nlargely unsecured freight rail network. I am sure the Senator is aware \nthat several studies conclude that the chemical industry is \nparticularly vulnerable to terrorist attacks, and point to the shipment \nof hazardous materials by rail as one of\n\n[[Page S13882]]\n\nthe most serious threats to the industry. In fact, I believe that a \nstudy requested by the Senator's Appropriations Subcommittee and due to \nbe published this month, will come to this very conclusion.\n  I do not mean to suggest that transportation of chemicals or other \nhazardous materials should be curtailed. While the transportation of \nhazardous materials poses risks to human health, the expeditious \nmovement of certain products, like chlorine for municipal water \nsystems, is absolutely essential for the protection of human health.\n  The railroad and chemical industries have acknowledged the risks, and \nhave taken strides toward improving the security of their facilities, \nhazardous materials shipments, and rolling stock since the September \n11th attacks. These security improvements, and additional security \nenhancements that are planned, will be inordinately costly, perhaps \nreaching as high as $150 million in this calendar year, and another \n$150 million in 2002. I hope the Senator will agree that the \nextraordinary and unforeseen nature of the costs being incurred by \nhazardous materials shippers, tank car owners, and railroads, combined \nwith the benefit to human health and public safety that these security \nenhancements represent, justifies a program of short-term federal \ngrants to reimburse or defray some of the post-September 11th security-\nrelated expenses these companies are incurring.\n  If the Senator from South Carolina does agree with the need to \nimprove our nation's rail security, and understands the unprecedented \noutlays that railroads and shippers have made or will make in the near \nfuture, would he commit to this Senator to hold whatever hearings \ndeemed necessary, and to schedule a prompt mark-up in the Commerce \nCommittee early in 2002 for legislation of mine to require the \nSecretary of Transportation to conduct a comprehensive terrorism risk \nassessment, and to set up a Rail Security Fund to make the types of \ngrants that we have discussed here today?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator for his comments on the state of \nour nation's transportation security, and I agree with his assertion \nthat a complete treatment of our security needs would include \nlegislation to improve the security of our rail network. I am aware \nthat the need for the safe and expeditious rail transportation of \nchemicals and other hazardous materials is essential for our nation's \neconomy, and that the movement of some chemicals, including chlorine, \nis necessary for the preservation of public health.\n  I am aware also of the security improvements that have been \nundertaken by railroads and hazardous materials shippers. I agree that \nthe security-related expenses are extraordinary, and that in the \ninterest of protecting the general public from the effects of a \nterrorist attack on hazardous materials shipped by rail, the federal \ngovernment should help these companies on a short-term basis to defray \ntheir post-September 11th security-related expenses. I will promise the \nSenator from West Virginia that the Commerce Committee will take up the \nissue of rail security as early as possible during the next session of \nthe Congress.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator from South Carolina, and I thank \nthe Presiding Officer.\n\n\n                            BUS SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman's leadership in \npromoting safety in all modes of passenger and cargo transportation. In \nthe Commerce Committee executive session on October 17, the committee \naddressed the important issue of passenger rail safety. The committee \napproved funding for the upgrading of Amtrak tunnels and bridges \nprimarily along the much-used Northwest corridor. While I support and \napplaud the goal of increasing passenger rail safety and security--in \nfact I strongly support this legislation--at the same committee session \nI raised the issue of intercity bus security. Attention became acute on \nthis issue after the October 3 incident on a Greyhound bus that \nresulted in the death of seven people. Since that event, there have \nbeen other attempts to cause mayhem on buses, but thankfully, none have \nresulted in deaths. With over 774 million intercity bus passengers \nannually with companies serving over 4,000 communities, we cannot wait \nto act on securing this important mode of transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate the fact that the Senator from Georgia \nbrought this matter to the committee's attention. Bus security is in \nfact an important issue which unfortunately cannot be appropriately \naddressed before the end of this year. I applaud the initiative of the \nSenator from Georgia and leadership on this issue and, in particular, \nhis introduction of S. 1739, which establishes a competitive grant \nprogram to allocate funding to bus companies to increase security and \nsafety and creates a research and development program for new \ntechnologies to increase bus security and safety. It is my intention to \nconsider this legislation on the markup calendar of the Commerce \nCommittee's first executive session of 2002.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I applaud the chairman's decision to advance the issue \nof bus safety. With bus terminals often sharing facilities with both \nairports and rail stations, omitting this critical component of the \nequation leaves a hole in the system. This mode of transportation is \nthe largest domestic passenger service provider, and it has grown \nwithout the aid of federal support. Now that they need assistance to \nsupplement their own efforts and protect our citizenry, it is time for \nCongress to act. This industry is made up of many small businesses, \nwhich may not be able to survive if assistance is not given to help \nboost security in order to bring passengers back to bus travel. \nOtherwise, these businesses may have to increase the cost to the \ncustomer to pay for the necessary security upgrades.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. As chairman of the Commerce Committee, I am very aware \nof the need of the bus community. It is an important segment of our \ntransportation infrastructure. I look forward to working with my \ncolleague from Georgia on his legislation at the earliest opportunity \nin 2002.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator for his support and attention to \nthis matter, and I look forward to working with you in the future on \nthis issue of national importance.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I seek unanimous consent to say a few \nwords about the Port and Maritime Security Act of 2001 and the \nherculean efforts of the Senate Commerce Committee Chairman, Senator \nHollings, to get it passed.\n  In the aftermath of September 11, most of the legislation considered \nin this chamber has been reactive in nature. This bill, like Senator \nByrd's homeland security package, is decidedly different.\n  This bill is designed to prevent a terrorist attack on one of our \nnation's most vulnerable pieces of infrastructure--our ports. This bill \nanticipates the possibility of an attack, and sets out to make that \nimpossible. This is exactly the kind of legislation that we were sent \nto Congress to pass.\n  Yet it would not have passed without the dogged efforts of Senator \nHollings, who forced the issue as most members of Congress were leaving \ntown.\n  Finally, I would just like to comment on Senator Holling's use of \nDavid Stockman's The Triumph of Politics, in his remarks today. I too \nremember those days in the early 1980's, when the Laffer Curve and \ntrickle-down economics were coming into vogue. I was a young \ncongressman then, and I didn't believe it would work.\n  I still don't. And I share the chairman's disbelief that even after \nSeptember 11--when our Nation's vulnerabilities have been so explicitly \nexposed and the need for additional security resources has been made so \nevident-- we would again travel down that path.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for his efforts on this vital \npiece of legislation.\n\n\n                         PORT SECURITY, S. 1214\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to thank Chairman Hollings \nand Senator McCain for accepting my amendment to this important bill \nwill promote security at our Nation's seaports.\n  America's ports provide invaluable links between American \nproductivity and markets both here at home and abroad.\n  Ports are a critical cog in the wheels of our economy. But quite \nfrankly, our ports are vulnerable.\n\n[[Page S13883]]\n\n  History has taught us lessons in vulnerability before, whether it be \nthe USS Maine in Havana Harbor, the attack on Pearl, or the USS Cole in \nYemen, ships and shipping are always a risky proposition, especially in \nthe confines of port.\n  These lessons have new meaning in today's reality of war.\n  A single attack, on a single ship, in a single U.S. port could render \nthe entire facility immobile.\n  What does that mean? No exports of U.S. autos. No freighters carrying \nore on the Great Lakes. No grain barges up or down the Mississippi \nRover. Simply put, No trade.\n  And perhaps most troubling, no energy.\n  In my State the Port of Valdez, at the end of the Alaska Pipeline, is \nresponsible for providing much of the West Coast and Hawaii with its \noil. And in Kenai, the facility sees billions of cubic feet of \nLiquified Natural Gas transferred each year.\n  What would happen if these ports were closed by some horrific act? \nHow could we move our Nation's domestically produced energy?\n  These facilities and others around the U.S. demand our best efforts \nto protect them.\n  But a large, and unfortunately growing, role for our ports is the \nimportation of foreign-produced energy, crude oil, refined petroleum \nproducts and liquified natural gas.\n  As imported energy becomes a larger share of the U.S. energy supply, \nwe become more vulnerable to terrorist attacks.\n  The energy trade itself creates new terrorist targets.\n  In the aftermath of September 11th, the Coast Guard was forced to \nsuspend LNG shipments in to Boston Harbor for fear of those ships being \nused for terror.\n  What else is aboard those foreign flagged supertankers that enter our \nports from the Middle East?\n  What is hidden in the holds? Biohazards? Chemical warfare?\n  What else has that crew been trained to do?\n  These situations take on a new sense of reality after September 11.\n  My colleagues are well aware of my efforts to reduce our dependence \non foreign oil and foreign supertankers by using our own domestic \nresources.\n  The longer we wait, the more vulnerable we become.\n  The majority leader has used parliamentary tactics to subvert the \nwill of the Senate and delay voting on our energy independence.\n  That is a debate that still lies before us.\n  But for today, as long as we remain dependent, we must do all we can \nto protect the safety of those ships and that energy.\n  My amendment which is now included in this bill makes certain that \nthose who are the most knowledgeable in this most critically-important \naspect of port operations are full participants in the effort to ensure \nport security.\n  It further ensures that when we talk port security, that we're \ntalking about our Nation's energy security.\n  I greatly appreciate the willingness of the Chairman, Mr. Hollings, \nand the Ranking Republican, Mr. McCain, to accept this amendment.\n  This amendment will make a strong and much needed bill even stronger.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Port and \nMaritime Security Act of 2001 and to speak about the need to protect \nour seaports from terrorist attacks.\n  Our seaports are critically important to our national, and global, \neconomy. Our seaports enable us to export our goods to the rest of the \nworld and allow us to import the goods we do not produce domestically. \nNinety-five percent of all U.S. overseas trade is conducted through our \n361 public seaports. Roughly 45,000 cargo containers enter the U.S. \nevery day.\n  Our seaports are also an important component of our national \nsecurity. In the interest of promoting trade, we accept increasing \ntraffic in and around our seaports as ships, crew and cargo move goods \nbetween our nation and others. Yet even as we do this, we must \nrecognize that the very volume of cargo moving through our seaports \nmakes it difficult to adequately guard against a potential terrorist \nattack.\n  Traditionally, our seaports are viewed as highly vulnerable targets \nfor terrorist attacks. They are open spaces, full of traffic, and \ndifficult to monitor. Yet an attack against one of our larger seaports \ncould dramatically impact our domestic economy by destroying cargo, \neliminating jobs, and shutting off trading routes to other shippers.\n  Unfortunately, we have let our guard down with respect to our \nseaports by failing to adequately address the potential for a terrorist \nattack. We know how important our seaports are to our national and \nglobal economy, yet at best, inspectors are able to examine only about \ntwo percent of the cargo that passes through our seaports. This means \nthat the vast majority of cargo entering our seaports is not inspected \nbefore the containers are allowed to move throughout the country. We \ncan, and must, do better.\n  We must improve the quality of and deployment of detection technology \nand we must make sure that those who guard our seaports are equipped to \nprevent an attack. We have technology that scans containers to look for \nsuspicious materials and shipments. It is in place right now, but not \nat all our seaports and not even at all of the largest seaports. We \nneed to expand the deployment of this type of technology, and make sure \nall our seaports are equipped with the best available scanning \ntechnology. We must also make sure that the Coast Guard has the \nmanpower and equipment it needs to protect our coast and ports and to \nrespond in the event of an attack.\n  I am so pleased that we are passing the Port Security Bill. This is \nan extremely important piece of legislation and an important component \nof our national defense.\n  I would like to take this moment to thank Chairman Hollings for \nworking with me on several amendments I had to this important bill.\n  When the Commerce Committee held hearings on port security back in \nJuly, I raised several issues with the witnesses about the security of \nour ports and the ability to protect against a possible terrorist \nthreat. I have been working since then to develop legislation to \naddress some of the concerns I had that were confirmed at the hearing.\n  When the Commerce Committee marked up its port security bill in early \nAugust, I received assurances from Chairman Hollings that we would \ncontinue to work to make sure my concerns were addressed when the bill \ncame to the Senate floor. At that time, we of course had no idea that \nour country was only a month away from such a horrendous terrorist \nattack.\n  But I am pleased that we are now taking up this bill. It will make \nour seaports and our nation safer. And I want to again thank the \nChairman and Ranking Member for working with me on these amendments and \nfor including them in the final bill.\n  Specifically, these amendments will: improve our ability to safely \nhandle cargo entering our country; provide the Coast Guard with \nadditional anti-terrorism resources to protect domestic ports; and \nprovide for the most modern security technology to be deployed in \nseaports.\n  My first amendment is an anti-tampering amendment that will ensure \nthat the cargo we accept in our country has not been altered or \ninterfered with. The amendment improves port security by allowing \nCustoms to work with ocean shippers to better coordinate the tracking \nof cargo in our ports and across our country. It will improve security \nby enabling Customs to better assist shippers in preventing cargo \ntampering and cargo theft. It will also improve security by enabling \nCustoms to track containers as they move cross-country to ensure that \nthey are not diverted for criminal or terrorist purposes.\n  My second amendment establishes Port and Maritime Security Teams, \nteams of Coast Guard personnel with training in anti-terrorism, drug \ninterdiction, and navigation assistance. These units will operate high-\nspeed boats that are equipped to patrol our coastal waters and respond \nimmediately to terrorist or other criminal threats to our coast and \nseaports. Similar teams are already used to protect U.S. vessels in \nforeign ports, my amendment brings them to our domestic defense.\n\n[[Page S13884]]\n\n  My final amendment will ensure that the best available technology is \ndeployed in our seaports to improve security, identify threats, and \nprevent terrorist attacks. The grant program would cover technologies \nto deal with such security risks as: explosives, firearms, weapons of \nmass destruction, chemical and biological weapons, drug and illegal \nalien smuggling, and trade fraud. This amendment is so important, \nbecause the type of cargo and containers that move through seaports are \nentirely different than what moves through our airports, and we need to \nmake sure we are developing technology that recognizes those \ndifferences. Only about 2 percent of the cargo entering our seaports is \ninspected, without better technology, we are leaving ourselves too \nvulnerable to those who would exploit our seaports for terrorist or \ncriminal activity.\n  Again, I would like to express my thanks to Chairman Hollings and \nSenator McCain for helping make sure that these amendments were \nincluded in the final bill and for making sure that we take aggressive \naction to protect our seaports.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2690\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with respect to the stimulus bill, let's \ngo right to the point. It really was not a stimulus at all. Over a \nmonth ago, Joseph Stiglitz wrote an article entitled ``A Boost That \nGoes Nowhere.'' I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 11, 2001]\n\n                       A Boost That Goes Nowhere\n\n                          (By Joseph Stiglitz)\n\n       The United States is in the midst of a recession that may \n     well turn out to be the worst in 20 years, and the \n     Republican-backed stimulus package will do little to improve \n     the economy-indeed it may make matters worse. In the short \n     term, unemployment will continue to rise and output will \n     fall. But the U.S. economy will eventually bounce back--\n     perhaps in a year or two. More worrying is the threat a \n     prolonged U.S. recession poses to the rest of the world.\n       Already we see inklings of the downward spiral that was \n     part of the Great Depression of 1929: Recession in Japan and \n     parts of East Asia and bare growth in Europe are contributing \n     to and aggravating the U.S. downturn.\n       Emerging countries stand to lost the most. Globalization \n     has been sold to people in the developing world as a promise \n     of unbounded prosperity--or at least more prosperity than \n     they have ever seen. Now the developing world, especially \n     Latin America, will see the darker side of its links to the \n     U.S. economy. It used to be said that when America sneezed, \n     Mexico caught a cold. Now, when America sneezes, much of the \n     world catches cold. And according to recent data, America is \n     not just sneezing, it has a bad case of the flu.\n       October unemployment figures show the largest monthly \n     increase in two decades. The gap between the United State's \n     potential gross domestic product--what it would be if we had \n     been able to maintain an unemployment rate of around 4 \n     percent--and what is actually being produced is enormous. By \n     my calculations, it is upwards of $350 billion a year! This \n     is an enormous waste of resources, a waste we can ill afford.\n       It is widely held that every expansion has within it the \n     seeds of its own destruction--and that the greater the \n     excesses, the worse the downturn. The Great Boom of the 1990s \n     had marked excesses. Irrational optimism has been followed by \n     an almost equally irrational pessimism. Consumer confidence \n     is at its lowest level in more than seven years. The low \n     personal savings rate that marked the Great Boom may put even \n     more pressure of consumers to cut back consumption now.\n       It seemed to me that we were headed for a recession even \n     before Sept. 11. In the coming months we will have the \n     numbers that make clear that we are squarely in one now. The \n     economic cost of the attacks went well beyond the direct loss \n     of property, or even the disruption to the airlines. \n     Anxieties impede investment. The mood of the country \n     discourages the consumption binge that would have been \n     required to offset the reduction in investment.\n       In any case, monetary policy--the Federal \n     Reserve's lowering of short-term interest rates to heat up \n     the economy--has been vastly oversold. Monetary policy is \n     far more effective in reining in the economy than in \n     stimulating it in a downturn, a fact that is slowly \n     becoming apparent as the economy continues to sink despite \n     a massive number of rate cuts; Tuesday's was the 10th this \n     year.\n       The Bush administration's tax cut, which was also oversold \n     as a stimulus, is likely to haunt the economy for years. Now \n     the consensus is that a new stimulus package is needed; the \n     president has ordered Congress to have one on his desk by the \n     end of the month. Much of the stimulus debate has focused on \n     the size of the package, but that is largely beside the \n     point. A lot of money was spent on the Bush tax cut. But the \n     $300 and $600 checks sent to millions of Americans were put \n     largely into savings accounts.\n       What worries me now is that the new proposals--particularly \n     the one passed by the Republican-controlled House--are also \n     likely to be ineffective. The House plan would rely heavily \n     on tax cuts for corporations and upper-income individuals. \n     The bill would put zero--yes, zero--into the hands of the \n     typical family of four with an annual income of $50,000. \n     Giving tax relief to corporations for past investments may \n     pad their balance sheets but will not lead to more investment \n     now when we need it. Bailouts for airlines didn't stop them \n     from laying off workers and adding to the country's \n     unemployment.\n       The Senate Republican bill, which the administration backs, \n     in some ways would make things even worse by granting bigger \n     benefits to very high earners. For instance, the $50,000 \n     family would still get zero, but this plan would give \n     $500,000 over four years to families making $5 million a \n     year--and much of that after (one hopes) the economy has \n     recovered. It directs very little money to those who would \n     spend it and offers few incentives for investment now.\n       It would not be difficult to construct a program with a \n     much bigger bang for the buck:\n       America's unemployment insurance system is among the worst \n     in the advanced industrial countries; give money to people \n     who have lost their jobs in this recession, and it would be \n     quickly spent.\n       Temporary investment tax credits also would help the \n     economy. They are like a sale--they induce firms to invest \n     now, when the economy needs it.\n       In every downturn, states and localities have to cut back \n     expenditures as their tax revenues fall, and these cutbacks \n     exacerbate the downturn. A revenue-sharing program with the \n     states could be put into place quickly and would prevent \n     these cutbacks, thus preserving vitally needed public \n     services. Many high-return public investments could be put \n     into place quickly--such as renovating our dilapidated inner-\n     city schools.\n       This may all sound like partisan (Democratic) economies, \n     but it's not. It's just elementary economics. If you really \n     don't think the economy needs a stimulus, either because you \n     think the economy is not going into a tailspin or because you \n     think monetary policy will do the trick, only then would you \n     risk a minimal-stimulus package of the kind the Republicans \n     have crafted in both the House and Senate.\n       But what matters is not just how I or other economists see \n     this: It matters how markets, both here and abroad, see \n     things. The fact that medium- and long-term bond rates (that \n     is, bonds that reach maturity in five or 10 years or more) \n     have not come down in tandem with short-term rates is not a \n     good sign. Nor is the possibility that the interest rates \n     some firms pay for borrowing for plant and equipment may \n     actually have increased.\n       In 1993, a plan of tax increases and expenditure cuts that \n     were phased in over time, providing, reassurances to the \n     market that future deficits would be lower, led to lower \n     long-term interest rates. It should come as no surprise, \n     then, that the Bush package, with its tax decreases and \n     expenditure increases, would do exactly the opposite. The \n     Federal Reserve controls the short-term interest rates--not \n     the medium- and long-term ones that firms pay when they \n     borrow money to invest, or that consumers pay when they \n     borrow to buy a house, which are still far\n\n[[Page S13885]]\n\n     higher than the short-term rate, which now stands at its \n     lowest level in 40 years. Whatever monetary policy does in \n     lowering short-term rates can be largely undone by an \n     administration's misguided fiscal policy, which can increase \n     that gap between short and long rates; that gap has widened \n     considerably.\n       Worse still, America has become dependent on borrowing from \n     abroad to finance our huge trade deficits; and the reduction \n     in the surplus is likely to exacerbate this (on average, the \n     two move together). If foreigners become even less confident \n     in America, they will shift their portfolio balance, putting \n     more of the money elsewhere. That adjustment process itself \n     could put strain on the U.S. economy. Before the terrorist \n     attacks, confidence abroad in America and the American \n     economy had eroded, with the bursting of the stock and dot-\n     com bubbles. The two remaining pillars of strength were the \n     quality of our economic management and our seeming safety. \n     Both of these have now been questioned--and the stimulus \n     package likely to become law has nothing to allay foreigners' \n     fears.\n       As a former White House and then World Bank official, I \n     have had the good (or bad) fortune to watch downturns and \n     recessions around the world. Two features are worth noting.\n       First, standard economic models perform particularly badly \n     at such times, they almost always underestimate the magnitude \n     of the downturn. One relies on these models only at one's \n     peril. The International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Treasury \n     badly underestimated the magnitude of the Asian downturns of \n     1997--and this mistake was at least partly responsible for \n     the disastrous IMF policies prescribed in Indonesia, Thailand \n     and elsewhere.\n       Second, there are long lags and irreversibilities: Once it \n     is clear that the downturn is deep, and a stronger dose of \n     medicine is administered, it takes six months to a year for \n     the effects to be fully felt. Meanwhile, the consequences can \n     be severe. The bankrupt firms do not become unbankrupt and \n     start functioning again.\n       Downturns are likely to be particularly severe when the \n     economy is hit by a series of adverse shocks. Market \n     economies such as ours are remarkably robust. They can \n     withstand a shock or two. But even before terrorism came \n     ashore, America had been hit badly. The attacks added \n     political uncertainty to the already great economic \n     uncertainty.\n       So here we are, facing a major downward spiral. This is \n     where eroding confidence in economic management comes into \n     play. John Maynard Keynes, the founder of modern \n     macroeconomics, (including the notion of the stimulus) \n     emphasized the importance and vagaries of investers' ``animal \n     spirits''--that is, the unpredictability of their optimism \n     and pessimism. But expectations, rational or irrational, \n     about the future are of no less importance to consumers. \n     Those who are worried about losing their jobs are more likely \n     to cut back on their spending and to save the proceeds from \n     any tax cuts.\n       It was great fun being part of the Great Expansion. Every \n     week brought new records--the lowest unemployment rate in a \n     quarter-century, the lowest inflation rate in two decades, \n     the lowest misery index in three. The good news fed on \n     itself, and the confidence helped fuel the expansion. We took \n     credit where we could, but I knew that much of this was good \n     luck--and the Clinton administration and Fed not messing \n     things up.\n       Now, every week brings new records in the other direction--\n     the largest increase in unemployment and decline in \n     manufacturing in two decades, the first quarterly fall in \n     consumer prices in nearly a half-century, the slowest growth \n     in nominal GDP in any two consecutive years since the 1930's. \n     Americans love records, but unfortunately, these new ones are \n     contributing to the already pervasive sense of anxiety. The \n     Bush administration will not try to claim credit for these \n     new records; rather, it will blame Sept. 11. Osama bin Laden \n     is a convenient excuse, but the data will show his murderous \n     henchmen were aiding and abetting at best: The economy was \n     already sliding toward recession.\n       I wish I could be more optimistic about our economy's \n     prospect. I worry that all of this naysaying will simply \n     contribute to the downturn. Perhaps I am wrong, and the \n     economy will, on its own, recover quickly.\n       But perhaps I am right. Then, without an effective \n     stimulus, the U.S. economy will sink deeper into recession, \n     and the rest of the world with it. An ineffective stimulus \n     could be even worse: It would harm budgetary prospects, \n     raising medium- and long-term interest rates. And when we see \n     the false claims for what they are, confidence in our economy \n     and in our economic management will deteriorate further. We \n     have had a first dose of this particular medicine. We hardly \n     need another.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, earlier this week USA Today had an \neditorial entitled ``Shopping for 2002 Votes, Dems, GOP Raid Surplus.''\n  I will read the last sentence:\n\n       In Washington, putting on a great show of activity to \n     demonstrate concern for anyone's economic hurt may seem to be \n     smart politics. But sometimes the best thing the government \n     can do is nothing. This is one such time.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the USA-Today, Dec. 17, 2001]\n\n            Shopping for 2002 Votes, Dems, GOP Raid Surplus\n\n\n  despite signs of economic recovery, congress insists on `stimulus'.\n\n       What's wrong with this picture?\n       Just two weeks ago, the White House announced that not only \n     have last winter's predictions of massive budget surpluses \n     evaporated, but major deficits are predicted for at least the \n     next three years, as well.\n       State governors from both parties are warning that \n     homeland-security needs are going unaddressed for lack of \n     funding.\n       Yet, instead of recognizing these new realities, Congress \n     and the White House are spending the last days before their \n     holiday recess trying to enact a hugely expensive ``economic \n     stimulus'' package that is packed with tax cuts and social \n     spending. And they're doing so even as the economy is showing \n     signs of recovering on its own.\n       Stimulus clearly is not more dangerous than the lack of \n     one. yet, instead of spiking the idea, congressional \n     Democrats and Republicans are seeking a compromise. Not \n     because the economy needs a jolt, but because each party sees \n     it as an opportunity to score some points in the 2002 \n     congressional campaigns:\n       House Republicans, on a largely party-line vote, passed a \n     $100-billion package of tax cuts targeted overwhelmingly at \n     corporations and individuals with incomes in the top 5% of \n     the nation, coincidentally among the biggest sources of \n     political contributions. The biggest tax breaks for business \n     weren't targeted at job creation but at refunding taxes \n     already paid as long ago as 1986. Many of the cuts for \n     individuals--questionable during a budget squeeze in any \n     case--wouldn't take effect until 2003, when the recession is \n     likely to be long over.\n       Senate Democrats are headlining a $600 tax rebate for \n     working-poor families that didn't earn enough to benefit from \n     last summer's income-tax rebates, as well as a one-month \n     holiday from payroll taxes. It's a nice appeal to their blue-\n     collar political base, but normally fractious economists \n     almost all agree it's no stimulus: Repeated studies show one-\n     shot cash windfalls are likely to go to reduce debt or \n     bolster savings, not to spending that would stimulate the \n     economy. Similarly, extending unemployment benefits and \n     helping to pay for health insurance sound like noble \n     objectives--but backdoor welfare, even if needed, is no kick-\n     start for a troubled marketplace.\n       The Bush administration murmurs piously about compromise, \n     but what the president and his aides are hinting at looks a \n     lot like the old Washington game: doling out the political \n     bonbons for both sides to claim victory, with little concern \n     for economic justification.\n       Meanwhile, the money just isn't there. The return to red \n     ink is so abrupt that the Treasury asked Tuesday for a hike \n     in the government's borrowoing limit, to a whopping $6.7 \n     trillion. The current ceiling, $5.95 trillion and just three \n     months ago headed rapidly downward, may be reached as soon as \n     February.\n       In Washington, putting on a great show of activity to \n     demonstrate concern for anyone's economic hurt may seem to be \n     smart politics. But sometimes the best thing the government \n     can do is nothing. This is one such time.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Wall Street Journal printed an \narticle earlier this week on Monday entitled, ``The Stimulus Fiasco.'' \nI ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 17, 2001]\n\n                          The Stimulus Fiasco\n\n       In the not-so-epic battle over fiscal ``stimulus,'' the \n     shouting has all come down to this: The White House is \n     demanding that the 27% income-tax rate, be cut to 25%, while \n     Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle is insisting on a mere \n     26%. Only in Washington would anyone believe that either one \n     is going to make much economic difference.\n       If this is all that the politicians can come up with, we \n     have a modest proposal: Pack it in. The economy will be \n     better off if President Bush calls the whole thing off and \n     instead focuses on abosrbing the lessons of this political \n     fiasco.\n       Not that we expect this to happen. The point of this \n     exercise long ago stopped being economic growth and became \n     political advantage. Mr. Bush wants to be able to sign \n     something--anything--he can call ``stimulus'' to show voters \n     he isn't like his father and cares about more than foreign \n     policy. Mr. Daschle knows this, so he wants to deny Mr. Bush \n     any tax cuts that might actually stimulate in favor of \n     loading up on tax rebates, jobless benefits, health-care \n     subsidies and other things that will redistribute income to \n     his political constituencies. And it looks as if he's going \n     to prevail.\n       This is clear from Mr. Bush's latest counter-offer last \n     week to Mr. Daschle dictating the terms of his own surrender. \n     Gone was the across-the-board acceleration of individual \n     income-tax rates that he originally wanted and that his own \n     economists believe would be the best economic medicine. Mr. \n     Bush is still requesting some corporate tax\n\n[[Page S13886]]\n\n     relief, such as a temporary speedup in depreciation and \n     scaling back the corporate alternative minimum tax. But these \n     will only pad business balance sheets for a while and do \n     little to alter long-term incentives. Meanwhile, the \n     President gave in to Mr. Daschle on tax rebates for low-in-\n     come Americans who didn't get them last summer--that is, for \n     people who pay little or no income tax anyway.\n       What really matters now is not whether a deal is struck \n     this week but what lessons Mr. Bush learns from his looming \n     defeat. We'd suggest at least two. The first is that only \n     thing bipartisan abut Mr. Daschle is his smile. Like his \n     mentor, George Mitchell, who destroyed Mr. Bush's father, Mr. \n     Daschle wants to make Mr. Bush a one-term President. Rumors \n     abound that the South Dakotan plans to run himself, but even \n     if he doesn't he represents a Senate Caucus loaded with other \n     potential candidates (John Kerry, Joe Lieberman, John \n     Edwards, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden).\n       All of them are pursuing the Daschle strategy of wrapping \n     their arms around a popular President on the war. But on \n     domestic policy they are competing against one another for \n     advantage among the Democratic Party's liberal interest \n     groups. This critical mass of Presidential ambition is \n     inevitably pulling the entire Democratic Senate to the left. \n     In the stimulus debate, it explains why Mr. Daschle \n     established the absurd condition that any ``bipartisan'' \n     compromise had to be supported by two-thirds of all Senate \n     Democrats. That means any 17 Democrats can kill anything, and \n     there are more than enough Caucus liberals to do that.\n       If Mr. Bush wants to know where Democrats will go next, all \n     he had to do was watch Mrs. Clinton a week ago Sunday on \n     NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' While praising Mr. Bush to the \n     skies on the war, she also came out for repealing the tax \n     cuts that the Congress already passed this summer. By not \n     fighting harder to accelerate all of his rate cuts now, the \n     President has left himself open to a three-year defensive \n     battle to keep what he's already won.\n       Mr. Bush might as well recognize this now and plan \n     accordingly. The only way he will get anything done in the \n     Senate between now and 2004 is to move public opinion on the \n     issues or beat Democrats at the polls in 2002. The worst \n     habit in this environment is to negotiate with yourself, \n     which is what has happened to Mr. Bush on ``stimulus.'' The \n     President first gave Democrats $40 billion in new spending, \n     but got no tax promises in return. Then he conceded on \n     jobless benefits, but also got nothing, then on tax rebates, \n     for which Mr. Daschle seems to have handed him only the token \n     one-percentage point cut in the 27% rate.\n       The second lesson is that Mr. Bush's economic team failed \n     him. Counselor Larry Lindsey gave him outdated Keynesian \n     advice, assuring him against all evidence that tax rebates \n     would spur growth. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill has \n     provided no direction that we've noticed, offering only \n     tentative counsel on policy and tripping over his own tongue \n     on the politics. If this team were running the war in \n     Afghanistan, the Marines would be the ones surrounded at Tora \n     Bora.\n       The silver lining is that the economy may recover on its \n     own without any fiscal stimulus. Ed Hymen of the ISI Group \n     says he sees more signs of recovery by the week, oil prices \n     are down and the Fed has provided ample liquidity (maybe too \n     much if you look at the 10-year Treasury bond rate that \n     hasn't fallen with Fed easing). This means Mr. Bush can \n     afford to reject the phony stimulus that is now emerging from \n     Congress. But in the long run he owes Americans coping with \n     hard times a better domestic political strategy and a \n     stronger economic team.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will read the last sentence:\n\n       But in the long run [Mr. Bush] owes Americans coping with \n     hard times a better domestic political strategy and a \n     stronger economic team.\n\n  That is the first time I heard the Wall Street Journal ask for a \nstronger economic team. The reason is because we are in deep trouble.\n  We ended up last fiscal year, which ended just 3 months ago, on \nSeptember 30 with a deficit of $141 billion. That was not as a result \nof September 11.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a Wall Street Journal \neditorial dated August 16.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 16, 2001]\n\n            Nasdaq Companies' Losses Erase 5 Years of Profit\n\n                           (By Steve Liesman)\n\n       Mounting losses have wiped out all the corporate profits \n     from the technology-stock boom of the late 1990s, which could \n     make the road back to the previous level of profitability \n     longer and harder than previously estimated.\n       The massive losses reported over the most recent four \n     quarters by companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market have \n     erased five years' worth of profits, according to figures \n     from investment-research company Multex.com that were \n     analyzed by The Wall Street Journal.\n       Put another way, the companies currently listed on the \n     market that symbolized the New Economy haven't made a \n     collective dime since the fall of 1995, when Intel introduced \n     the 200-megahertz computer chip, Bill Clinton was in his \n     first term in office and the O.J. Simpson trial obsessed the \n     nation. ``What it means is that with the benefit of \n     hindsight, the late '90s never happened,'' says Robert \n     Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Co.\n       The Wall Street Journal analysis looked at earnings \n     excluding extraordinary items going back to September 1995 \n     for about 4,200 companies listed on Nasdaq, which is heavily \n     weighted toward technology stocks but also includes hundreds \n     of financial and other growth companies. For the most \n     recently reported four quarters, those companies tallied \n     $148.3 billion in losses. That roughly equaled the $145.3 \n     billion in profit before extraordinary items these companies \n     have reported since September 1995. Because companies have \n     different quarter-ending dates, the analysis doesn't entirely \n     correspond to calendar quarters.\n       Large charges that aren't considered extraordinary items \n     were responsible for much of the red ink, including \n     restructuring expenses and huge write-downs of inventories \n     and assets acquired at high prices during the technology \n     bubble.\n       Analysts, economists and accountants say these losses raise \n     significant doubts about both the quality of past reported \n     earnings and the potential future profit growth for these \n     companies. Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at \n     Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, said the losses raise the question \n     of ``whether the Nasdaq is still too expensive. These \n     companies aren't going to give us the kind of awesome \n     performance they did in the '90s, because a lot of it wasn't \n     really sustainable.''\n       The Nasdaq Composite Index stood at around 1043 in \n     September 1995, soared to 5048.62 in March 2000 and now \n     stands at 1918.89. Because companies in the Nasdaq Composite \n     Index now have a cumuluative loss, for the first time in \n     memory the Nasdaq's value can't be gauged using the popular \n     price-earnings ratio, which divides the price of stocks by \n     their earnings. That means it is impossible to say whether \n     the market is cheap or expensive in historical terms.\n       The extent of the losses surprised a senior Nasdaq \n     official, who asked not to be named. ``I wouldn't have \n     thought they were that high,'' he said.\n       Nasdaq spokesman Andrew MacMillan, while not disputing the \n     losses, pointed to the $1.5 trillion in revenue Nasdaq \n     companies generated over the past year, saying that \n     represented ``a huge contribution to the economy, to \n     productivity, and to people's lives . . . regardless of \n     what's happening to the bottom line during a rough business \n     cycle.''\n       Satya Pradhuman, director of small-capitalization research \n     at Merrill Lynch, says the recent massive losses tell a story \n     of a market where investors became focused on revenue instead \n     of earnings. With billions of dollars in financing chasing \n     every glimmer of an Internet idea, Mr. Pradhuman says, a lot \n     of companies came to market long before they were ready.\n       ``The underwriting was very aggressive, so earlier-stage \n     companies came to market than the kind of companies that came \n     to market five or 10 years ago,'' he adds. He believes there \n     is plenty of potential profitability out there in this crop \n     of young companies, But, he notes, ``only among those that \n     survive.''\n       The data show that the very companies whose technology \n     products were supposed to boost productivity and help smooth \n     out the business cycle by providing better information have \n     been among the hardest-hit in this economic slowdown. \n     ``Management got caught up with how smart they were and \n     completely forgot about the business cycle and competition,'' \n     says Mr. Yardeni. ``They were managed for only ongoing \n     success.''\n       To be sure, some of Nasdaq's largest star-powered companies \n     earned substantial sums over the period. Intel led the pack \n     with $37.6 billion in profit before extraordinary items since \n     September 1995, followed closely by Microsoft's $34.6 billion \n     in earnings. Together, the 20 most profitable companies \n     earned $153.3 billion, compared with losses of $140.9 billion \n     for the 20 least profitable. Included in the losses was a \n     $44.8 billion write-down of acquisitions by JDS Uniphase and \n     an $11.2 billion charge by VeriSign, also to reduce the value \n     on its book of companies it had bought with its high-price \n     stock.\n       These charges lead some analysts and economies to believe \n     that including these losses overstates the magnitude of the \n     decline. According to generally accepted accounting \n     principles, these write-offs are treated as regular expenses. \n     But corporate executives say they should be treated as one-\n     time items. ``It's an accounting entry rather than a true \n     loss,'' maintains Bill Dudley, chief U.S. economist at \n     Goldman Sachs Group.\n       Removing these unusual charges, the losses over the most \n     recently reported four quarters shrink to $6.5 billion on a \n     before-tax basis. By writing down the value of assets, \n     companies have used the slowdown to clean up their balance \n     sheets, a move that should allow them to move forward with a \n     smaller expense base and could pump up future earnings.\n       ``It sets the table for future dramatic growth,'' says \n     independent accounting analyst Jack Ciesielski. Because of \n     the write-downs, ``when the natural cycle begins again,\n\n[[Page S13887]]\n\n     the returns on assets and returns on equity will look \n     fantastic.'' But Mr. Ciesielski adds that this benefit will \n     be short-lived.\n       Cicso Systems in the first quarter took a $2.25 billion \n     pretax inventory charge. This quarter, it partly reversed \n     that write-down taking a gain of $187 million from the \n     revaluation of the previously written-down inventory. The \n     reversal pushed Cisco into the black.\n       But Mr. Barbera warns that investors shouldn't be so quick \n     to ignore the unusual charges. For example, during good times \n     it wasn't unusual for companies to book large gains from \n     investments in other companies. Now that the value of those \n     investments are under water, companies are calling the losses \n     unusual. ``If they are going to exclude the unusual losses, \n     then they should exclude the unusual gains,'' says Mr. \n     Barbera.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I read from the article:\n\n       The Wall Street Journal analysis looked at earnings \n     excluding extraordinary items going back to September 1995 \n     for about 4,200 companies listed on Nasdaq, which is heavily \n     weighted toward technology stocks, but also includes hundreds \n     of financial and other growth companies. For the most \n     recently reported four quarters those companies tallied \n     $148.3 billion in losses. That roughly equaled the $145.3 \n     billion in profit before extraordinary items these companies \n     have reported since September 1995.\n\n  It is as if the last 5 years never occurred. What did I have to \nlisten to as a long-time member of the Budget Committee? Surpluses as \nfar as the eye can see, they said in June when the President signed the \n$2.3 trillion tax cut. I want to say it right as a Senator saying we \nought to be increasing revenues, paying our way.\n  I see the distinguished former Governor of Florida in the Chamber. We \ncould not get by as Governors in our States unless we had a triple-A \ncredit rating. None of these industries are going to expand and come to \nus at all.\n  What really hearkened this particular Senator because we never seem \nto learn. The same act, same scene 20 years ago: David Stockman, the \nhead of President Reagan's economic team, the Director of his Office of \nManagement and Budget, in his book, ``The Triumph of Politics,'' talks \nabout the Trojan horse, growth-growth, Kemp-Roth, and what we had \nentitled ``voodoo No. 1.'' Now we have voodoo No. 2. Referring to \nvoodoo No. 1 on page 342, at the end of the year in November after they \npassed the tax cuts, we immediately went into recession, which is \nexactly what has happened in the year 2001.\n  I quote:\n\n       [President Reagan] had no choice but to repeal, or \n     substantially dilute, the tax cut.\n\n  Can you imagine that?\n\n       He had no choice but to repeal, or substantially dilute, \n     the tax cut. That would have gone far toward restoring the \n     stability of the strongest capitalist economy in the world. \n     It would have been a great act of statesmanship to have \n     admitted the error back then, but in the end it proved too \n     mean a test. In November 1981, Ronald Reagan chose not to be \n     a leader but a politician, and in so doing he showed why \n     passion and imperfection, not reason and doctrine, rule the \n     world. His obstinacy was destined to keep America's economy \n     hostage to the errors of his advisers for a long time.\n\n  That is exactly our dilemma now. For those who regret the non-passage \nof the stimulus bill, go to Sunday school and thank the Good Lord \nbecause--as Stiglitz said and as the USA Today said and as the Wall \nStreet Journal said and now as Dave Stockman said 20 years ago--we \nought to be removing those tax cuts, repealing that $2.3 trillion.\n  It is not the confidence of consumers, it is the confidence of the \nmarket. The money boys who really govern the economic affairs of this \ncountry--the $2 trillion is still going to be lost.\n  How much are we up? I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record, \nthe deficit to the penny as included by none other than the Secretary \nof Treasury.\n  It is entitled the Public Debt to the Penny. That is the Secretary of \nthe Treasury. I ask unanimous consent that this document be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          THE

S13888]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We are already $76 billion in the red in addition to \nthe $141 billion we ended up in the red this last fiscal year. We had \nto listen to Alan Greenspan say, ``Oh, wait a minute; we might pay off \nthe debt too quick.''\n  We had $5.6 trillion and surpluses as far as the eye could see, and \nnow what do they need to do? They need to increase the debt limit. They \nasked us the other day, let us increase the debt limit.\n  The debt limit, according to the budget and economic outlook for \nfiscal years at the beginning of the year, they said, and I quote: \n``Under those projections, the debt ceiling would be reached in 2009.'' \nThat is what they told us 11 months ago, that in 2009 the debt limit \nwas going to be reached. The first order of business when we come back \nin January and February is to increase the debt limit, all on account \nof a rosy scenario, all on account of--what do they call it?--voodoo \nnumber two.\n  We better sober up and start paying the bill in Washington.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13888-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13888-S13893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LACK OF ACTION ON STIMULUS BILL\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am happy to be able to have some time \nto comment on the fact the Senate is not bringing up the stimulus \npackage. It is to my chagrin, after all the hard work Senator Baucus \nand I have put into these negotiations. Albeit what we have in front of \nus is not a product of a conference committee, it is still a White \nHouse bipartisan compromise, a White House Centrist compromise, that \nwould get a majority vote of the Senate if we had actually had an \nopportunity to vote on it.\n  In normal circumstances, I would not be one to say we ought to pass a \nHouse bill. These are, however, not normal times and this is not a \nnormal process. Some will say this is a House product that needs to be \namended and debated. That assertion, while technically accurate, does \nnot capture the essence of our situation today or right now that we are \nin a war on terrorism.\n  The House bill is really the product of an agreement between the \nWhite House and Senate Centrists so I am going to call the House bill \nwhat it really is. It is a White House Centrist agreement, if you are \nlooking for a bipartisan, bicameral product the President will sign. \nThe President said he would sign this. This agreement is the only game \nin town.\n  To anyone opposing this agreement, including the Democrat leadership, \nI ask them to show me where they are being bipartisan. All I have seen \nfrom the leadership throughout this process is an iron fist cloaked in \na velvet glove.\n  Today, we did witness, with the objection to consideration of the \nstimulus package, the iron fist clothed in an eloquent velvet glove, \ndisplayed once again, similar to what we have done on other issues like \ninsurance and like a stimulus package earlier on.\n\n  Today that iron fist smashed the White House Centrist agreement. The \nAmerican people will not be well served by the destruction of the White \nHouse Centrist agreement. All it means is that after 3 months of long \nmeetings, committee action, floor debates, we, the Senate, will not \ndeliver to the American people.\n  The House has delivered. The President has delivered. One has to \nwonder, then, why are we stuck? If we can get a bipartisan majority in \nthe Senate, action by the House and a signature by the President, why \ndoes a partisan minority of the majority party decide to thwart the \nwill of the people? Why, especially now?\n  Our Nation is in a state of war on terrorism. Our President is \nnecessarily occupied as Commander in Chief to run that war. Why, on a \nmatter of economic stimulus and aid to dislocated workers, did the \nPresident have to come to the Hill yesterday to try and break a logjam? \nWhy did the Democratic leadership give his effort the back of their \nhand? Why did the bipartisan objectives go by the wayside? I will take \na few minutes to talk about how we got here.\n  Shortly after September 11, we started out with meetings with \nChairman Greenspan and other economic policymakers. For the most part, \nthey were called by the good chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \nSenator Baucus. In that period, right after September 11, the President \ntook first steps and took the risk by committing to a stimulus package, \nfully aware we might be going in the budget ``red'' if we did.\n  We should not discount this leadership by the President. Certainly it \ntook courage, and it was the right thing to do. Chairman Greenspan also \ntook the lead and gave the ``Greenspan green light'' to pursue a \nstimulus package. It seemed everyone realized our responsibility was to \nheed the President's directive and Greenspan's advice. Both of these \nmen said Congress should address the economic slowdown. They told us \nthe slowdown started over 1 year ago. Subsequently, the National Board \nof Economic Research told us the economy might have recovered but for \nthe September 11 attack.\n  The President took the lead in meeting needs of dislocated workers. \nHe proposed extension of unemployment insurance benefits. He also \nproposed providing health care benefits through the National Emergency \nGrants.\n  In addition, the President proposed, as a concession to the other \nparty, a new round of rebate collection to those who do not pay income \ntax.\n  Was there any reciprocation, any movement from the Democratic \nleadership? No.\n  President Bush, much to the consternation of many in the Republican \nParty, took capital gains tax off the table because it was not well \nreceived by Democrats. Was there any reciprocation on the part of the \nDemocratic leadership? No.\n  This is not to say we did not agree on some things. Bonus \ndepreciation, for instance, was agreed to by each side. Although we did \nnot have it in our caucus position, Republicans agreed with Democrats \non liberalizing the net operating loss rules and expensing for small \nbusiness.\n  I do not also discount the ideologically based opposition to \naccelerating the reduction of the 27 percent bracket, but it is amazing \nto me that many on the other side see taxpayers in the 27 percent \nbracket as rich people.\n  A 2 percent rate cut for single folks earning between $27,000 and \n$65,000 is seen as a tax cut for the very wealthy by the Democrat \nleadership. Likewise, a married couple with incomes between $45,000 and \n$109,000 are considered rich. I recognize this tax cut proposal was \ndifficult for the Democratic leadership to accept. After a series of \nbipartisan, bicameral talks, the House went its own way with a bill; \ntoo heavy for me on corporate AMT. It passed by just two votes.\n  The Senate Democratic leadership responded in kind. The result was a \nDemocratic Caucus partisan position paper reduced to legislation they \nrammed through our Finance Committee on a party line vote. That bill \ndead ended in the Senate. The reason is the bill was designed for \npartisan point making. Its partisan design was its weakness in an \ninstitution like the Senate where one only gets things done on a \nbipartisan basis. That design guaranteed its failure.\n  We could have ended there, but the President forced us back into \naction. Frankly, the House also yielded on a very bad bill they first \npassed.\n  The result was a quasi-conference environment to work out \ndifferences. By virtue of this quasi-conference, my friends Jay \nRockefeller and Max Baucus, our chairman, and I spent many long hours \ndebating the merits of economic stimulus and aid to dislocated workers. \nIn many ways, the discussions were vigorous exchanges of views with our \nHouse colleagues. A lot of that discussion was healthy, and some of it \nhelped move the process along.\n  Little real progress was made. Once again, the President intervened \nand endorsed the Senate Centrist position. Eventually, the House \nleadership came toward the Centrist position because they wanted to \nfind a way to get a bill through the Senate, and that can only be done \nif it is done on a bipartisan basis. Even with movement to the Centrist \nposition, the quasi-conference was at an impasse. Senator Daschle's \nedict about 3 weeks ago that one-third of his caucus could veto a \nstimulus plan came into clear focus. The sentiments of the House or \nWhite House, let alone the sentiments of Joe Six-pack out there\n\n[[Page S13889]]\n\nworking every day to pay taxes, were less important than the opinion of \na minority of the Democratic Senators, which would be as few as 18. The \nfailure to obtain a super-majority in the Democratic caucus then \nimperiled this Centrist package, this Centrist bipartisan package.\n  In the end, the impasse came not from tax cuts. Republicans moved far \noff their priorities so that tax cuts were not the deal breaker. The \nimpasse was not over unemployment benefits. Republicans had largely \nmoved to the Democratic position. The impasse was not over the amount \nof the health care benefit package. Again, though the benefit came in \nthe form of a tax credit, Republicans moved toward a Democratic \nposition on the costs of health care benefits.\n  Bizarre as it may seem, the whole agreement broke down over some \nideological position on the eligibility of people for health insurance \nfor the unemployed through just COBRA. The impasse came down not over \nwhether to help these workers. The White House Centrist agreement \ncovered these workers with a tax credit. The Senate Democratic bill \ncovers these workers with a new entitlement. Basically, a super-\nmajority of Democrats would not agree to let laid-off workers have the \nchoice of where they wanted to get their health care benefits. But they \ncould still get their health care benefits with the same tax credit.\n  The bottom line is the White House-Centrist agreement does not meet \nthe two-thirds litmus test set for the Democratic caucus by the leader.\n  One has to wonder, why leave all of these good things in the White \nHouse-Centrist agreement on the Senate cutting room floor, as just \nhappened about an hour ago? We have before the Senate revolutionary \nsocial policies. For the first time, Members have sign-able legislation \nthat guarantees health care benefits for laid-off workers--the biggest \nchange in policy for dislocated workers since unemployment insurance \nwas passed in the 1930s.\n  We have, in the bill that was objected to, extended unemployment \nbenefits as we have done several times in the last 50 years. We have a \nrobust stimulus package with 30 percent bonus depreciation. We have an \nextension of expiring tax provisions for 2 years. We have the victims \nof terrorism tax relief and tax incentives to build New York City once \nagain.\n  All of these are good provisions which enjoy broad bipartisan \nsupport. They are the foundation of the White House-Centrist agreement. \nYet because of this ideological fixation, all of these good things now \ngo by the wayside until we return 1 month from now on January 23. While \nwe are going to be enjoying Christmas, these dislocated workers who \ncould have been guaranteed health benefits and further unemployment \ncompensation are going to go away empty handed.\n\n  I will look at each key player in the process and see how much \nmovement there has been. Common sense says those who want a deal will \nshow movement. By the same token, those who do not want a deal will not \nmove.\n  Start with the President. As I said, he made several key moves. He \nput the dollars on the table, knowing it would complicate the fiscal \nyear 2002 budget. He took capital gains off the table. He put the \npayroll tax rebates on the table. He put the unemployment insurance and \nhealth care benefits on the table. Finally, he endorsed even a plan \nthat went much further in the case of health care benefits, from $3 \nbillion up to $19 billion. That is in the White House-Centrist \nagreement.\n  When you look at the record, it is clear to me that the President of \nthe United States wanted a deal, an economic security package for \ndislocated workers and to help create jobs for those who do not have \njobs.\n  At the House of Representatives, I agree that the first bill, as I \nsaid before, from that body was too heavy on the corporate alternative \nminimum tax. But the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee made many \ngestures to the other side. For instance, he did not pick and choose \namong extenders. He included the payroll tax rebate that many of his \nMembers in the other body opposed. The chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee increased the resources for unemployment compensation and \nhealth care benefits. If you doubt me on the seriousness of that \nmovement, ask many in my caucus their opinion of those proposals. If \nyou look at the record, the House Republicans moved and ultimately \nended up as part of the White House-Centrist agreement.\n  Senate Republicans had a caucus position very close to the \nPresident's plan. Like the President, Senate Republicans, especially \nour leader, Senator Lott, constantly worked to try to get a deal. As \nthe President moved, so did the Senate Republican caucus position move. \nThat is in the Record.\n  That brings us to the last and ultimate critical player. Obviously, \nthat is the Senate Democratic leadership. I ask, where has the Senate \nDemocratic leadership really moved? At every stage of the process, \nwhether it is the Finance Committee action, whether the action on the \nfloor, or even the quasi-conference, ultimately we find this leadership \nposition always saying ``no''. Everyone else was saying ``yes''.\n  Now there is a good game being talked by the other side. They say \nthey want an agreement. That is the elegant velvet glove they are noted \nfor, but where is the action? The action today was ``no'' on unanimous \nconsent request. But look at the whole last 3 months on this issue. \nWhere have they moved? If you want an agreement, you have to see \nmovement. There has been none.\n  One has to ask, with so many good provisions in this White House-\nCentrist agreement, why should the Democratic leadership want to kill \nit? The President has expressed that polling data, political \nconsultants, and union officials had a big impact on the Senate \nDemocratic leadership strategy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial \nfrom the Wall Street Journal that states in depth what the consultants \nsay.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                           President Daschle\n\n       One of the more amusing Washington themes of late has been \n     the alleged revival of the Imperial Presidency, with George \n     W. Bush said to be wielding vast, unprecedented powers. Too \n     bad no one seems to have let Senate Majority Leader Tom \n     Daschle in on this secret.\n       Because from where we sit Mr. Daschle is the politician \n     wielding by far the most Beltway clout, and in spectacularly \n     partisan fashion. The South Dakotan's political strategy is \n     obvious if cynical: He's wrapping his arms tight around a \n     popular President on the war and foreign policy, but on the \n     domestic front he's conducting his own guerrilla war against \n     Mr. Bush, blocking the President's agenda at every turn. And \n     so far he's getting away with it.\n       Mr. Bush has asked Congress to pass three main items before \n     it adjourns for the year: Trade promotion authority, and \n     energy and economic stimulus bills. Mr. Daschle has so far \n     refused to negotiate on any of them, and on two he won't even \n     allow votes. Instead he is moving ahead with a farm bill (see \n     below) the White House opposes, and a railroad retirement \n     bill that is vital to no one but the AFL-CIO.\n       Just yesterday Mr. Daschle announced that ``I don't know \n     that we'll have the opportunity'' to call up an energy bill \n     until next year. One might think that after September 11 U.S. \n     energy production would be a war priority. In September alone \n     the U.S. imported 1.2 million barrels of oil a day from Iraq, \n     which we soon may be fighting, the highest rate since just \n     before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990.\n       But Mr. Daschle is blocking a vote precisely because he \n     knows Alaskan oil drilling has the votes to pass; earlier \n     this autumn he pulled the bill from Senator Jeff Bingaman's \n     Energy Committee when he saw it had the votes. So much for \n     the new spirit of Beltway cooperation.\n       We're not so naive as to think that war will, or should, \n     end partisan disagreement. But what's striking now is that \n     Mr. Daschle is letting his liberal Old Bulls break even the \n     agreements they've already made with the White House. Mr. \n     Bush shook hands weeks ago on an Oval Office education deal \n     with Teddy Kennedy, but now we hear that Mr. Kennedy wants \n     even more spending before he'll sign on. Mr. Daschle is \n     letting Ted have his way.\n       The same goes for the $686 billion annual spending limit \n     that Democrats struck with Mr. Bush after September 11. \n     That's a 7% increase from a year earlier (since padded by a \n     $40 billion bipartisan addition), and Democrats made a \n     public fanfare that Mr. Bush had endorsed this for fear \n     some Republicans might use it against them in next year's \n     elections. But now Mr. Daschle is using the issue against \n     Mr. Bush, refusing to even discuss an economic stimulus \n     bill unless West Virginia Democrat Bob Byrd gets his \n     demand for another $15 billion in domestic spending.\n       Mr. Byrd, a former majority leader who thinks of Mr. \n     Daschle as his junior partner,\n\n[[Page S13890]]\n\n     may even attach his wish list to the Defense spending bill. \n     That would force Mr. Bush to either veto and forfeit much-\n     needed money for defense, or sign it and swallow Mr. Byrd's \n     megapork for Amtrak and Alaskan airport subsidies.\n       All of this adds to the suspicion that Mr. Daschle is only \n     too happy to see no stimulus bill at all. He knows the party \n     holding the White House usually gets most of the blame for a \n     bad economy, so his Democrats can pad their Senate majority \n     next year by blaming Republicans. This is the same strategy \n     that former Democratic leader George Mitchell pursued in \n     blocking a tax cut during the early 1990s and then blaming \n     George H.W. Bush for the recession. Mr. Mitchell's conigliere \n     at the time? Tom Daschle.\n       It is certainly true that Republicans have often helped Mr. \n     Daschle's guerrilla campaign. Alaska's Ted Stevens is Bob \n     Byrd's bosom spending buddy; he's pounded White House budget \n     director Mitch Daniels for daring to speak the truth about \n     his pork. And GPO leader Trent Lott contributed to the \n     airline-security rout by letting his Members run for cover.\n       The issue now is whether Mr. Bush will continue to let \n     himself get pushed around. Mr. Daschle is behaving badly \n     because he's assumed the President won't challenge him for \n     fear of losing bipartisan support on the war. But this makes \n     no political sense: As long as Mr. Bush's war management is \n     popular, Mr. Daschle isn't about to challenge him on foreign \n     affairs.\n       The greater risk to Mr. Bush's popularity and success isn't \n     from clashing with the Daschle Democrats over tax cuts or oil \n     drilling. It's from giving the impression that on everything \n     about the war, Tom Daschle might as well be President.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a portion of a November 13 memo from Democracy \nCorps regarding the economic stimulus proposals.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Politics After the Attack--A Report on Democracy Corps' New National \nSurvey and Focus Groups\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                         the economic stimulus\n\n       Voters do not currently bring a strong partisan filter to \n     the various economic proposals being considered. Nonetheless, \n     a majority support every Democratic proposal; in fact, two-\n     thirds favor every Democratic proposal but one (the tax \n     rebate). Overall, the Democratic proposal does better than \n     the Republican--particularly those features that have led the \n     public debate, like the Alternative Minimum Tax.\n       Across the Democratic and Republican packages, the \n     strongest support is for unemployment benefits for the newly \n     unemployed; delaying tax cuts for the wealthiest one percent \n     in order to fund rebuilding and Social Security; funding \n     ready-to-go infrastructure to create jobs; accelerating \n     already scheduled broad middle class tax cuts; Cobra health \n     insurance for the newly unemployed; and tax incentives for \n     business if clearly linked to new investment.\n       The public rallies to four elements of the Democratic plan. \n     The starting point is the immediate construction program, \n     including airport improvements and school modernization to \n     create jobs. That has the broadest support (85 percent) and \n     nearly the most intense--48 percent strongly supportive.\n       There is strong support for delaying the tax cuts for the \n     top one percent (those earning more than $375,000 a year) in \n     order to fund the rebuilding and security and to make sure we \n     do not keep borrowing from the Social Security trust fund. \n     Two-thirds of the electorate favors this proposal, but most \n     important, more than half (51 percent) strongly favor it--the \n     highest for any Democratic proposal. One person noted that \n     they used to laugh about the ``Social Security lock box,'' \n     ``Well, there it goes. . . . Well, that's all our money.'' \n     That sentiment reverberated across the groups: ``It's not \n     their money anyhow''; ``that's what we paid into for our own \n     security, [and] that's not something they should say, well, \n     we got this money here, we can use it however we want.'' And \n     some said, ``I mean don't delay, just eliminate that tax cut \n     for these people.''\n       Cobra coverage health care for the newly unemployed stands \n     out, on its own, as a very important thing to do at this \n     moment. People understand the rising cost of health care and \n     how expensive coverage can be for anyone.\n       It is important to underscore that three-quarters of the \n     public favors a Democratic proposal for business tax \n     incentives to encourage investment in new plants and \n     equipment. The public wants tax breaks, including for \n     business, if the provision is linked to investment, not \n     simply consumption. People are looking for initiatives, \n     consistent with this new period. One of the participants \n     observed, ``The tax cut is tied to investment to encourage \n     them to move forward, not just a blanket.''\n       Unemployment benefits for the newly unemployed are \n     immensely popular. When offered by the Republicans and \n     targeted at those who have lost their jobs after September \n     11th, 85 percent favor the idea, including 53 percent who \n     strongly favor it. Presented with an expansive Democratic \n     proposal--extending benefits to 26 weeks, while raising \n     weekly benefits and covering part-time employees--more than \n     two-thirds support it, but less enthusiastically.\n       In the focus groups, many participants worried that such an \n     expansive proposal might re-open the old welfare system. That \n     is why the unemployment proposals should be part of a broad \n     Democratic economic package.\n       On taxes, voters offer a fairly consistent posture, whether \n     offered by Democrats or Republicans. They support business \n     tax cuts, even a capital gains tax cut, when it includes the \n     wording, ``in order to encourage investment.'' Voters seem to \n     support an accelerated schedule for tax cuts aimed at the \n     middle class--such as the marriage penalty. But there is \n     little enthusiasm for the tax rebate whether proposed by \n     Democrats or by Republicans--just 56 percent. The weak \n     reaction to the rebate reflects our earlier observations--a \n     citizenry focused on addressing the community's crisis and \n     long-term needs, rather than simply throwing money at \n     individuals to consume now.\n       Cuts in corporate tax rates, with no immediate spur to \n     investment, gets little support (46 percent). Repeal of the \n     Alternative Minimum Tax, providing $25 billion in tax cuts \n     for large businesses wins the support of only 28 percent. \n     When presented specifically with tax cuts for IBM, GE and \n     General Motors, voters are simply incredulous. Now the \n     leading element of the House Republican package, this is \n     likely to shape public perceptions of the Republicans' \n     approach to the economy. This may become one of the \n     substantive elements in the public's desire to balance the \n     President's direction.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I was not in on the meetings with the Democratic \nconsultant, so I do not know if it is was true or not, but Members can \nread it and make their own determination.\n  The theory from the articles is the political strategy of the \nDemocratic leadership is to covertly thwart any stimulus and aid to \ndislocated workers. It is good to keep these issues as ``issues'' to \nbeat up on the President next year and on Republicans, particularly if \nthe economy does not recover. If the economy does recover, what is lost \nexcept stimulative tax relief and some worker aid? Better to keep the \nissue than to act now is the way it turns out.\n  So goes the theory, then. Apply the iron fist, but do it covertly, \nusing the velvet glove so as to escape responsibility for your actions.\n  I hope this is a cynical political theory, but that it is not true. \nIf it is, and only the Democratic leadership really knows if it is \ntrue. If it is true, it is sad and it is disappointing. If true, it is \npolitics at its worst. I only hope the articles are not true. There is \nno better authority on this subject than the former distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator George Mitchell, he said it best in an \ninterview with John McLaughlin. Senator Mitchell said: Good policy \nresults in good politics. Not the other way around. You don't get good \npolicy because of good politics but good politics because of good \npolicy.\n  I hope the Senate Democratic leadership heeds Senator Mitchell's \nadvice here and doesn't get it backwards. I hope the press accounts and \nrumors around the Hill are not true. But we will have to wait and find \nout. Regrettably we are not taking up this consensus economic stimulus \nbill. That says to the workers dislocated because of September 11, at a \ntime when we are in a war environment, that they can not have anything \nfor Christmas. They do not have the 13 more weeks of unemployment \ncompensation; they do not have the additional health insurance.\n  To reiterate, as most of you know, Senator Daschle has radically \nmodified the economic stimulus proposal that the Democrats first tried \nto pass in the Senate.\n  Surprisingly, it looks a lot like our White House-Centrist stimulus \npackage. It has adopted many measures initially promoted by \nRepublicans. Perhaps some good has come from all these weeks of \ndiscussion.\n  I'd like to talk about some of the differences between the White \nHouse-Centrist package and the altered Democrat stimulus plan.\n  I want to explain why I believe our bipartisan package is better for \nAmerica.\n  Let's start with the White House-Centrist plan's tremendous \ncommitment to displaced workers.\n  Our unemployment insurance proposal represents an unprecedented \ncommitment to American workers. We would provide up to 13 weeks of \nadditional unemployment benefits to eligible workers who exhaust their \nregular benefits between March 15, 2001 and December 31, 2002.\n\n[[Page S13891]]\n\n  An estimated 3 million unemployed workers would qualify for benefits \naveraging $230 a week. These benefits would be 100 percent federally \nfunded at a cost of nearly $10 billion.\n  Our proposal would also transfer an additional $9 billion to state \nunemployment trust funds.\n  This transfer would provide the states with the flexibility to pay \nadministrative costs, provide additional benefits, and avoid raising \ntheir unemployment taxes during the current recession.\n  The United States enjoyed a growing economy and declining \nunemployment for much of the previous decade. But, the economic \nslowdown that began last year--which was exacerbated by the terrorist \nacts on September 11--has resulted in substantial layoffs.\n  The unemployment rate has risen from 4.0 percent in November 2000 to \n5.7 percent in November 2001.\n  By historical standards, the current unemployment rate is still \nsubstantially below the level at which Congress deemed it necessary to \nenact extended unemployment benefits.\n  Over the past 50 years, the federal government has provided temporary \nextended unemployment benefits only six other times. The average \nunemployment rate during those times was 7.3 percent.\n  Based on this historical record, the President originally suggested \nthat extended unemployment benefits should be limited to those states \nthat have a disaster declaration in effect as a result of September 11, \nor have a 30 percent increase in their unemployment rate.\n  However, a number of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle \ninsisted that we provide immediate assistance to every state regardless \nof their unemployment rate. We have agreed to do exactly that in our \nproposal.\n  Unfortunately, some on the other side of the aisle continue to insist \nthis is not enough. They insist we should go further by requiring every \nstate to provide specific benefits and establish specific eligibility \ncriteria as a condition of receiving federal assistance. We could not \nagree to these demands.\n  The Federal Government has always left decisions about benefit levels \nand eligibility criteria to the States.\n  The changes sought by those on the other side of the aisle would \ndestroy this historic relationship and undermine the flexibility needed \nby the states to respond to their unique circumstances.\n  I would now like to discuss our bipartisan plan's commitment to \nproviding health care for dislocated workers.\n  Now, Democrats have been saying since October that Republicans don't \ncare about helping workers with health insurance. Senator Daschle \nhimself said yesterday that his Republican colleagues, and I quote, \n``so far have refused to come to the table and negotiate seriously.''\n  Mr. President, nothing could be farther from the truth. Since October \nwhen President Bush first called on Congress to pass a stimulus \npackage, I have worked closely and seriously with both Democrats and \nRepublicans to come up with a meaningful, bipartisan approach to \nhelping people impacted by the events of September 11.\n  Compared to where we started on the issue of health care, we have \ncome a very long way. Let me give you a little history first.\n  When this debate began, our proposal relied on the National Emergency \nGrant program to deliver health benefits to workers at a cost of about \n$3 billion. Over time, that number grew, and I said publicly that we \ncould double, or even triple, that number.\n  I also invited the Democrats to modify the grant criteria to make the \nprogram more responsive to the needs of workers without health \ninsurance.\n  They refused. But that didn't stop us from staying at the negotiating \ntable.\n  Next, we proposed giving workers a refundable, advanceable tax credit \ntowards the purchase of health insurance equal to 50 percent of the \npolicy's cost.\n  And when Democrats objected to that, claiming that the credit was too \nsmall and that sicker people would have trouble buying policies in the \nindividual market, we came back with yet another offer, which is \nreflected in this bill.\n  The new proposal, endorsed by the White House, the House of \nRepresentatives, and the centrists in this body, takes a three-pronged \napproach to getting health insurance assistance to people in need.\n  It goes farther and wider than any proposal on the table to date, and \ngets more help, to more people, more quickly than any other proposal to \ndate.\n  What's more, it represents a giant leap in spending on health care. \nIt includes over six times as much money for temporary health insurance \nassistance as our original Republican proposals.\n  And still the Democratic leadership tells us we are not negotiating \nseriously.\n  Mr. President, the White House/centrist proposal spends approximately \n$19 billion on temporary health insurance help in 2002. And it does it \nthe right way, by using existing programs along with new ones designed \nto get people they help they need quickly.\n  Now let me take a minute to describe our three-pronged approach.\n  First, the White House/centrist proposal provides a refundable, \nadvanceable tax credit to all displaced workers eligible for \nunemployment Insurance, not just those eligible for COBRA. The value of \nthe credit is 60 percent of the premium, up from 50 percent in our \noriginal proposal. The credit has no cap, and is available to \nindividuals for a total of 12 months between 2001 and 2003.\n  Individuals can stay in their employer COBRA coverage, or they can \nchoose policies in the individual market that may better fit their \nfamily's needs. This only makes sense. Locking people into COBRA, as \nthe Democratic leadership insists, forces people to stay with policies \nthat may be too expensive for them to keep, even with a subsidy.\n  Our goal was to give dislocated workers access to all the health \ninsurance choices available to them in the private marketplace, and \nwe've done that in a responsible way.\n  This bill also includes a major, new insurance reforms to protect \npeople who have had employer-sponsored coverage and go out into the \nprivate market for the first time after being laid off.\n  It makes the COBRA protections available to people who have had only \n12 months of employer-sponsored coverage, rather than 18 months, as \nunder current law. By doing this, we greatly expand the group of \ndisplaced workers who cannot be turned down for coverage or excluded \nbecause of a pre-existing condition.\n  The new 12 month standard is especially important for people with \nchronic conditions who have difficulty obtaining affordable coverage. \nIt is a major step, and I'm surprised that the Democratic leadership \ndoesn't want to take us up on these sweeping new reforms.\n  Let me turn to the mechanics of tax credit proposal. It is easier to \nimplement than the direct subsidy approach of the Democratic \nleadership.\n  While their proposal requires employers to shoulder the burdens, our \nproposal relies on existing state unemployment insurance systems. So \nunder this bill, workers will be able to access the credit, and begin \napplying it to their health insurance premiums in a timely way. Here's \nhow it works:\n  Newly dislocated workers will receive vouchers from their state \nunemployment offices or ``one stop'' centers when they apply for \nunemployment insurance. Workers can then take those vouchers and submit \nthem, along with their contribution to the premium, to their employer \nor insurer. Afterwards, insurers would submit the vouchers to the \nTreasury Department for reimbursement.\n  This approach works because it relies on existing systems to deliver \nthe new benefits, and as a result delivers those benefits in a fast and \nreliable way.\n  I ask my colleagues: why would anyone insist on a mechanism that just \nwon't work as well? I don't understand it.\n  The second prong of our proposal is $4 billion in enhanced National \nEmergency Grants for the States, which can be used to help all \nworkers--not just those eligible for the tax credit--pay for health \ninsurance. States have flexibility under our approach, and can use \nthese grants to enroll their workers in high risk pools or other state-\nrun plans, or even in Medicaid.\n  To address concerns raised by Democratic colleagues, our enhanced \nNational Emergency Grant program requires all States to spend at least \n30\n\n[[Page S13892]]\n\npercent of their grant funds on temporary health insurance assistance. \nIn addition, we've included protection for states: a minimum grant \nlevel of $5 million for any state that meets the grant criteria.\n  Finally, the third prong of the proposal responds to Democratic \nrequests by including $4.3 billion for a one-time temporary State \nhealth care assistance payment to the States to help bolster their \nMedicaid programs.\n  As we know, the Medicaid program is an important safety net program \nfor low-income children and families and disabled individuals. Medicaid \nis a joint Federal and State program and accounts for a large part of \nState budgets.\n  So, in this time of budget constraints due to the recession, States \nare struggling to make ends meet.\n  As a result of the unique and extraordinary economic situation we now \nface, a number of states are considering scaling back Medicaid \nservices, including my own state of Iowa. This provision provides a \none-time, emergency cash injection that will help States avoid Medicaid \ncutbacks.\n  This feature was not part of our original plan, and I recognize that \nmany of my colleagues have concerns about it. In fact, I share their \nreservations, and that is why I'm emphasizing that this is not simply a \ngarden-variety increase in Medicaid funding, but a temporary, emergency \npayment.\n  The nation is calling for bipartisan compromise, and in that spirit, \nwe've agreed to add this to our proposal.\n  Mr. President, we have made tremendous steps toward the Democratic \nposition in order to find bipartisan compromise on health care. Those \nsteps have not been reciprocated by the Democratic leadership.\n  Displaced workers deserve to be treated with respect by this body, \nand I believe those workers have earned a vote on this bill.\n  I would now like to discuss the individual income tax rate reductions \nin the White House-Centrist plan and the resuscitated Daschle plan.\n  The original House stimulus bill would have accelerated the reduction \nof the 27 percent rate to 25 percent which is scheduled to go into \neffect in 2007. The White House-Centrist package has adopted this \napproach.\n  Now, the revamped Democrat plan would reduce the 27 percent rate to \n26 percent in 2002, and would not reduce the rate to 25 percent until \n2006. Recall that the original Democrat plan did not provide one red \ncent of rate relief for working Americans.\n  Now think about this. The 1 percent higher rate under the Democrat \nplan will operate as a 4 percent rate increase until the 27 percent \nrate is finally lowered to 25 percent 4 years from now. That makes a \nhuge difference to Americans who are struggling to make ends meet. \nLet's take a look at who will benefit from our plan's rate reduction.\n  The reduction of the 27 percent rate will benefit singles with \ntaxable income over $27,000, heads of household with taxable income \nover $36,250, and married couples with taxable income over $45,000.\n  These are not wealthy individuals. These are middle class working \nAmericans.\n  I have a chart which shows the median income of a four person family \nfor every State in the Nation. Median income is the amount of income \nright in the middle, with half the incomes above it and half below it.\n  This chart shows that the average median income for a four person \nfamily in the United States is $62,098.\n  Now, reduction of the 27 percent rate will benefit married couples \nwith taxable income over $45,000. So it will benefit working people who \nearn well below the national median income level.\n  This chart also lists those states that have a family median income \nthat is higher than the national average. And look at where these \npeople live.\n  Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Michigan, Rhode Island, \nCalifornia, Washington State. These are the states where a family of \nfour will benefit the most from our proposed tax cut.\n  The Democrat's revamped alternative would impose an additional 4 \npercent tax rate on these incomes over the next 4 years. That should \nconcern representatives from those states.\n  For example, consider that an additional 4 percent tax on New \nJersey's $78,000 median income results in more than $1,300 in \nadditional taxes.\n  Michigan is the same: an additional $900 of tax. Washington State is \nhit with nearly $800 in additional tax.\n  These are significant numbers for a working family with two children. \nThey would spend this money to meet their families' needs, which would \nstimulate the economy more than a bunch of liberal Democrat spending \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this chart be printed at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The more surprising figures are shown in the next \nchart, which shows States with median income below the national \naverage.\n  Recall that I said reducing the 27 percent rate to 25 percent will \nbenefit married couples with taxable income over $45,000. Now look at \nthe median income distributions on this chart.\n  There is not one State on here that has a median family income of \nless than $45,000.\n  So you can see that our proposal will benefit everyone, not just an \nelite few, from a few selected states.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my second chart be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Treasury Department has estimated that White House-\nCentrist plan's acceleration of the 27 percent rate reduction will \nyield $17.9 billion of tax relief in 2002 for over 36 million \ntaxpayers, or one-third of all income tax payers.\n  Business owners and entrepreneurs account for 10 million, or 30 \npercent, of those benefitting from the rate reduction.\n  When you refuse to accelerate the rate cuts you harm farmers and \nsmall business persons. This is because most small business owners and \nfarmers operate their businesses as sole proprietorships, partnerships \nor ``Sub S'' corporations.\n  The income of these types of entities is reported directly on the \nindividual tax returns of the owners. Therefore, a rate reduction for \nindividuals reduces taxes for farms and small businesses.\n  That is why the additional rate reduction under the White House-\nCentrist plan is so important. In 2002 alone, it injects $17.9 billion \nof stimulus into our ailing economy and small businesses.\n  So what would a small business do with these tax savings? Well, \nconsidering that most of the recent job growth has come from small \nbusinesses, I believe they would hire more people and make more \nbusiness investments.\n  We know that 80 percent of the 11.1 million new jobs created between \n1994 and 1998 were from businesses with less than 20 employees.\n  And 80 percent of American businesses have fewer than 20 employees.\n  This is what I refer to as the ``80-80 Rule'' for supporting rate \nreductions.\n  In addition, lowering taxes now would increase a business' cash flow \nduring the current economic slowdown. The higher cash flow would \nincrease the demand for investment and labor.\n  But don't just take my word for it. Take it from an October 2000 \nreport by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a very well-\nregarded non-partisan organization, entitled ``Personal Income Taxes \nand the Growth of Small Firms.''\n  This report reaches the unambiguous conclusion that when a sole \nproprietor's marginal tax rate goes up, the rate of growth of his or \nher business enterprise goes down.\n  Simply stated, high personal income tax rates discourage the growth \nof small businesses. And right now, that is the last thing we need.\n  That is why it is important to do rate reductions the right way, and \nfully accelerate the 27% rate reduction. We are simply accelerating a \ndecision this Senate made last summer.\n  We should have confidence in our decision. We know that tax cuts are \nstimulative.\n  When working Americans have more of their own income, they feel more \nfinancially secure and are more comfortable with spending.\n\n[[Page S13893]]\n\n  A full reduction of the 27 percent rate to 25 percent is much more \nstimulative than a reduction that is deferred to 2007, as called for \nunder the Democrat plan.\n  In closing, let me say who really loses when the Senate loses its \nright to vote on the White House-Centrist bill. It is our displaced \nworkers, it is our fellow Americans who still have a job and the \nsecurity of our jobs base; and it is the soundness of our nation's \neconomy.\n  The Senate Democrat Leadership will not allow an up or down vote on \nour bipartisan White House-Centrist stimulus package. Why? Because it \nwould pass. We have a majority of Senators who support this package.\n  Instead, the Senate Democrat Leadership has created a ``make-believe \nboogey-man'' over the issue of how health care benefits should be \ndelivered to unemployed. But the majority of this Senate does not agree \nwith them.\n  But voting on this issue and helping the economy recover is not \nreally what is on their minds. It is not their political objective.\n  The Senate Democratic leadership is playing political brinkmanship, \nhoping that the American public buys into their excuses for inaction.\n  The Senate Democratic Leadership keeps their fingers crossed, hoping \nthat our economic difficulties will last until next fall so they can \nblame it on the President in their campaign ads.\n  But the blame doesn't go to the President. He has bent over backwards \nto accommodate their demands. And it still is not enough. The Senate \nDemocratic leadership would rather move the goal post than agree to a \nsolution.\n  This is not what we were elected by to do. This is not in service of \nour country. It is in no one's best interest.\n  We are at war. Our economy is in crisis. And the only impediment to \nrecovery is the refusal of the Senate Democratic leadership to allow \nthis Senate to pass this economic stimulus package. A majority of our \nmembers will vote for this bill.\n  I hope the Senate leadership hears the pleas of the American people \nand stops blocking this bill through procedural technicalities. The \nSenate should be allowed to do its job.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n          Median income for 4-person families, by state, 2001\n\nUnited States...................................................$62,098\nConnecticut......................................................78,170\nNew Jersey.......................................................78,088\nMaryland.........................................................77,447\nMassachusetts....................................................74,220\nAlaska...........................................................72,775\nMinnesota........................................................69.031\nHawaii...........................................................68,746\nIllinois.........................................................68,698\nNew Hampshire....................................................68,211\nDelaware.........................................................67,899\nMichigan.........................................................67,778\nRhode Island.....................................................66,895\nVirginia.........................................................66,624\nWisconsin........................................................65,675\nCalifornia.......................................................65,327\nColorado.........................................................65,079\nWashington.......................................................64,828\nDistrict of Columbia.............................................64,480\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\nNew York.........................................................61,864\nPennsylvania.....................................................61,648\nNevada...........................................................61,579\nIndiana..........................................................60,585\nIowa.............................................................60,125\nGeorgia..........................................................59,835\nVermont..........................................................59,750\nMaine............................................................59,567\nUtah.............................................................59,272\nKansas...........................................................59,214\nMissouri.........................................................58,674\nOhio.............................................................58,222\nNorth Carolina...................................................58,096\nSouth Carolina...................................................57,954\nNebraska.........................................................57,659\nWyoming..........................................................57,588\nFlorida..........................................................57,540\nOregon...........................................................55,812\nTexas............................................................55,172\nArizona..........................................................54,913\nAlabama..........................................................54,255\nOklahoma.........................................................54,106\nSouth Dakota.....................................................54,090\nKentucky.........................................................54,028\nTennessee........................................................53,835\nNorth Dakota.....................................................52,802\nMontana..........................................................52,765\nLouisiana........................................................51,191\nMississippi......................................................49,606\nIdaho............................................................49,387\nArkansas.........................................................48,318\nWest Virginia....................................................46,798\nNew Mexico.......................................................46,534\n\nSource: Census (inflated from 1999 date by GDP deflator).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report can be found in the House proceedings of \nDecember 19, 2001.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with American troops on the ground in \nAfghanistan, with an uneasy coalition of nations confronting an \nunprecedented war on terrorism, and with the possibility of all-out war \nlooming over the Israelis and the Palestinians, the Foreign Operations \nAppropriations conference report before us today comes at a pivotal \nmoment in our nation's history. Given the volatility of the situation \nin the Middle East in the midst of America's war on terrorism, it is \nvital that Congress and the Administration present a united foreign \npolicy front to the rest of the world. For that reason, I will vote for \nthe FY 2002 Foreign Operations conference report, I do so reluctantly \nand with reservation--and I do not often vote for Foreign Operations \nappropriations bills.\n  I believe it is time--I believe it is past time--to rethink our \nforeign aid policy and how relates to our national security priorities. \nSeptember 11 was a wake up call on many fronts. As a result of the \nattack on America, we have made sweeping changes in our concept of \nnational security. We have learned that national security also means \nhomeland defense. We have learned that airplanes can be bombs and that \nletters in the mail can be lethal. We have learned that we must change \nour definition of defense to encompass defending our domestic \ninfrastructure as well as defending against ballistic missile threats.\n  These changes reflect the realization that the September 11 terrorist \nattacks on U.S. soil may not be an isolated incident. At this moment, \nthere may be people planning other terrorist acts against our homeland. \nWe have already experienced three terrorism alerts in the U.S. since \nSeptember 11. Almost daily, we hear grim predictions of what the future \nmay bring. We are living in an age of global instability, \ndisenfranchised and desperate peoples, and widespread proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. The volatility of the current world \nsituation is without precedent.\n  And yet, in many ways, the major instrument of our foreign policy--\nthe Foreign Operations Appropriations Act--reflects a distressing \nattitude of business-as-ususal. I do not fault the authors of this \nbill. Senator Leahy and Senator McConnell have done an excellent job in \nbalancing the priorities of the Administration with the concerns of \nCongress and the needs of our allies throughout the world. They have \ndone so with care and skill, and they are to be commended for their \nwork.\n  No, the fault, I believe, lies with our inability as a nation to \nrelinquish long held conventional wisdom about foreign aid and \nrecognize that the changing global environment requires a revamping of \nour foreign policy. We must move away from using dollars to symbolize \nthe strength of our relations with other countries, and instead focus \nour energies--and our resources on promoting a new understanding of \nforeign policy that complements and enhances our global war on \nterrorism.\n  Nowhere is this more true than in the Middle East, where renewed \nviolence and antipathy have brought Israel and the Palestinian \nAuthority to the brink of open warfare. Since September 29, 2000, the \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, fueled by generations of hatred, has \nclaimed nearly 1,000 lives. For the past 15 months, the unending cycle \nof violence has pitted the home-made bombs and deadly suicide missions \nof the Palestinians against the heavy armor and missile attacks of the \nIsraelis. Many, perhaps most, of the victims have been young people \nbarely on the cusp of adulthood. The sad fact is that the next \ngeneration of leaders of the Israelis and the Palestinians are being \nsacrificed to the blood feud of their elders.\n  The United States, like the rest of the world, has looked on this \nceaseless carnage in horror. We have expressed dismay, regret, sorrow, \nand anger. We have wrung our hands in despair. We have condemned the \nviolence in the strongest terms. But we have not suited our words to \nany meaningful action. In this bill, our foreign assistance to the \nMiddle East virtually ignores the spiraling violence in the region. \nThis bill provides $5.1 billion dollars in foreign assistance to the \nMiddle East, primarily Israel and Egypt, a level almost identical to \nlast year's funding. It is as if nothing has changed. There are no \nstrings on the money. There is no requirement that the bloodshed abate \nbefore the funding is released. There is no motivation for Egypt to \nstep up its effort to mediate between the sides, and there is no \nincentive whatsoever for Israel and the Palestinians to make meaningful \nprogress toward a peaceful settlement of their differences.\n  In short, we are doing little more than offering a tacit \nacknowledgment that the United States is powerless to stop the \nbloodshed. We are sending the wrong signal to the Middle East. By not \nusing our foreign assistance dollars as an instrument to effect change \nin the Mideast, we are inadvertently helping to fuel the continued \ncycle of violence. And what has this hands-off policy produced? Empty \npromises, escalating violence, and the prospect of war instead of peace \nbetween Israel and the Palestinians.\n  Now what? Where does the so-called peace process go from here? Can we \nreally expect the Israelis to exercise restraint following the most \nrecent escalation of violence against their citizens? Is there any \npoint in urging Yassar Arafat to seize and punish the terrorists within \nhis control when he is obviously unable to live up to his promises? Is \nthere any hope that the Israelis and Palestinians will be able to re-\nengage in meaningful discussions in the foreseeable future?\n  In the current poisonous environment, neither side has any incentive \nto resume peace talks. To give his expressions of dismay any \ncredibility, Mr. Arafat will have to conduct a swift and sweeping \ncrackdown on the leaders of the Palestinian terrorist cells--something \nhe has never been able to accomplish in the past. And even if Mr. \nArafat could deliver on his promises, it will take masterful leadership \non the part of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to restrain his \nmilitary options and to place Israel's settlements in disputed areas on \nthe negotiating table--two difficult but necessary prerequisites for \npeace.\n  The Israelis and the Palestinians, riven by generations of hatred, \ncannot hope to accomplish these goals on their own. It is time for \nEgypt--with the assistance of Saudi Arabia and Jordan--to exercise its \nconsiderable influence in the region and place long term security \ninterests over short term internal political costs. Such leadership \nwill not be easy. President Mubarak will have to make hard choices and \nsteel himself and his government against the predictable political \nbacklash from the more radical elements of his own country. But \nPresident Mubarak's leadership is necessary to temper the emotions of \nhis fellow members of the Arab League.\n\n[[Page S13895]]\n\n  The United States has a similarly difficult task before it. Despite \nour clear alliance with Israel, the U.S. must regain the role of honest \nbroker. We must stop rewarding the status quo with an uninterrupted \nflow of foreign aid dollars and instead use foreign assistance as a \ntool to leverage peace.\n  We are certainly not doing so now. Just a few weeks ago, the State \nDepartment confirmed the intended sale of 53 advanced anti-ship \nmissiles to Egypt. Egypt contends that these missiles are needed to \nprotect its borders, but the fact is, these deadly accurate missiles \nhave the range to threaten Israel's ports and shipping. Given the \ntinderbox that is the Middle East today, why is the United States \ncontemplating sending these weapons into the region at this time?\n  Meanwhile, we routinely sell advanced aircraft and missiles to Israel \nas part of our foreign assistance package. Some of these U.S.-made \nhigh-tech weapons have been used to target and assassinate Palestinian \nterrorists. Just days ago, we again saw television images of Israeli-\noperated, American-made jets and helicopters launching missiles at \nbuildings used by the Palestinian Authority. You can be sure those \nimages were seen throughout the Arab world. How can we demand peace on \none hand when we are providing instruments of destruction with the \nother?\n  Israel and the United States are the staunchest of allies. No one \nshould question our support of Israel's right to exist. But support \nneed not translate into enabling. The United States, the Middle East, \nand the world would be better served if we changed our policy in the \nMiddle East to reflect reality, not rhetoric. The Palestinians must \nstop the cycle of violence. The Israelis must practice restraint. The \nUnited States must back up its words with action.\n  We have a road map to restart the Middle East peace process, the \nMitchell Report. This blueprint, drawn up by former Senator George \nMitchell and issued last April, is a step-by-step plan to end the \nviolence and resume negotiations between the Israelis and the \nPalestinians. The Mitchell Report is often cited as a practical and \nworkable solution. It has strong support in both the Administration and \nthe Congress. But to date, it is doing little more in real terms than \ngathering dust on a shelf. To date, there has been no incentive on \neither side to make the hard decisions that are required to actually \nimplement the steps of the Mitchell Report.\n  It is time for the United States to provide some incentive. It is \ntime to try to implement the Mitchell Report. Just as we must hold the \nPalestinians responsible for increasing the violence, so must we hold \nthe Israelis responsible for the inflammatory expansion of settlements \nin disputed areas. The Mitchell Report provides a clear and unbiased \ninsight into the realities of the dispute between the Israelis and the \nPalestinians. It is remarkable in its fairness and even-handedness in \nholding both sides accountable for their transgressions. Our foreign \nassistance policy should do no less. I call on the Administration and \nthis body to take a fresh look at how we apply our foreign assistance \nto the Middle East before we take up another foreign policy measure in \nthe Senate.\n\n  And when we take that fresh look at our Middle East policy, we should \nlook at all facets--all facets--of our relationship both with Israel \nand its Arab neighbors. For example, if we are quick to condemn Iran \nfor the transfer of missile technology to North Korea, how can we stand \nsilent in the face of Israel's sale of advanced weapons and components \nto China--weapons that are based on U.S. technology or developed in \nIsrael with U.S. tax dollars? China may not be in the same category as \nNorth Korea, but it defies logic to think that the sale of advanced \nAmerican weapons technology to China is in the security interests of \nthe United States. Foreign policy decisions do not exist in a vacuum. \nOur support for Israel affects the Arab world's policies toward the \nU.S. The weapons systems that Israel sells to China could effect \nChina's capability to inflict harm on the United States. With the new \nurgency to protect our homeland, these are significant issues that \nshould be dealt with honestly and openly in future foreign assistance \nprograms.\n  In light of September 11, the P-3 incident of April 1 has almost \nfaded from many memories. That was 5 months before 9-11, and our \nservice men and women were put in harm's way by a brutal regime, which \nsummarily executes dissidents and independence-seeking nationalists in \nTibet and other occupied lands. Have the recipients of our fungible \nforeign aid dollars and other friends and allies been arming this \npotential adversary of ours, which in turn provides chemical and \nbiological weapon delivery systems to terrorist-sponsoring states? The \nanswer is yes. China is a known proliferator of chemical weapons and \nballistic missiles capable of delivering chemical and biological \nwarheads, and Britain, France, Russia, and Israel have been selling \nweapons and transferring advanced military and dual-use technologies to \nChina. Regrettably, our record is not clean either. Our excessively \nprofit-motivated corporations have also transferred technologies to the \nPRC, sometimes as the price of doing business there and sometimes even \nvoluntarily. China is known to have provided missiles capable of being \nequipped with chemical and biological warheads to Iraq. Iraq is a \nterrorist state, a manufacturer and user of chemical and biological \nweapons, and a sponsor of terrorist groups. China has provided \nballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia, to Syria, to Iran, and to Libya. It \nhas provided nuclear weapons to Syria, to Japan, and to Iraq. It \nprovided chemical weapons to Syria. It provided them to Iran.\n  Could these weapons be used against our personnel and our allies in \nthe event of a future confrontation? The answer is yes. Are these \nweapons sales to China in the interests of American national security? \nOf course not. I was one of the initiators of the enabling legislation \nof the U.S.-China Security Review Commission, a bipartisan \nCongressional commission. One of its specific mandates is to analyze \nthe transfer of our advanced military and dual-use technology by trade, \nprocurement, or other means to China. The Commission is looking into \ntechnology transfers to the PRC through third parties. Another specific \nmandate to\n  The Commission is to look at the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. The basic purpose of the Commission is to assess the \nimpact of these and other acts on the national security interests of \nthe United States. The Commission is to report its findings and \nrecommendations to Congress and the President in May. I look forward to \nthe report today, the United States is embroiled in a war of its own in \nthe Middle East. Until recently, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict had \nlargely vanished from the headlines, displaced by the specter of hand-\nto-hand combat between American troops and Taliban forces in \nAfghanistan. But the importance of seeking a peaceful solution to the \nviolence between the Palestinians and the Israelis is no less urgent \nthan it has always been. The recent terrorist attacks against innocent \nIsraeli citizens and the possibility that Israel will launch its own \nwar against Palestinian terrorists is all the proof--all the proof--\nthat we need.\n  If this cycle of violence continues unabated, if the Israelis and the \nPalestinians are unable to come to terms themselves, then the United \nStates should intervene by conditioning future foreign assistance to \nthe Middle East--to all the major players, including Egypt, including \nIsrael, including Jordan and including the Palestinians--on \nimplementation of the Mitchell Report or something very like it.\n  U.S. interests are not served by the perpetuation of violence between \nthe Israelis and the Palestinians. No one should be more cognizant of \nthis fact than the citizens of Israel, where precious lives have once \nagain fallen victim to Arab extremists bent on wreaking havoc. No one \nshould be more cognizant of this fact than Yassar Arafat, who time and \nagain has failed to moderate the extremist Palestinians who are \ndetermined to sabotage any movement toward peace. No one should be more \ncognizant of this fact than the United States, which has spent billions \nupon billions of tax dollars and sponsored countless rounds of peace \ntalks, to no apparent avail.\n  The path to peace in the Middle East is a two-way street, and like \nmost roads in that ancient part of the world, the path is steep and the \npath is rocky\n\n[[Page S13896]]\n\nand the path is difficult to traverse. But, with faith and \nperseverance, it need not be a dead end street. There is no ideal \nsolution to the travail in the Middle East. There is no right answer, \nthere is no fair solution, there is no justice for all those who have \nsuffered. There is only accommodation and acceptance, giving ground and \nrestraining hatred. But there is no other solution.\n  If the Palestinians and the Israelis continue to pursue hatred and \nrevenge, the future of Israel will be written in blood, as the past \npages are written in blood, and the dreams of a new Palestinian state \nwill lie shattered in the dust. If the players in this tragedy cannot \nbring themselves to accept that fact, the United States should use its \nevery tool--every tool--and I am including dollars, I am including the \ninstrument of foreign assistance--to pressure the sides to negotiate a \npeace. To do otherwise makes us little more than an accessory to the \nviolence.\n  Mr. President, these are strong words. They are intended to be. These \nare perilous times. This is not the time to mince words. As we saw on \nSeptember 11, and as we all fear we may see again, allowing hatred to \nrage unfettered in the Middle East places our very homeland in \njeopardy. The war that we are waging against terrorism is the first and \nmost urgent step in protecting our homeland. But defeating the \nterrorists is only the first step. We must also work to eradicate \nterrorism, eradicate the causes, if we can. Abandoning conventional \nwisdom in these unconventional times and using our foreign assistance \ndollars to effect change instead of making a pro forma allotment of \nfunds is the best, and perhaps the only, means that we have at hand to \nhelp shape a peaceful future for the Middle East.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Louisiana will be \nseeking recognition in a moment. I will be relatively brief.\n  Let me say to Senator Byrd from West Virginia, I stayed on the floor \nbecause even in all the tumult here this afternoon, as we were trying \nto get final agreement on a number of bills or establish disagreement, \nI learned that Senator Byrd was going to give a speech on foreign \npolicy issues. I have heard him speak on this subject before and found \nit very interesting, thoughtful, and thought provoking. That is why I \nstayed and listened because I wanted to hear what the Senator from West \nVirginia had to say in this area.\n  As I suspected, I found it interesting and useful. I hope the \nadministration will review these remarks, and I hope those in the \nMiddle East who are involved in a very dangerous situation on all sides \nwill take into consideration what has been said there.\n  For years I have been concerned that our policy didn't always make \nsense. We seemed to be giving money to all sides with no assurances and \nsometimes not even participation by those who received that aid. I have \nalways thought it was almost contradictory, maybe even hypocritical. \nThis is a volatile part of the world. It is a place where the pages of \nhistory do reflect conflict and bloodshed. We all hope and pray for a \npeaceful solution.\n  I do think it is going to take an extraordinary effort. First, the \nPalestinians have to be prepared to accept peace and security with \nIsrael. Israel has to be prepared to seek a negotiated peace agreement. \nAll have to be participants, including other Arab countries in the \nworld receiving aid from America. And America has to be prepared to \npress these points on them.\n  I say to Senator Byrd, I appreciate his taking the time. More \nSenators should think about this subject and express themselves. We \nshould take a look at our foreign operations appropriations process \nmore closely, maybe consider making some changes next year.\n  We also need to take advantage of this time in which we find \nourselves with support from countries that have not traditionally been \nour allies, a number of people who are working with us against whom we \nhad been taking unilateral sanction actions. We should review all of \nthat. The world is different now. It is an opportunity, as we move \nforward in fighting terrorism, completing the action in Afghanistan, \nand looking at where terrorism may be in other parts of the world. It \nis going to be an opportunity for this administration, under the \nleadership of President Bush and Secretary Powell and his other \nadvisers, such as Condoleezza Rice, to change our thinking and to \nimprove our position and our relationship with a number of countries \naround the world.\n  I thank Senator Byrd for his remarks this afternoon. I do commend \nthem to all Senators when they have an opportunity.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the distinguished Republican leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield to Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the leader for his comments and his observations. I \nthank him for remaining on the floor, and I thank him for what I accept \nto be an observation that we do need to use our foreign aid dollars as \na tool to help bring about peace in the Middle East.\n  I am not attempting to take sides one way or the other. We give $3 \nbillion to Israel every year. We give $2 billion to Egypt--$5 billion. \nAnd we seem to give this without asking the question. We ought to \nrequire both Israel and Egypt to work hard for peace and to be willing \nto give a little here and give a little there or else this money isn't \ngoing to be paid.\n  Could the leader imagine with me what we could do in this country for \nthe American people with $5 billion more every year; what that would do \nfor homeland security, $5 billion a year; what it would do for New York \nCity? We give these dollars practically without asking a question. I \nthink both those countries look upon this $5 billion--$3 billion in the \ncase of Israel, $2 billion in the case of Egypt--I think they virtually \nlook upon these $5 billion as entitlements. They put these figures into \ntheir budgets. They apparently have no doubts that the moneys are going \nto come. And the way we have been operating for several years, those \nmoneys have come.\n  I think it is time to put some strings on those moneys: If you want \nthis money to help, we want you to work for peace.\n  That is what I am saying today. I am not attempting to take any \nsides. But we hand this taxpayers' money out to the tune of $5 billion \na year. That is $5 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. We \nought to make those dollars work for peace, and we can make them work \nfor peace. That is what I am asking.\n  I thank the distinguished Republican leader.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for the conference report to H.R. 2506, \nthe Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2002.\n  The conference report provides $15.346 billion in discretionary \nbudget authority, which will result in new outlays in 2002 of $5.537 \nbillion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into \naccount, discretionary outlays for the conference report total $15.106 \nbillion in 2002. By comparison, the Senate-passed version of the bill \nprovided $15.524 billion in discretionary budget authority, which would \nhave resulted in $15.138 billion in total outlays. H.R. 2506 is within \nits Section 302(b) allocation for both budget authority and outlays. In \naddition, it does not include any emergency designations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the Budget Committee \nscoring of H.R. 2506 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     H.R. 2506, CONFERENCE REPORT TO THE FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT\n        FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002\n    [Spending comparisons--Conference Report, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report:\n  Budget Authority...............       15,346           45       15,391\n  Outlays........................       15,106           45       15,151\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............       15,524           45       15,569\n  Outlays........................       15,149           45       15,194\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............       15,169           45       15,214\n  Outlays........................       15,081           45       15,126\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............       15,167           45       15,212\n  Outlays........................       15,080           45       15,125\nSenate-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............       15,524           45       15,569\n  Outlays........................       15,138           45       15,183\n \n\n[[Page S13897]]\n\n \n  CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............         -178            0         -178\n  Outlays........................          -43            0          -43\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............          177            0          177\n  Outlays........................           25            0           25\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............          179            0          179\n  Outlays........................           26            0           26\nSenate-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............         -178            0         -178\n  Outlays........................          -32            0          -32\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ For enforcement purposes, the budget committee compares the\n  conference report to the Senate 302(b) allocation.\n \nNotes.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

It is a \nlittle known fact to most Americans, but foreign assistance is among \nthe first lines of defense in ensuring the safety and security of each \nand every American here and abroad.\n  Through this appropriation we fund anti-terrorism activities, we \nprovide money to give jobs to Russian nuclear physicists who would \notherwise be offering their services to whatever terrorist \norganizations were willing to pay them, we fund our antinarcotics \nefforts and provide money to combat the spread of deadly diseases \nbefore they reach our shores. Mr. President, we are in no way devoting \nthe necessary resources to the front line.\n  I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Foreign Operations \nAppropriation sub-Committee. They did the best they could with the \nallocation they were given. I know that if he had his druthers the \nchairman would have been working with a much bigger number. I do not \nintend to criticize the hard work that the subcommittee has done. And I \nwill acknowledge that for its part, the Senate Budget Committee \ncertainly exceeded the administration's grossly inadequate request when \nit made the initial allocation. I applaud that. And I applaud the fact \nthat the conferees understood the importance of the Non-proliferation, \nAntiTerrorism, Demining and Related Programs, fully funding vitally \nimportant accounts such as those for Non-proliferation and Disarmament, \nthe Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory \nCommission, Antiterrorism, Terrorist Interdiction and the International \nScience and technology Centers.\n  What I would say to my colleagues, however, is that the conference \nreport, although it is slightly more than the administration's request, \nmakes it clear that we need to do much, much more. We need to stop \nthinking about foreign assistance as a handout, as welfare for the \ndeveloping world, and consider it a strategic investment in America's \nsecurity.\n  The tragic events of September 11 were a wake-up call. The United \nStates is not isolated from the rest of the world in a sea of \ninvulnerable tranquility. As we stand here today, there are radicals \npreaching anti-American sentiments around the globe. They are saying \nthat democracy breeds corruption, and that globalization is the reason \nfor poverty. These radicals take advantage of the desperation of the \npoor and the hopeless.\n  Poverty and ignorance are one of the most fertile breeding grounds of \nterrorism. By now my colleagues are aware of the fact that many members \nof the Taliban, the same group of radical fiends that harbored Osama \nbin Laden, were refugees in Pakistan who were too poor to afford \nschool. They were educated in radical seminaries that they attended \nfree of charge. Where were we and the rest of the international \ncommunity with an alternative for these children? We were absent. It \ndid not concern us. It was not our problem.\n\n  On the other side of the world in Mali, a Washington Post article \ndated September 30 states that Muslim missionaries have taken \n``hundreds of recruits'' abroad for religious training. The story \nstates that radical Islamic religious movements are gaining popularity \ndue to corruption and rising poverty. Are we going to ignore the \nwarning signs in west Africa as well? Will we let Mali, an emerging \ndemocracy struggling to hold on by the skin of its teeth, become a \nsource of turmoil, unrest and violence? The government there is trying \nto do the right things in terms of economic and market reform. We \nshould be empowering the Agency for International Development and the \nState Department to provide the country with the ability to make the \ntransition to democracy in such a way that all people benefit. This \nappropriation in no way provides enough money to adequately do so.\n  Those who are hopeless and disaffected swell the ranks of terrorist \norganizations. Autocratic politically repressive regimes, where \ndiscontent and disagreement cannot be expressed, are fertile grounds \nfor terrorist recruitment. In countries that prohibit free speech, \nfreedom of association and political choice, violence becomes the only \nmeans through which to affect political change. The United States \nforeign policy apparatus has the mandate to push for change in these \ncountries. It lacks the means to do so to the extent necessary.\n  I say to my colleagues that we have got to take heed. The problems in \nother countries are our problems. We need to engage, and it is \nimpossible to do so on the cheap. We cannot adequately engage the world \nwith the monies allocated in this appropriation. The United States \ncannot hope to participate meaningfully in the reconstruction of \nAfghanistan out of these meager funds. The cost of that alone is \nprojected to be as much as $18-20 billion over the next 5 years. A cost \nwhich we must be prepared to share among the donor community.\n  As we speak there are students in the very schools in Pakistan that I \nspoke of learning to hate America. As we speak there are anti-Western \nsentiments being preached to people in some mosques in west Africa. \nWhat are we doing to expose them to American values and ideals so that \nthey will not be the perpetrators of violence against U.S. citizens in \nthe future?\n\n  The United States cannot be all things to all people everywhere. We \ncannot cure the ills of the world. And I do not believe that \neliminating poverty will be the silver bullet that eradicates \nterrorism. There is no silver bullet or magic potion that will achieve \nthat aim. But let's consider the state of our efforts today. President \nBush has declared a war on terrorism. He has stated that we must fight \nterrorism on all fronts. I submit that foreign assistance is one \nimportant tool in our arsenal. We have just been rudely and shockingly \nawakened to the fact that we need to take advantage of each of these \ntools.\n  There is nothing we can do which would 100 percent guarantee that \nAmerica will not be attacked by terrorists again. What we can do is \nmitigate the threat. We can help the UN and the government of Pakistan \nprovide alternatives to the madrassass that refugee children in \nPakistan attend because there is no other form of education available. \nWe can help eliminate poverty and corruption in developing countries \nthat radical elements seize on as a reason to attack so called western \nvalues and democracy.\n  The United States is spending a billion dollars a month on the war in \nAfghanistan. I do not begrudge a penny of that money. We must do \nwhatever it takes for however long it takes to wipe Al-Qaida from the \nface of the earth. However, I strongly believe that we must do all we \ncan to prevent ever having to fight such a war again. One of the ways \nwe can do this is to invest more in preventative measures. We must \nfoster the spread of democracy, bolster the judicial and law \nenforcement capabilities of developing countries and help strengthen \nthe economies where necessary. What we have done to date is clearly not \nenough.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nadoption of the conference report on the Fiscal Year 2002 \nappropriations bill for Foreign Operations H.R. 2506.\n  The annual Foreign Operations appropriations bill is the primary \nlegislative vehicle through which Congress reviews the U.S. foreign aid \nbudget and influences executive branch foreign policy making generally. \nIt contains the largest share--over two-thirds--of total U.S. \ninternational affairs spending.\n  I regret that I was forced to vote against the original Senate \nversion of this bill on October 24th, after the Senate rejected my \nattempts to restore\n\n[[Page S13898]]\n\nfunding for the Andean Regional Initiative to the level which the \nadministration had requested.\n  The Andean Regional Initiative represents our best strategy for \nfighting terrorism in this hemisphere. President Andres Pastrana and \nhis administration have been leading a valiant fight against the \nnarcotraffickers who have been threatening the economy, the society, \nthe very civilization of the Republic of Colombia for more than two \ndecades now.\n  In 2000, Congress approved the first installment of our commitment to \nPlan Colombia. President Bush correctly requested $731 million for \nFiscal Year 2002, which would have broadened our involvement beyond \nmilitary support and expanded this assistance to Bolivia, Ecuador and \nPeru.\n  The Senate bill would have cut this important strategic initiative by \n22 percent, from $731 million to $567 million, which would endanger the \nprogress we have made.\n  The conferees have agreed to fund the initiative at $660 million, \nwhich represents a reduction of $71 million from the President's \nrequest, but that is $93 million above the Senate's level.\n  While I remain concerned about what the impact will be on the program \nat the level of funding, it is an improvement to the Senate's position, \nso I am willing to vote for this conference report.\n  I also want to emphasize my support for other important priorities \nthat are funded by this conference report--priorities that I in no way \nintended to disavow when I voted against the Senate version of the \nbill.\n  They include $2.04 billion in military grants and $720 million in \neconomic grants for Israel in Fiscal Year 2002.\n  We have no stronger ally in the global war on terrorism than the \nState of Israel, and this aid recognizes Israel's key role in helping \nus protect our interests in the Middle East and around the world. I am \nprofoundly grateful for the support and assistance that our good \nfriends have provided, and I have no doubt that their assistance will \ncontinue well into the future.\n  They include a 22 percent increase in disaster aid, to $235 million.\n  The Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis--a new \ninitiative for Fiscal Year 2002--receives $435 million from the Child \nSurvival and Health Programs Fund and $40 million in other accounts.\n  They include $3.5 billion for the Agency for International \nDevelopment (AID). This is $350 million above the administration's \nrequest and $210 million above fiscal year 2001.\n  And finally, there are several terrorism-related issues addressed in \nthe Foreign Operations bill, including direct funding for two counter-\nterrorism programs; increased resources to meet physical security needs \nat USAID's overseas missions; aid restrictions for countries engaged in \nterrorist activities, and aid allocations for nations helping combat \nterrorism.\n  I am pleased to support the conference report, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to do so.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are about to pass the foreign operations \nconference report for fiscal year 2002. I want to again thank Senator \nMcConnell, Chairman Byrd, and Senator Stevens for their support \nthroughout this process.\n  I also want to recognize Chairman Kolbe, who worked extraordinarily \nhard to get this conference report passed in the House, and \nCongresswoman Lowey, who was extremely helpful. This was a \ncollaborative effort in every sense of the word.\n  Mr. President, the attacks of September 11th hold important lessons \nthat are relevant to this conference report. They showed us how our \nsecurity is directly and indirectly linked to events and conditions \naround the world.\n  With the exception of the cost of deploying our Armed Forces, the \n$15.3 billion in this conference report is what we have available to \nprotect our security outside our borders.\n  These funds are used to combat poverty, which engulfs a third of the \nworld's people who barely survive, and often succumb, on less than $2 \nper day. The misery, despair and ignorance that poverty breeds is \nunquestionably one of the reasons for the resentment felt by so many \npeople toward the United States.\n  The funds in this conference report are used to protect the \nenvironment and endangered wildlife, to strengthen democracy and the \nrule of law, and to help prevent the proliferation of chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear weapons.\n  We support agriculture research at American universities, and we \npromote exports through loans and guarantees for American companies \ncompeting in foreign markets.\n  Mr. President, we call these programs ``foreign assistance.'' They \nare held up as proof of America's generosity. But anyone paying \nattention can see that is only part of the story. These funds directly, \nand indirectly, protect our economy, our democracy, our national \nsecurity. It is in our self-interest, plain and simple.\n  This conference report contains 1 percent of the total federal \nbudget. On a per capita basis that amounts to about $40 per American \ncitizen per year--the cost of a pair of shoes.\n  To use another example, next year we plan to spend about $150 million \non children's education in poor countries where many children, \nespecially girls, receive only a few years of schooling. That is less \nthan most American cities spend on children's education, yet that is \nall we have for the whole world.\n  A year ago, some might have asked what children's education in \nAfghanistan or other countries has to do with America's security. Today \nit should be obvious. People who are educated, who can earn money to \nfeed and clothe their families, and participate meaningfully in the \npolitical process, are not training to be terrorists.\n  For years, organizations working on the front lines in poor countries \nhave appealed to the Congress and the administration to significantly \nincrease the amount of funding to address the inter-related problems of \npopulation growth, poverty, political and economic instability, \ncorruption, environmental degradation, narco-trafficking, and \nterrorism. Year after year, the Congress and the administration have \nturned a deaf ear.\n  Is it any wonder that Afghanistan today is a destroyed country that \nbecame a haven for terrorists?\n  Part of the problem is misconceptions about the foreign operations \nbudget. People think it's some kind of give-away, when in fact, we use \nit to protect our security.\n  Mr. President, since September 11th, a large majority of the American \npublic, and a broad, bipartisan cross-section of Members of Congress--\nDemocrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives--have called for \nsubstantial increases in funding to address the causes of poverty and \ndisillusionment that persists not only in many Muslin countries, but \namong a third of the world's population.\n  We can no longer pretend that spending 1 percent of our $2 trillion \nFederal budget is a serious response to these national security needs. \nThe widening gap between rich and poor nations is the best evidence of \nthat.\n  Many have made these points before. Today they are a common refrain. \nSenators Feinstein, Gordon Smith, and I have introduced a resolution \ncalling for tripling the foreign assistance budget. Others have \nproposed similar legislation. There have been numerous speeches, \neditorials, and other commentary.\n  Yet we have yet to see any effective response from the political \nprocess. Our foreign assistance budget--I would prefer to call it our \ninternational security budget--has fallen in real terms since the \n1980s. Rumor has it that the President's fiscal year 2003 budget \nrequest for International Affairs will be at about the fiscal year 2002 \nlevel--in other words, business as usual, despite the lessons of \nSeptember 11.\n  That would be extraordinary short sighted. We cannot possibly deal a \nlasting blow to international terrorism without a multi-prong \nstrategy--addressing the social and economic causes of terrorism and \nconflict with foreign assistance, diplomacy, and law enforcement, and \nwhen necessary, military force.\n  Mr. President, the security of an American citizen is worth a lot \nmore than the price of a pair of shoes, yet that is how much we are \nspending on the prevention part of this strategy. It is, frankly, \nludicrous.\n  We argue over a few million dollars to alleviate the suffering in \nrefugee camps, which are fertile grounds for terrorist recruits. We \ndebate about another $5 or $10 million to help the\n\n[[Page S13899]]\n\nworld's poorest families start businesses, to work their way out of \npoverty. We rob Peter to pay Paul to get a few more millions for \nchildren's education or programs to improve health care. We struggle, \nyear after year, to increase funding for family planning and \nreproductive health to the level it was six years ago.\n\n  Have we so soon forgotten the lessons of September 11? We are the \nrichest, most powerful nation in history, yet we continue to act as \nthough the rest of the world barely matters to us.\n  We cannot put those lessons into effect without Presidential \nleadership. If President Bush, today, were to ask every American to \nsupport a tripling of our foreign operations budget, and he explained \nwhy it is important too our national security and to combating \ninternational terrorism, does anyone think the Congress would not \nrespond or that the public would object? The polls show unequivocally \nthat the public understands these issues.\n  This conference report is the best we could do with what we had, and \nwe owe a debt of gratitude to Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens. But we \nneed a multi-prong strategy if we are going to combat international \nterrorism and protect our other security around the world. I hope \nsomeone in the White House is listening, because this is what the \nPresident should be saying to America and the world.\n  Mr. President, I want to briefly mention a few of the important \nprovisions in this conference report.\n  It provides sufficient funding for the Export Import Bank to support \nexport financing well above the fiscal year 2000 level. This is of \ngreat importance to American companies who compete for markets in \ndeveloping countries.\n  It provides increases for the Foreign Military Financing and \nInternational Military Education and Training programs.\n  It includes additional funding for international peacekeeping and for \nassistance for the former Yugoslavia, including Serbia, Montenegro, and \nMacedonia.\n  It includes $475 million for the prevention and treatment of HIV/\nAIDS, including $50 million for the Global Fund to combat AIDS, TB and \nmalaria. This falls short of what our country should be providing, but \nit is a significant increase above last year's level.\n\n  The conference report also increases funding for other infectious \ndisease and children's health programs. These programs are desperately \nneeded to strengthen the capacity of developing countries to conduct \nsurveillance and respond to diseases like polio and measles. But they \nare equally important for combating the spread of biological agents \nused in acts of terrorism, like anthrax.\n  It includes $625 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. This \nis in addition to the $1.3 billion for Plan Colombia that we \nappropriated last year. We include several conditions on our assistance \nto the Colombian Armed Forces, and on the aerial spraying of chemical \nherbicides which are used to eradicate coca.\n  The conference report provides $34 million for the UN Population \nFund, and $446.5 million for USAID's family planning and reproductive \nhealth programs. Although still less than what the United States was \nproviding for these activities in the mid-1990's, it is an increase \nabove the fiscal year 2001 level. With 100 million new births each \nyear--95 percent of which are in developing countries many of which \ncannot feed their people today, these programs are of vital importance \nin combating poverty.\n  The conference report contains the usual earmarks for the Middle East \ncountries. It also continues various limitations or restrictions on \nassistance to several governments beyond those I have already \nmentioned, where there is a history of corruption or human rights \nviolations that have gone unpunished.\n  Mr. President, I want to again thank Senator McConnell for his \ninvaluable help.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have before us, the foreign operations, \nexport financing, and related programs bill, H.R. 2506, for fiscal year \n2002. This bill is the primary legislative means by which this body can \nreview the U.S. foreign aid budget. That has always been an important \ntask, but the events of September 11th have only enhanced the \nimportance of examining our priorities and international commitments as \nwe seek to stop international terrorism while continuing to promote \ndemocracy, the rule of law and free markets throughout the world.\n  The events of September 11th have caused the United States to re-\nexamine its relations with many nations including Armenia and \nAzerbaijan. For nearly a decade, our relations with these two nations \nhas been shaped by section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act, 102-511. \nSection 907 has restricted aid to Azerbaijan until it ceases the \nblockade and use of force against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabagh. Section \n907 has been seen as a vital tool in the efforts to encourage Armenia \nand Azerbaijan to resolve the dispute over Nagorno-Karabagh in a \npeaceful manner.\n  In spite of the vital role section 907 has played in trying to end \nthe blockade of Nagorno-Karabagh, H.R. 2506 will allow the President to \nwaive section 907 only with respect to our immediate crisis, the \ninternational was against terrorism. It is my hope that the President \nwill not use this waiver given the important role section 907 plays in \nencouraging a cessation of this blockade that threatens the peace and \nstability of the entire Caucasus region.\n  I am heartened by the fact that Congress will review the waiver to \nsection 907 in the FY 2003 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill and \nwill be closely monitoring Azerbaijan's actions and progress in the \nNagorno-Karabagh peace process.\n  In addition, I am particularly pleased that Armenia will receive \nsignificant military financing and training assistance and it is my \nhope that in the long run, this balanced approach will speed the \nNagorno-Karabagh process.\n  I would like to express my gratitude to Senators Leahy and McConnell \nfor their hard work with regard to this bill. In addition, I would like \nto recognize the input of those individuals and organizations from the \nArmenian-American community who understand the importance of America's \nefforts to combat terrorism in the aftermath of September 11th.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \npatience as the final negotiations on the FY 2002 foreign operations \nbill came to a conclusion only this week.\n  The conference report reflects a compromise between both sides of the \naisle in the Senate, and with our House colleagues. Let me take a brief \nmoment to underscore a few accomplishments in the bill:\n  Conferees accepted the Senate amendment--which was painstakingly \nreached with the help of Senator Brownback--permitting counter\nterrorism assistance to Azerbaijan, while protecting the integrity of \nsection 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act. This will ensure that America's \nwar on terrorism can be waged effectively--but not at the expense of \nthe ongoing negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan. I thank all \nthe conferees for understanding the delicate balance struck on this \nimportant issue, and I want to recognize the unabashed patriotism of \nthe Armenia-American community in supporting the Senate's language.\n  Conferees accepted, with modifications, the Senate amendment \nproviding $10 million for programs and activities to promote democracy, \nhuman rights, the rule of law, women's development, and press freedoms \nin countries with a significant Muslim population, and where such \nprograms would be important to America's war on terrorism. I strongly \nurge the administration to act quickly in supporting activities \nrelating to the welfare and status of Afghan women, and to explore \ninitiating women's development programs along border areas where Afghan \nrefugees are located.\n  Conferees maintained, with modifications, House language requiring \nthe President to report to Congress on whether the Palestinian \nLiberation Organization, PLO, has lived up to its 1993 commitments to \nrenounce the use of violence against Israel. My colleagues may recall \nthat the Senate did not offer a similar provision--at the request of \nSecretary of State Colin Powell--but inclusion of this provision in the \nconference report could not be more timely. I am disheartened and \nsickened by continued incidents of terrorism against the people of \nIsrael. The stakes are high for Chairman Arafat, and his political life \nis on the line.\n\n[[Page S13900]]\n\nArafat needs to get a grip on the extremists he has given free reign on \nthe West Bank and Gaza. As we say in Kentucky, you reap what you sow.\n  Finally, I want to express my continued frustrations with Egypt over \nits less than enthusiastic support for America's war against terrorism, \nlackluster performance to further the peace process between \nPalestinians and Israelis, and continued anti-American and anti-Semitic \ndrivel in its government-controlled press. I have said it before, and I \nwill say it again: the Egyptians need to be a better ally to the United \nStates. It is not acceptable to purchase No-Dong missiles from North \nKorea. It is appalling to accuse the United States of fattening up the \npeople of Afghanistan before slaughtering them. And it is beyond the \nrealm of human decency that the song ``I hate Israel'' by Shaaban Abdel \nRahim is a popular hit in Egypt. Each of these actions will be \ncarefully considered during next year's appropriations process.\n  Let me close my remarks by thanking Chairman Byrd, Senator Stevens, \nand all the members of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee for their \nsupport of this bill. My staff and I look forward to working with \nSenator Leahy and his capable crew--Tim Rieser and Mark Lippert--on the \nFiscal Year 2003 foreign aid bill early next year. Finally, I extend my \nheartfelt thanks to Jennifer Chartrand, Billy Piper, and Paul Grove for \ntheir hard work throughout this challenging year.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my sincere \ndisappointment that the foreign operations conference report before us \nincludes a provision that will suspend the certification process \nworldwide. This goes far beyond what this Senate passed just weeks ago.\n  The certification process is this Nation's best--and in many cases, \nonly--mechanism to persuade problem nations to work with us as we try \nto stem the flow of illegal narcotics across our borders and onto our \nstreets.\n  The purpose of the certification profess is not to punish any one \nindividual country, but rather to hold all countries to a minimum \nstandard of cooperation in the war against illegal drugs. In that \nregard, I believe it is the most effective system we have available to \nus. There simply is no alternative.\n  Many have tried to turn the certification issue into a simplistic \nclash between the United States and Mexico. To be sure, in the past \nthat relationship has received the most attention.\n  But in fact, there are more than 30 countries that undergo an annual \ncertification review under current law--including countries like \nAfghanistan, Syria, Iran, Burma, and even China.\n  Afghanistan, for instance, has been decertified 10 out of 12 times \nthey have faced review. As a result, U.S. aid has been withheld from \nthe Nation.\n  Burma, also, has been decertified 10 out of the 12 times it has faced \nreview.\n  It is interesting to note that Mexico has never once been \ndecertified.\n  So this is not a U.S.-Mexico issue. This is an issue affecting our \nglobal efforts to reduce the supply of drugs to the United States. \nSuspending the certification process worldwide means that countries \nfailing to cooperate in the drug war will face no penalty for that \nfailure. And that is a step we should not be taking.\n  Now is not the time to be letting up on the war on drugs.\n  The connection between terrorist and narcotics traffickers is real, \nand closer than ever before.\n  In Colombia, in Afghanistan, and in other places around the world, \ndrug money helps terrorist organizations carry out violent, \ndestructive, and even deadly acts of terror against citizens of the \nUnited States and other countries.\n  The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that last year, \nAfghanistan supplied 70 percent of the world's opium. Money from the \ndrug trade in Afghanistan helped keep the Taliban in power, and some of \nthat money undoubtedly made it to the al Qaeda organization.\n  In Colombia, the FARC narco-terrorists make millions every year in \nextortion and protection money from drug traffickers. This money helps \nthem maintain control over an area within Colombia the size of \nSwitzerland, and funds activities that include kidnaping and even \nmurder.\n  Even beyond the drug-terror connection, the drug trade around the \nworld is ever-developing. Supplies of many drugs are near or at all \ntime highs. In the last few years alone, the drug known as Ecstasy has \nbecome a virtual phenomenon among young people in this country, and is \nsmuggled into the United States from countries as diverse as Mexico and \nthe Netherlands, Belgium and Israel.\n  If anything, this administration and this Congress should be taking \nthe certification process even more seriously--not moving to abandon it \nwholesale.\n  If anything, the real threat of decertification should be used more \noften as a tool to modify the behavior of problem nations, not less \noften.\n  To do as this conference report does and completely stop the \ncertification process for all nations will essentially remove the one \ngood means we have of encouraging foreign nations to work with us in \nreducing the supply of illegal drugs to the United States.\n  This moratorium is a mistake, plain and simple.\n  I do want to again stress that a partial moratorium is warranted, \nparticularly for the government of Mexico. I believe that Mexican \nPresident Vicente Fox has shown a clear willingness to work with the \nUnited States in the drug war, much like the government of Colombia has \nover the last few years in the battle against strong drug cartels.\n  That is why a temporary moratorium on the certification process in \nthis hemisphere makes some sense. And that is why I did not object to \nsuch a moratorium when this issue first came up on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  But expanding the moratorium to countries that have shown far less \ncooperation, and continue to do little to keep drug traffickers from \nproducing drugs or moving drugs through their territory, is a step \nbackward in the war against drugs.\n  I feel very strongly about this issue, and it is my belief that this \nprovision may very well be an attempt by the opponents of the \ncertification process to begin the process of dismantling certification \naltogether.\n  Well, let's just say that while I am happy to work with my colleagues \nto consider reasonable ways to address the certification issue--\nespecially, in cases like Mexico, where the record may warrant \nchanges--I intend to make sure that next year's foreign operations \nlegislation does not reflect such a poorly conceived approach to this \nissue.\n\n\n                              Bioterrorism\n\n  Mr. BYRD. While the Republican leader is on the floor, if I may \nchange the subject, Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas proposed to me \nearlier seeking unanimous consent to pass a bioterrorism bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, bioterrorism.\n  Mr. BYRD. At that point, I didn't know about the bill and didn't know \nanything about it. I objected. I thought he was going to remain around. \nBut I want to say to the Senate Republican leader that I have no \nobjection. I have had my staff look at it, and I am advised by the \nstaff and on reading this measure and contemplating it and \nunderstanding it, I certainly have no objection if the leader wants to \ncall it up. That is the bill in which Pat Roberts of Kansas is \ninterested.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is the bioterrorism legislation, I might say to the \nSenator from West Virginia. It has been very laboriously worked through \nby Senator Craig, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Frist. This is an area \nwhere we need to do more. This is only authorization. It would still be \nsubject to the appropriations process. But it does authorize a great \ndeal more activity in very critical areas such as public health \nservice. And, of course, Senator Roberts also worked to get a food \naspect of that in agriculture. Agriculture terrorism is an area where \nwe have to be concerned, too.\n  I think it is good legislation. I appreciate Senator Byrd's making \nthat observation and agreeing that we could move it. Once Senator Reid \nreturns to the floor, we will renew our unanimous consent request at \nthat time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Pat Roberts came to my office earlier this year and \nexplained the need for this kind of program.\n  Mr. LOTT. We need to do it because he has been in my office several \ntimes explaining it. I would like to get it done because I have heard \nenough to be convinced.\n\n[[Page S13901]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I remove my objection.\n\n\n                          Victims' Tax Relief\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do want to say on other matters that we \npassed this afternoon and on which we didn't get to comment too much, I \nam glad we did what we did with regard to victims' tax relief, the \nspouses who lost loved ones in the Twin Towers and at the Pentagon. I \nmet with a group of them, most of them women, but a man also.\n  It was one of the most cheerful things I have experienced. These are \nwomen, most of them young women with children, some of them pregnant, \nsome of them with no income right now; some of them hadn't gotten much \nin terms of charitable assistance. I was floored to learn that we taxed \ncharitable contributions or receipts to individuals who had been hit by \na disaster such as this. I think we should say as to the funds they \nreceive from charitable contributions, these spouses who have lost \ntheir loved ones, not only should they not have to pay taxes on the \ncharity they receive but no American should.\n  I have gone back and checked on the history now and found out how \nthat happened. At one point there was a budget need for $10 billion. So \nthey said, we can just do a tax on charitable receipts for 5 years and \nthat will take care of this $10 billion hole.\n  So I am glad we did that. I appreciate that there were Senators from \nall over the country on other issues, such as Senator Baucus and the \nSenator from New York, who were willing to put aside very important \nissues to them to make sure we didn't leave this issue on the table.\n\n\n                         Terrorism Reinsurance\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, another issue I was very sorry we couldn't \nwork out was the terrorism reinsurance. We should have moved that \ntoday. We should have moved it a month ago.\n  What happened was Senator Gramm, Senator Dodd, and Senator Sarbanes \ncame to agreement on a bill in the committee of jurisdiction, the \nBanking and Financial Services Committee. It had some limits on \nliability. But then it was basically taken away from those Senators, \nand they were told we were not going to do it that way.\n  The bill that Senator Daschle asked consent to move this afternoon \ndid not have any limits on attorney's fees or any prohibitions on \npunitive damages. And Senator McConnell then said: We should move the \nbill, but we should have at least a vote on whether or not there should \nbe any limits on liabilities. That is all we were asking, not that it \njust be included, which it should have been because that was what was \nin the committee, but that we have an opportunity to vote on that.\n  And, by the way, as an old whip, I had counted the votes, and the \nvotes were here in the Senate to pass that bill with no punitive \ndamages allowed and some limits on liability.\n  Otherwise, we would have lawsuits being settled and attorney fees and \npunitive damages coming out of the Federal Treasury if we had a \nterrorist attack that invoked this terrorism reinsurance.\n  So I hope we don't have a situation at the end of the year where \nbuildings will not be able to be built because they won't get loans \nbecause there won't be terrorism insurance. Maybe too much won't happen \nbetween now and the end of January or early February, but we need to \naddress this issue. When we do, it should have some reasonable tort \nreform included, as the Federal tort claims law now provides.\n  One other brief point, and I will yield so others may speak. Mr. \nPresident, in the 29 years I have been in Congress, the House and the \nSenate, we have worked through a lot of difficult issues. We have \ncommittee action, we pass things in the House and Senate, we have \nintense negotiations in conference, but at some point we bring it to a \nconclusion and we pass it.\n  I have never seen an issue that more work went into than this \nstimulus package with no result. The President was personally involved. \nThe President personally made concessions. The House and the Senate \nwere involved. We set up a system of negotiators involving Senator \nBaucus, Senator Grassley, and Senator Rockefeller. We finally had a \nbill before us this afternoon that would provide stimulus for the \neconomy, tax incentives for businesses, big and small, and for \nindividuals to be able to keep a little more of their taxes, lowering \nthe 27 percent tax bracket down to 25, helping people who make as low \nas $28,000 for an individual, and $40,000 for a couple--not exactly \nwealthy people, and not even middle income, if you get down to it--and \nassistance for unemployed, increased benefits for them, and a new \nprecedent of health insurance coverage.\n  We could not even get it up to a vote. I believe if we would have had \na vote on that issue today, there would have been 60 votes to override \na point of order. I would not want to have to go back to my State and \nexplain how I voted against a bill that provided additional \nunemployment compensation, health insurance coverage for the \nunemployed, expensing for small business men and women, and rate cuts \nfor middle-income individuals. I don't think I could have defended \nthat. Therefore, I would have voted for it, and I believe 60 or more \nSenators would have voted for it. But it is here.\n  I hope the economy begins to show continued growth. There is good \nnews for the third week in a row. Unemployment claims are down. We have \na robust, dynamic economy in America. Maybe it won't be needed. But if \nwe come back in late January and February and it is still stumbling \nalong, and we are not seeing positive signs of real recovery, we are \ngoing to have to revisit this issue.\n  We should also revisit the issue Senator Domenici raised--the payroll \ntax holiday--and put that in place of some of the other provisions in \nthis bill. This bill is pretty expensive already. I think we need to \ntake some things out of this bill. That would provide a quick, \nimmediate impact on the economy. If we didn't collect that 12.4 percent \npayroll tax for 1 month on individuals and employers, that would have \nan impact immediately. So that may be something to which we will have \nto return.\n  There will be a lot of accusations back and forth as to why we didn't \nget it done, but I will say I think for the American people, no matter \nhow it happened, it is a shame we didn't complete work on that piece of \nlegislation.\n\n  I hope next year we will start on a positive note and pass a national \nenergy policy bill, and pass an agriculture bill that has better policy \nin it than the one we considered, and also pass trade legislation that \nwould help the economy. I think we can do those things, a lot of other \ngood things, and a stimulus bill if the economy calls for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Byrd, I yield back the \n17 minutes he has. It is my understanding that Senator Lott has the \nauthority to yield back the time of Senator McConnell on the foreign \noperations bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, and I do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 2506 is agreed to and the motion to reconsider \nis laid upon the table.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Virginia is recognized for \nup to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I spoke to Senator Baucus, and I know he \nhas a measure he wants to discuss and, without objection, I would \nactually defer to Senator Baucus for his remarks he wanted to make if I \nmay follow right behind Senator Baucus.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, I inquire of the Senator \nfrom Virginia and the Senator from Montana about the timeframe they are \nspeaking of because I wanted to address the Senate on a matter \ndifferent from the subject about which they want to speak.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if I might answer the question posed, it \nis my intention that the matter I intend to bring up will probably \nconsume 4, 5 minutes maximum.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may ask the courtesy of my friends, \nSenator Lott and I have something we have been trying to do all day. It \nwill take a short time, a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Virginia?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I do object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n[[Page S13902]]\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Montana, I would \nhave liked to yield 5 minutes, but I had better take them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss a bill we just passed, S. \n1858. I thank my colleagues for their support: Senator Kerry, Senator \nNickles, Senator Kennedy, and Senators Warner, Hatch, and Clinton. \nParticularly, I thank Senator Nickles for he was of great help in \ngetting this measure passed.\n  S. 1858 deals with the upcoming trial of Zacarias Moussaoui. \nMoussaoui has been charged in a six-count indictment with undertaking \n``the same preparation for murder'' as the perpetrators of the \nSeptember 11 attacks, but his alleged participation had been thwarted \nby his arrest the previous month in Minnesota. Now this measure is one \nthat is helpful to all of us in that he is the only suspect with any \ndirect connection with the most vile and horrific terrorist attack in \nour history.\n  There will be substantial interest in the trial of Mr. Moussaoui on \nthe part of those who have been left behind, especially the families \nand loved ones of thousands who were killed on that dreadful day. By \nsome estimates, there are as many as 10,000 or 15,000 victims who may \nhave an interest in viewing this historic legal proceeding that will \ntake place in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nVirginia in Alexandria.\n  The current policy of the Federal Judicial Conference does not permit \nthe televising of court proceedings. I am supporting legislation that \nwould give Federal judges such discretion. But until that legislation \npasses, we will not be able to address the interests of victims' \nfamilies to view the proceedings in the Moussaoui trial.\n  In the past, exceptions have been made through congressional action, \nmost notably allowing the closed circuit transmission of the trials of \nTimothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols from Denver to Oklahoma City, so that \nfamilies in Oklahoma could witness the proceedings. That is where \nSenator Nickles was especially empathetic and knowledgeable about how \nmuch this means to the victims' families.\n  This legislation, S. 1858, is modeled on the law that allowed the \nOklahoma City victims to witness the McVeigh and Nichols trials, and \nthis bill will extend the same compassionate access or benefit to the \nnumerous victims and families of September 11.\n  The legislation calls for the closed circuit broadcast of the court \nproceedings to convenient locations in Northern Virginia; Los Angeles \nand San Francisco, CA; New York City; Boston; and Newark, NJ. Also \n``with the amendment in such other locations as the court shall \ndetermine to be desirable,'' to use the exact language, and other \nlocations the court may find desirable in their discretion.\n\n  The reason for the six places is that these are the sites of the \nterrorist attacks: the Pentagon and the World Trade Center, and the \nothers are the sites where commandeered aircraft either departed or \nintended to arrive. Unfortunately, they did not. These locations \nobviously would have the greatest number of interested people and have \nvictims in this attack.\n  The legislation allows those who the court determines to have a \ncompelling interest but who are unable to attend because of expense and \nconvenience or simply a lack of space in the courtroom to witness the \ntrial.\n  The courtroom in Alexandria, VA, holds fewer than 100 people, and the \nsheer number of victims and others who meet the standard make it \nimpossible for them to observe in person. While there is a great, deep \nwound for the larger society, the wound is deepest and most deeply and \npainfully felt by the survivors and families who lost loved ones.\n  I am glad we recognize in the Senate that we owe it to those victims' \nfamilies to allow them to see this open proceeding which is directly \nrelated to the horrific event of September 11 that took the lives of \ntheir loved ones. In doing so, for those who want to watch the trials--\nothers may not--for those who want to, it will begin to help them heal.\n  It is a right approach that a compassionate nation wants to provide \nto these victims' families. I thank the Senators for their support, not \nof this legislation but for their support of the families of these \nvictims.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13902-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, with the attention of the Senator from \nMississippi, Mr. Lott, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to H.R. 3448, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H. R. 3448) to improve the ability of the United \n     States to prevent, prepare for, and respond to bioterrorism \n     and other public health emergencies.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am very concerned about help for for-profit hospitals \nif they must deal with bioterrorist attack. Their services are \ncritical, and they face the same challenges as other hospitals. They \nshould be eligible for Stafford Act assistance under certain \ncircumstances.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand the concerns of my colleague. In many \nplaces for-profit hospitals are the only providers. I will work with \nher to address these legitimate needs in conference.\n\n\n                              food safety\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the sponsors of the bill \nrecognize the importance of strengthening our Nation's protections for \nfood safety and of addressing potential bioterrorist threats against \nour food supply. Among the bill's provisions are new authorities for \nthe Food and Drug Administration to require the maintenance of food \nrecords, to inspect such records, and to detain unsafe foods.\n  I would appreciate clarification regarding the standard of serious \nadverse health consequences or death, which applies to the authorities \nfor inspection of records and administrative detention, among others. \nIt is my understanding that some have suggested that foodborne \npathogens such as salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, shigella \ndysenteriae, and cryptosporidium parvum, which in 1993 sickenened over \n400,000 people in Wisconsin who drank contaminated water, may not pose \na threat of serious adverse health consequences to healthy adults. Most \nof these pathogens have been identified by the CDC as possible \nbiological agents that could be used in an attack against our citizens, \nand they could clearly pose a threat of serious adverse health \nconsequences or death to vulnerable populations, such as children, \npregnant women, the elderly, transplant recipients, persons with HIV/\nAIDS and other immunocompro- mised persons.\n  Do the sponsors intend for the standard in this bill, cited in the \nsections on inspection of records, administrative detention, debarment, \nand marking of refused articles, to enable the Food and Drug \nAdministration to act when a foodborne pathogen presents a threat of \nserious adverse health consequences or death to such vulnerable \npopulations mentioned above, even if healthy adults may not face the \nsame risk? And do the sponsors agree that the pathogens I mentioned \npreviously may present such a risk of serious adverse health \nconsequences or death? I believe we must ensure that the law is fully \nprotective of all American consumers. I hope that the sponsors share my \nconcerns.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator from Illinois yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First, I commend my colleague for his longstanding \nadvocacy for food safety. He has been a\n\n[[Page S13903]]\n\nleader, both in the House of Representatives and here in the Senate, in \nseeking the resources, the authority and the public awareness which \nwill reduce the yearly epidemic of foodborne illness. The CDC has \nestimated that foodborne diseases cause approximately 76 million \nillnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths in the United \nStates each year.\n  I also point out that he has played an instrumental role, with our \ncolleagues, Senator Mikulski, Senator Collins, and Senator Clinton, in \nassuring that food safety is addressed in this legislation.\n  In response to my colleague's inquiry, I fully concur with his \ninterpretation of the food safety provisions in our legislation. It is \nprecisely our intent, with respect to the food safety sections of this \nbill, that the standard of serious adverse health consequences or death \nwith respect to these provisions in this bill should be understood to \nenable the FDA to protect all Americans, including vulnerable \npopulations such as children and the elderly.\n  I agree that there are instances where foodborne pathogens, such as \nthose mentioned by my colleague, whether accidentally or deliberately \nintroduced into food, may threaten some more vulnerable individuals but \nnot the healthy adult population. For that reason, my colleague is \ncorrect that the agency would be able to exercise these food safety \nauthorities to protect such vulnerable populations.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. With pleasure.\n  Mr. FRIST. I concur with Senator Kennedy's remarks regarding this \nstandard as it applies to the food safety provisions in this bill. As \n21 C.F.R. 7.41 regarding health hazard evaluation makes clear, the FDA \nevaluation will take into account a list of factors, one of which is \n``an assessment of hazard to various segments of the population, \nincluding children, livestock, etc. who are expected to be exposed to \nthe product being considered with particular attention paid to the \nhazard to those individuals who may be at greatest risk.''\n  I believe these provisions will help protect the safety and security \nof our food supply.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I appreciate my colleagues' willingness to clarify these \nimportant points, and join them in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n\n\n                          antitrust exemption\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of this legislation \nbecause it is extremely important, but as I noted when the bill was \noriginally introduced, I am concerned about the scope of the antitrust \nexemption.\n  I have three concerns in particular: There is no opportunity for \npublic comment prior to the granting of an exemption; the period of \nexemption is too long; and the criteria for granting the exemption are \ntoo broad with respect to competitive impact on areas not directly \nrelated to the agreement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand my colleague's concerns and commend him for \nhis commitment to protecting consumers. His concerns are legitimate and \nI will work to improve these provisions in response to his concerns in \nthe conference.\n\n\n                         COMBATING BIOTERRORISM\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, and my distinguished colleagues, I am \npleased that we are moving so quickly on legislation to combat \nbioterrorism--this is certainly a timely issue.\n  I would like to engage my colleagues in a colloquy to clarify our \ncommitment to another important issue--the security of our Nation's \nwater supply. At the end of October of this year, I was joined by the \nranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee in \nintroducing S. 1593 and S. 1608. S. 1593 authorizes the Administrator \nof the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a grant program to \nsupport research projects on critical infrastructure protection for \nwater supply systems. S. 1608 establishes a program to provide grants \nto drinking water and wastewater facilities to meet immediate security \nneeds.\n  I understand that the gentleman from Tennessee, the gentleman from \nMassachusetts and the gentleman from New Hampshire support the modified \nprovisions of these bills. Is that correct?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, that is correct because in the interest of time, we \nare unable to change the bill prior to conference.\n  Mr. SMITH. I too would like to thank Senator Frist, Senator Kennedy, \nand Senator Gregg for agreeing to work with us to ensure these two \nproposals are included in the bioterrorism proposal. I regret that with \nthe end of session quickly approaching, there is no time to incorporate \nthese provisions into the underlying bill. As we all recognized in our \nsupport for these proposals, since the September 11 attacks, Americans \nthroughout the country have become concerned about the security of our \nNation's water supply. While it is widely believed that our water \nsupply is safe, there are a few vulnerabilities that must be addressed. \nOur bills would provide resources for research into security at \nfacilities and assessment tools while also providing seed money to \nencourage additional spending on security measures.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Our colleagues on the House side also recognized this \nneed by including water security provisions in the bioterrorism bill, \nH.R. 3448, that was passed by the House on December 12. I would like my \ncolleagues' assurance that during conference they will press for \nadoption of the modified versions of S. 1593 and S. 1608.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I intend to press for adoption of these provisions. The \nsecurity of our Nation's water supply is crucial to the health and \nwell-being of our citizens.\n  Mr. GREGG. I concur, and I intend to press for adoption of these \nprovisions.\n  Mr. FRIST. I agree and you have my commitment to do the same.\n  Mr. SMITH. I again would like to thank my colleagues for agreeing to \nfight for these provisions during conference. It was with great \nreluctance that Senator Jeffords and I agreed to allow S. 1765 to be \nbrought to the floor without our legislation included so that we can \nmove forward on this important bill and conference it with the House. \nHowever, it is important that these immediate needs be addressed and \nthat our proposals be included in the final legislation. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to ensure that the provisions we agreed \nto that comprise the modified versions of S. 1593 and S. 1608 are \nincluded in the bioterrorism bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Finally, I want to commend Senators Kennedy, Frist, and \nGregg and say that I am looking forward to working with them during the \nconference on these measures.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to approve this \nimportant bipartisan legislation to respond to one of the most severe \ndangers our country faces, the grave threat of bioterrorist attacks. I \ncommend my colleagues Senator Frist and Senator Gregg for their \nimpressive continuing leadership on this vital issue.\n  We are all well aware of the emergency we face. In recent weeks, a \nhandful of anthrax cases stretched our health care system to the \nbreaking point. A larger attack could be a disaster, and the attack of \nthe past weeks has clearly sounded the alarm. The clock is ticking on \nAmerica's preparedness for a future attack. We've had the clearest \npossible warning, and we can't afford to ignore it. We know that lives \nare at stake, and we're not ready yet.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services has made anthrax vaccine \navailable to workers at risk for exposure to the deadly spores, but \nthere has been few plans to distribute the vaccine and inform workers \nabout the risks and benefits of vaccination. In a major outbreak, our \npublic health agencies and hospitals would be strained to the breaking \npoint by the task of providing vaccinations against anthrax, smallpox, \nor other deadly plagues to thousands or even millions of Americans. \nSome cities have already developed plans and procedures for providing \ncare to patients affected by bioterrorism, but too few communities are \nadequately prepared.\n  The needs are great. A summit meeting of experts on bioterrorism and \npublic health concluded that $835 million was needed just to address \nthe most pressing needs for public health at the State and local \nlevels.\n  The National Governors Association has said that States need $2 \nbillion to improve readiness for bioterrorism. John Hopkins Hospital is \nspending $7.5 million to improve its ability to serve as a regional \nbioterrorism resource for\n\n[[Page S13904]]\n\nBaltimore. Equipping just one hospital to this level in each of 100 \ncities across America would cost $750 million.\n  The Appropriations Committee has recognized the importance of \nsignificant investments in bioterrorism preparedness. The Department of \nDefense conference bill provides as important down payment for the \nNation's needs for bioterrorism preparedness. I commend Senator Byrd, \nSenator Stevens, Senator Inouye, Senator Harkin, and Senator Specter \nfor their impressive leadership in this area. In particular, they have \nbegun to address the basic issue of State and local preparedness and \nthe readiness of hospitals to deal with bioterrorism by providing $1 \nbillion for these purposes.\n  The need for help at the State and local level is especially urgent. \nIn the first 3 weeks of October alone, state health departments spent a \nquarter billion dollars responding to the anthrax attack. Many \ndepartments were forced to put aside other major public health \nresponsibilities.\n  Massachusetts has suspended many public health activities other than \nbioterrorism, and has fielded over 2,000 calls from worried residents, \neach one taking half an hour of time for personnel. South Dakota has \nhad to suspend an investigation of serious food poisoning outbreak to \ninvestigate rumors of anthrax attacks, even though no actual attack \nappears to have occurred. The Georgia Health Department has spent 3,000 \nperson-hours just in 1 week on anthrax.\n  Hospitals across the country have immediate needs. According to the \nAmerican Public Health Association, hospitals are hard-pressed even \nduring a heavy flu season, and could not cope with a lethal contagious \ndisease like smallpox.\n  The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act we are proposing will address these \ndeficiencies. It provides new resources for bioterrorism preparedness \nto the States under a formula that guarantees help to each State. These \nresources will be available to improve hospital readiness, equip \nemergency personnel, enhance State planning, and strengthen the ability \nof public health agencies to detect and contain dangerous disease \noutbreaks.\n  The need is great at the State and local level, but gaps need to be \naddressed at the Federal level too.\n  So far, we have had only a handful of patients diagnosed with \nanthrax, but our resources have been stretched to the breaking point. \nWe can't afford further delays in meeting these critical needs.\n  Ft. Detrick, one of our two national reference laboratories, \nprocessed over 19,000 samples after the attacks began, and they are \nalready stretched to the limit.\n  The story was the same at CDC. Usually, a few dozen CDC experts \nrespond to a disease outbreak. But CDC assigned nearly 500 specialists \nto the anthrax attacks. One out of eight employees at CDC headquarters \nin Atlanta is working on the current outbreak. Staffers worked round \nthe clock and slept in hallways and only 18 cases of actual illness was \nknown.\n  In a recent article, CDC Director Koplan summed up the situation this \nway:\n\n       Right now, we are working flat out. I keep thinking, if you \n     know you;re in a marathon, you pace yourself for a marathon; \n     if you know you're in a sprint, ou pace yourself for a \n     sprint. But our guys are sprinting, and the sprint distance \n     is long over. We're sprinting a marathon.\n\n  The diversion of resources to anthrax has also led to the neglect of \nother important health priorities. According to a recent article in the \nChicago Tribune, CDC has had to postpone programs to prevent meningitis \namong college students. They've delayed the development of vaccines \nurgently needed to combat diseases in the developing world. They've \ndeferred activities to contain the spread of deadly infections \nresistant to antibiotics. Hawaii is facing a serious outbreak of dengue \nfever. When local health authorities asked CDC to analyze lab samples, \nthey were told that no facilities were available due to the anthrax \noutbreak. Instead, the Hawaii doctors had to send their important \nsamples to a lab in Puerto Rico for analysis.\n  Dr. David Satcher, the Surgeon General, recently said that the \ncountry ``should be ashamed of the condition of the laboratories of the \nCDC.'' These vital national resources, he said, were without power for \n15 hours during the early days of the anthrax outbreak. Computers are \ncovered in plastic to protect them from leaky roofs, and termites have \nchewed holes through laboratory floors.\n  Dr. Satcher is right to call this problem a national disgrace. We \ncannot continue to expect the CDC to do a first class job, if we \nprovide only third-rate facilities.\n  Clearly, our legislation is an important downpayment on preparedness. \nBut we must make sure that our commitment to achieving full readiness \nis sustained in the weeks and months to come.\n  Since September 11, the American people have supported our commitment \nof billions of dollars and thousands of troops to battle terrorism \nabroad. But Americans also want to be safe at home. We have an \nobligation to every American that we will do no less to protect them \nagainst terrorism at home than we do to fight terrorism abroad.\n  Federal stockpiles of antibiotics, vaccines, and other medical \nsupplies are an essential part of the national response. We have a \nstrategic petroleum reserve to safeguard our energy supply in times of \ncrisis. We need a strategic pharmaceutical reserve as well, to ensure \nthat we have the medicines and vaccines stockpiled to respond to \nbioterrorist attacks. Our legislation establishes this reserve, and \nauthorizes the development of sufficient smallpox and other vaccines to \nmeet the needs of the entire U.S. population.\n  The legislation will also help protect the safety of the food supply, \nthrough increased research and surveillance of dangerous agricultural \npathogens.\n  Our legislation draws on the work and suggestions of numerous \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. One of the important areas \naddressed in the legislation is the threat of agricultural \nbioterrorism. Deliberate introduction of animal diseases could pose \nrave dangers to the safety of the food supply. Such acts of \nagricultural bioterrorism would also be economically devastating. The \noutbreaks of ``mad cow'' disease in Europe cost over $10 billion, and \nthe foot and mouth outbreak cost billions more. We must guard against \nthis danger.\n  Protecting the safety of the food supply is a central concern in \naddressing the problem of bioterrorism. Senator Clinton, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Harkin, Senator Collins, and Senator Durbin have all \ncontributed thoughtful proposals about food safety. Our bill will \nenable FDA and USDA to protect the Nation's food supply more \neffectively.\n  We are grateful for the leadership of other Senators who have made \nsignificant contributions to this legislation. Senator Bayh and Senator \nEdwards contributed important proposals on providing block grants to \nStates, so that each State will be able to increase its preparedness. \nTheir proposals ensure that each state will receive at least a minimum \nlevel of funding.\n  We are also grateful for the contributions that many of our \ndistinguished colleagues have made to meet the special needs of \nchildren. Senator Dodd, Senator Collins, Senator Clinton, Senator \nDeWine and Senator Murray have emphasized the crucial needs of children \nin any plan to deal with bioterrorism. The legislation includes \nsignificant initiatives to provide for the special needs of children \nand other vulnerable populations.\n  The events of recent weeks have also shown the importance of \neffective communication with the public. Our legislation incorporates \nproposals offered by several of our colleagues on improving \ncommunication. Senator Carnahan has recognized the importance of the \ninternet in providing information to the public. The legislation \nincludes the provisions of her legislation to establish the official \nFederal internet site on bioterrorism, to help inform the public.\n  Senator Mikulski also contributed provisions on improving \ncommunication with the public. A high-level, blue-ribbon task force can \nprovide vitally needed insights on how best to provide information to \nthe public. Senator Mikulski also recommended ways to ensure that \nstates have coordinated plans for communicating information about \nbioterrorism and other emergencies to the public.\n\n[[Page S13905]]\n\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have a leading role in \nresponding to bioterrorism. Senator Cleland has been an effective and \nskillful advocate for the needs of the CDC. Our legislation today \nincorporates many of the proposals in his legislation on public health \nauthorities.\n  Hospitals are also one of the keys to an effective response to \nbioterrorism. We must do more to strengthen the ability of the Nation's \nhospitals to cope with such attacks. Senator Corzine has proposed to \nstrengthen designated hospitals to serve as regional resources for \nbioterrorism preparedness. I commend him for his thoughtful proposals, \nwhich we have incorporated in the legislation.\n  We must also ensure that we monitor dangerous biological agents that \ncan be used for bioterrorism. There is a serious loophole in current \nregulations, and we are grateful for the proposals offered by Senator \nDurbin and Senator Feinstein to achieve more effective control of these \npathogens.\n  In a biological threat or attack, mental health care will be \nextremely important. We are indebted to Senator Wellstone for his \nskillful and compassionate advocacy for the needs of those with mental \nillnesses. In the event of a terrorist attack, thousands of persons \nwould have mental health needs, and our legislation includes key \nproposals by Senator Wellstone to meet these needs.\n  Mobilizing the Nation's pharmaceutical and biotech companies so that \nthey can fully contribute to this effort is also critical. Senator \nLeahy, Senator Hatch, Senator DeWine, and Senator Kohl made thoughtful \ncontributions to the antitrust provisions of the bill, which will help \nencourage a helpful public-private partnership to combat bioterrorism.\n  This legislation is urgent because the need to prepare for a \nbioterrorist attack is urgent. I urge my colleagues to approve this \nlegislation, so that the American people can have the protection they \nneed.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am thankful to be able to come to the \nfloor today, along with many of my colleagues, to announce the Senate \npassage of the Frist-Kennedy Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001. \nOver the past several weeks, we have been working in a bipartisan \nmanner to address this critical issue, and I am grateful for the work \nof Senators Gregg, Kennedy, and others. Everyone has worked very hard \nto get us to this point, and I will continue to work with them in \nconference to ensure final passage of this crucial legislation.\n  I am also thankful for the work of my colleagues to ensure that there \nis an appropriate level of funding for bioterrorism preparedness and \nresponse activities that will be available immediately. I commend \nSenators Stevens, Byrd, Specter, Inouye, and Roberts and others for \ntheir strong support in securing the necessary funding. With the \npassage of the latest appropriations bills, we have secured well over \n$2.5 billion for bioterrorism activities in addition to those provided \nfor agroterrorism. I am also pleased with the level of funding for \nState and local preparedness and response activities--at least $1 \nbillion--which is one of my top priorities.\n  However, our efforts cannot end when the funding is secured. We must \nprovide greater guidance and authorities through an authorization bill, \nwhich is why final passage of a bioterrorism authorization bill is \nequally important. Both the House and the Senate have signaled the need \nfor increased authorization with the passage of the Tauzin-Dingell \nPublic Health Security and Bioterrorism Response Act of 2001 and the \nFrist-Kennedy Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001. We must work \ntogether in conference to ensure final passage.\n  A variety of increased authorizations are necessary to protect our \nfood supply, prevent agroterrorism, develop appropriate \ncountermeasures, and ensure appropriate State and local preparedness \nand response. For example, in the Frist-Kennedy Bioterrorism \nPreparedness Act of 2001, we have greatly expanded the ability to \nprotect our Nation's food supply by increasing authorities for the \nDepartment of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration.\n  We need to ensure that our food supply is safe. With 57,000 \nestablishments under its jurisdiction and only 700-800 food inspectors, \nincluding 175 import inspectors for more than 300 ports of entry, the \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) needs increased resources for \ninspections of imported food.\n  Our legislation grants FDA needed authorities to ensure the safety of \ndomestic and imported food. It allows FDA to use qualified employees \nfrom other agencies and departments to help conduct food inspections. \nAny domestic or foreign facility that manufactures or processes food \nfor use in the U.S. must register with FDA. Importers must provide at \nleast four hours notice of the food, the country of origin, and the \namount of food to be imported. FDA's authority is made more explicit to \nprevent ``port-shopping'' by marking food shipments denied entry at one \nU.S. port to ensure such shipments do not reappear at another U.S. \nport.\n\n  This bill also gives additional tools to FDA to ensure proper records \nare maintained by those who manufacture, process, pack, transport, \ndistribute, receive, hold or import food. The FDA's ability to inspect \nsuch records will strengthen their ability to trace the source and \nchain of distribution of food and to determine the scope and cause of \nthe adulteration or misbranding that presents a threat of serious \nadverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. Importantly, \nthe bill also enables FDA to detain food for a limited period of time \nwhile FDA seeks a seizure order if such food is believed to present a \nthreat of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or \nanimals. The FDA may also debar a person who engages in a pattern of \nseeking to import such food.\n  This important legislation also includes several measures to help \nsafeguard the nation's agriculture industry from the threats of \nbioterrorism. Toward this end, it contains a series of grants and \nincentives to help encourage the development of vaccines and antidotes \nto protect the nation's food supply, livestock, or crops, as well as \npreventing crop and livestock diseases form finding their way to our \nfields and feedlots.\n  It also authorizes emergency funding to update and modernize USDA \nresearch facilities at the Plum Island Animal Disease Laboratory in New \nYork, the National Animal Disease Center in Iowa, the Southwest Poultry \nResearch Laboratory in Georgia, and the Animal Disease Research \nLaboratory in Wyoming. Also, it funds training and implements a rapid \nresponse strategy through a consortium of universities, the USDA, and \nagricultural industry groups.\n  No one has worked harder on these agricultural provisions than my \ncolleague Senator Roberts. I know he understands deeply the threat that \nwe face in these areas and has helped provide real leadership in \npointing the way to solutions.\n  Additionally, the Frist-Kennedy ``Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of \n2001'' expands our nation's stockpile of smallpox vaccine and critical \npharmaceuticals and devices. The bill also expands research on \nbiological agents and toxins, as well as new treatments and vaccines \nfor such agents and toxins.\n  Since the effectiveness of vaccines, drugs, and therapeutics for many \nbiological agents and toxins often may not ethically be tested in \nhumans, this crucial legislation ensures that the FDA will finalize by \na date certain its rule regarding the approval of new priority \ncountermeasures on the basis of animal data. Priority countermeasures \nwill also be given expedited review by the FDA.\n  Because of the limitations on a market for vaccines for these agents \nand toxins, our legislation gives the Secretary of HHS authority to \nenter into long-term contracts with sponsors to ``guarantee'' that the \ngovernment will purchase a certain quantity of a vaccine at a certain \nprice.\n  This legislation also provides a limited antitrust exemption to allow \npotential sponsors to discuss and agree upon how to develop, \nmanufacture, and produce new priority countermeasures, including \nvaccines, and drugs. Federal Trade Commission and the Department of \nJustice approval of such agreements is required to ensure such \nagreements are not anti-competitive. I appreciate the work of Senator \nHatch and his advice in crafting the antitrust language.\n  These FDA authorities and market incentives--which can only be \nprovided\n\n[[Page S13906]]\n\nby additional authorizing legislation--are critical to the rapid \ndevelopment of vaccines and other countermeasures. I want to thank \nSenators Hutchinson and Collins for their important work with this \nportion of the bill.\n  Both the House and Senate bills also include protections, similar to \nthose currently provided to those who join the National Guard, to help \nprotect the employment rights of medication volunteers within the \nNational Disaster Medical Response System (NDMS). The bills also extend \nnecessary liability protections to those volunteers. Senator Enzi \nprovided beneficial advice about how to craft this portion of the \nlegislation.\n  Moreover, both bills contain additional measures to assist with the \ntracking and control of biological agents and toxins. With respect to \nthe control of biological agents and toxins, the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services is required to review and update a list of \nbiological agents and toxins that pose a severe threat to public health \nand safety and to enhance regulations regarding the possession, use and \ntransfer to such agents or toxins.\n  Again, these needed protections will not go into effect until we pass \nauthorizing language.\n  Although the ``Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000'' \nestablished basic grant programs to assist with strengthening the \npublic health infrastructure, the language was based on the assumption \nthat each year five more states would receive enough money to be \nprepared for a bioterrorist attack. Given the recent set of events, we \ncannot wait 10 more years for our public health infrastructure to be \nstrengthened.\n  We must put in place a mechanism to ensure that every state has \nsufficient funding to improve their public health infrastructure so \nthat they are able to respond to a potential biological attack.\n  I agree that we must provide resources necessary to develop smallpox \nand other needed vaccines, drugs, and biologics to counter potential \nbiological agents. But it is even more important that we provide needed \nresources to those who will be on the front-lines in responding to a \npotential attack. Hospitals and other medical facilities must become \nbetter prepared to respond and to deal with the public health emergency \nafter such an attack. And doctors, nurses, firefighters, police, and \nemergency medical response personnel need better training and equipment \nto combat biological threats and provide needed treatment.\n  Therefore, the two new grant programs included in the ``Bioterrorism \nPreparedness Act''--the State Bioterrorism grant program and the \nDesignated Bioterrorism Response Medical Center program--are essential.\n  Finally, our legislation would also ensure that we enhance \ncoordination among local, state and federal agencies responsible for \nresponding to a biological attack, and that this response appropriately \ndeals with the special needs of children and other vulnerable \npopulations.\n  Almost half of all public health departments serve jurisdictions \nwhose emergency response plans do not address incidents of \nbioterrorism. Agencies have not determined a single list of biological \nagents likely to be used in a biological attack, several agencies have \nnot been consulted in crafting the list or determining an overall \nemergency response plan, and agencies have developed programs to \nprovide assistance to state and local governments that are similar and \npotentially duplicative.\n  The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001 establishes an Assistant \nSecretary for Emergency Preparedness at HHS to coordinate all functions \nwith the Department relating to emergency preparedness, including \npreparing for and responding to biological threats or attacks. It also \ncreates a federal interdepartmental Working Group on Bioterrorism that \nconsolidates and streamlines the functions of two existing working \ngroups first established under the ``Public Health Threats and \nEmergencies Act of 2000.''\n  Recent reports regarding the treatment of children during the anthrax \nscare, including the cutaneous anthrax case in a 7 month old boy, have \nhighlighted the need to more fully address the special needs of \nchildren when responding to bioterrorism attacks. Within the Frist-\nKennedy ``Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001,'' numerous provisions \nwere added to specifically address this critical issue, with the \nemphasis on streamlining the language so that the children's health and \nwelfare issues were considered in concert with the general provision of \nservices. These provisions include a specific reference that the \nvaccines, therapies and medical supplies within the stockpile \nappropriately address the health needs of children and other vulnerable \npopulations; requiring the Working Group to take into consideration the \nspecial needs of children and other vulnerable populations; \nestablishing the National Task Force on Children and Terrorism--an \nadvisory committee of child health experts on infectious disease, \nenvironmental health, toxicology, and other relevant professional \ndisciplines--to offer advice to the Secretary; along with other crucial \nadditions. I want to thank Senators Dodd, DeWine, Collins, and Clinton \nfor their assistance in crafting appropriate language to address the \nspecial needs of children and other vulnerable populations.\n  Along with my colleagues, I am appreciative of the steps we have \ntaken thus far to ensure that we are prepared to respond to biological \nthreats or attacks, and I look forward to continuing to work with them \nto ensure final passage of bioterrorism authorization legislation. I \nwant to thank Senator Jeffords and Senator Bob Smith for their input \nand advice regarding water safety and how we should more adequately \nprotect our nation, Senators Sessions and Shelby for their important \ninput on the various training activities, and Senator Lieberman for his \ncrucial input regarding our disease surveillance and coordination \ninfrastructure. I look forward to continuing to work with all of the \nSenators and their staff.\n\n  I must also commend Senator Kennedy again for his efforts. He has \nbeen a true partner on this bill and the Frist-Kennedy ``Public Health \nThreats and Emergencies Act of 2000,'' which we signed into law last \nyear.\n  Finally, I want to thank my staff--Allen Moore, Dean Rosen, Helen \nRhee, Craig Burton, Allison Winnike, and Shana Christrup--as well as \nthe staff of other Senate offices for all of their efforts, including \nVince Ventimiglin, Katy French and Steve Irizarry of Senator Gregg's \nstaff; David Nixon, David Bowen, David Dorsey, and Paul Kim of Senator \nKennedy's staff; John Mashburn of Senator Lott's staff; Stacey Hughes \nof Senator Nichles' staff; Abby Kral of Senator DeWine's staff; Claire \nBernard and Priscilla Hanley of Senator Collins' office; Kate Hull of \nSenator Hutchinson's staff; Raissa Geary of Senator Enzi's staff; Laura \nO'Neill of Senator Session's office; Debra Barrett and Jim Fenton of \nSenator Dodd's staff; and Bruce Artim and Patty DeLoatche of Senator \nHatch's staff. Their tireless work has been essential in assisting us \nin getting this far.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Senate's action \nthis evening on bioterrorism. Today, the Senate has taken an important \nstep toward improving the Nation's ability to prepare for, and respond \nto, the threat of bioterrorism by adopting legislation, authored by \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Frist, and of which I am a cosponsor. The \nSenate bill, S. 1765, recognizes that any meaningful improvement in \nthis area must begin with improvements in the Nation's public health \nsystem, a fact underscored by a series of hearings conducted by the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs on bioterrorism earlier this year. As \na result of those hearings, I believe that there are several areas in \nwhich the Senate bill could be further strengthened especially in terms \nof the way the Federal Government's efforts to combat bioterrorism are \norganized. In anticipation of Senate consideration, I prepared an \namendment to the original Kennedy/Frist bioterrorism bill, S. 1715, to \naddress these concerns. However, given Senate's interest in acting on \nthis important measure before adjournment, I agreed to defer offering \nthis amendment at this time. I do, however, believe that the underlying \nissues need to be addressed\n  Specifically, I would like to see additional attention given to \nbioterrorism within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nCDC. The underlying bill recognizes the need to strengthen\n\n[[Page S13907]]\n\nCDC bioterrorism role. Currently, CDC's bioterrorism activities are \ncurrently coordinated by the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response \nProgram within the National Center for Infectious Diseases. While many \nof the agents of concern are infectious diseases, many are not, \nincluding toxins and chemical agents. Even more to the point, many of \nthe elements of the CDC bioterrorism program actually reside in other \nPrograms and Centers. The pharmaceutical stockpile program resides \nwithin the National Center of Environmental Health. The Health Alert \nNetwork is in the Public Health Practices Program. Surveillance and \ndetection activities are in the Epidemiology Program Office. \nCoordination of these activities, competition for resources, and line \nauthority is a major problem. The importance and unique nature of the \nbioterrorism mission also requires creation of a separate \n``intellectual'' center.\n  The underlying bill also recognizes both the importance of expanding \nthe role of HHS within the Government to provide leadership on \nbioterrorism preparedness and response. In addition, it recognizes the \nneed to coordinate such activities within the many parts of HHS, \nincluding FDA, CDC, OEP, NIH, etc. The amendment would codify basic \ngovernment management responsibilities and tools for the new Assistant \nSecretary position including agency performance measures, performance \nevaluation capability, technology verification.\n  Detection is key to responding to bioterrorism attacks. Although \nhealth agencies have surveillance systems, they do not rely upon \nstandard methodologies or real-time data collection. Though some States \nand localities have also begun to incorporate ``syndromic'' indicators, \nthis practice is not widespread or standardized and they are not \nintegrated into other health data systems. CDC is working on \ndevelopment of a new internet-based system, the National Electronic \nDisease Surveillance System, NEDSS, but its deployment is many years in \nthe future. The amendment establishes an accelerated deployment \nschedule, including the development of data collection and reporting \nprotocols, in consultation with state and local health agencies.\n  CDC has initiated an internet-based Health Alert Network to provide \nreal-time information to state and local health officials. \nUnfortunately, a number of States are not yet included in the network \nand very few county and municipal health departments are included. The \namendment would establish an accelerated schedule for deployment.\n  Lack of interoperability of communication systems, and more recently \nin IT systems, is a long-standing problem in emergency response among \nfederal agencies, much less between federal and state agencies. The \nunderlying bill recognizes the need for better interagency coordination \nthrough the creation of an interagency working group. The amendment \nwould specifically charge the group with addressing interoperability of \nIT and communication systems and give the Secretary of HHS authority to \nprovide technical and financial support to resolve such problems.\n  The amendment would require the Secretary of HHS to contract with the \nInstitute of Medicine to analyze the response of the public health \nsystem of the recent anthrax attacks and provide a ``lessons-learned'' \nreport to help guide improvements at the federal, state, and local \nlevel.\n  Finally, I would note that the House bill also recognizes the need to \nimprove our public health surveillance and communications systems. The \nHouse bill also seeks to incorporate performance measures as part of \nexpanded bioterrorism program in a manner similar to what I propose. \nNow that Senate has acted, I look forward to working with the conferees \nto ensure that our Nation is prepared for meeting this new threat.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment that I was prepared to \nsubmit, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the amendment was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Amendment No.--\n\n       On page 11, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n       ``(d) National Center for Bioterrorism.--There is \n     established within the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention a National Center for Bioterrorism, to develop, \n     manage, and provide scientific and medical capabilities to \n     prepare for, and respond to, bioterrorism attacks, \n     including--\n       ``(1) analyzing and applying intelligence and threat \n     assessment information to the preparation, development and \n     stockpile of vaccines, antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals, \n     medical training, and other preparation and response \n     capabilities;\n       ``(2) detecting biological and chemical agents, detecting \n     and conducting surveillance, and making a diagnosis of \n     related diseases;\n       ``(3) disease investigation and mitigation; and\n       ``(4) the provision of guidance to Federal, State, tribal, \n     and local officials, concerning preparation for and response \n     to bioterrorism attacks.''.\n       On page 13, strike line 3.\n       On page 13, line 7, strike the period and insert a \n     semicolon.\n       On page 13, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       ``(3) coordinate the standards and interoperability of \n     information technology and communications systems within the \n     Department of Health and Human Services and among Federal, \n     State, tribal, and local health officials and health service \n     providers relevant to emergency preparedness and biological \n     threats or attacks;\n       ``(4) develop and maintain advanced health surveillance \n     systems to provide early warning of natural disease outbreaks \n     or bioterrorist attacks to Federal, State, tribal, and local \n     health officials and to aid response management; and\n       ``(5) develop and maintain a program to continuously \n     evaluate the capabilities and vulnerabilities of the national \n     health and emergency preparedness plans and systems to \n     identify and respond to natural disease outbreaks or \n     bioterrorist attacks, including the establishment of \n     performance measures.\n       ``(c) Evaluation Group and Exercises.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Assistant Secretary for Emergency \n     Preparedness shall establish an evaluation group, to be \n     composed of at least 10 individuals who are experts on public \n     health preparedness and bioterrorism from both within and \n     without the federal government, to test and evaluate the \n     capabilities and vulnerabilities of the national health and \n     emergency preparedness plans and systems to identify and \n     respond to natural disease outbreaks or bioterrorist attacks \n     on a continuous basis, including the conduct of local, \n     regional, and national-scale exercises.\n       ``(2) Annual report.--At least annually, the evaluation \n     group established under paragraph (1) shall prepare and \n     submit to the Secretary and to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor and Pensions, the Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs, and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate \n     and the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Committee on \n     Government Reform, and the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     House of Representatives a report concerning the results of \n     the tests and evaluations conducted under paragraph (1).\n       ``(d) Performance Measures.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this title, the Assistant Secretary for \n     Emergency Preparedness, in cooperation with the evaluation \n     group established under subsection (c)(1), shall establish a \n     system of performance measures to evaluate responses to \n     bioterrorism threats and vulnerabilities.

Mr. President, the final day of a legislative session \noften brings a flurry of activity as bills get un-jammed, compromises \nemerge, and the Senate produces progress on important issues. Depending \nupon one's perspective, these last-minute actions include both good \nthings and bad things. Nevertheless, I think we all can agree that \ntoday's passage of the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act is a real \naccomplishment in improving America's homeland defense. This bill \nauthorizes $3.25 billion for comprehensive measures to take the first \nstep in improving our nation's capability, in the event of a biological \nweapons attack, to respond quickly, contain the attack, and treat the \nvictims. I want to applaud Senators Kennedy and Frist for coming \ntogether in a bipartisan spirit and displaying real leadership in \ndrafting this bill.\n  When Sam Nunn testified in early September before the Foreign \nRelations Committee on the threat posed by biological weapons, he was \nvery clear--bioterrorism is a direct threat to the national security of \nthe United States and we need to invest the necessary resources to \ncounter this threat accordingly. As troubling as the recent spate of \nanthrax by mail attacks was, we were very fortunate that this was a \ncomparatively small-scale attack. Eighteen Americans contracted \ninhalation or cutaneous anthrax; unfortunately, five individuals died. \nThe next time a biological weapons attack occurs, we may not be so \nfortunate in dealing with a small number of victims who emerge over a \nperiod of weeks and months. Instead, we may face thousands of victims \nflooding local emergency rooms and overwhelming our hospitals in a \nmatter of hours.\n  Let's be real here--the anthrax attacks, as small-scale as they may \nhave been, have greatly stressed our national public health \ninfrastructure. One out of eight Centers for Disease Control employees \nat their headquarters in Atlanta is working on the current anthrax \noutbreak, forcing the CDC to sideline other essential core activities \nfor the time being. Folks, what we have just been through is small \npotatoes compared to what we potentially will face. Plain and simple, \nwe can't afford to be so under-prepared in the future.\n\n[[Page S13909]]\n\n  Among Sam Nunn's recommendations for countering biological terrorism, \nhe declared, ``We need to recognize the central role of public health \nand medicine in this effort and engage these professionals fully as \npartners on the national security team.'' There are many good things in \nthis bill, ranging from the expansion of the National \nPharmaceutical Stockpile to efforts to enhance food safety, but I am \nespecially pleased that the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act provides \ndirect grants to improve the public health infrastructure at the state \nand local level. Our doctors, nurses, emergency medical technicians, \nand other public health personnel are our eyes and ears on the ground \nfor detecting a biological weapons attack. We can't afford not to do \neverything we can to make sure they have the necessary tools and \nresources in containing any BW attack. This bill goes a long way toward \nfulfilling that core commitment.\n\n  So I am very pleased the Senate today has passed the Bioterrorism \nPreparedness Act and I look forward to a quick reconciliation of this \nbill with counterpart House legislation early next year. When this bill \nwas introduced, I had expressed my serious concern that it was ignoring \nthe international aspects to any effective response to potential \nbioterrorism. As Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I know \nthat we cannot address the threat of bioterrorism within the borders of \nthe United States alone. A biological weapon attack need not originate \nin the United States to pose a threat to our nation. A dangerous \npathogen deliberately released anywhere in the world can quickly spread \nto the United States in a matter of days, if not hours. The scope and \nfrequency of international trade, travel, and migration patterns offer \nunlimited opportunities for pathogens to spread across national borders \nand even to move from one continent to another. Therefore, I continue \nto believe we need to view all infectious disease epidemics, wherever \nthey occur, as a potential threat to all nations.\n  It is for this reason that, when the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act \nwas being drafted, Senator Helms, the distinguished Ranking Member on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, and I had worked together in seeking \nto insert provisions in this bill to enhance global disease monitoring \nand surveillance. With Senator Kennedy's strong backing, we had sought \nto ensure the full availability of information (i.e., disease \ncharacteristics, pathogen strains, transmission patterns) on infectious \nepidemics overseas that may provide clues indicating possible illegal \nbiological weapons use or research. Even if an infectious disease \noutbreak occurs naturally, improved monitoring and surveillance can \nhelp contain the epidemic and tip off scientists and public health \nprofessionals to new disease that may be used as biological weapons in \nthe future.\n  The World Health Organization (WHO) established a formal worldwide \nnetwork last year, called the Global Alert and Response Network, to \nmonitor and track infectious disease outbreaks in every region of the \nworld. The WHO has done an impressive job so far working on a \nshoestring budget. But this global network is only as good as its \ncomponents--individual nations. Many developing nations simply do not \npossess the personnel, laboratory equipment or public health \ninfrastructure to track disease patterns and detect traditional and \nemerging pathogens. In fact, these nations often just seek to keep up \nin treating those who have already fallen ill.\n\n  Doctors and nurses in many developing countries only treat a small \nfraction of the patients who may be ill with a specific infectious \ndisease--in effect, they are only witnessing the tip of a potentially \nmuch larger iceberg. According to the National Intelligence Council, \ngovernments in developing countries in Africa and Asia have established \nrudimentary or no systems at all for disease surveillance, response or \nprevention. For example, in 1994, an outbreak of plague occurred in \nIndia, resulting in 56 deaths and billions of dollars of economic \ndamage as trade and travel with India ground to a halt. The plague \noutbreak was so severe because Indian authorities did not catch the \nepidemic in its early stages. Authorities had ignored or failed to \nrespond to routine complaints a flea infestation, a sure warning signal \nfor plague.\n  Owing to the lack of resources, developing nations are the weak spots \nin global disease monitoring and surveillance. Without shoring up these \nnations' capabilities to detect and contain disease outbreaks, we are \nleaving the entire world vulnerable to either a deliberate biological \nweapons attack or an especially virulent naturally occurring epidemic.\n  For all of these reasons, Senator Helms and I had worked together in \nproposing language to authorize $150 million in FY 1001 and FY 2003 to \nstrengthen the capabilities of individual nations in the developing \nworld to detect, diagnose, and contain infectious disease epidemics. \nThe proposed title would have helped train entry-level public health \nprofessionals from developing countries and provide grants for the \nacquisition of modern laboratory and communications equipment essential \nto any effective disease surveillance network. Upon first glance, $150 \nmillion is chump change in a bill that authorizes more than $3 billion. \nBut I have been assured by public health experts that $150 million \nalone can go a long ways in making sure that developing countries the \nbasic disease surveillance and monitoring capabilities to effectively \ncontribute to the WHO's global network. The bottom line is that these \nprovisions would have offered an inexpensive, common-sense solution to \na problem of global proportions.\n\n  I was greatly disappointed, therefore, when the White House expressed \nresistance to the language Senator Helms and I had worked out and \nsought to drop it from the final bill. While voicing support for our \nideas, the White House believed that the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act \nshould only focus on domestic defenses against bioterrorism and was not \nthe appropriate vehicle for the international programs we proposed.\n  I strongly disagreed. It doesn't make sense to draw artificial \nboundaries between ``domestic'' and ``international'' responses to \nbioterrorism. I have already pointed out that pathogens deliberately \nreleased in an attack anywhere in the world can quickly spread to the \nUnited States if we are unable to contain the epidemic at its source. \nThe National Intelligence Council has concluded that infectious \ndiseases are a real threat to U.S. national security. To ignore the \ninternational arena in favor of domestic solutions alone just doesn't \nmake any sense.\n  Therefore, when the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act was introduced in \nNovember without any provisions to enhance global disease surveillance, \nI announced my intention to introduce an amendment to ensure this bill \nwould enhance the capabilities of developing nations to track, \ndiagnose, and contain disease outbreaks resulting from both BW attacks \nand naturally occurring epidemics. This week, the Senate leadership \nchose to move this bill under an unanimous consent procedure. I \ninitially objected because I strongly believed the Senate should have \nan opportunity, at the very least, to vote on an amendment to \nincorporate global disease surveillance activities in the Bioterrorism \nPreparedness Act. But I understand the urgency of the moment. There is \nno greater vulnerability in our nation's defenses than against the \nthreat of bioterrorism and it is the responsibility of Congress to act \nquickly to correct this deficiency.\n  Therefore, I have chosen, for now, to cease my effort to include this \namendment in this bill. Office of Management and Budget Director Mitch \nDaniels today sent me a letter where he expresses appreciation for the \nproposals contained in this amendment and recognizes that \n``International public health has a critical role to play in protecting \nthe United States and our global partners''. Furthermore, Daniels \nhighlights the Administration's intention to engage in discussions with \nmyself and other interested colleagues on these proposals when the \nCongress reconvenes in January. I ask for unanimous consent that the \nfull text of this letter be included at the end of this statement in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  I expect the Administration to follow up on this letter by planning \nand budgeting for improved global pathogen surveillance in Fiscal Year \n2003. The need is urgent and our ability to lessen the threat posed by \nbioterrorism is real.\n\n[[Page S13910]]\n\nThe steps we take to combat bioterrorism overseas can keep diseases \nfrom reaching our shores and will give us vital early warning of new \ndiseases and strains for which we must prepare.\n  Let me again salute today's passage by the Senate of the Bioterrorism \nPreparedness Act. While it does not include every essential proposal in \nenhancing our nation's bioterrorism defenses, it still accomplishes a \ngreat deal. If this bill becomes law, which I have no reason to doubt, \nit is my hope that the Congress will follow up next year with the \nnecessary appropriations to carry out the programs authorized in this \nbill.\n  Let me close with an excerpt of testimony from the Foreign Relations \nCommittee hearing on bioterrorism in September from Dr. D.A. Henderson, \nthe man who spearheaded the international campaign to eradicate \nsmallpox in the 1970's. Today, he is the director of the newly-formed \nOffice of Emergency Preparedness in the Department of Health and Human \nServices, which has the mandate to help organize the federal \ngovernment's response to future bioterrorist attacks. Dr. Henderson was \nvery clear on the value of global disease surveillance: ``In \ncooperation with the WHO and other countries, we need to strengthen \ngreatly our intelligence gathering capability. A focus on international \nsurveillance and on scientist-to-scientist communication will be \nnecessary . . .''\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                               Washington, DC., December 20, 2001.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Biden: I very much appreciate the important \n     proposals contained within Title VI of the Kennedy-Frist \n     bioterrorism bill. International public health has a critical \n     role to play in protecting the United States and our global \n     partners from the threat of infectious disease.\n       As you are aware, the Administration supports the version \n     of the Kennedy bill that does not include Title VI. These \n     issues are critical, however, and I would very much like to \n     resolve them outside the context of the current bioterrorism \n     bill. Your willingness to discuss these matters in the future \n     is critical to the movement of this important piece of \n     legislation and I would welcome the opportunity to engage in \n     these discussions at the beginning of the next session.\n       Thank you very much for your consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr.,\n                                                         Director.\n\n\n              additional bioterrorism preparedness issues\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to commend my colleagues, Senators First, \nKennedy, and Gregg for their work in crafting the bipartisan \nBioterrorism Preparedness Act. The Act takes a significant step forward \nin providing the necessary tools to combat future acts of bioterrorism.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the gentleman from Utah for his comments. On \nbehalf of myself, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Gregg, I also want to \nthank him for his significant contributions to the legislation, and for \nhis support for this measure.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand that there are efforts currently underway to \npass this legislation by unanimous consent before the Senate adjourns \nfor the year, and I strongly support those efforts. Because we are \ntrying to clear this measure under a tight time frame, I also \nunderstand that there will not be an opportunity to make modifications \nto the text of the legislation prior to final Senate passage.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. My friend from Utah is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Before Congress passes a final anti-bioterrorism law, I \nbelieve there are several important issues that must be addressed. \nBecause there will not be an opportunity to address these matters \nbefore the Senate passes anti-bioterrorism legislation, I strongly \nbelieve that the House-Senate conference committee should: (1) permit \nthe approval of priority countermeasures solely based on data from \nanimal studies; (2) clarify the Health and Human Service Secretary's \nrole and authority in distribution, and use of, priority \ncountermeasures and other medical responses to bioterrorist attacks; \nand (3) provide additional enforcement provisions with respect to \nprohibiting the unlawful shipment, transportation, and possession of \nbiological agents and toxins.\n  These issues have not been sufficiently addressed in the legislation \nbefore us. We must all recognize that this language the Senate is about \nto adopt has not been the subject of any congressional committee mark-\nup. While the extraordinary situation confronting our nation regarding \nbiological attacks requires expeditious action, we also must ensure \nthat there is flexibility in the conference committee to guarantee that \nnovel and, frankly, evolving issues, concerning bioterrorism are \nadequately addressed. This is what happened during the House-Senate \nconference of the U.S.A. Patriot Act and, with diligence, we can \nduplicate that success again.\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree that the conference committee should address each \nof the issues that you have raised. I will actively work to ensure that \nthese provisions are included.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I concur with my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. FRIST. I also agree that these important issues should be \naddressed during a conference with the House of Representatives and we \nwill call on the Senator from Utah to participate in discussions \nconcerning these issues.\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree with my colleague from Utah that additional \nspecificity with respect to the language on animal trials would be \ndesirable, particularly with respect to clarifying that the FDA has the \nauthority to promptly promulgate a final rule in this area. I also \nbelieve that the Secretary of Health and Human Services should have \nclear authority to prioritize the distribution of scarce \ncountermeasures under certain circumstances. Finally, I believe there \nis great value in considering the inclusion in a final bill of \nintermediate enforcement authority with respect to the unlawful \nshipment, transport, possession, or other use of biological agents or \ntoxins.\n  Mr. FRIST. I agree with Senator Gregg. The Senator from Utah can be \nassured that these issues will receive my active support during \nconference consideration of this measure.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I also agree with Senator Gregg. I thank the Senator \nfrom Utah for bringing these important issues to the attention of the \nSenate. I will look forward to working with him in resolving these \nissues during the conference.\n  Mr. HATCH. I also request that my colleagues support the inclusion of \nprovisions to establish an animal terrorism incident clearinghouse.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will actively support this provision.\n  Mr. FRIST. I concur with my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I also believe that this issue should be given serious \nconsideration.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleagues for their comments. I look forward \nto working with them during the conference to ensure that this \nimportant legislation is passed by Congress so that our nation can be \nbetter prepared to meet the threat of bioterrorism and public health \nemergencies.\n\n\n                         WATER SUPPLY SECURITY\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, and my distinguished colleagues, I am \npleased that we are moving so quickly on legislation to combat \nbioterrorism--this is certainly a timely issue.\n  I would like to engage my colleagues in a colloquy to clarify our \ncommitment to another important issue--the security of our Nation's \nwater supply. At the end of October of this year, I was joined by the \nRanking Member of the Environment and Public Works Committee in \nintroducing S. 1593 and S. 1608. S. 1593 authorizes the Administrator \nof the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a grant program to \nsupport research projects on critical infrastructure protection for \nwater supply systems. S. 1608 establishes a program to provide grants \nto drinking water and wastewater facilities to meet immediate security \nneeds.\n  I understand that the Senator from Tennessee, the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from New Hampshire support the modified \nprovisions of these bills. Is that correct?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, that is correct because in the interest of time, we \nre unable to change the bill prior to conference.\n\n[[Page S13911]]\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I too would like to thank Senator Frist, \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Gregg for agreeing to work with us to \nensure these two proposals are included in the bioterrorism proposal. I \nregret that with the end of session quickly approaching, there is not \ntime to incorporate these provisions into the underlying bill. As we \nall recognized in our support for these proposals, since the September \n11th attacks, Americans throughout the country have become concerned \nabout the security of our nation's water supply. While it is widely \nbelieved that our water supply is safe, there are a few vulnerabilities \nthat must be addressed. Our bills would provide resources for research \ninto security at facilities and assessment tools while also providing \nseed money to encourage additional spending on security measures.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Our colleagues on the House side also recognized this \nneed by including water security provisions in the bioterrorism bill, \nH.R. 3448, that was passed by the House on December 12th. I would like \nmy colleagues' assurance that during conference they will press for \nadoption of the modified versions of S. 1593 and S. 1608.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I intend to press for adoption of these provisions. the \nsecurity of our nation's water supply is crucial to the health and \nwell-being of our citizens.\n  Mr. GREGG. I concur, and I intend to press for adoption of these \nprovisions.\n  Mr. FRIST. I agree and you have my commitment to do the same.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I again would like to thank my colleagues \nfor agreeing to fight for these provisions during conference. It was \nwith great reluctance that Senator Jeffords and I agreed to allow S. \n1765 to be brought to the floor without our legislation included so \nthat we can move forward on this important bill and conference it with \nthe House. However, it is important that these immediate needs be \naddresed and that our proposals be included in the the final \nlegislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure \nthat the provisions we agreed to that comprise the modified versions of \nS. 1593 and S. 1608 are included in the bioterrorism bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Finally, I want to commend Senators Kennedy, Frist, and \nGregg and say that I am looking forward to working with them during the \nconference on these measures.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2692\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand Senators Frist, Kennedy, and \nGregg have a substitute amendment at the desk which is the text of S. \n1765. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered and \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses, and that the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate, without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2692) was agreed to.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted and Proposed.'')\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, it was regrettable today that we were \nunable to gain unanimous consent to take up H.R. 3210, the House \nterrorism insurance bill, and amend it with a substitute offered by the \nSenator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd. We made a good-faith effort to \naddress a pressing need, but we found that some of our colleagues \ninsisted on the consideration of amendments that would make it \nimpossible to complete work on this issue in the short time this \nsession of Congress had remaining.\n  In the wake of September 11th, a number of insurance companies are \ndeclining to provide coverage from losses that would result from a \nterrorist attack. Those policies that are available are often priced so \nhigh that they are unaffordable. Senator Dodd's proposal would have \ngiven them the safety net they need to keep insuring against terrorist \nrisks. In turn, that coverage would allow builders to keep building, \nbusinesses to keep growing, and, hopefully, prevent against further \neconomic setbacks.\n  Our amendment was the product of extensive bipartisan negotiations. \nIt was developed with extensive consultation with a number of Senate \nDemocrats and Republicans--including Senator Gramm--as well as the \nWhite House and the Treasury Department. I am especially appreciative \nof the enormous commitment of time and energy by the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, the Chairman of the Banking Committee, Mr. \nSarbanes, the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Mr. Hollings, the \nsenior Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, the junior Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Corzine, and many others from both sides of the aisle.\n  While we were unable to reach agreement on every point, the proposal \nincorporated line-by-line suggestions by our colleagues from both sides \nof the aisle and the Administration. It represented a compromise.\n  It requires substantial payments by insurance companies before the \nfederal government provides a backstop. The proposal would require the \ninsurance industry to retain the responsibility to pay for up to $10 \nbillion in losses in the first year, and up to $15 billion in losses in \nthe second year or around 7 percent and 10 percent of their annual \npremiums for each affected company. This legislation would ensure \nstability in the insurance market so that businesses can afford to \npurchase insurance.\n  As this session of Congress drew to a close, and we were forced to \noperate in an environment that required unanimous consent agreements to \ndo our business, I regret that we were unable to complete our work on \nthis legislation.\n  Accordingly, the Senate will keep a watchful eye on the insurance \nmarket in the coming weeks, and we will take the appropriate action to \nrespond to any problems that arise from the failure to gain approval \nfor the measure we sought to pass today.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, 3 months ago, our nation suffered \ndevastating terrorist attacks. We are now confronted with one of the \nmany aftereffects of the terrible events of September 11th on our \nnation. We are faced with the prospect that insurance protecting \nAmerica's buildings, businesses, homes and workers from terrorist acts \nwill no longer be available.\n  It is generally accepted that roughly 70 percent of insurance \ncontracts are scheduled to be renewed by year's end. Already, many \ninsurers have announced their intention to withdraw terrorism coverage \nfrom new insurance policies.\n  This is simply because primary insurers, who deal directly with \npolicyholders, have been unable to, in the short term, purchase \nreinsurance from an unstable reinsurance market. Reinsurers are \ncurrently unwilling to write coverage in the face of future \ncatastrophic losses equal in magnitude to those suffered at the World \nTrade Center.\n  Without the ability to purchase reinsurance, primary insurers cannot \nactuarially price policies that incorporate the assumption of \ncatastrophic terrorist losses.\n  They are faced with two choices. They can seek permission from state\n\n[[Page S13912]]\n\nregulators to exclude terrorist acts from all of their policies. Or \nthey can charge incredibly high premiums--rates are nearly certain to \ngo up 500 to 1000 percent of what is presently required. No shareholder \ncould be reasonably expected to allow their insurance company to \nunderwrite the seemingly immeasurable exposure of a terrorist act \nwithout drastically raising rates.\n  Without federal action, we risk either the possibility that our \nNation's economy will remain defenseless from a terrorist attack or the \npossibility that insurance companies will charge unaffordable rates to \nevery American insurance consumer.\n  Several of us endeavored to draft legislation to provide a short-term \nremedy aimed to bring stability to the insurance market, to protect \ntaxpayers, and to ensure that bank lending, construction, and other \nactivities vital to our economic health would not be jeopardized.\n  It is deeply regrettable that this legislation will not be considered \nby the Senate prior to the end of this session. It is particularly \nregrettable because the reason that this legislation was not considered \nhad nothing to due with the core issue of terrorism insurance; it had \nto do with liability reform. Deep-seated differences on the issue \ncreated an impasse. That is most unfortunate.\n  The legislation that Senator Sarbanes, Senator Schumer and I offered \nwas a modest proposal. It is based on three principles that must be \nincluded in any bill on this subject matter.\n  First, it makes the American taxpayer the insurer of last resort. The \ninsurance industry maintains front-line responsibility to do what it \ndoes best: calculate risk, assess premiums, and pay claims to \npolicyholders.\n  Second, it promotes competition in the current insurance marketplace. \nCompetition is the best way to ensure that the private market assumes \nthe entire responsibility for insuring against the risk of terrorism, \nwithout any direct government role, as soon as possible. This bill is a \ntemporary measure only, lasting for 24 months at most.\n  Third, it ensures that all consumers and businesses can continue to \npurchase affordable coverage for terrorist acts. Without action, \nconsumers may be unable to get insurance or the insurance available \nwill be unaffordable.\n  I intend to watch the markets and the economy closely in the coming \ndays and I am prepared to revisit this issue early next year if the \nneed arises.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have one simple message regarding the \nterror insurance legislation. We need to act now, before we adjourn, \nand we need to get this right. I fear that if we don't act, or don't \nget this right, we will need to return early in January to address this \nproblem. Unfortunately, it is now obvious that we won't enact this \ncritical legislation. This is irresponsible.\n  Let me say clearly, my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, \nshould be commended for his valiant effort to secure an agreement. It \nis not his fault that this did not get done. He has had his eyes \nfocused clearly on the goal line every day on this bill. He has been \npractical, energetic, tough, and patient. We are not able to act before \nwe leave, but I want to congratulate Senator Dodd for his valiant \neffort.\n  Let me explain why this issue is so important.\n  As part of their property and casualty insurance, many businesses \nhave insurance against the costs that arise if their business is \ninterrupted.\n  If we don't pass an effective terror insurance bill, the government \nwill, in effect, cause massive interruption in the business community. \nWe will create the interruption.\n  We could have avoided this result by passing this legislation.\n  Property and casualty insurance is not optional for most businesses.\n  Not every business owner buys life insurance, but nearly every \nbusiness buys property and casualty insurance, to protect its property, \nto protect it against being sued, and to protect its employees under \nthe state workers compensation laws.\n  Property and casualty insurance is required by investors and \nshareholders.\n  It is required by banks that lend for construction and other \nprojects. We all know that home mortgage companies require the \nhomeowners to maintain homeowners property insurance, and it's the same \nwith business lending.\n  Maintaining property and casualty insurance is mandated as part of \nthe fiduciary obligation to the business.\n  And if property and casualty insurance for major causes of loss is \nnot available, businesses face a difficult choice about going forward \nwith construction projects, and other ventures.\n  If no insurance is available, banks won't lend and the business \nactivity that is depending on the loans will stop.\n  The impact on the real estate, energy, construction, and \ntransportation sectors will be severe.\n  Insurance companies must be able to ``underwrite'' their policies. \nThis means that they need to be able to assess their exposure or risk \nof a claim. They need to know if their exposure to claims is \nacceptable, excessive, or indeterminate.\n  In the case of claims for damages caused by terrorist strikes, there \nis no way to assess their risk and no way to underwrite the policy. \nThere are too many uncertainties.\n  There is only one experience and the experience could not be more \ntroubling.\n  One thing that is certain, as it was not before September 11, is that \nlosses from terrorist acts can cost tens of billions of dollars. In \nfact, under worst-case scenarios, losses could easily reach hundreds of \nbillions of dollars.\n  I recently introduced legislation focusing on the need to develop \nmedicines to treat the victims of a bioterror attack. The Dark Winter \nexercise simulated a smallpox bioterror attack and it found that 15,000 \nAmericans could die and 80 million could die worldwide. This is why it \nis so important to develop medicines we can use to contain the \ninfections and deaths. My point here is that we could well have claims \nmuch larger than we had with the World Trade Center attack.\n  There are hundreds of insurers in any given market. It is a highly \ncompetitive industry.\n  But when reinsurers are not renewing their contracts without \nterrorism exclusions, many if not most of these companies will not be \nable to provide terrorism coverage--at any cost.\n  At the business decision level, each individual insurance company \nconsidering whether to issue policies that cover terrorism must assess \nthe costs that might result if the terrorists succeed in massive and \nhorrific attacks, perhaps in many areas at which the insurance company \nmay insure various businesses.\n  Because no one knows where the terrorists might strike, insurers must \nask questions like:\n  How much insured property value are we covering in a given location?\n  How many workers are we covering under workers' compensation laws, \nkeeping in mind that workers' compensation death claims vary by state \nbut are as high as $1 to 2 million dollars per claim in some \njurisdictions, including here in the District.\n  What would we lose on business interruption claims if damage in a \nmetropolitan area causes a large number of businesses to be shut down \nby the civil authorities?\n  What about multiple attacks in different locations?--keeping in mind \nthe coordinated events on September 11.\n  Unfortunately, at the individual insurer level, capital is finite, \nand the companies that insure commercial businesses have already taken \na major hit due to the September 11 losses, as well as having lost \ntheir reinsurance for terrorist acts.\n  Even a hypothetical good-sized company, one that would be in the top \nhalf dozen or so commercial insurers in the U.S., with perhaps 5 \npercent of the commercial lines market and capital of $7 or $8 billion, \nwould have to ask, do we want to roll the dice on our very survival by \nwriting terrorism coverage?\n  Because that is what they would be doing absent this legislation, \nparticularly if they incurred a disproportionate share of the losses.\n  For example, if one or more events caused even $100 billion in \ninsured losses, not that much more than the WTC, and they were lucky \nenough to have only 3-5 percent of the losses, they'd be severely \ncrippled but might survive. But if their share of the losses was 8-9 \npercent, they'd be out of business.\n  That is not a risk that an insurance company can reasonably take. If \nwe do\n\n[[Page S13913]]\n\nnot pass this legislation, therefore, insurers will be forced to take \nwhatever steps they consider necessary to ensure they do not drive \nthemselves into bankruptcy.\n  Make no mistake about it. The insurance industry can protect itself \nby reducing its exposure to terrorism going forward.\n  There is nothing we can do in the Congress, within the limits of our \nConstitution, to require insurance companies to write policies.\n  They don't have to write policies.\n  If they don't write policies, the companies may not be as profitable \nin the short run, but they will at least be protecting themselves \nagainst insolvency, as any business has to do.\n  State regulators are already considering terrorism exclusions, as \nthey must do, consistent with their responsibilities to oversee the \nsolvency of the insurance industry.\n  And absent exclusions, in states where they might not be approved for \none reason or another, the insurers will have no choice but to limit \ntheir business.\n  If insurance companies are permitted to write policies with no \ncoverage for claims connected to terrorism, then businesses will have \nto decide if they will self-insure against these losses. Many of them \nwill conclude that they cannot accept this exposure.\n  It is clear, therefore, that when we fail to pass this legislation, \nit will be both the insurance industry and everyone they insure that \nloses. Insurance companies can protect themselves by not writing \npolicies, or writing only policies without any coverage for acts of \nterror. But companies that need insurance coverage may have even \nharsher options.\n  What will be the effect on individual businesses and ultimately the \neconomic recovery if we do not pass this legislation?\n  At the individual company level, if a business in what appears to be \na potential target area can only buy insurance with a terrorism \nexclusion, the owners would have to consider whether they want to \ncommit new capital or even sell their current equity interests.\n  Banks would have to ask whether they could make new loans or perhaps \neven default existing loans and mortgages, based on their \ndeterminations that insurance without coverage for terrorism was \nunsatisfactory.\n  If insurers could not exclude terrorism and were forced to reduce \ntheir writing generally, the problem could be even worse, at least in \nwhatever areas or for whatever types of business were considered most \nat risk.\n  Companies would find that they could not get coverage for their \nproperties or their liability exposure or their workers' compensation \nliabilities, because insurers were no longer able to provide it.\n  This is why the real estate industry and a cross section of the \nbusiness community have been pushing for this legislation.\n  So, the issue is how we enable insurance companies to determine that \nthe risk of terrorist claims is a risk that they can assume.\n  That is what this legislation is all about, defining the risk so that \ninsurers can assess and put a price on it.\n  This legislation is about facilitating insurance companies' ability \nto continue to write property and casualty insurance policies.\n  It is about providing business owners with the opportunity to buy \ninsurance against terror claims and doing so in the private market to \nthe extent that is possible.\n  This is, of course, not the first time we have faced this kind of an \nissue. The Federal Government has a history of partnering with the \ninsurance industry to provide coverages for risks that are too big, too \nuninsurable, for the industry alone.\n  Current examples are the flood, crop, and nuclear liability programs, \nand in the past we've seen partnerships on vaccine liability and riot \nreinsurance. From an insurability standpoint, it is beyond dispute that \nthese risks are far more insurable than terrorism, yet we continue to \nstruggle on this bill.\n  First, the existing programs cover fortuitous or accidental events, \nunlike terrorism, in which the risk is manmade, with the perpetrators \nmeasuring success by how much damage they can cause and how many people \nthey can kill. Second, the dollar exposures are far less under the \nexisting programs. Average annual losses on these programs, flood, \ncrop, and nuclear liability, are probably only about $5 billion \ncombined, a full order of magnitude lower than the losses on September \n11 alone.\n  Some might debate whether we should have passed the existing \nprograms, or whether they are operated efficiently. But there should be \nno debate about the need for a terrorism program, and we have \nstructured this one the right way, with retentions and loss sharing by \nthe industry so the incentives are there for efficient operations.\n  This legislative effort has failed in part because there are some who \nwould use this legislation as an opportunity to enact wide-ranging \nreform of the tort claims system. While I have supported tort reform in \nthe past, it is clear that these reforms are not possible now. If these \nreforms are attached to the bill, as was the case in the House-passed \nbill and as proposed in the Senate, the bill will die. This is what has \nhappened.\n  This legislative effort has failed in part because there are some who \nwould use this legislation as an opportunity to use this legislation as \nan excuse to enact a wide-ranging and unprecedented venture in Federal \nregulation of the insurance industry. Some would, for example, seek to \nimpose Federal Government price controls on the property and casualty \ninsurance policies.\n  If such controls are added to this bill, it is clear that the bill \nwill die. Price controls are obviously unacceptable to many in the \nSenate and clearly unacceptable to the other body.\n  A vote for price controls is a vote to collapse the property and \ncasualty insurance market.\n  Price controls in this sector would distort markets, create \nincentives to vacate the marketplace, and stifle competition.\n  We do know that the cost of property and casualty insurance will \nrise.\n  The current rates do not contemplate claims for acts of terror. Like \nit or not, there will have to be price increases to cover the risk of \nterrorism. The World Trade Center attack was the biggest manmade \ncasualty loss in history. It was the biggest by a multiple of 40 or 50.\n  The previous biggest manmade loss was the LA riots, which cost less \nthan a billion dollars. The current estimates are that WTC will cost \n$40 to $50 billion or more.\n  The WTC losses exceeded the insurance industry's total losses for \ncommercial property & liability coverage, general liability, and \nworkers' compensation combined for the entire 2000 year.\n  Insurance companies cannot now cover this loss, and restore reserves, \nwithout price increases.\n  Insurance industry is one of the most competitive industries in the \nU.S.\n  If rates are rising too high, companies will be falling all over \nthemselves to enter or re-enter the market.\n  But so far, all signs point in the opposite direction, with insurers \nand reinsurers running as fast as they can from this--hardly an \nindication that they're gouging and planning on realizing egregious \nprofits.\n  There's a state regulatory system in place that can clamp down on \nrates if insurers overreach--and the bill leaves the state regulators \nwith the full authority to disapprove rates that are excessive.\n  I can't think of a better way to do the opposite of what we want to \ndo, to prevent the return of a terrorism insurance marketplace, than to \nimpose price controls.\n  It is clear that the price of terror insurance will be less because \nof the Federal guarantee. If insurance companies were forced to write \nterror insurance without this guarantee, they would have to set a \nworst-case-scenario price. They would have to protect the company from \ninsolvency. It is clear that these rates would make the insurance \nunaffordable.\n  Again, however, the problem is that companies would not be able to \nset a price because of the indeterminate nature of the risk.\n  This legislative effort has failed in part because there are some who \nwould use this legislation as an opportunity to require the insurance \ncompanies to repay the government for its expenditures. This is the \ncase in the House-passed bill.\n  While requiring payment is intuitively attractive, the financial \nassistance and payback mechanism in their\n\n[[Page S13914]]\n\nbill would discourage the return of a healthy private marketplace.\n  One of our most important objectives is to encourage the return to \nthe marketplace of insurers and reinsurers. The problem with the House \nbill's financial assistance and payback approach is that it mutualizes \nthe losses within the program itself, reducing incentives for private \ninnovation in the development of pooling and reinsurance mechanisms. If \nwe're going to sunset this program, we can't provide for mutualization \nof losses throughout its duration and then expect that there will be a \nhealthy reinsurance market to the day after it terminates.\n  Even if we did not adopt the other body's first dollar mutualization \nconcept, our objective of building a healthy marketplace, real work \npracticality considerations, and public policy all argue for not \nrequiring industry payback.\n  First, a payback requirement would be contrary to our objective of \ndeveloping a healthy marketplace. A payback requirement would, from day \none, raise the specter that in the event of substantial terrorism \nlosses, insurers would not only have to pay their share of the losses \nbut would also have to go to their regulators for substantial rate \nincreases to repay the government--with no guarantees that such rate \nincreases would be allowed. That is not the way to facilitate a healthy \nmarketplace.\n  Second, from a practical standpoint, let's also recognize that under \nour bill any government payments would not really go to insurers, that \nany repayments would not really come from insurers, and that it is the \npublic in either event that will bear the cost of this program.\n  The government payments are all keyed to amounts paid to claimants, \nand any repayments would or at least should be funded by policyholders, \neither indirectly through subsequent rate increases or directly through \npolicyholder surcharges.\n  Therefore, as long as an insurer's rates for terrorism coverage are \nbased only on its deductible and quota share, government payments would \nnot give a windfall to the insurers. That is of course how rates should \nbe determined, since the state insurance commissioners will have the \nauthority to disapprove excessive or unfairly discriminatory rates.\n  It is of course the public that will also bear the cost of this \nprogram whether or not we require insurers to pay back the government. \nThe costs of any such repayments would ultimately be paid by commercial \nbusinesses, which would in turn pass the costs back to the customers, \nemployees, and shareholders, which is to say back to the public.\n  Finally, from a public policy standpoint, I would refer you to the \nvery simple fact that it is losses caused by terrorist attacks on our \ncountry that we are talking about here. It is the responsibility of the \ngovernment to protect the people against attacks from without and \nwithin, and to the extent that terrorists succeed in causing losses \nthat exceed our bill's insurance industry retentions, it is because the \ngovernment has failed in this most fundamental responsibility. Of all \nthe various programs through which the government and the insurance \npartner together to provide coverage for risks thought to be \nuninsurable, this one stands out as presenting the best case for a \ntaxpayer role.\n  In terms of price, we know that every cent of any funds the Federal \ngovernment contributes to pay claims will go to the insured, not to the \ninsurance companies.\n  There is no Federal payment to any insurance company that does not go \nthrough to the victims.\n  This makes it very hard to understand the arguments some have made in \nthe other body about the insurance companies repaying the amounts that \nthe Federal government might contribute.\n  If the government contributions are passed through to the victims, \nwhat is the benefit to the insurance companies that needs to be paid?\n  Do the companies then increase their rates to cover the cost of the \nrepayment?\n  If repayment is required, it would have to come, directly or \nindirectly, from the victims, not the insurance companies.\n  There are some who would seek to add provisions to the legislation \nfocused on ``cherry-picking,'' that is seeking to reduce the risk of \nthe portfolio of clients and load it with lower risk clients.\n  Insurance, like other financial services, is a very competitive \nbusiness--and there are a variety of opportunities for large and small \nbusinesses to get coverage, with hundreds of insurers operating in any \ngiven market.\n  For the largest businesses, which are probably most at risk due to \nthe staggering workers' compensation exposures they present, in \naddition to traditional insurers, there are sophisticated offshore, \nexcess and non-admitted markets they can tap into, as well as other \nrisk-spreading devices.\n  For the smaller companies, if coverage isn't available from standard \nprivate market insurers, most states have legislatively mandated market \nplans to provide workers' compensation and property insurance.\n  The insurance industry also has a long history of working together to \nform pools and reinsurance arrangements so risks that are too difficult \nfor one company can be handled as they've done for aircraft, including \nthose that were hijacked on September 11.\n  They can do this if we pass this bill to provide them the financial \nbackstop they need.\n  The fact is that we do not have the expertise to step into this \ncomplex arena and set the controls to determine how coverage should be \nprovided and to whom.\n  Since insurance regulation began, it's been the states that have done \nthe job, and until such time as we're ready to change that and enact a \nfederal regulatory scheme, we should be very careful about our \ninvolvement.\n  At the state level, insurance departments in each state are much \ncloser to their markets, and they have the expertise and the leverage \nto assess the availability of insurance and to take appropriate steps \nif there are problems.\n  I am very disappointed in the failure to enact this legislation. I \nhave supported my Connecticut colleague, Senator Dodd, and will \ncontinue to work with him to enact this legislation as soon as possible \nin January. That we have failed to act in this session and may well see \nunfortunate consequences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13914-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13914-S13915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NEXTWAVE SETTLEMENT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to address the issue of wireless \nspectrum and the importance of its availability and utilization in a \nstruggling economy. On November 28, 2001, the Administration forwarded \nproposed legislation to Congress to codify a proposed settlement in the \nNextWave wireless spectrum bankruptcy litigation. We needed to pass \nthis legislation before December 31st in order to avoid nullifying the \nagreement. Unfortunately, it appears we will not be able to address \nthis settlement before the end of the year because members of this body \nhave expressed their intention to block its consideration on the floor. \nIt is not certain that a similar settlement can be arranged next year--\nwhich leaves a significant financial return to the U.S. Treasury in \ndoubt and denies viable industry actors access to essential wireless \nspectrum which could be a vital tool in jumpstarting the economy.\n  This is not the first time I have voiced my concerns about the \nNextWave spectrum controversy. In a letter to then Chairman Kennard of \nthe Federal Communications Commission in October of 2000, I warned him \nthat a premature re-auction of the NextWave licenses would be imprudent \nwhile litigation was still pending in the D.C. Circuit. The legal \nquestions went directly to the possessory interests of the spectrum and \nthe validity of the FCC's action to automatically cancel NextWave's \nlicenses upon filing for bankruptcy. The FCC ignored my warning and, in \nso doing, created untold practical problems and a myriad of legal \nliability issues.\n  On June 22 of this year, the D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of NextWave, \nholding that the FCC violated Section 525 of the Bankruptcy Code. This \norder essentially nullified Auction 35 in which the FCC preemptively \nre-auctioned the spectrum licensed to NextWave. Presently, both sides \nhave filed for certiorari with the Supreme Court to ask for\n\n[[Page S13915]]\n\nthe final disposition of this case. However, there is no certainty that \nthe Supreme Court will agree to review the case, or if it does, when or \nto whom it will ultimately award the licensing rights to the spectrum. \nIn fact, given the D.C. Circuit's opinion and legal reasoning, there is \na substantial likelihood that the FCC will not prevail, which may be \nwhy they were able to reach the settlement of this issue.\n  After extensive negotiations, the interested parties, including the \nOffice of Management and Budget, the U.S. Department of Justice, and \nthe FCC, reached a comprehensive Settlement Agreement to govern the \ndisposition of the licenses in question and provide for their release \ninto the marketplace and financial return to the Treasury.\n  This proposal is a chance to bring closure to litigation that has \ndragged on, and which, in all likelihood, could result in a net loss to \nthe government if it were to continue. We have an opportunity to \nfinalize this settlement, return money to the Treasury and release \nvaluable spectrum for commercial use--something that is essential to \nhelp this struggling economy.\n  The current litigation has been prolonged unnecessarily. To continue \nit now, in my view would be a mistake, and the American taxpayer could \nbe the loser. I certainly hope that the American taxpayer ultimately is \nnot the victim of Congressional inaction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13915-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13915-S13918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to share my dissappointment \nabout the farm bill with you. It is vital that we get a strong bill \npassed before we adjourn this year and, unfortunately, that isn't going \nto happen. To put it simply: Our farmers and ranchers deserve more from \ntheir representatives.\n  As long as I have been in the Senate, I have never seen the \nagricultural community more united than they were yesterday in invoking \ncloture and getting the Senate farm bill passed the floor this year.\n  The farm bill we passed out of committee is a good bill. It is not a \ngreat bill. But it's a good step in the right direction. We had the \nopportunity to work together to make this bill as comprehensive, full \nof common sense, and strong as possible. My sleeves were rolled up and \nI was dedicated to passing the farm bill this year. And I'm still \ndedicated to passing a bill when we get back next month.\n  We need to support our Nation's agricultural producers. Now. We can't \nwait until the current bill expires. We rely on our producers for a \nsafe and affordable food supply. Now they are relying on us for \nsurvival.\n  Our agricultural producers are suffering. Years of low prices and \ndrought have made it nearly impossible for farmers and ranchers to \nbreak even.\n  Low prices and drought have been disastrous not only to agricultural \nproducers, but also to the surrounding rural communities. When \nproducers are hurting, they can't invest in our economy. Agriculture is \nthe backbone of Montana's economy. And the backbone of rural America's \neconomy. The ripple effect is being felt throughout the country.\n  To help with the ongoing drought, it is important that we provide our \nfarmers and ranchers with natural disaster assistance. I included more \nthan $2 billion towards disaster assistance in my economic stimulus \nbill, but that bill has fallen to the same fate as the farm bill--it's \nat a stalemate this year. I'm dedicated to including disaster \nassistance in the farm bill, in another economic stimulus bill, or any \nother vehicle I see available. The assistance isn't something our ag \ncommunity can wait for and I'll keep working to see that they don't \nhave to.\n  The Senate's failure to pass a farm bill this year not only hurts our \nproducers, it hurts our lenders and our rural businesses as well. The \nbill that we passed by the Senate Agriculture Committee includes a \nRural Development Title that would have provided rural economies with \nmuch needed support. It's long overdue that we provide stability for \nour agricultural producers and our rural economies.\n  Lenders in Montana and across the country are getting nervous as the \nlean years of production are starting to add up. Their nervousness is \ncompounded now that we failed to act this year.\n  The time has come. We can no longer wait to repair the current farm \nbill. The health and stability of our producers, of our rural \ncommunities, and of America is up to us. Our Nation depends upon our \nagricultural producers for a safe, affordable, and abundant food \nsupply. Now our producers are depending on us to provide them with a \nsafety net they can rely upon. The time is now. We must all dedicate \nourselves to getting back to work on the farm bill in January. We must \nwork together to pass a strong, stable, and comprehensive farm bill \nquickly.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, over the past 2 weeks, the Senate has \nengaged in what is probably a first in the history of this body: it has \nworked to complete a task before a deadline. Even as appropriations \nbills remained unfinished 3 months into the fiscal year, we have, for \nthe past couple of weeks, debated a farm bill a full 9 months before \nthe current authorization lapses.\n  As admirable as it is to work ahead of schedule, this has been an \nunnecessary exercise. There is no reason that the Senate has had to \ndebate the farm bill when these programs don't expire until the end of \nthe fiscal year.\n  I joined in the successful effort here in the Senate to postpone \ndebate on the farm bill until next year. It is my hope that we will do \na better job at writing a bill that will address the needs of our \nfarmers in a fiscally responsible way, rather than rushing a bill \nthrough Congress for the sake of passing a bill.\n  The only reason we have debated this bill a year ahead of schedule is \nbecause some fear that the fiscal year 2003 budget resolution won't \nhave enough room in it to load up whatever farm bill the Senate \nconsiders with all the spending the majority desires.\n  Indeed, according to an article in the December 8th edition of \nCongressional Quarterly, ``lobbyists fear that if Congress waits until \n2002, when the current authorization bill expires, then the $73.5 \nbillion in new spending for agriculture programs over the next 10 years \nthat was set aside by this year's budget resolution might vanish.''\n  Senator Kent Conrad, the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who \nclearly must understand our country's financial condition, has said, \n``the money is in the budget now. If we do not use the money . . . it \nis very likely not going to be available next year.''\n  That does not sound like ``need'' to me, it sounds like opportunism, \nand opportunism is not sufficient reason for the majority to rush \nthrough a bill this important and this expensive.\n  I agree with the analysis of Senator Lugar, the Agriculture \nCommittee's Ranking Member, who correctly stated on the Senate floor \nlast Tuesday, December 11, that, ``Proponents of the bill, S. 1731, \nfastening on to a budget resolution adopted earlier this year, said we \nhave pinned down $172 billion over 10 years, $73.5 billion over \nbaseline, over the normal expenditures that have been occurring year by \nyear in the agriculture bills . . . I and others have pointed out that \n[the money] really is not there.''\n  Now, I take a back seat to no one in terms of my concern for the \nAmerican farmer. When I was governor of Ohio, agribusiness was my \nnumber one economic development initiative.\n  Many people, even Ohioans, don't realize that food and agribusiness \nmeans more than $73 billion to Ohio's economy each year. In fact, one \nin six Ohioans is employed in one aspect of agriculture or another.\n  I gave agriculture more attention and priority than any governor in \nmemory, and I continue my close relationship with Ohio's agribusiness \ncommunity.\n  Nevertheless, I could not support the majority's farm bill as \nwritten, and honestly, I am disappointed at the apparent lack of \nrespect some of my colleagues seem to have for the American farmer.\n  Every farmer worth his salt knows that if he or she wants to stay in \nbusiness, they have to be fiscally responsible and make tough choices. \nThey know that the United States has to do so as well. They understand \nthat the majority's farm bill did not focus on proper planning and \nmaking the right choices, but rather ``getting while the getting is \ngood.''\n  Some here in Washington think that viewpoint epitomizes the American\n\n[[Page S13916]]\n\nfarmer, but for anyone in this body to think that the American farmer \nis only concerned about ``what's in it for him,'' is an insult to their \npatriotism and their own understanding of fiscal responsibility.\n  Let me make it abundantly clear, this bill was written and has been \ndebated without any regard for the other obligations our nation now \nfaces. It is heedless of America's national security needs and it does \nnothing to acknowledge the long-term fiscal responsibilities of our \nNation. Instead, the Majority's Farm Bill really just helps the \nnation's agricultural conglomerates.\n  When Congress passed the last farm bill in 1996, it did so with the \nintention that it would gradually phase out the heavy reliance on \nsubsidies characteristic of previous farm bills and move towards a more \nmarket-oriented approach. That bill was named Freedom to Farm.\n  However, had S. 1731 passed, it would have increased federal spending \nby over $70 billion over ten years, putting us back to where we were \nprior to Freedom to Farm, when farmers were more dependent on the \nfederal government.\n  I remain supportive of market-based farm policies, but I believe \nimportant improvements must be made to the current system that will \nallow our farmers to adapt to a global marketplace. Unfortunately, that \nsame marketplace has kept U.S. prices and income low for the past three \nto four years due to ever increasing world supplies coupled with low \nexport demand.\n  The cost has been outrageous, with Congress appropriating more than \n$32 billion in emergency spending since Fiscal Year 1999 to offset low \nprices and assist farmers who suffered losses due to natural disasters. \nI have to ask: What happened to Freedom to Farm?\n  I have opposed these emergency measures, not only because they were \nnot offset, which has added to our current budget crisis, but also \nbecause ``stop gap'' emergency measures only meet a temporary need, and \ndo nothing to help the long-term outlook for the American farmer.\n  Unfortunately, the majority, in their bill, attempted to rectify this \nsituation by making these emergency payments essentially permanent.\n  In a December 14 editorial titled ``A Piggy Farm Bill,'' the \nWashington Post labeled S. 1731 ``obscene,'' and pointed out that \nbillions indeed have been made available in the past few years in \n``emergency'' payments, however, the Post goes on to say ``the effect \nof the new bill would be to regularize those [payments], thereby \nabandoning the five-year experiment in supposed market reform.''\n  Another contention that I have with the majority's bill, is that \npassage of S. 1731 as written could very well have put the U.S. in \nviolation of our obligations under the World Trade Organization and \nweakened our demands that Europe and other countries cut subsidy \npayments to their agricultural producers.\n  In an article that appeared in the December 18 edition of the \nFinancial Times, former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy, noting \nCongress' apparent willingness to abandon a market-based approach to \nagriculture, stated ``It's very awkward. Here we are involved in a \nglobal effort to reduce subsidies, and this [bill] flies in the face of \nthat effort.''\n  Current Agriculture Secretary, Ann Veneman, said in the same article \nthat the legislation would ``exacerbate overproduction and perpetuate \nlow commodity prices,'' which would undermine our ability to expand \ninto new foreign markets.\n  That's because the majority's farm bill would put in place counter-\ncyclical payments, which pay farmers a subsidy as the price of their \ncommodity falls. This approach most assuredly would run afoul of the \nWTO treaty.\n  What's more, the subsidies under the majority's proposal would go to \nmillions of farmers and quite a few wealthy individuals and even some \nFortune 500 corporations.\n  Again, the Financial Times article references an organization known \nas The Environmental Working Group, which has on its web-site a \ncompilation of more than 2.5 million farmers who receive subsidies. Of \nthat total, the largest farms get the most amount.\n  To quote the news article, ``just 1,290 farms have each received more \nthan $1 million in the past five years; Tyler Farms of Arkansas, which \ngrows cotton, rice and soybeans, led the list at more than $23 million. \nIn addition, 11 Fortune 500 companies, including Chevron and \nInternational Paper, also received farm subsidies. In contrast, the \naverage farm in the bottom 80 percent got just $5,830.''\n  While I would have voted against the bill proposed by the majority, \nthe Cochran-Roberts Amendment that was considered on Tuesday provided a \nworkable alternative.\n  Instead of creating a counter-cyclical program, the Cochran-Roberts \nAmendment would have created farm savings accounts for producers to \nparticipate in on a voluntary basis, with matching funds provided by \nthe USDA. This money would help farmers make ends meet during the lean \nyears and would be a great improvement over the current practice of \nrelying on touch-and-go so-called ``emergency'' supplemental farm \nspending bills.\n  While I am still concerned with the expense of the Cochran-Roberts \nAmendment, it evenly divides its spending over the first and last five \nyears, and is thus more fiscally responsible than the Majority's \nproposal which frontloads $45.3 billion of their $73.5 billion bill in \nthe first five years. Unfortunately, the Cochran-Roberts amendment was \ndefeated along party lines.\n  So we were left with the bill pushed by the majority with a price tag \nwe cannot afford. It will most assuredly exceed the $73.5 billion, 10-\nyear spending increase allowed by the fiscal year 2002 Budget \nResolution.\n  As we near the end of this year, we find ourselves facing challenges \nthat could never have been predicted a year ago. An economic slowdown \nthat began in the spring of 2001 has now been deemed a full-fledged \nrecession; a recession that was exacerbated by the events of September \n11.\n  As Americans have responded generously to the needs of the victims \nand their families, the federal government has acted quickly and \nsignificantly as well. We've passed a $40 billion emergency \nsupplemental bill, as well as $5 billion in grant funding to help \nprevent the collapse of the airline industry. In addition, we could \nspend another $100 billion for an economic stimulus package soon after \nwe return from recess.\n  Add all that to the $25 billion that Appropriators and the White \nHouse agreed this summer to spend over and above the fiscal year 2002 \nbudget resolution that Congress passed, and we could spend some $170 \nbillion over the budget resolution.\n  To put that in perspective, $170 billion represents 30 percent of all \nthe regular discretionary spending Congress enacted in fiscal year \n2001.\n  Given this amount of spending, the Senate is poised to spend every \nlast tax dollar, all of the Medicare surplus and the entire $174 \nbillion projected Social Security surplus. Even that won't be enough.\n  To cover all of this spending, including the spending in the \nmajority's farm bill if it passed, the federal government would have to \nissue tens of billions of dollars in new debt this fiscal year \ndepending on the size of the stimulus bill, any additional defense \nspending we pursue, plus the inevitable emergency supplementals \nCongress will pass between now and the end of the fiscal year.\n  It's amazing that a few months ago, people here were worried we would \nrun out of debt to repay. Now, we are in a far different situation.\n  In fact, Treasury Secretary O'Neill sent a letter to the Majority \nLeader last week requesting that the government's debt ceiling be \nraised. The Secretary indicated that the current borrowing limit of \n$5.95 trillion will be reached by February and that the administration \nrequests that the national debt ceiling be raised to $6.7 trillion.\n  As recently as August, the administration projected that the current \nborrowing limit would not be reached until September 2003. This is \ndisturbing.\n  I am pleased we are not going forward with a farm bill that we cannot \nafford at a time of fiscal crisis, and that we are not going forward \nwith a bill that is frankly not in the best interest of our farmers and \ndefinitely not in the best interest of the American people. It is \nunfortunate, though, that we spent two weeks debating the majority's \nfarm bill, when there are three\n\n[[Page S13917]]\n\nother pieces of legislation that I believe we should have been \nconsidering instead.\n  Our number one priority should be an economic stimulus bill, or \n``jobs bill'' as it should be called.\n  Just last week, I was part of a six-member bipartisan group of \nsenators who were invited to the White House by the President to \ndiscuss the stimulus bill and the package that the Centrist Coalition \nhas been working on for the past seven weeks. After the meeting, \nPresident Bush announced his support for our stimulus package; a \npackage that responds to the needs of those who are currently \nunemployed by extending benefits and health care coverage.\n  It also provides rebate checks to those Americans who pay Social \nSecurity taxes but who did not qualify for rebate checks earlier this \nyear. It would truly be a wonderful holiday present for the working men \nand women of America as well as the nation itself since people would \nreceive extra cash to help pay their holiday bills, and their spending \nwould help spur the U.S. economy.\n  The bill also contains other stimulus functions, including 30 percent \ndepreciation bonuses to encourage investment; a reduction in the 27 \npercent tax rate to 25 percent; and tax incentives to encourage small \nbusiness owners to increase investment.\n  I won't sugarcoat the fact that it will take a lot of money to \njumpstart our $10 trillion economy, and our approach may cost up to \n$100 billion. However, I believe that it is necessary to get our nation \nout of the recession we're in.\n  That's why I am somewhat dismayed that the Majority Leader did not \nbring the stimulus bill to the floor for consideration during these \npast couple of weeks. Early this morning the House passed a responsible \nbill based on the Centrist package which the President has agreed. It's \na compromise package that reflects much of what the Majority Leader has \nsaid he wanted. However, that wish list seemed to shift when it became \nclear that a genuine willingness to compromise existed. The American \npublic have expected us to pass such a bill, and I am disappointed that \nwe have not yet done so.\n  The second bill we should consider is a terrorism reinsurance bill. \nThis legislation would provide government backing to help cover the \ncosts of damages incurred in the event of an act of terrorism. Without \nit, we are going to see many businesses with enormous increases in \ntheir insurance costs. And that's for companies that can get insurance.\n  As a result, projects that are on the table or in the planning \nprocess will not go forward and the economy will suffer.\n  There is a bipartisan proposal that is being worked on, and I can see \nno reason why we should not have pushed to get this bill onto the floor \nof the Senate before the end of the year.\n  The third bill is a comprehensive energy bill, one that will help our \neconomy and harmonize our energy needs with our environmental needs.\n  While national energy policy is being held hostage to the demands of \nenvironmental groups, the United States must continue to rely on energy \nsources in the Middle East. Surely I don't have to remind my colleagues \nof the political instability that exists in this area of the world.\n  The most glaring example of how the lack of an energy policy is \naffecting us is the fact that we currently rely on Iraq for more than \n750,000 barrels of oil per day. As my colleagues know, Iraq is a hotbed \nof terrorism, and I have no doubt the manufacturer of weapons of mass \ndestruction, run by a man who would dearly like to inflict pain upon \nthe United States if given the ability.\n  We have to put the interests of the American people in front of \npolitics and special interest groups. I say to my colleagues that it is \nbetter to be able to know that we can rely upon ourselves to meet our \nenergy needs than to rely on Saddam Hussein. We need to stand up and do \nthe right thing and pass a comprehensive energy policy now, and to me, \nit is incredible that the Majority Leader placed it on the back-burner \nin favor of a farm bill that we can consider later this fiscal year.\n  Our farmers understand the need to enact these three bills because \nthey use energy, because they feel the pinch of a soft economy, and, \nbecause farmers know the right thing to do.\n  It is my hope that we will be able to address these three issues \nquickly when we return next year and that we will do a better job of \nprioritizing all of the necessary work this body undertakes.\n  There was no compelling reason why we needed to consider the Farm \nBill one week before Christmas. In fact, with one year left on the \nauthorization of the Freedom to Farm Act, we will have almost all of \n2002 to work on this legislation.\n  When we return next year, and after we take up the critical issues \nlike energy, stimulus and terrorism insurance, we should follow the \nPresident's suggestion and sit down with real numbers and put together \na farm bill that is fair to America's farmers, the men and women who \nreally need help; fair to the American taxpayer; and fiscally \nresponsible. I also would encourage my colleagues to take a look at \nother farm bill alternatives, such as Senator Lugar's proposal, and the \nproposal put forth by Senators Cochran and Roberts. I believe they are \non the right track.\n  Right now, we are facing tough times that affect all Americans, \nincluding farmers, and the Senate needs to make tough choices because \nthat is what our constituents have elected us to do.\n  The majority's farm bill, S. 1731, was the wrong bill at the wrong \ntime. We shouldn't have wasted precious time on flawed legislation. Our \nfarmers deserve a bill that has been fully vetted, following a \nthoughtful and comprehensive debate. Sadly, S. 1731 offered our farmers \nprecious little in that regard as the majority focused more on getting \na bill done than getting the right bill done.\n  It is my hope that in the months ahead, we will craft a Farm Bill \nthat will help farmers succeed while reflecting the other pressing \nfiscal needs that also face our nation. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to enact such legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Financial Times, Dec. 18, 2001]\n\n        US Agricultural Bill Will Go Against the Grain Worldwide\n\n\n  proposals to increase subsidies for farmers could violate wto rules\n\n                           (By Edward Allen)\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Financial Times, Dec. 18, 2001]\n\n U.S. Agricultural Bill Will Go Against the Grain Worldwide: Proposals \n       To Increase Subsidies for Farmers Could Violate WTO Rules\n\n                           (By Edward Alden)\n\n       Five years ago, when the US Congress last passed a major \n     bill to reform its farm policy, it pledged to wean farmers \n     from two generations of government subsidies and reintroduce \n     market pressures into US agriculture.\n       This week, the Senate is set to follow the House of \n     Representatives in declaring that experiment a failure. \n     Instead, Congress is close to approving legislation that will \n     increase federal subsidies to farmers by more than $70bn over \n     the next decade.\n       The sharp turnround has undermined the Bush \n     administration's preparations for the launch of a new round \n     of world trade talks that is supposed to cut sharply \n     government supports for agriculture. The increase in subsidy \n     payments to farmers could put the US in violation of World \n     Trade Organisation rules, and will seriously weaken the \n     credibility of US demands that Europe cut its farm subsidies.\n       ``It's very awkward,'' said Mike Espy, a former secretary \n     of agriculture. ``Here we are involved in a global effort to \n     reduce subsidies, and this flies in the face of that \n     effort.''\n       Over the past decade, the US government has tried to \n     persuade farmers that their future lies in opening up markets \n     for farm products abroad.\n       But instead, US exports fell sharply following the 1998 \n     Asian financial crisis and commodity prices plummeted. This \n     led Congress to approve billions of dollars in emergency \n     payments to US farmers over the past three years. ``We have \n     seen that export markets do not serve as a reliable safety \n     net in and of themselves,'' said Tom Harkin, the Iowa senator \n     who is the chief sponsor of the Senate bill. The new farm \n     bill will entrench that philosophy by institutionalising so-\n     called counter-cyclical payments--subsidies that rise as crop \n     prices fall.\n       Such subsidies, which have the perverse effect of \n     encouraging increased production when prices are falling, run \n     directly counter to what the US has tried to achieve in the \n     WTO. The Bush administration admitted earlier this year these \n     counter-cyclical payments fall into the so-called amber box \n     of\n\n[[Page S13918]]\n\n     subsidies that must be reduced under WTO rules.\n       If crop prices continue to fall, automatically increasing \n     government payments to farmers, the US could run up against \n     the Dollar 19.1bn per year that is the maximum allowed under \n     these restrictions.\n       The administration and some critics in Congress have tried \n     to fight back.\n       Ann Veneman, agriculture secretary, said earlier this month \n     the new farm bill would ``exacerbate overproduction and \n     perpetuate low commodity prices'', and would compromise US \n     efforts to open new markets abroad. Pat Roberts, the Kansas \n     senator who was the chief author of the 1996 farm reform, was \n     blunter.\n       He charged last week that the powerful farmers who will \n     reap a windfall in new subsidies ``view the farm bill as an \n     ATM machine'', the American term for automatic cash \n     dispensers. The administration and its outmanned supporters \n     in Congress are hoping to delay final passage of the bill \n     until next year when the government will produce new budget \n     numbers. Those figures, which will show the federal surplus \n     vanishing as a result of recession, tax cuts and the war on \n     terror, could create pressure to curb farm spending.\n       The bloated farm bill legislation has indeed cast an \n     embarrassing new light on rural America's dependency on the \n     federal government.\n       The Environmental Working Group, a non-profit organisation, \n     last month posted on its website a comprehensive list of the \n     subsidies received by more than 2.5m American farmers.\n       The data, obtained under US freedom of information laws, \n     shows that a small number of large farmers gets the vast \n     majority of federal payments. Just 1,290 farms have each \n     received more than Dollars 1m in the past five years; Tyler \n     Farms of Arkansas, which grows cotton, rice and soybeans, led \n     the list at more than Dollars 23m.\n       In addition, 11 Fortune 500 companies, including Chevron \n     and International Paper, also received farms subsidies. In \n     contrast, the average farm in the bottom 80 per cent got just \n     Dollars 5,830.\n       The new bill would only increase that trend by linking \n     payments firmly to production, thereby rewarding the \n     country's largest farmers.\n       Other agricultural exporting countries like Australia and \n     many Latin American nations are dismayed by the direction of \n     US farm policy. Warren Truss, Australia's agriculture \n     minister, said during a visit to Washington last week that \n     the new bill would ``entrench a mentality of farm subsidies \n     in the US.\n       ``It is obvious that the US which once proudly boasted it \n     had the most efficient farmers in the world, has now \n     degenerated to a situation where US farmers are dependent \n     upon the taxpayers for around half their income.''\n       The European Union, however, has been noticeably quiet on \n     the farm bill debate. As the world's largest provider of \n     agricultural subsidies--at least for the moment--the EU has \n     the most to gain from a bill that will do much to erase any \n     US claims to free market virtue.\n       Said one EU agricultural official: ``It has certainly taken \n     the heat off us.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13918-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAITH-BASED INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, unfortunately, during this holiday season \nthere has been a decline in charitable donations. In the land of \nplenty, having children going hungry during the holiday season is \nsimply heartbreaking. But today too many charitable organizations are \nfacing new funding constraints and cutting back on items like food \nvouchers. Many of us in Congress have been interested in looking for \nways to resolve these problems and strengthen the partnership between \ncharities and the Federal Government.\n  Senators Lieberman and Santorum have been working throughout the year \nto develop just such a solution. Throughout their process they have \nconsulted with my staff and the White House to ensure that the final \nproduct would be a consensus bill that would enjoy bipartisan support. \nI am pleased that the outlines to an agreement are now within reach. \nHad the Senate had more time, I would be very interested in seeing the \npackage that has emerged introduced and debated by the full Senate.\n  The Lieberman-Santorum package is comprised of two limited \ncomponents: one, a tax and technical assistance section; and two, a \nsocial services section that includes a title on equal treatment for \nnon-governmental providers, authorization for a capital compassion \nfund, a program on mentoring for children of prisoners, and \nappropriations for funding Social Services Block Grants and Maternity \nHomes.\n  I am pleased that Senators Lieberman and Santorum were able to \nresolve most of the problems that caused many to oppose H.R. 7. Their \ncompromise package eliminated privatization and the voucherization of \nfederal social service programs, as well as preemption of state and \nlocal civil rights laws. Their package also remained silent on Federal \nfunding of pervasively sectarian organizations and expansion of the \nTitle VII exemption.\n  I also support many of the tax and spending provisions that have been \nproposed. In particular, research shows that provisions like the IRA-\nrollovers and food and book donation provisions are effective in \ninducing new charitable giving. Additionally, increased funding for the \nSocial Services Block Grant is an important provision to ensure that at \nlong last we fulfill our commitment to providing adequate resources for \ncommunity programs.\n  While much hard work has already been done on all sides to get a bill \nthat can pass, some concerns remain with provisions of this package. \nGiven the slowing economy and OMB Director Daniels' statement that the \nbudget will be in deficit this year and for several years to come, the \nSenate must be careful about any new tax and spending measures that are \nunpaid for.\n  Therefore, while I strongly support increasing funding to charities, \nthe changing economic outlook demands that fiscal responsibility be \nadhered to when enacting new tax cuts. As we move into the fiscal year \n2003 budget cycle, I look forward to working with Senators Lieberman \nand Santorum, as well as the White House, to identify workable offsets.\n  It is my hope that the work that Senators Lieberman and Santorum have \ndone will not go to waste. I believe that next year we can build on the \nbipartisan process that Senators Lieberman and Santorum have created to \nresolve these outstanding issues. Once we do that I am confident the \nSenate will be able to quickly move a consensus bill.

The first year of an Administration is always difficult, \nwith a new Administration settling in and the need in the Senate to \nconfirm a host of non-judicial officials to serve in that new \nAdministration. As a result, the Senate's duty to ``advise and \nconsent'' in judicial nominations is all the more difficult to fulfill. \nI was privileged to serve as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee the \nlast two times a new Administration came into the White House. In 1993, \nwhen President Clinton arrived, we worked hard and confirmed 28 judges \nthat first year, with the White House and the Senate controlled by the \nsame party. In 1989, when the first President Bush took office, with an \nopposing Senate, we managed only 15 judicial confirmations in the first \nyear.\n  This year, the White House got a late start on its executive branch \nnominees, due to the election battle. For this and other reasons, no \njudges were confirmed while the Republicans held the Senate this year. \nSince June, when the Democrats took control of the Senate, the White \nHouse and the Senate have been controlled by different parties, \nnormally a recipe for stagnation on judicial confirmations. Still, by \nthe end of this year, if all goes as expected, we will have confirmed \nmore judges--more than twice the number confirmed in 1989, and even \nmore than we accomplished in 1993, when the White House and the Senate \nwere held by the same party. And as the guy who was running the \nJudiciary Committee in 1989 and 1993, I can tell you that we were not \nsitting on our hands back then. And clearly the Committee has not been \ndawdling this year.\n  Now, some people would come back and say ``well, what about appeals \ncourts? Appellate judges are far more important than district court \njudges.'' As a matter of fact, we have confirmed more nominees to the \nappeals courts since June than were confirmed in all of 1993 or 1989.\n  Some people will come back and say ``but Joe, you know what really \nmatters is whether the number of vacancies is growing or shrinking. Are \nwe filling the slots?'' That's true--what\n\n[[Page S13919]]\n\nreally matters is not the whole number of judges confirmed, but whether \nwe are making progress on filling the vacancies that have opened up on \nthe federal bench. Again, let's look at the numbers. In 1993, with the \nWhite House and Senate in the same hands, we barely managed to reduce \nthe number of vacancies, by 3 slots. In 1989, with the White House and \nthe Senate split between the Republicans and the Democrats, the number \nof vacancies grew over the course of the year by 14 slots--the Senate \ncould not keep pace with the retirements and resignations of federal \njudges. (It's worth noting as well that, during the entire recent \nperiod when the Committee was chaired by the Republicans, judicial \nvacancies grew by 65 percent). By contrast, this year, we will have \nreduced the number of vacancies by 20, or 18 percent. And that's only \nsince June. With the White House and the Senate controlled by different \nparties. And with the September 11 attacks happening right smack in the \nmiddle of that period!\n  I should point out that another hurdle was thrown into the Senate \nconfirmation process this year, which was not there in previous years. \nThe White House announced that it would no longer vet potential \nnominees with the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the \nJudiciary. As a result, now the ABA's evaluation of nominees must \nhappen as part of the Senate confirmation process, after the candidate \nhas been nominated by the White House. This step adds weeks to any \nconfirmation.\n  I should also point out that, not only did September 11 disrupt just \nabout everything that was happening in this country, but it \nparticularly affected the Senate; we had to turn immediately to \nlegislation necessary to authorize the war on terrorism. Moreover, the \narrival of anthrax on Capitol Hill displaced many Senators and staff, \nincluding Judiciary Committee staff. My own Judiciary Committee staff \nhas not had access to their judicial nominations files--not to mention \ntheir office--for the past two months.\n  Despite all of these disruptions and delays, which I did not face \nwhen I chaired the Committee, and which the Republicans did not face \nduring the past 6 years when they controlled the Committee, we will \nhave confirmed more judges by the end of this year than in the first \nyear of the Clinton Administration, and more than twice as many as in \nthe first year of the first Bush Administration. And we will have \nsignificantly reduced the number of judicial vacancies from in just 6 \nmonths. So, let my friends on the other side of the aisle tone down \ntheir rhetoric, and consult their history books.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13919-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13919-S13920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TECHNOLOGY AND TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is becoming increasingly clear that \nAmerican technological supremacy will be an invaluable asset in our \nefforts to combat international terrorism and protect our citizens from \nfurther attack. The technological advantages we now enjoy--in weapons, \nin communications infrastructure, and in detection systems--must be \nboth aggressively pursued and zealously guarded.\n  For example, the recent anthrax attacks in this country highlight the \nneed for the prompt deployment of effective technology to track the \norigins of the dangerous biochemical substances that threaten our \nsecurity. This lack of important information hampers our ability to \ntrack down, capture, and punish terrorists and their supporters. The \ntechnology to accomplish this goal exists, and can be quickly and \ninexpensively modified to law enforcement and public safety \nrequirements. However, the government needs to make this a priority.\n  Although we have long held concern for the impact of hazardous \nmaterials on the public, the terrorist attack of September 11 and \nsubsequent attacks require a heightened response. The weaponization of \nChemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (``CBRN'') materials \ndemands an accounting of these high-risk materials, particularly as \nthey accumulate at seemingly innocent locations. Tracking CBRN \nmaterials is an important step in anticipating and preventing their \nmisuse and thereby thwarting terrorist activity.\n  We currently have the capability for sophisticated materials \nmanagement that connects people, places, processes, and products in a \nmanner critical to security. The federal and local governments should \nwork to put in service high-risk material tracking systems that provide \nthe basis for powerful, instantaneous decision making. The government \ncontrol centers can observe the global position of hazardous materials \nprovided by producers and users in all our allied nations. In less \naccessible locations, the information could be collected through \nsatellite technology.\n  Such a hazardous materials management system should: provide for data \ncollection and for authorization at customs operations and border \ncontrols; use sophisticated bar code and embedded chip data \ntransmitting devices; employ handheld capabilities to manage field \noperations and material logistics; have multi-language capability and \nglobal reach; integrate with e-solutions and Defense Department \nEnterprise Resource Planning systems; and make use of data mining and \nknowledge management principles.\n  Our Nation should immediately move to identify and track the movement \nor accumulation of CBRN materials. We must monitor CBRN materials at \nall global locations, including where they are produced, transported, \nused, staged and/or stored. And we must track, consolidate and analyze \nthe CBRN material movements as the basis for a legitimate solution to \nthe threats posed to Americans and our citizens abroad.\n  At the same time that we use technology to better protect Americans, \nwe must make certain that our technological infrastructure is protected \nfrom attack. To that end, critical infrastructure should undergo \nautomated electronic testing of their internal and external network \nassets on a frequent and recurring basis. This testing should include \nwritten or electronic reports detailing the methods of testing used and \nthe results of all tests performed, so that trend-line analysis of \nnetwork security posture can be conducted.\n  The Policy on Critical Infrastructure Protection: Presidential \nDecision Directive 63 (``PDD-63'') provided a starting point for \naddressing cyber risks against our Nation. This directive identified \nthe critical sectors of our economy and assigned lead agencies to \ncoordinate sector cyber security efforts. This directive presents the \nvision that ``the United States will take all necessary measures to \neliminate swiftly any significant vulnerability to both physical and \ncyber attacks on our critical infrastructures, including especially our \ncyber systems.''\n  I believe that we can prepare a defense for our critical \ninfrastructure much like we prepared for problems associated with the \nyear 2000 computer bug. First, we need, as the President recently \nappointed, an executive agent for cyberspace security, who has the \npower necessary to cause mandatory private and public interaction and \ncoordination. Second, we must consider empowering and funding each PDD-\n63 lead agency to establish quantitative baselines of the external and \ninternal network security posture of their portion of critical \nindustries. This can be done through automated electronic testing. \nThird, we must identify vulnerable critical systems within the critical \ninfrastructures and secure them to the extent possible through software \nupdates, patches, and other correcting configuration issues. Fourth, we \nshould mandate continued automated electronic reassessment of systems, \nespecially after upgrades or patches are applied. This will provide \nquantitative views of security over time. We must also enforce \nelectronic documentation of reassessments and hold businesses and \nvendors accountable for failure to adhere to security mandates. \nFinally, we must expand our domestic partnerships to global public/\nprivate partnerships, including both coalition governments and \nmultinational corporations. I would also think that the broadening of \nmandates in these partnerships should consider standards for layered \nsecurity, penetration testing, and demonstrate a commitment to the \ndevelopment and installation of wireless equivalency protocols.\n  We must make use of every tool at our disposal in our fight against \nterrorism. We must take advantage of American ingenuity and our \ntechnological supremacy as we work to rid the world of terrorism. In \naddition, it is critical that we protect our critical\n\n[[Page S13920]]\n\ntechnological infrastructure from those who would use our technology \nagainst us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13920-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CHANGES TO THE 2002 APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATION AND BUDGETARY \n                               AGGREGATES\n\n  Mr. Conrad.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to discuss the \ndeteriorating situation in Zimbabwe. Over the past several months, we \nhave all watched with alarm as President Mugabe has placed his desire \nto remain in power above the best interests of his own people. In the \nprocess, Mr. Mugabe's government has destroyed the rule of law, \ncontributed to food shortages, committed violations of human rights, \nand wrecked the economy--causing unemployment to rise to more than 60 \npercent.\n  The issue has received most of the attention is land reform. There is \nno question that land reform is badly needed to ensure long-term \nprosperity in Zimbabwe. As late as 1999, the process appeared to be \nmoving in the right direction: Zimbabwe had presented a detailed plan \nfor the inception phase of a land reform effort, the World Bank had \nmade a $5 million pledge to assist with the resettlement of poor \nfarmers, and several bilateral donors, including the United States, \nmade pledges of assistance.\n  However, in an attempt to deflect attention from a failing economy, a \nmisguided military intervention in the Congo, widespread government \ncorruption, and a host of other domestic problems, President Mugabe \ndecided to support the sudden occupation of large farms. In the wake of \nthis ill-conceived policy, several farmers have been killed, the \nindependence of the judicial system has been seriously undermined, and \nagricultural production has been sharply reduced, contributing to \nwidespread food shortages throughout the country.\n  As the land seizure crisis continues, other forms of harassment and \npolitical violence in Zimbabwe--carried out primarily by members of the \nZANU-PF party against members of the Movement for Democratic Change \n(MDC), journalists, and other critics of the government--have steadily \nescalated. A number of recent events clearly indicate that the \nsituation is a risk of spiraling out of control: the MDC office in \nBulawayo was invaded and burnt down with a petrol bomb, as the police \nstood by and watched; there are reports that MDC members have been \nillegally taken into custody and tortured; the government announced the \nhumanitarian organizations will not be permitted to distribute food aid \nin rural areas where it is acutely needed; and after two journalists \nwere arrested, the minister of information compared the international \nmedia to terrorists and began notifying foreign journalists that they \nwould not be allowed to work in the country for the foreseeable future.\n  There are also serious concerns about the upcoming Presidential \nelection scheduled for early next year. As a Gallup poll shows \nPresident Mugabe running behind MDC candidate Morgan Tsvangirai, many \noutside observers believe that Mr. Mugabe and ZANU-PF will stop at \nnothing to remain in power, and are engaged in activities to undermine \nthe democratic process and illegally alter the outcome of the election. \nIn addition to the campaign of harassment and violence against MDC \nsupporters, the government has prevented non-governmental organizations \nfrom carrying out voter education campaigns and has refused to allow \nobservers from international organizations, including the European \nUnion, to monitor the elections. Moreover, the government is pushing \nthrough electoral reforms that will effectively withhold absentee \nballots from Zimbabweans living abroad, with the exception of diplomats \nand soldiers, and require voters to present proof of residency. These \nare measures that could eliminate thousands from the voter rolls.\n  Because of the serious situation in Zimbabwe, I have joined with \nSenator Feingold and sponsored a provision which was included in FY \n2002 Foreign Operations Appropriations Conference Report that requires \nU.S. executive directors to international financial institutions to \nvote against loans, except those for basic human needs or democracy-\nbuilding purposes, to the Government of Zimbabwe, unless the Secretary \nof State determines and reports that the rule of law has been restored.\n  I would also like to point out that earlier this session the House \nand Senate passed S. 494, the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery \nAct of 2001, and I look forward to President Bush signing it into law, \nas soon as possible. S. 494 contains several provisions similar to \nsection 560 in the Foreign Operations Conference Report, although \nsection 560 does not provide waiver authority.\n  Mr. President, I continue to strongly support the Administration's \nrequest for assistance to Zimbabwe for health care programs, \nstrengthening civil society that is not affiliated with the ruling \nparty, peace corps activities, and humanitarian purposes. However, the\n\n[[Page S13921]]\n\nrequest for funds to restart the International Military Education and \nTraining is premature, and would send the wrong message at this \ncritical juncture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13921-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13921-S13923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  BANKRUPTCY OF AMERICAN CLASSIC VOYAGES AND THE FAILURE OF ``PROJECT \n                               AMERICA''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President I want to bring to the attention of may \ncolleagues a short article that appeared in Sunday's New York Times \nthat points out just how awry a project based on pork barrel politics \ncan go. The article, title ``A Venture in Ships Is a Rare Zell Flop,'' \ngives a short chronicle of the rise and fall of American Classic \nVoyages (AMCV), its largest shareholder, and the government support for \nAmerican Classic Voyages that has now left the taxpayers holding the \nproverbial bag for a whopping $366.9 million in defaults on title XI \nmaritime loan guarantees.\n  On October 19, 2001, American Classic Voyages (AMCV) voluntarily \nfiled a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. \nBankruptcy Code. The petition lists total assets of $37.4 million and \ntotal liabilities of $452.8 million. The cruise line's reorganization \npetition indicated it has more than 1,000 creditors, including the \nDepartment of Transportation. The Department of Transportation in this \ncase, means the American taxpayer whose exposure on a total of six \ntitle XI maritime loan guarantees made to AMCV totals $366,897,000. The \nloans cover five vessels that were in service in Hawaii, the East \nCoast, and the Northwest Coast and the partially completed ``Project \nAmerica'' vessel at Northrup Grumman's Ingalls Shipbuildings in \nPascagoula, Mississippi.\n  In order for my colleagues to fully understand what this article in \nthe business section of the New York Times represents, we really need \nto look back at the brief history of the American Classic Voyages rise \nand the political push for AMCV's ``Project America.'' The ``Project \nAmerica'' initiative included building two 1,900 passenger cruise ships \nthat were to enter service in Hawaii in 2004 and 2005. These were to be \nthe largest cruise ships ever built in the United States. To help push \nthe program, the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD), in the face of \nstrong political support for the project, approved a $1.1 billion title \nXI loan guarantee for the construction of these two vessels on April 8, \n1999.\n  The New York Times article reports just how that political pressure \nwas felt at MARAD when it quotes a former top MARAD official who \ninsisted on anonymity saying. ``We were supported to be promoting \nshipbuilding.'' ``The maritime trade unions wanted jobs. So there was a \nlot of political support.''\n  ``Project America'' did indeed receive considerable political support \nover the last several years as noted further in the New York Times \narticle: ``In 1996 and 1997, American Classic executives met with \nmembers of Congress, labor leaders and shipyard owners in an all our \neffort to promote the project in Washington.'' My colleagues may recall \nthat this promotion paid off in the form of political support which \ntranslated into language being included in the Fiscal Year 1998 \nDepartment of Defense Appropriation Bill granting a legal monopoly for \nAmerican Classic Voyages to operate as the only U.S.-flagged operator \namong the Hawaiian islands.\n  My colleagues may recall that I questioned the merits of the \n``Project America'' at the time the special legislation was considered \nand went as far as to introduce an amendment to the fiscal year 1998 \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill to remove the monopoly \nlanguage. Based on the information available at the time, I believed \nthen that the project was more likely to fail than to succeed and I \ncalled the monopoly language, and I quote an ``egregious example of \nporkbarrel spending,'' and asked ``How many times has the U.S. Senate \nso blatantly set up a monopoly set-aside for any individual or \nbusiness?'' I would ask now, how many times will we do this in the \nfuture?\n  There were early warnings signs that something was going seriously \nwrong with the project. During the first year of construction, \n``Project America'' fell a year to a year-and-one-half behind schedule. \nBoth American Classic Voyages and Ingalls Shipbuilding were crying foul \nover construction problems and months of non-binding mediation over \ncontract disputes led to no resolution. Accusations of default came \nfrom both sides. However, on September 21 of this year a resolution was \nannounced. Yet, here we are three months later and it is still unclear \nwho was at fault as both sides have refused to discuss the dispute. \nThis is important since, the settlement agreement between Ingalls and \nAMCV, which was reviewed and agreed to by the U.S. Maritime \nAdministration, kept the American taxpayer holding all the risk.\n  To highlight just how critical the problems with Project America were \nat the time this agreement was reached, I want to read from a two-page \nsummary on the status of the project at that time that a lobbyist \nrepresenting American Classic Voyages inadvertently faxed to my office. \nIt highlights the lagging construction schedule, the claims for \nadditional payments by Ingalls, and the problems of dealing with a yard \nused to doing work under the typically higher-cost DOD procurement \nstandards.\n  One statement in the summary hints at AMCV's recognition that a \nshipyard accustomed to dealing with the U.S. Navy was ill-prepared for \nthe commercial project, is very telling of how the customer views the \nshipyard's ability to meet the demands of commercial work. The faxed \nsummary reads, ``For U.S. shipyards to succeed in commercial \nconstruction, they must use commercial procedures to maintain costs and \nensure timely delivery schedules. Cost increases and schedule delays \nhave significant impact on commercial customers--increased capital \ncosts, higher marketing costs, lost revenue from employment of the \nvessel, and market uncertainties.''\n  In March 1999, the contract for Project America was signed with great \nfanfare in the rotunda of this very building and now we have one of the \nsignatories calling into question the shipyard's ability to succeed at \ncommercial ship construction. If a customer of the shipyard is \nquestioning Ingalls Shipbuilding's ability to meet its obligations, \nshouldn't MARAD also have raised this question before it approved the \nsettlement agreement that allowed for the continuation of the project?\n  We all know the answer now.\n  In signing off on the Settlement Agreement between AMCV and Northrop \nGrumman's Ingalls Shipbuilding, MARAD, on behalf of the taxpayer, \nagreed to assume the outstanding Title XI debt of $185 million on the \nfirst of the two cruise ships under construction at Ingalls in the \nevent of an AMCV bankruptcy and complete the vessel, after the issue of \nthe remaining Title XI debt of $350 million. Fortunately, AMCV filed \nbankruptcy before the remaining debt was issued. Otherwise, MARAD would \nhave been legally obligated to complete the vessel at an additional \nloss to the taxpayers.\n  On October 29, MARAD formally announced that it was not legally \nrequired to fully fund the construction of the first ship at Ingalls \nShipbuilding. However, in a sign of just how deep the political support \nof AMCV is, and despite the overwhelming evidence that the project was \nin serious trouble and was unlikely ever to be completed, 14 members of \nCongress signed a letter urging Secretary Mineta to reconsider and move \nto complete construction of the Project America vessel. This would \ninvolve an additional $350 million in Title XI loan guarantees and the \nvessel, upon completion, would be sold by MARAD.\n  It is important to note, that with more than 80,000 new cruise ship \nberths coming on line in the next four years, MARAD expects that the \nvessel would sell for $150 to $200 million less than it would cost the \nAmerican taxpayer to build.\n  This week, MARAD will pay out $267.4 million in the first of several \npayments to be made to American Classic Voyages' creditors. The \nremaining $105.7 million will be paid off in the next 30 days as \nrequired waiting periods expire. I note for my colleagues this totals \n$366.7 million of the American taxpayers' money. And what do we have to \nshow them for these expenditures? A growing U.S.-flagged cruise\n\n[[Page S13922]]\n\nship fleet? NO. A growing and competitive U.S. shipbuilding industry? \nNO. More U.S. mariner jobs at sea? NO.\n  As a matter of act we have just the opposite. We have a smaller U.S.-\nflagged cruise ship fleet, struggling shipyards, and fewer mariners at \nsea than ever before. As I have said many times before, we owe it to \nthe taxpayer to do better and make wiser decisions.\n  AMCV is but one example to Title XI loan guarantee defaults. The \nTitle XI maritime loan guarantee program has experienced many problems \nand suffered financial difficulties throughout its history. Since the \nbeginning of this year, the program has cost taxpayers more than $339.1 \nmillion due to defaults.\n  Let me provide some background for the record: Title XI of the \nMerchant Marine Act of 1936 authorizes the Secretary of Transportation \nto make loan guarantees to finance the construction, reconstruction, or \nreconditioning of eligible export vessels and the modernization and \nimprovement of shipyards. Under regulations governing the Title XI loan \nguarantee process, applicants must meet certain economic soundness \ncriteria before receiving a commitment from MARAD. Even with controls \nin place, loan defaults during the 1980's reached into the billions of \ndollars and the program was halted. In 1986, the worst year on record, \ndefaults in pay-outs of $1.2 billion.\n  The title XI program was revived in 1993 following the enactment of \nthe Federal Credit Reform Act and the National Shipbuilding and \nShipyard Conversion Act. According to figures recently provided by \nMARAD, the title XI program has cost taxpayers $400 million in default \npayments since 1993. Of that cost, MARAD has been able to recover \nroughly 10 percent or $40 million through the disposition of assets.\n  Currently, the title XI program has an outstanding loan guarantee \nportfolio of approximately $4.7 billion consisting of 86 projects \ncovering more than 100 vessels, several hundred barges, and 7 shipyard \nmodernization projects. What that means is the American taxpayer could, \nas happened in the 1980's, be burdened with billions of dollars in debt \nif an industry downturn occurs. With that much at risk, I think we owe \nit to the American taxpayers to do all we can to ensure that adequate \nprotections are in place.\n  Our Nation has had a strong and proud maritime history. I fear our \nmaritime future, in the U.S. however, is jeopardized due to a \ndependence on government programs that do not foster a progressive and \ncompetitive attitude in what has clearly become a global market. This \nis especially true of our larger shipyards.\n  According to MARAD, the purpose of the title XI program is to promote \nthe growth and modernization of the U.S. merchant marine and U.S. \nshipyards. Yet, there is little if any evidence that either has \noccurred. Since 1993, when the title XI program was resurrected \nfollowing the heavy loan losses in the 1980s, the program has cost \ntaxpayers $400 million in default pay-outs and an additional $296.4 \nmillion in appropriated funds as required by the Federal Credit Reform \nAct.\n  Over the same period, the number of vessels in our oceangoing fleet \nshrank considerably. The number of bulk carriers in the U.S. merchant \nfleet dropped from 81 to 71, the number of container ships dropped from \n85 to 75, and the number of tankers dropped from 205 to 154.\n  If the tale of AMCV's losses is not enough to stop pork barrel \nspending on pet projects that unfairly put taxpayers' dollars at risk, \nthe figures on the U.S. fleet size should clearly show us that a \nprogram that artifically props up a U.S. shipbuilding industry that is \nstruggling to find its way in a tough world market is not working.\n  I am sure my colleagues know I oppose any program that unnecessarily \nburdens American taxpayers and subsidizes industry. But, I am not alone \nin this view. I encourage my colleagues to look at the Administrations' \nFY 2002 budget request and its ``Explanation of Program Changes'' for \nTitle XI Loan Guarantee Program. It states, ``In an effort to trim \ncorporate subsidies, the President's Budget seeks no new funding for \nthe Maritime Guaranteed Loan Subsidy Program.''\n  I wrote to President Bush in June to express my support for his \nproposal to zero-out the title XI program. In a response to my letter \nprepared for the President by Mitchell Daniels, Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget, Mr. Daniels stated: ``The Administration \nconcurs with your view that the Maritime Administration's Maritime \nGuaranteed Loan Program constitutes an unwarranted corporate subsidy.''\n  The problems with AMCV's loan guarantees raise serious questions that \nshould be answered before we allow additional taxpayer funding to be \ncommitted in the form of loan guarantees. I have written to the \nDepartment of Transportation Inspector General (IG), Kenneth Mead, \ntwice this year requesting his office look into Title XI loan guarantee \ndefaults, including American Classic Voyages, and MARAD's oversight of \nthe title XI program.\n  I understand that the Inspector General has directed such \ninvestigations to get underway. I hope he will be able to determine if \nMARAD has acted appropriately to protect the taxpayer in these matters. \nWe need to learn if Ingalls, Northrop Grumman, and American Classic \nvoyages fully and accurately presented the difficulties they faced in \nbuilding Project America to MARAD while seeking to both secure and \nrestructure the title XI loan guarantee for this project.\n  I want to close by making one last point on the New York Times \narticle. It quotes AMCV's largest investor saying, ``Everyone talks \nabout taxpayers' losses. But they never mention the fact that others \nlost significant amounts of money as well.'' That may be true; however, \nunlike investors who chose to put their money at risk on American \nClassic Voyages, the American taxpayer did not have a choice. They \ndepend on us to do the right thing, but instead they have been saddled \nwith an expenditure $366.7 million. I don't personally know all of \nAMCV's investors, but I would be willing to bet they won't make this \nsame mistake again. The question then becomes ``will we?''\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the New York Times article in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 16, 2001]\n\n                 A Venture in Ships Is a Rare Zell Flop\n\n                           (By Leslie Wayne)\n\n       Sam Zell may have the Midas touch when it comes to \n     investing in real estate. But his efforts on the high seas--\n     with cruise ships--have ended in a debacle that has cost him \n     over $100 million and taxpayers at least three times that.\n       Mr. Zell is the chairman and largest shareholder of \n     American Classic Voyages, which filed for bankruptcy \n     protection in October. This came after the failure of an \n     ambitious project by Mr. Zell to build two 1,900-passenger \n     cruise ships, the first that were to be constructed in this \n     country in 40 years. It also came despite a boatload of \n     government aid to Mr. Zell, including $1.08 billion in \n     federal loan guarantees. When it came to playing the \n     Washington game, Mr. Zell walked away a big winner in the \n     mid-1990's. His cruise ship plan--called Project America--\n     wrapped up patriotism and politics and allowed him to \n     construct his two huge ships by putting government money, not \n     his, at risk. He also secured a 30-year monopoly on all \n     cruise-ship traffic within the Hawaiian islands.\n       Helping him get this sweet deal were Senator Trent Lott, \n     the Republican minority leader, who wanted to land a big \n     project for the Ingalls shipyard in his home state of \n     Mississippi, and Senator Daniel K. Inouye, the Hawaii \n     Democrat, who engineered the exclusivity pact. Mr. Zell's \n     ships, American-made and with American crews, would be the \n     only ones allowed to sail port-to-port within Hawaii; others \n     must stop at foreign ports first, eating up time.\n       ``Obviously, I lost a lot of money,'' Mr. Zell said. \n     ``Everyone talks about the taxpayer losses. But they never \n     mention the fact that others lost significant amounts of \n     money as well. Shareholders lost a lot of money, and \n     that's very unfortunate.''\n       Last year, with American Classic shares trading at $36, Mr. \n     Zell's 3.8 million shares were worth $137 million. This fall, \n     the shores were delisted from Nasdaq when they were trading \n     at 45 cents, chopping Mr. Zell's stake to $1.7 million. The \n     government, meanwhile, is looking at losses of $367 million \n     from American Classic, which also operates four paddlewheel \n     steamboats through its Delta Queen Steamboat subsidiary.\n       The failure has incurred the wrath of Senator John McCain, \n     Republican of Arizona, who called for an investigation, which \n     the inspector general of the Transportation Department has \n     undertaken.\n       Rob Freeman, a staff member of the Senate Commerce \n     Committee, where Mr. McCain is the ranking Republican, said: \n     ``It was a bad idea. The taxpayer took all the risk.''\n       Mr. Zell got such government largess by being the right \n     person in the right place\n\n[[Page S13923]]\n\n     when the United States Maritime Administration wanted to \n     revive the domestic shipbuilding industry, which had been \n     beaten down by lower-cost foreign competitors. Without aid, \n     American Classic executives say, their project would never \n     have gotten off the ground.\n       ``We were supposed to be promoting shipbuilding,'' said a \n     former top Maritime Administration official, who insisted on \n     anonymity. ``Inouye and the whole state wanted to grow the \n     cruise business. The maritime trade unions wanted jobs. So \n     there was a lot of political support.''\n       Mr. Zell never lobbied the administration directly; his top \n     executives did. In 1996 and 1997, American Classic executives \n     met with members of Congress, labor leaders and shipyard \n     owners in an all-out effort to promote the project in \n     Washington. That effort was backed by campaign contributions \n     from Mr. Zell and American Classic to Mr. Lott, Mr. Inouye \n     and other crucial members of Congress.\n       It paid off. The $1.08 billion loan guarantee was the \n     largest the Maritime Administration had ever approved, and it \n     allowed American Classic to enter debt markets that would \n     otherwise be closed to it--and at rates comparable to \n     government debt. American Classic was also allowed to buy an \n     old foreign-made ship and use it for Hawaii cruises while the \n     two new ship were under construction, giving the company an \n     exemption from a law prohibiting foreign carriers from that \n     route.\n       But the souring economic picture of 2001 halted these \n     ambitions. By last summer, the company had cash-flow \n     problems, and the downturn in tourism after the terrorist \n     attacks pushed it over the edge. ``Sept. 11 just put it \n     away,'' Mr. Zell said. http://www.nytimes.com\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13923-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13923-S13925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S DETENTION OF OVER 1,100 INDIVIDUALS IN \n             CONNECTION WITH THE SEPTEMBER 11 INVESTIGATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was pleased to hear the Attorney \nGeneral's announcement of the first indictment of a co-conspirator to \nthe terrorist attacks on our Nation on September 11. Zacarias \nMoussaoui, who was detained by the FBI for carrying a false passport \nbefore September 11 and has been in custody since that time, has been \nindicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia. I commend the Justice \nDepartment, the FBI, and our intelligence services, for their tireless \nwork in seeking to bring Moussaoui and other terrorists to justice.\n  We have known about Mr. Moussaoui since a few short days after \nSeptember 11, but we still do not know the identities of hundreds of \nother individuals still held in detention, the vast majority of whom \nhave no link to September 11 or al-Qaida.\n  And so I rise today to speak about the Justice Department's detention \nof these individuals in connection with its investigation of the \nSeptember 11 attacks and the administration's continued refusal to \nprovide a full accounting of who these people are and why they have \nbeen detained.\n  On October 31, along with Senator Leahy, Senator Kennedy, \nRepresentative Conyers, Representative Nadler, Representative Scott, \nand Representative Jackson-Lee, I sent a letter to Attorney General \nAshcroft requesting basic information about the detention of over 1,100 \nindividuals in connection with the investigation of the September 11 \nattacks. We wanted to know who is being detained and why; the basis for \ncontinuing to hold individuals who have been cleared of any connection \nto terrorism; and the identity and contact information for lawyers \nrepresenting detainees. We also wanted information regarding the \ngovernment's efforts to seal or close proceedings and its legal \njustification for doing so.\n  I thank and commend Senator Leahy, the distinguished Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, for his efforts and leadership. Chairman Leahy \nheld four oversight hearings on the Justice Department's actions, \nincluding one hearing that I chaired focusing on the Department's \ndetention of individuals. Those hearings culminated with the testimony \nof the Attorney General himself before the Committee.\n  I come to the floor today because I remain dissatisfied with the \nAdministration's response to our request for information about the \ndetainees. Seven weeks after our letter, the Department of Justice has \ngiven flimsy and contradictory excuses but no convincing legal \njustification for keeping secret the identities of the over 550 people \nit now holds in custody for minor immigration violations.\n  In addition, the Department has not yet provided any information on \nperhaps hundreds of additional people who have been detained. These \npeople might still be being held on state or local charges, or without \ncharges, or they might have been released. Nor has the Department given \ndefinite information on the number of individuals held as material \nwitnesses.\n  After our hearings last week, I am more convinced than ever that \nCongress and the American people are entitled to this information to \nassess the Justice Department's assertions that everyone in custody has \naccess to legal counsel and is being treated fairly.\n  In the days and weeks after the attacks, the Department made \nannouncements about the status of the investigation, including tallies \nof the number of individuals detained. In fact, on October 25, the \nAttorney General announced that ``[t]o date, our anti-terrorism \noffensive has arrested or detained nearly 1,000 individuals as part of \nthe September 11 investigation.''\n  In early November, however, the Department reversed course and \ndecided it would no longer publicly release comprehensive tallies of \nthe number of individuals detained in connection with the September 11 \ninvestigation and that it would limit its counts to those held on \nfederal criminal or immigration violations. Thus, it would no longer \nkeep track of those held on state or local charges, nor would it \nindicate how many people have been released after being detained or \nhave been held without charges being filed.\n  sAccording to some recent news reports relying on sources in \nthe Justice Department, other than Zacarias Moussaoui, none of the over \n1,100 individuals who have been detained are believed to be involved \nwith the September 11 attacks. It now appears that the Department \nbelieves that at least Mr. Moussaoui is connected to September 11. And \nonly 10-15 of the detainees are believed to have any links to the al-\nQaida organization. Furthermore, according to senior Justice Department \nofficials quoted in the press, apart from Moussaoui, not a single one \nof the over 550 people detained on immigration charges is linked to al-\nQaida. This leads us to a simple, critical question: Who are the \nremaining hundreds of people and why have they been detained?\n  The Attorney General undoubtedly faces an enormous challenge: He must \nwork to find the perpetrators of the September 11 attacks and bring \nthem to justice, while, at the same time, protect Americans from future \nattacks. I fully support our law enforcement officials in their \ntireless efforts to leave no stone unturned as they investigate the \nSeptember 11 attacks and strive to protect our nation from future \nattacks.\n  But, as the Attorney General moves forward in our fight against \nterrorism, he has a responsibility to ensure that the constitutional \nfoundations of our nation are not eroded. The torch of Lady Liberty \nmust continue to shine on our Nation.\n  This is not just an abstract or theoretical concern. Our Constitution \nprotects the people of this country from the arbitrary or unfair \ndeployment of the awesome power of the Federal Government. The Federal \nGovernment has the power to ruin the lives of innocent people. The \nchecks and balances of our Constitution are crucial in protecting the \ngoverned from an unfair government.\n  While the Justice Department recently began releasing some \ninformation about the people who have been detained on federal criminal \ncharges or immigration violations, we still do not have a full picture \nof who is being detained and why. And there are reports that detainees \nhave been denied their fundamental right to due process of law, \nincluding access to counsel, and have suffered serious bodily injury. \nWe simply cannot tell if those cases are aberrations or an indication \nof systemic problems, if the Justice Department will not release \nfurther information about those being held in custody.\n  The Attorney General has repeatedly and emphatically asserted that he \nis acting with constitutional restraint. He even went so far as to \nsuggest last week that those who question his actions are giving aid \nand comfort to the terrorists. I reject that charge in the strongest \nterms. And I further believe that the Department of Justice has a \nresponsibility to release sufficient information about the \ninvestigation and the detainees to allow Congress and the\n\n[[Page S13924]]\n\nAmerican people to decide whether the Department has acted \nappropriately and consistent with the Constitution. It is not disloyal \nto view the government's assertions with skepticism. It is the American \nway.\n  Just before Thanksgiving, in response to our October 31 letter, the \nDepartment provided copies of the complaints or indictments for about \n46 people held on federal criminal charges. It also provided similar \ninformation on about 49 people held on immigration violations, but \nedited out their identities. Then, three weeks ago, the Attorney \nGeneral announced the number and identities of all persons held on \nfederal criminal charges and the number, but not the identities, of \npersons held on immigration charges. The total number of detainees is \nroughly 600 individuals. But the Department continues to refuse to \nidentify the over 550 persons held for immigration violations, or \nprovide the number and identity of persons held without charge, the \nnumber and identities of persons held on state or local charges, or \neven the number of material witnesses.\n  In statements to the press and in the Attorney General's and his \nassociates' testimony before Congress, the Justice Department has cited \na number of reasons for its refusal to provide additional information.\n  Very troubling is the Department's assertion that those being held \nfor immigration violations have violated the law and therefore ``do not \nbelong in the country.'' Without full information about who is being \ndetained and why, we cannot accept blindly this suggestion that each \nand every immigration detainee does not deserve to be in the country. \nDo all of these immigration violations merit detention without bond and \ndeportation? I doubt it, as the hearing on detainees the Judiciary \nCommittee held showed that some are very minor violations, which under \nnormal circumstances can be cleared up with a phone call or by \ncompleting some additional paperwork.\n  Another reason the Attorney General has cited for refusing to \ndisclose information about detainees is that he does not want to aid \nOsama bin Laden in determining which of his associates we have in \ncustody. Yet, the Attorney General and Assistant Attorney General \nMichael Chertoff have said nothing prevents the detainees from ``self- \nidentifying.'' This, it strikes me, entirely undercuts the argument \nthat giving out this information will help bin Laden. If the Justice \nDepartment really thought it would, it would never permit self-\nidentification and would not have released the names of those 93 \nindividuals who have been charged with Federal crimes.\n  Nor would the Department have released the name of Zacarias Moussaoui \nand the basis for his detention. The public has known about Moussaoui \nand his alleged role in September 11 and al-Qaida since shortly after \nthe attacks. The Department never tried to keep his identity or why he \nwas being detained a secret or try to prevent its disclosure.\n  Moreover, the claim that detainees can self-identify rings somewhat \nhollow, since we heard during the hearing on detainees that some of \nthese individuals have been denied access to lawyers or family, for \ndays or weeks at a time. Ali Al-Maqtari, a Yemeni national married to a \nU.S. citizen, testified that for most of the nearly two months he was \ndetained, he was allowed only one phone call, of no more than 15 \nminutes, per week. He was never charged with perpetrating, aiding or \nabetting terrorism or with any crime whatsoever, and was eventually \nreleased on bond.\n  Dr. Al Bader Al-Hazmi was held incommunicado--denied access to his \nlawyer or family--for seven days. After nearly two weeks in detention, \nDr. Al-Hazmi was released with no charges filed against him.\n  Tarek Mohamed Fayad is an Egyptian national and dentist residing in \nCalifornia. He was picked up by the FBI on September 13 and then \ntransferred to the Brooklyn Detention Center in New York City, where he \nremains to this day. According to the Wall Street Journal, it took his \nlawyer one month before she was able to locate and talk to him.\n  Unfortunately, there could be many more cases like these three I have \nmentioned. But if the Justice Department will not tell the public who \nis in detention, we can never know the circumstances of their cases.\n  It is apparent that the option of `self-identification' is not a real \noption. Indeed, it borders on the fanciful to suggest that all the \ndetainees are in a position to self-identify. Rather, there are serious \nquestions about whether the Department has denied those detained their \ndue process rights, including access to counsel.\n  The Department has also said that it is prohibited by law from \ndisclosing the information. But when I questioned both Assistant \nAttorney General Chertoff and later the Attorney General himself, they \nadmitted that there is no law that provides for a blanket prohibition \non the disclosure of information about individuals who have been \ndetained.\n  The Attorney General cited a section of the Privacy Act, as \njustification for not providing this information. The Privacy Act, \nhowever, only applies to citizens and legal permanent residents. It \ndoes not apply to aliens who are not legal permanent residents. From \nthe information provided by the Department thus far, we know the vast \nmajority of the detainees are not permanent residents.\n  Furthermore, case law under the Freedom of Information Act explicitly \nallows the government to release private information about even \ncitizens and legal permanent residents where that information reflects \non the performance of the agency.\n  And that's exactly why this information has been requested. There are \nserious questions about whether individuals who have been detained have \nbeen denied their constitutional right to due process of law. And the \nkind of information we have requested will help Congress evaluate \nwhether the Justice Department has deprived any detainee of his or her \nconstitutional rights. We seek this information not to embarrass or \nharass the detainees but to provide oversight of the Justice \nDepartment's treatment of them.\n  To make matters worse and further thwart public or congressional \nscrutiny of the Department's actions, we also learned during the \noversight hearings that the Attorney General has taken the \nextraordinary step of closing all immigration proceedings involving \nabout 550 of the 1,100 or more individuals who have been detained. This \nmeans no visitors, no family and no press are allowed. As Mr. Al-\nMaqtari's attorney Michael Boyle has said, this secrecy taints the \nproceedings, even when, in cases like Mr. Al-Maqtari's, the FBI has \ncleared the immigrant of any link to terrorism whatsoever. This should \ngive us all pause. People innocent of any connection to terrorism are \nbeing branded terrorists and being evaluated in secret proceedings. \nThis is not right.\n  In sum, the various reasons cited by the Department for not \ndisclosing information about the detainees are contradictory and lack \nlegal justification. I once again urge the Administration to release \nbasic information about the people now held in federal custody, except \nfor the identities of material witnesses. And the Administration should \nalso give us whatever help it can in identifying people who may be held \nin state custody. Rather than expending its resources trying to keep \nthese detentions secret, the Administration should show that it has \nconfidence in what it is doing by opening up its actions to public \nscrutiny.\n  This is not simply a question of constitutional rights, it is a \nquestion of effective law enforcement. It became clear during our \nhearing on the detainees that the roadblocks to individuals consulting \nwith counsel not only cause great hardship to the detainees and violate \ntheir rights, but also hinder the investigation and waste the resources \nof law enforcement on people who have no connection with terrorism. As \nMr. Goldstein, an attorney for Dr. Al-Hazmi, testified:\n\n       Dr. Al Hazmi's attorneys had notified the appropriate law \n     enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice in \n     writing, requesting the whereabouts of their client and \n     expressing their desire to communicate with him. Despite \n     these efforts--and despite Dr. Al Hazmi's repeated requests \n     to consult with his counsel--Federal authorities stonewalled \n     and continued to interrogate Dr. Al Hazmi in the absence of \n     his counsel.\n\n  Mr. Goldstein added:\n\n       By denying Dr. Al-Hazmi access to his retained counsel, \n     Federal law enforcement officials not only violated my \n     clients rights,\n\n[[Page S13925]]\n\n     they deprived themselves of valuable information and \n     documentation that would have eliminated many of their \n     concerns. Their obstructionism prolonged the investigative \n     process, wasting valuable time and precious resources.\n\n  I was gratified that a number of my colleagues expressed concern \nabout the treatment of Mr. Al Maqtari and Mr. Al-Hazmi, and \nparticularly about the difficulties they had in communicating with \ncounsel. I have focused in recent weeks on the issue of access to \ncounsel because I believe this issue is at the center of how our \njustice system is treating these detainees. This is the issue that \ntakes the concern over the fate of the detainees from an abstract \ndebate over civil liberties versus security to a very specific and very \nimportant inquiry about how our government actions affect the lives of \nhundreds of people.\n  What happened to Mr. Al Maqtari and his wife Tiffany had a severe \nimpact on their well being. What has happened to hundreds of other \ndetainees has similarly affected them. We are not just engaged in a \nhypothetical law school exam question or a mock crisis where we each \nplay a role. We are talking about taking the liberty of real people, \nwith real families and real lives. It is not enough to say that some \nliberties have to be sacrificed in these difficult times. Rather, we \nmust be able to determine whether the actions of the Department have \nbeen reasonable, and whether the sacrifices that are being requested \nare justified.\n  That is where lawyers come in. With a lawyer, a detainee can much \nmore readily answer concerns about his behavior, provide documents to \nshow his whereabouts during crucial periods, and generally provide \ninformation to show that he is not a terrorist. Lawyers can help \ndetermine whether the extreme step of detention without bond is \nwarranted. And they can explain what is going on to the detainee and \nthe public. I asked the Attorney General at our hearing to take steps \nto ensure that everyone under detention who wants a lawyer can obtain \none. And I asked him to determine how many of the detainees are not \nrepresented by counsel. I hope he will follow through on our \ndiscussion. It is essential that anyone who is being held have counsel \nand be able to communicate with counsel.\n  The Attorney General has said reasoned discourse should prevail. I \nagree. But in order to have that reasoned discourse, the Justice \nDepartment should provide Congress and the American people with enough \ninformation to promote a fair and open dialogue and make our oversight \nmeaningful. Our hearings showed that not all the detainees have \nadequate access to counsel. They showed, at least, that the Congress \nhas reason to test and examine the Administration's assertions that \neveryone's constitutional rights are being respected in this \ninvestigation. By continually saying in the face of this evidence that \nwe should take its assertions about the treatment of the detainees on \nfaith, the Administration furthers the appearance that it has something \nto hide.\n  I hope that we are not in some sense following those who rounded up \nover 120,000 Japanese Americans and thousands of German and Italian \nAmericans during World War II. The rhetoric we hear today rings awfully \nfamiliar. We must not return to the time when immigrants who provided \nso much to our nation were suddenly branded ``enemy aliens'' and \ndeprived of their liberty and other fundamental rights.\n  Let us not repeat these mistakes of history. I again call on the \nAdministration to fulfill its responsibility to protect the \nConstitution in its pursuit of liberty and justice for all. It can \nbegin by identifying those now held in Federal Custody and providing \nthe other information requested in our October 31 letter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13925-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13925-S13929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INVESTOR AND CAPITAL MARKETS FEE RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to address an issue which I \nbelieve may merit the attention of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission following enactment of H.R. 1088, the Investor and Capital \nMarkets Fee Relief Act.\n  That bill has two main impacts. It authorizes the commission to raise \nthe salaries of its staff to levels that are on a par with the \ncompensation paid by other Federal financial regulators. Our securities \nmarkets are the envy of the world. It is important that the regulator \nof those markets be in a favorable position to attract and retain \nqualified employees. Enacting pay parity contributes towards this goal \nand will result in enhanced supervision of the securities markets.\n  In addition, the bill reduces certain fees charged to investors and \nissuers. Section 11 of the bill provides an effective date for \nreduction of transaction fees on the later of, one, the first day of \nfiscal year 2002; or two, 30 days after the date on which a regular \nappropriation to the Commission for such fiscal year is enacted. \nBecause the regular appropriation to the Commission (H.R. 2500) was \nsigned into law on November 28, 2001, Public Law 107-77, the effect of \nSection 11 is to provide an effective date for transaction fee \nreduction of December 28, 2001, regardless of when the bill is enacted.\n  The legislation was passed by the Senate on December 20, 2001, and \nstill must be signed by the President. Thus, the industry will have at \nmost only a few days to comply with the law. I have been informed by \nsome market participants that this may not allow them adequate time to \nre-program and test their computers to make certain that the transition \nto the new fee structure goes smoothly and without flaws.\n  I believe it would be appropriate, and consistent with the intent of \nthis legislation, for the commission to review this situation and \ndetermine whether it is necessary or appropriate in the public \ninterest, and consistent with the protection of investors, to use the \ncommission's general exemptive authority to extend the effective date \nfor the reduction of transaction fees for a brief period as may be \nreasonably necessary in order for market participants to comply with \nthe new law fully and without disruption.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I believe that the commission can and should alleviate \nthis problem. When the Senate passed its version of fee reduction \nlegislation in March, the bill, S. 143, provided for a delay of 30 days \nin the effective date for transaction fee reduction in order to provide \nsecurities firms and markets the necessary time to adjust their \ncomputer systems to accommodate the rate change. This language was \nchanged when the bill was passed by the House in June, in order to \ncomply with budget-scoring requirements. At that time, it was \nenvisioned that congressional action on the bill would be completed \nwell before the start of the new fiscal year in October, and that the \neffective date provision would not cause administrative problems for \nthe securities industry.\n  It is not our intention to impose an administrative requirement that \nwould be impossible for industry to meet. In order to comply with \ncongressional intent and to make this provision workable, I hope that \nthe commission will consider using its general exemptive authority \nunder Section 36 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to extend the \neffective date for reduction of transaction fees.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I speak today on S. 1499, the American \nSmall Business Emergency Relief and Recovery Act of 2001. This \nlegislation provides help to small businesses hurt by the events of \nSeptember 11th and to small businesses suffering in the weakened \neconomy. Senator Bond and I have spent months trying to uncover who is \nbehind the serial holds that have been placed on this emergency \nlegislation and work out disagreements.\n  This bill hasn't been ``hustled through,'' as some contend. It was \ndrafted with the input of small business organizations, trade \nassociations and SBA's lending and counseling partners through more \nthan 30 meetings and conference calls--conference calls because we \ncouldn't ask folks to fly in the immediate weeks after the attacks. It \nis cosponsored by 18 of the Small Business Committee's 19 members. And \noverall 62, senators, including 20 Republicans, have joined me in \ncosponsoring S. 1499.\n  On the House side, the Committee on Small Business passed the \ncompanion to S. 1499. We attempted to move this bill quickly because it \nis emergency legislation. It is a good bill because it can do a lot for \na lot of people. It is being held because of shameful politics.\n\n[[Page S13926]]\n\n I say let's bring this bill up for a vote. Small businesses have a \nright to know exactly who is working against them and who is working \nfor them.\n  So what happened? On October 15th, when this legislation had cleared \nboth cloakrooms for passage, the Administration had the Republican \ncloakroom put a last-minute hold on the bill so the Administration \ncould announce its approach the next day. The next morning, the \nAdministration lifted its hold, but a new hold was immediately placed \nby the junior Senator from Arizona, which he stated in the press was on \nbehalf of the Administration. Last week, the Senator from Arizona \nlifted his hold, and I thank him for that, but unfortunately, we then \nlearned that there was one or more anonymous Republican holds on the \nbill. This approach makes it very difficult to try to work out \nobjections. Two other Republican senators told me that their objections \nwere solely based on the Administration's problems with the bill. \nTherefore, I directed my staff to meet with the Administration, learn \ntheir concerns and try to reach a compromise so that this bill could \npass before the recess.\n  Last night, Senator Bond and I joined our staffs as they met with \nrepresentatives of the Administration for the eighth time. I am very \ndisappointed to report that the Administration came to the table and \nsaid that, although we had made some progress, it would not negotiate \nfurther. The ultimatum was for us to strike entire sections and \nprovisions critical to the relief provisions of our bill.\n  Specifically the Administration's representatives said:\n  ``We cannot work with you on Section 6.'' That is the entire stimulus \nportion of S. 1499. As such, we were asked to eliminate the provision \nthat would make it less expensive for small businesses to get loans and \nprovide incentives to lenders to make these loans. We were told that, \nin their view, there is no credit crunch for small businesses.\n\n  ``We cannot work with you on Section 10.'' Section 10 establishes a \nfund to help small businesses that were shut out of their Federal work \nsites or have suffered delays in accessing those sites because of \nnational security measures. We offered to set it up in any way they \nthought it could work and to reduce its $100 million authorization \nlevel, but the Administration refused to work with us on that section.\n  ``We cannot work with you on refinancing non-SBA business debt.'' \nThis was an important part of the disaster relief that S. 1499 targets \nto those at ground zero in NY and VA, those located in airports and \nthose adversely affected by Federal security actions. The \nAdministration was unwilling to make this help available to these \ndisaster victims.\n  The administration can not go further in providing an incentive to \nsmall business lenders by reducing the lenders' loan fee by more than \none-tenth of one percent. Despite numerous articles in reputable \nnewspapers such as the New York Times, it is the Administration's view \nthat lenders do not need incentives to make small business loans in \nthis economic downturn. Senator Bond and I, as well as the 61 other \ncosponsors of S. 1499 believe that both lenders and small business \nborrowers need a break to encourage these loans to be made. With this \ncapital, small businesses will stay in business and continue to employ \npeople. Without it, we can expect greater business failures and \nbankruptcies.\n  Senator Bond and I asked them to meet us halfway, and they said no. \nWe asked them to give us alternative language, and they didn't give us \nany. We spent more than 20 hours negotiating on this bill and it \nappears as if the Administration never had any intention of finding \ncommon ground. It appears as if it was an exercise in delay.\n  Let me describe briefly where I disagree with the administration \nabout how to help small businesses battling bankruptcy and employee \nlayoffs triggered by the terrorist attacks and economic downturn. The \nadministration believes that all assistance should be delivered through \nthe SBA's disaster loans, which are administered through only four \nregional offices. From talking to small businesses and SBA lenders, \nSenator Bond and I have concluded that small businesses would be better \nserved through a combination of disaster loans and government \nguaranteed loans. Government guaranteed loans are almost five times \ncheaper than what the administration has proposed, have less exposure \nfor the taxpayer, and can reach more small business owners because they \nare delivered through more than 5,000 private sector lenders who know \ntheir communities and have experience making SBA loans. Our proposal \ncombines public and private sector approaches to ensure small \nbusinesses receive the maximum amount of assistance.\n  We will never agree on each other's approach, mostly because the \nadministration has told us in meeting after meeting that it does not \nbelieve there's a credit crunch and that small businesses are not \nhaving difficulty in accessing credit. They don't acknowledge articles, \nsurveys and testimonials that state it has become harder and more \nexpensive for small businesses, particularly minority and women-owned \nsmall businesses, to get loans over the past year.\n\n  They ignore the surveys by the Federal Reserve that say, ``40 percent \nof domestic banks reported tighter standards [when lending to small \nbusinesses] over the past three months, up from 32 percent in August.'' \nPlease keep in mind that this survey was released in October and \ndoesn't even capture the affects of September 11.\n  They ignore articles from economic authorities such as the Wall \nStreet Journal. I read this last week on the floor but think it is \nabsolutely worth repeating. Wall Street Journal, Tuesday, November 6th, \n2001. Here are the words of Mr. John Rutledge, Chairman of Rutledge \nCapital in New Canaan, CT, and a former economic advisor to the Reagan \nadministration:\n\n       Interest rate reductions alone are not enough to jump-start \n     this economy. We need to make sure cheaper credit reaches the \n     companies that need it. . . . The Fed is cutting interest \n     rates--but the money isn't reaching capital-starved small \n     businesses because Treasury regulators are cracking down on \n     bank loans. Credit rationing, not interest rates, is the real \n     problem with the economy. . . . This problem didn't start on \n     September 11th. For more than a year U.S. banks have been \n     closed for business lending. Unless the current Bush \n     administration takes steps to restore bank lending to small \n     businesses and heal the asset markets now, the economy will \n     stay weak.\n\n  They ignore surveys published in the American Banker. On October 31, \na survey of 80 lenders of all sizes by Phoenix Management Services \nfound that 42 percent ``would be less likely to lend to small \nbusinesses, which they view as more risky because they foresee no \nimprovement in the economy until late 2002 at the earliest.'' The \narticle from November validated what before was characterized as ``less \nlikely to lend to small businesses,'' by reporting lenders had actually \n``tightened their standards'' to small firms by more than 40 percent.\n  Still, the administration maintains there's no credit crunch and that \nprovisions in S. 1499 to provide improved access to credit are too \nexpensive and unnecessary.\n  The administration has also raised concerns about the cost of the \nlegislation, which has been unofficially scored by Congressional Budget \nOffice at $860 million. Let me be clear, that's million, not billion. \n$860 million to help all of our Nation's small businesses. Yet the \nadministration objects to this, when they have sent up requests for \nbillions in tax cuts for a select few large corporations, and when the \nadministration's approach costs almost five times as much to help fewer \nsmall businesses. The bill's $860 million cost is too much to invest in \nthe nation's small businesses, according to the administration's \nposition.\n  I regret very much for small businesses and their employees that \ntheir needs are being trivialized. I admire Senator Bond and the \nChairman of the House Committee on Small Business for showing \nleadership in their party to help small businesses. I am very glad that \nwe can work in such a strong bipartisan fashion to fight for small \nbusinesses. I thank the 62 members of this body who have come together \nin a bipartisan fashion to support this legislation and our nation's \nsmall businesses.\n  Let me note here that the White House said in our meetings that 62 \ncosponsors ``means nothing--that it happens all the time up here.'' I \nfind that cavalier considering that, according to the Congressional \nResearch Service,\n\n[[Page S13927]]\n\nonly 13 out of 1,839 bills introduced in the 107th Congress have more \nthan 60 cosponsors.\n  The support for this bill is strong and bipartisan. I am very sorry \nthat those Senators supporting S. 1499 have not had the chance to cast \na vote in favor of this emergency legislation before they go home for \nthe holidays and visit with the small businesses in their states. Small \nbusinesses deserve some good news. As for right now, we can only tell \nthem what I told the administration in our meetings last night: When we \ncome back in January, we intend to file cloture on this bill and take a \nvote.\n  In closing, let me thank the many groups who have fought so hard on \nbehalf of their members to get this legislation enacted. They have \ndemonstrated all that is great about grassroots action and active \ninvolvement in the political and legislative process.\n  In addition to including for the record the list of these groups, I \nalso ask unanimous consent to have printed articles and letters from \nsmall business groups regarding the current credit crunch, the need for \nequitable adjustment provisions for our small business contractors and \nother provisions of S. 1499 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           S. 1499 Supporters\n\n       Airport Ground Transportation Association, American Bus \n     Association, American Subcontractors Association, Associated \n     General Contractors of America, Association of Women's \n     Business Centers, CDC Small Business Finance, Chicago \n     Association of Neighborhood Development Organizations, \n     Citizens Financial Group, RI, Clovis Community Bank, CA, \n     Coastal Enterprises, ME.\n       County of San Diego, Delaware Community Reinvestment Act \n     Council, Fairness in Rural Lending, Florida Atlantic \n     University Small Business Development Center, Helicopter \n     Association, HUBZone Contractors National Council, National \n     Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders, National \n     Community Reinvestment Coalition, National League of Cities, \n     National Limousine Association.\n       National Restaurant Association, National Small Business \n     United, National Tour Association, New Jersey Citizen Action, \n     Rural Housing Institute, Rural Opportunities, Self Help \n     Credit Union, Small Business Legislative Council.\n       U.S. Conference of Mayors, United Motorcoach Association, \n     United States Air Tour Association, United States Chamber of \n     Commerce, United States Tour Operator Association, Women's \n     Business Development Center.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Wall Street Journal, Tues., Nov. 6, 2001]\n\n                  A Credit Crunch Imperils the Economy\n\n                           (By John Rutledge)\n\n       When the Federal Open Market Committee meets today it won't \n     be arguing over whether we are in recession. The economy is \n     weaker today than at any time since 1982. It will almost \n     certainly end the meeting by voting to reduce interest rates \n     again. This will bear the same results as all the previous \n     rate cuts this year: none.\n       Interest rate reductions alone are not enough to jump-start \n     this economy. We need to make sure cheaper credit reaches the \n     companies that need it. Credit rationing, not interest rates, \n     is the real problem with the economy.\n       The Fed's monetary stimulus has been hijacked by the bank \n     regulators. these credit highwaymen aren't bad guys, they are \n     just doing their jobs. The Treasury Department's Office of \n     the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which is charged with \n     regulating federally chartered banks, has a different agenda \n     from the Fed. Its job is to protect bank capital, period. It \n     does so with an army of bank examiners, who wield the blunt \n     instrument of credit rationing inside banks. For more than a \n     year, these regulators have been diverting bank reserves into \n     Treasury securities instead of business loans, in hopes of \n     restoring bank capital that was damaged by technology \n     lending. Companies that rely on banks for working capital \n     have been sucking air.\n       To restore growth we need a functioning banking system. \n     This will require a level of coordination the Treasury and \n     the Fed have seldom achieved. But the current consensus for \n     growth could give President Bush the political Roto-Rooter he \n     needs to clear out the conduit.\n       This problem didn't start on Sept. 11. For more than a year \n     U.S. Banks have been closed for business lending. The story \n     reads a lot like the real-estate blowout of the early 1990s \n     that ended with Resolution Trust Corp. auctions, except this \n     time it was undisciplined technology investments that did us \n     in. In the three years leading up to 2000, commercial banks \n     loaned enormous sums of money to telecom, cable and \n     technology companies to finance, capital-spending programs. \n     These loans weren't backed by assets, but were based on \n     projections that all three sectors would have sales growth \n     rates several times that of the economy for many years to \n     come.\n       Last summer it became clear that sales growth would not \n     meet those heady projections. Instead of the 14% growth \n     projected by analysts for telecoms this year, for example, \n     actual sales will shrink. Companies without revenues don't \n     make interest payments. And so by the fall of 2000, OCC teams \n     were forcing regional banks to downgrade loans and reduce \n     business lending.\n       The Fed is cutting interest rates--but the money isn't \n     reaching capital-starved small businesses because Treasury \n     regulators are cracking down on bank loans.\n       Here's the catch. The loans to technology companies were \n     generally unrecoverable. The tech firms had spent the funds \n     on current operating expenses or to purchase assets with lots \n     of goodwill but little resale value. So the banks turned to \n     the one place they could get money back: reducing the \n     revolving credit facilities of their small business \n     customers.\n       I got a personal glimpse of all this last October, when a \n     team of bankers visited our office to inform us their bank \n     had decided to reduce the credit rating of, as well as cash-\n     flow loans to, one of the private companies we own, in \n     preparation for a bank examiner audit the following week. Our \n     loan went from a ``five'' to a ``six'' on their 10-point \n     internal risk management system, which meant the company \n     could no longer use its acquisition credit line. This caused \n     the company to halt discussions with an acquisition target \n     and to book the costs incurred up to that point as current \n     expenses.\n       Other companies had it worse, with reduced revolving credit \n     facilities and increased fees. Some companies, under pressure \n     from their banks to raise equity capital, have been forced to \n     sell control in an illiquid equity market. Others have been \n     forced into filing for bankruptcy protection or liquidation.\n       Deprived of working capital, U.S. companies have been \n     trying to shrink their way to solvency, by reducing \n     inventory, stretching vendors and laying off workers. This \n     has created the sharpest drop in industrial output in 20 \n     years.\n       Ironically, when the Fed became alarmed at the shrinking \n     economy and began to cut interest rate sin January, the bank \n     examiners, who report to a different master, tightened \n     further. The business loan market is far tighter today than \n     it was then. Two years ago banks were willing to lend a good \n     company four to five times Ebitda, or earnings before \n     interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Today banks \n     quote a market of just over two times Ebitda but money is \n     not, in fact available even at that level.\n       A further irony is that although banks have refused to lend \n     to businesses, they have been throwing money at the consumer \n     through mortgage and equity credit lines. This has produced a \n     two-speed economy that has left many companies unable to \n     produce products or to ship orders for lack of working \n     capital. Stimulating consumer spending won't solve this \n     problem; we need a functioning bank market.\n       The last period of nonprice credit rationing was the 1990-\n     92 credit crunch. It caused tremendous damage to the economy \n     and cost the first President Bush his re-election bid. It \n     ended only after the RTC had finished its auctions and the \n     property and banking markets had stabilized.\n       The lesson of that experience--that the economy is only as \n     healthy as its balance sheets--is as true today as it was a \n     decade ago. Unless the current Bush administration takes \n     steps to restore bank lending to small businesses and heal \n     the asset markets now, the economy will stay weak.\n       The White House can do three things to put the economy back \n     on sound footing.\n       First, it should bring the Fed and the Comptroller of the \n     Currency together to coordinate efforts to restore bank \n     lending. This can be done very quickly and would not require \n     new legislation.\n       Second, it should introduce legislation to transfer the \n     regulation of federally chartered banks from the Treasury to \n     the Fed, which would make monetary policy function more \n     smoothly and prevent future credit-crunch situations.\n       Third, the White House should make it, clear to \n     Congressional Democrats that the price for support of their \n     huge spending projects is fast action on a lower capital-\n     gains tax rate and further action to lower marginal income \n     tax rates, both of which would increase asset market values \n     and improve bank capital.\n       Forceful action to Roto-Rooter the business loan pipeline \n     is one thing we can do to make the economy grow again.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From The American Banker, Wed., Nov. 14, 2001]\n\n                            (By Rob Garver)\n\n       The slowdown in lending activity, evident through much of \n     the year, sharpened in recent months through diminished \n     demand and tighter lending standards even as banks addressed \n     a new round of credit quality problems in their loan \n     portfolios.\n       According to the Federal Reserve Board's latest survey of \n     senior loan officers, which was released Tuesday, nearly half \n     the banks had lowered internal ratings on at least 5% of \n     their commercial lending portfolios.\n       Internal loan ratings reflect a bank's assessment of the \n     risk that the borrower will default. The most likely \n     borrowers to be downgraded in the three-month period through \n     October were commercial airlines and nondefense aerospace \n     firms, followed\n\n[[Page S13928]]\n\n     closely by travel and leisure-related businesses such as \n     hotels and restaurants. The survey of the chief credit \n     officers of 57 domestic banks and 22 U.S. branches of foreign \n     institutions also found that most U.S. banks tightened their \n     underwriting standards for commercial loans, and that \n     commercial borrowers, for their part, were less willing to go \n     into debt. Terms and conditions for consumer loans tightened \n     slightly, the survey found, and demand for consumer loans \n     fell.\n       The survey, taken four to six times a year, typically \n     contains a number of ``special questions'' in addition to \n     standard queries about loan terms, conditions, and demand. \n     The special questions, which usually address typical issues, \n     focused on the recent downgrading of commercial credits and \n     the changes in the loan market as a result of the Sept. 11 \n     terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.\n       After noting that debt rating agencies ``have revised their \n     ratings for a substantial number of firms'' recently, the \n     survey asked banks what portion of their commercial loan \n     portfolios, by dollar volume, had been downgraded in the past \n     three months.\n       Among domestic institutions, 10.5% said they had downgraded \n     less than 1% of their portfolios, while 40.4% reported \n     downgrading between 1% and 5%. Banks that downgraded between \n     6% and 20% of commercial loans made up 42.1% of the total, \n     and an additional 7% of respondents reported downgrading \n     between 21% and 30%.\n       The standard elements of the survey, which deal with \n     underwriting standards and loan demand, found that 50.9% of \n     banks had tightened their standards for large and midsize \n     firms. For loans to small firms, 40.4% reported higher \n     standards.\n       The tightening of standards most frequently took the form \n     of premiums charged for making risky loans, and higher \n     interest rates. Loans to large firms were also likely to have \n     tighter loan covenants, while loans to small firms were \n     likely to carry higher collateralization requirements.\n       The main reasons for the tougher underwriting standards \n     were a ``less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook'' \n     and a ``worsening of industry-specific problems.''\n       While banks were tightening their standards, commercial \n     borrowers were reducing their demand for loans, the survey \n     found. Loan demand from large and middle-market firms was \n     down at 72% of banks in the survey, while demand form small \n     businesses was down 55.4%. The most common reason reported \n     for the decreased demand was a reduced investment by \n     customers in their plants and equipment.\n       After noting that, in the aftermath of the attacks, the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission had relaxed its rules on \n     stock repurchases by public companies, the survey asked if \n     demand for loans to finance such repurchases had increased, \n     and if banks had altered the terms of such loans. In both \n     cases, more than 90% of respondents reported little or no \n     change.\n       The survey also asked if the dislocation of businesses \n     after Sept. 11 had affected liquidity in the secondary loan \n     market. Two-thirds of the respondents reported decreased loan \n     trading volume, and 64.4% reported that since the attacks, \n     bid-ask had widened.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From the Arizona Daily Star]\n\n                    Kyl Accused of Blocking Aid Bill\n\n                 (By Tiffany Kjos and Aaron J. Latham)\n\n       Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl and an anonymous lawmaker are being \n     accused of blocking a bill that would provide low-income \n     loans to small businesses suffering as a result of the \n     country's economic downturn.\n       The bill would provide financial help through existing loan \n     programs administered by the Small Business Administration: \n     7(a) working capital loans; and 504 loans for equipment and \n     building improvements. It would also lower fees for borrowers \n     and SBA lenders.\n       Sen. John Kerry, a Democrat from Massachusetts and chairman \n     of the Senate small-business committee, introduced the bill \n     more than two months ago in hopes of moving it through \n     quickly. It has 60 co-sponsors in the Senate and dozens of \n     backers in small-business associations.\n       ``I'm asking my Republican colleague to stop obstructing \n     this legislation,'' Kerry said.\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill's cost \n     at $860 million, but it would result in $25 billion in \n     government-guaranteed loans and venture capital for \n     businesses, Kerry said. If the bill passes, Congress would \n     have to figure out where the money would come from.\n       ``As each day passes, more and more small businesses are \n     left behind, facing financial hardships that are forcing them \n     to close their doors as a result of inadequate disaster \n     assistance, stifled availability of loans and limited access \n     to capital,'' Kerry said.\n       Kyl, a Republican, has said the bill is too expensive, and \n     he told the Washington Post he is not blocking the bill but \n     acting as an agent for the Republican steering committee in \n     reviewing it.\n       Kyl's anonymous colleague on the bill can remain \n     unidentified because Senate rules allow members to oppose \n     legislation without going public.\n       The federal government already has in place a disaster loan \n     program that offers low-interest loans to businesses that \n     suffered directly or indirectly as a result of the Sept. 11 \n     attacks. The Small Business Emergency Relief and Recovery Act \n     of 2001 would help those firms, plus any small business that \n     needs money to survive in the lagging economy.\n       Like thousands of other small businesses across the \n     country, Tucsonan Maggie Johnson has seen a dropoff since \n     Sept. 11. Johnson's Malkia African Arts & Gifts at 272 E. \n     Congress St. is filled with African masks, fabric and \n     clothing, Egyptian beaded scarves, and colorful greeting \n     cards she makes by hand.\n       ``I'm not selling necessities. I'm selling things people \n     buy with their disposable income. And everyone's sitting on \n     their disposable income now,'' she said.\n       The consumer response to the attacks was immediate and \n     nationwide, she said.\n       ``People are pulling back, retrenching--waiting is a good \n     word,'' she said. ``They're spending money on things they \n     have to have, food and basics.''\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is a strong supporter of the \n     measure. Giovanani Coratolo, director of small-business \n     policy for the Washington, D.C.-based group, was careful not \n     to criticize Kyl but did not say the chamber has been working \n     hard to get the bill through the Senate.\n       ``We respect his opinion but we are not with him on this,'' \n     Coratolo said. ``We've been actively working to get co-\n     sponsors and, quite frankly, it could have 80 co-sponsors, \n     (but) he is still determined to block it.''\n       Normally the chamber would not endorse legislation that \n     would expand the government's role in small business, Corato \n     said--but these are special circumstances.\n       ``Given the times and what we see from small businesses, \n     there's a lot of hurting going on and they do need help. \n     They're not looking for handouts. They're looking for access \n     to capital that will give them the ability to help them hang \n     in there,'' he said.\n       Coratolo said the opposition's strategy has been to run out \n     the clock. The Senate will probably adjourn by the end of \n     this week and not return until late January, Coratolo said.\n       ``Small businesses need the relief now, and actually they \n     needed it last month,'' he said. ``The existing programs and \n     loan programs that were meant to act as a safety net--some \n     are not there and some don't reach out far enough to help \n     those that really need the help.''\n       SBA loans are guaranteed by the government, so lenders are \n     more apt to give them, Kerry said.\n       While he opposes the small-business bill, Kyl is backing a \n     $500 per person tax credit for travel-related expenses.\n       ``Sen. Kyl has a travel incentive bill going through that's \n     $10 billion, but he says our bill is too expensive. \n     Understanding how important small businesses are to our \n     economy, we are not denying that travel is important as well, \n     but we do need to get these small businesses some \n     assistance,'' said Dayna Hanson, Kerry's press secretary for \n     the small-business committee.\n       Kerren Vollmer, who owned Nava-Hopi Tours in Flagstaff with \n     her husband, Roger, agrees. The couple closed their bus tour \n     business Oct. 26 because so many people canceled their travel \n     plans after Sept. 11. The Vollmers owned 10 tour buses and \n     operated charter tours as well as regular trips to Phoenix \n     and the Grand Canyon from Flagstaff.\n       ``You still have to run regular schedules,'' she said. \n     ``You can't quit just because you have only three or four \n     people.''\n       Vollmer is a lifelong Republican who voted for Kyl, ran for \n     county superintendent, and has worked in the voting precinct. \n     She tried to contact Kyl's office but received no response.\n       ``I've sent e-mail, I've sent him a fax, begging him, \n     offering to talk with him or any of his staff, this is what's \n     going on,'' Vollmer said. ``When it's your own senator, it \n     hurts. Because I don't feel like he even recognizes what's \n     going on under his own nose.''\n       Vollmer said the company tried to get a disaster loan but \n     couldn't even get the application, even with the help of the \n     Arizona Department of Revenue and the local community \n     college's small business development center. Whether the \n     latest measure will make it through the Senate is very much \n     up in the air, Coratolo said.\n       ``Am I optimistic? It's about a 50-50 chance, and if it \n     does, it will be by the skin of its teeth,'' he said. ``Sen. \n     Kyl has been very, very effective at blocking it.''\n                                  ____\n\n         The National Association of Government Guaranteed \n           Lenders, Inc.,\n                                                December 20, 2001.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, Russell Senate Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry, On behalf of the members of the \n     National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders \n     (NAGGL), the SBA's 7(a) lending partners, thank you for your \n     continuing efforts to improve capital access for small \n     businesses in this time of sharply heighted need. We strongly \n     support your efforts and the efforts of Senator Bond to enact \n     S. 1499.\n       It is clear, especially in light of events of September 11, \n     that banks' profits continue to plunge. According to a \n     November 30 article in the Washington Post, ``Earnings for \n     the nation's banks dropped nearly 10 percent in the third \n     quarter because of the largest increase in expected loan \n     losses in more than a decade.'' The report goes on to say \n     that ``the dip in earnings can be partly attributed to losses \n     from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, with more expected to be \n     reported in the fourth quarter.''\n\n[[Page S13929]]\n\n       This drop in profits has resulted in an every-tightening \n     credit crunch, as can be inferred from just the headline of a \n     November 14 Wall Street Journal article that reads, ``Banks \n     Tighten Credit, Loan Standards In Past Months Amid Uncertain \n     Outlook.'' This article cities a Federal Reserve study that \n     ``aids fuel to growing concerns that an unwillingness among \n     bankers to lend is threatening to choke off investment, \n     hampering chances of a quick economic recovery.''\n       In this economic climate, it has become exceedingly \n     difficult for even the most qualified small businesses to \n     access the capital they need for survival, and to help spur \n     the American economy to recovery and renewed prosperity.\n       This is why the passage of S. 1499 is so important. While \n     the SBA's Disaster Loan Program is a necessary ingredient of \n     economic recovery, it cannot possibly provide the sweeping \n     help that the 7(a) program can, and S. 1499 addresses this \n     problem. S. 1499 creates a more attractive 7(a) program for \n     cautious lenders, and a more affordable 7(a) program for \n     hurting borrowers for one year's time--when both of them need \n     it most. And it utilizes private sector lenders that are \n     already in place and ready to provide necessary capital \n     immediately.\n       We encourage you and your Senate colleagues to \n     expeditiously pass S. 1499 while it is still possible to help \n     small businesses and the American economy in their time of \n     greatest need.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Anthony R.

Mr. President, on April 27, 1999, we paused in the Senate \nto observe a moment of silence in tribute to those who died at \nColumbine High School and to express our sympathy for their loved ones. \nSince the Littleton tragedy, over 60,000 people have been killed by \nguns, criminals continue to gain easy access to guns and, according to \nthe Brady Campaign, there is an unlocked gun in one of every eight \nfamily homes. Several strong pieces of gun safety legislation have been \nintroduced in the 107th Congress to address these problems. None, \nhowever has been adopted. In fact, none has even been voted on in the \nSenate.\n  In 1994, the Brady law established the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System, NICS. This check system allows federally \nlicensed gun sellers to determine whether a person is allowed to buy a \ngun. Since its inception, NICS checks have prevented more than 156,000 \nfelons, fugitives and others not eligible from purchasing a firearm \nwithout infringing upon any law-abiding citizen's ability to purchase a \ngun.\n  However, a loophole in the law allows unlicenced private gun sellers \nto sell guns without conducting a NICS check. A 1999 study by the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms found 314 cases of fraud at gun \nshows, involving 54,000 guns. Felons and suspected terrorists have \nreportedly used gun shows to purchase firearms, and smuggle them out of \nthe United States. On April 24, 2001, Senator Reed introduced the Gun \nShow Background Check Act. I cosponsored that bill because I believe it \nis an important tool to prevent guns from getting into the hands of \ncriminals and foreign terrorists. This bill, which is supported by \nmajor law enforcement organizations including the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, simply applies existing law governing \nbackground checks to persons buying guns at gun shows. We should stand \nwith our Nation's law enforcement community and take this common sense \nstep to reduce gun violence.\n  In January, regulations issued by the Department of Justice directed \nthe FBI to retain NICS check information for a 90-day period. This 90-\nday period allows local law enforcement and the FBI to check NICS for \nillegal guns sales, identify purchasers using fake IDs and screens for \ngun dealers misusing the system. However, in June, the Attorney General \nproposed reducing the length of time that law enforcement agencies can \nretain NICS data to 24 hours. This is simply not a sufficient amount of \ntime for law enforcement to audit and review the NICS database for \npatterns of illegal activity. This change will create another potential \nloophole for criminals to purchase guns.\n  I was greatly concerned by the Attorney General's action and I was \npleased to cosponsor the ``Use NICS in Terrorist Investigations Act'' \nintroduced by Senators Kennedy and Schumer. This legislation would \nreinstate the 90-day period for law enforcement to retain and review \nNICS data. The need for this legislation was highlighted just a couple \nof weeks ago when the Attorney General denied the FBI access to the \nNICS database to review for gun sales to individuals they had detained \nin response to the September 11th terrorist attacks and refused to take \na position on an amendment which would authorize that access. I believe \nit is imperative that law enforcement is given the authority to review \nthe NICS database. The Schumer-Kennedy bill is commonsense legislation \nthat deserves floor action.\n  The Brady law has been effective in keeping guns out of the hands of \ncriminals, but the number of children killed in suicides, unintentional \ndeaths and school violence remains unacceptably high. This is the case \nbecause kids still have all too easy access to guns. Young children are \ntoo often killed or severely injured because adults do not store their \nfirearms properly. A recent National Institute for Justice survey found \nthat 20 percent of all gun-owning households had an unlocked and loaded \ngun in the home. To prevent easy access to guns, Senator Durbin \nintroduced the Children's Firearm Prevention Act. Under this bill, \nadults who fail to lock up a loaded firearm or an unloaded firearm with \nammunition would be held liable if the weapon is taken by a child and \nused to kill or injure themself or another person. The bill also \nincreases the penalties for selling a gun to a juvenile and creates a \ngun safety education program that includes parent-teacher \norganizations, local law enforcement and community organizations. This \nbill is similar to a bill President Bush signed into law during his \ntenure as the Governor of Texas. I support this bill and hope the \nSenate will act on it during this Congress.\n  We know kids and criminals should not have access to guns, but there \nare certain types of guns that simply do not belong on the street. One \nexample is .50 caliber sniper guns. These weapons are among the most \npowerful weapons legally available. In fact, according to one rifle \ncatalogue, a .50 caliber manufacturer touted his product's ability to \nwreck ``several million dollars, worth of jet craft with one or two \ndollars worth of cartridge.'' This is a disturbing assertion, \nparticularly in the wake of September 11th. Even more disturbingly, \nthere are fewer restrictions placed on purchases of long-range .50 \ncaliber sniper weapons than there are on handguns. In fact, according \nto a 1999 GAO report, since the end of the Gulf War, .50 caliber sniper \nguns have ended up in the hands of many suspected terrorists, including \nal-Qaeda. Senator Feinstein's Military Sniper Weapon Regulation Act \nwould change the way .50 caliber guns are regulated by placing them \nunder the requirements of the National Firearms Act. This is a \nnecessary step to assuring the safety of Americans.\n  More than 2 years ago, two young men brought terror to Columbine High \nSchool. Of the four guns used by the two Columbine shooters, three were \nreportedly acquired at a gun show. The teenage shooters took full \nadvantage of the gun show loophole, which allowed their friend to buy \nthem two rifles and a shotgun without ever submitting to a background \ncheck. The tragedy in Littleton, Colorado struck a chord with every \nAmerican. About a month ago, it was discovered in New Bedford, \nMassachusetts that a 17-year-old was plotting a massacre at his school. \nHe told police he wanted the event to be like the 1999 slaughter at \nColumbine High School. Since the events of September 11th, several \nstates, including my home state of Michigan, have experienced \nsignificant increases in applications for concealed weapons permits and \nbackground checks for gun permits. The gun show loophole remains open, \nlaw enforcement lacks access to the NICS database, kids continue to \ngain access to guns and .50 caliber military sniper guns remain \nuncontrolled. It is long past time to adopt sensible gun safety \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13929-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13929-S13931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LEGISLATION IN BEHALF OF VETERANS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on legislation acted upon during the first session of the 107th \nCongress which will make a dramatic difference in the lives of hundreds \nof thousands of\n\n[[Page S13930]]\n\nservice members and veterans, and in the lives of every American. Four \nbills relating to veterans benefits now await the President's \nsignature. These bills, coupled with another major piece of legislation \nadopted by the Congress immediately prior to Memorial Day of this year, \nwill substantially enhance veterans' benefits in the areas of health \ncare, education, homeless assistance, disability compensation, and \nother areas. They are a testament to the good which can come when House \nand Senate, Republicans and Democrats, come together to achieve a \ncommon end.\n  The first bill now awaiting the President's signature, the \n``Veterans' Compensation Rate Amendments of 2001'', H.R. 2540, provides \na 2.6 percent increase in the rates of veterans' disability \ncompensation and survivors' compensation. The increase, effective \nDecember 1, 2001, reflects inflation which occurred during the \npreceding 12 months, and is the same percentage increase Social \nSecurity recipients most recently received. H.R. 2540 will ensure that \nthe purchasing power of compensation and survivor benefits is not \ncompromised by inflation.\n  A second bill, the ``Veterans Education and Benefits Expansion Act of \n2001'', H.R. 1291, is a comprehensive bill which enhances education, \ndisability compensation, housing, burial, and other benefits that \nveterans have earned through service to the Nation. The education \nprovisions of H.R. 1291 build on legislation, S. 1114, which I \nintroduced earlier this year, by increasing the Montgomery GI Bill, \n``MGIB'', monthly educational assistance benefit from $672 to $985, a \n47 percent increase, over the next 3-year period. With the opportunity \nto ``buy-up'' an additional $150 per month in benefits as a result of \nlegislation I authored during the 106th Congress, veterans the \npotential will now exist for a monthly benefit in excess of $1,100 per \nmonth for veterans attending school in the Fall of 2003. Such a benefit \nlevel will pay the average cost of tuition, fees, books, room and \nboard, and travel expenses at a 4-year public college or university. \nThese improvements are not just good for veterans; they are good for \nthe Nation. The national security dictates that the services attract \nwell-qualified, highly motivated men and women to serve. As was most \nrecently recognized by the United States Commission on National \nSecurity/21st Century, enhancements in Montgomery GI Bill benefits are \nnecessary to attract such recruits.\n  The ``Veterans Education and Benefits Expansion Act of 2001'' will \nfurther enhance educational assistance benefits by providing needed \nflexibility to students by allowing veterans to claim benefits on an \naccelerated basis so that they can pay the significant ``up front'' \nexpenses of high-cost technology courses. It will also expand distance \nlearning and independent study benefits. Further, this legislation \nincorporates provisions from a bill authored by Senator Thompson to \nallow certain Vietnam-era veterans the ability to use benefits, and it \nexpands work-study opportunities available to veterans while they're \nattending college. And it will provide increased educational assistance \nbenefits to the spouses and children of service members killed in the \nline of duty or who are permanently disabled as a result of service. \nFinally, this legislation preserves the suspended education entitlement \nof service members or reservists who had to leave school as a result of \nbeing called to active duty, such as a call to active duty \nparticipation in Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  In addition to these improvements in educational assistance benefits, \nthe ``Veterans Education and Benefits Expansion Act of 2001'' keeps \nfaith with veterans who served in past conflicts by expanding the \neligibility of Vietnam and Gulf War veterans for presumptive \ncompensation based on exposures and experiences which occurred during \nthose conflicts. A Persian Gulf War veteran will now be eligible for \ncompensation if he or she has a medically unexplained, chronic, multi-\nsymptom illnesses such as chronic fatigue syndrome or irritable bowel \nsyndrome, in addition to undiagnosed illnesses already covered in law. \nFurther, this legislation gives VA explicit authority to compensate \nGulf War veterans for any diagnosed condition. Given the Secretary's \nDecember 10, 2001, announcement of the increased prevalence of Lou \nGehrig's disease among Gulf War veterans, this provision is \nparticularly timely.\n\n  For veterans who served in the Vietnam war, the ``Veterans Education \nand Benefits Expansion Act of 2001'' will repeal the 30-year limit on \nthe time period during which a Vietnam veteran must have contracted a \nrespiratory cancer if he or she is to be presumed eligible for \ncompensation based on exposure to Agent Orange. According to a recent \nNational Academy of Science/Institute of Medicine report, there is no \nscientific evidence which suggests an upper limit can be placed on \nrespiratory cancer latency. Given this, I believe the formerly-existing \n30-year limit was arbitrary; this bill removed it. I owe thanks to Mr. \nJoseph R. Mancuso, a Vietnam veteran from Pennsylvania who was stricken \nby, and who, very sadly, has succumbed to, lung cancer for bringing \nthis legal anomaly to my attention. This provision is a memorial to \nhim. I just wish the Congress might have acted while Mr. Mancuso was \nstill alive.\n  I should mention a few of this legislation's other important \nprovisions. It increases VA's home loan guaranty to enable veterans \nliving in high-cost regions of the country to afford a home with little \nor no down payment. It increases burial benefits available to the \nfamilies of veterans who die due to a service-connected cause, and it \nincreases grants provided to severely disabled veterans so they may \npurchase an automobile or make modifications to their homes to \naccommodate disabilities. The legislation also expands outreach and \ninformation services for departing service members, veterans, and \nfamily members, and it streamlines the eligibility determination \nprocess for low-income, disabled veterans seeking non service-connected \npension benefits.\n  A third major piece of veterans' legislation which now awaits the \nPresident's signature, the ``Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance \nAct of 2001'', H.R. 2716, is an additional step toward achieving the \ngoal of ending chronic homelessness among America's veterans. This \nlegislation would authorize VA to provide grants and per diem payments \nof up to $60 million in 2002, rising to $75 million in 2003, to \nentities which provide outreach, rehabilitative, vocational counseling \nand training, and transitional housing services to homeless veterans. \nIt would expand mental health services, and direct each VA primary care \nfacility to develop and carry out a plan to provide mental health \nservices to veterans who need them. This legislation would also \nauthorize the provision of dental care to homeless veterans by VA in \nrecognition of the fact that such care is a necessary prerequisite if a \nhomeless veteran is to gain, or regain, meaningful employment. Finally, \nthis bill would ensure proper oversight of these programs through the \ncreation of a VA Advisory Committee on Homeless Veterans.\n  A fourth and final bill which is now pending executive action, the \n``Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Programs Enhancement Act \nof 2001'', H.R. 3447, would address a number of critical issues \naffecting veterans' health care. First, this legislation addresses the \nlooming, and in some places already-present, VA nursing shortage by \npermanently authorizing the Employee Incentive Scholarship Program, a \nprogram which allows VA to provide up to $10,000 per year, for up to \nthree years, to employees engaged in full-time academic studies. \nAdditionally, this legislation reduces the minimum period of employment \nrequired for eligibility in the program from two years to one year, and \nextends authority to increase the award amounts based on federal \nnational comparability increases in pay. Further, in an effort to \nencourage nurses who have already completed school to come work for VA, \nthe bill would permanently authorize the Employee Debt Reduction \nProgram, EDRP, extend to five the number of years that a VA employee \nmight participate in the EDRP, and increase the gross award limit to \nany participant to $44,000. The EDRP program allows VA to assist \nemployees with the repayment of education debt, and it allows VA to \ncompete with private sector health care systems that offer similar \nprograms. Finally, this legislation creates the National VA Commission \non Nursing, which will consist of experts\n\n[[Page S13931]]\n\nin the nursing profession as well as economists and education \nprofessionals. The Commission will report findings and recommendations \nrelating to nurse recruitment and retention and other nurse employment \nissues within two years.\n\n  The ``Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Programs Enhancement \nAct of 2001'' also contains elements of a bill, S. 1188, which I \nintroduced earlier this year to provide priority access to VA care to \npoor veterans residing in relatively high cost areas like Philadelphia \nor Pittsburgh. Currently, VA provides priority access to care, and it \nwaives co-payments, only for veterans whose incomes are below a \nnationally-determined annual amount. This ``one-size-fits-all'' formula \ndoes not take into account local variations in the cost of living. As a \nconsequence, veterans in high-cost areas, typically urban areas, who \nare poor by most standards, do not qualify for priority access for VA \ncare. And they must pay the full amount of co-payments charged to \nother, much better off, veterans. This legislation would relieve much \nof the burden of co-payments on, and raise the relative priority for VA \nhealth care of, these near-poor veterans.\n  The ``Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Programs Enhancement \nAct of 2001'' also addresses other important health issues. It provides \nservice-dogs, trained to accomplish tasks such as opening doors and \nretrieving clothing, to disabled veterans. It directs VA to focus its \nattention on the maintenance of special programs in each geographic \nregion of the country, and it creates a program for chiropractic care \nin the VA. Finally, this legislation authorizes the construction of a \npower plant in Miami, FL, that was destroyed over one year ago by a \nfire that left two employees critically injured.\n  Finally, I note the enactment of the ``Veterans' Survivor Benefits \nImprovements Act of 2001,'' Public Law 107-14, which was signed by the \nPresident on June 5, 2001. This legislation retroactively increased \ninsurance benefits provided to, and guaranteed additional health care \ncoverage for, the survivors of service members killed in the line of \nduty. This legislation also expanded health care coverage to the \nspouses of veterans who have permanent and total disabilities due to \nmilitary service and to the spouses of veterans who have died as a \nresult of wounds incurred in service. Further, this Act extended life \ninsurance benefits to service members' spouses and children, and \nauthorized, and directed, VA to conduct outreach efforts to contact \nthese survivors, and other eligible dependents, to apprize them of the \nbenefits to which they are entitled. Finally, the ``Veterans' Survivor \nBenefits Improvements Act of 2001,'' made technical improvements to \nMontgomery GI Bill education benefits, and make other purely technical \namendments to title 38, United States Code.\n  This first session of the 107th Congress has produced five \noutstanding bills benefitting veterans. The enhancements contained \nwithin them send an unmistakable message to Americans that this Nation \nvalues military service and honors those who risk their lives so that \nwe may be free. I complement all those who worked so hard to make these \nlegislative accomplishments a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13931-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13931-S13932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE EQUAL PROTECTION OF VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, when the Voting Rights Act was signed \ninto law over 30 years ago, many thought it was the end of a long \njourney to recognize that the ideals on which this country was founded \nwere more than just abstract notions. The Voting Rights Act and before \nit the 14th amendment were definitive expressions by our Nation's \ngovernment that liberty and equality in theory is only as meaningful as \nliberty and equality in practice. As my colleague from Connecticut \nnoted yesterday in this Chamber, Thomas Paine captured the essence of \nour Nation's democracy when he stated that the right to vote is ``the \nprimary right by which all other rights are protected.''\n  The immediate consequence of the 2000 elections and its unsettling \naftermath was a realization that even 30 years after the Voting Rights \nAct became law, the Nation's election system was not what people \nthought it was. The election brought to light many problems with the \nNation's voting system, including the impact that outdated voting \nmachines, undertrained poll workers, and poorly-designed ballots can \nhave on an election.\n  Throughout the past year, Congress and the Nation have evaluated how \nbest to ensure that future elections are ones in which Americans can \nhave faith in the results. I have spent countless hours devoted to the \nsubject. A year ago last week, Senator McConnell and I introduced one \nof the first bills seeking to improve election systems and procedures. \nOthers soon followed with their own ideas about how to best bring about \nchange to what we had learned was a clearly flawed system.\n  With so much at stake, the process has not been without disagreement \nand at times it seemed that little would be changed. Both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate, however, have finally made progress in \ncrafting bipartisan legislation seeking to make elections more fair for \nall Americans. The House of Representatives has passed legislation \nsupported by a majority of both parties. Yesterday, Senators Dodd, \nMcConnell, Bond, Schumer and I introduced bipartisan legislation to \nmodernize the Nation's election procedures.\n  The Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act of 2001 represents a \nbalance between establishing national standards for voting and giving \nStates the flexibility to make improvements tailored to their State's \nneeds. First, this bill creates a permanent Federal system of analysis \nand assistance. This legislation establishes an Election Administration \nCommission, consisting of two commissioners from each party who will \nserve 4-year terms. The commission will bring expertise to modernizing \nelections and provide States and localities with advice for their \nenhancing voting procedures. This permanent commission was the \ncornerstone of election reform legislation that Senator McConnell and I \nintroduced over a year ago and I am extraordinarily pleased to see it \nincluded in this landmark legislation.\n  Second, this legislation establishes three minimum national \nrequirements for voting procedures to ensure that voting across the \nNation is uniform and nondiscriminatory. These minimum national \nstandards include requiring States and localities across the Nation to \nutilize voting systems that enable voters to verify how they voted and \nensure accessibility to language minorities and individuals with \ndisabilities, requiring States and localities to provide for \nprovisional balloting, and requiring States and localities to establish \na statewide voter registration list with the names and addresses of \neligible voters.\n  Perhaps most importantly, however, this legislation provides $3 \nbillion in Federal grants for States and localities to update voting \nsystems, improve accessibility to polling places, and train poll \nworkers, among other things. States and communities must show that they \ncomply with the three national requirements to be eligible for the \ngrants. An additional $400 million is authorized for providing early \nfunds so that States and localities can implement some improvements \nquickly; $100 million of the bill's funding is directed to provide \ngrants to make polling places physically accessible to those with \ndisabilities. This funding ensures that for the first time in our \nNation's history, the Federal Government will contribute our share to \nthe cost of administering elections for Federal office.\n  I hope that this legislation completes our Nation's journey to \nensuring that all eligible Americans are able to cast their vote \nfairly, accurately, and without interference. To some, this legislation \nmay not be perfect, but I can assure my colleagues that it is the \nresult of reasoned compromise and is a balanced response to all that \nour Nation has learned from the 2000 elections. I hope that when my \ncolleagues and I return in January, we can work with the Senate \nleadership to ensure that bringing this legislation to the Senate floor \nis one of our top priorities.\n\n[[Page S13932]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13931-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13931-S13932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE EQUAL PROTECTION OF VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI.

Mr. President, in the whirlwind of activity that always \naccompanies the end of a legislative session, many critical legislative \ndecisions are made and critical legislation passes. Often it takes some \ntime to tote up the wins and losses and arrive at a final evaluation of \nwhat has been achieved and what remains to be done.\n  Despite the efforts of those in the Senate, one of the losses for the \nsession is the expiration of three key trade programs, the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences (GSP), the Andean Trade Preferences Act (ATPA), \nand Trade Adjustment Assistance program.\n  What is surprising about the expiration of these programs is all \nthree of them have nearly universal support. They expire not because of \na legitimate difference in policies and not because the programs have \nserved their purpose. They expire because of political maneuvering in \nthe House.\n  In my view, it always reflects poorly on the Congress when needed \nprograms expire due to political machinations or simply lack of \nattention. It sends poor signals to those that depend on these \nprograms. In this case, the U.S. companies that import products under \nGSP and ATPA and the foreign countries we are attempting to aid through \nthese programs can hardly avoid the impression that these programs are \na low priority for Congress.\n  In the case of ATPA, there are those that believe that expiration \nwill spur a rapid move to expand ATPA. I support an expansion of ATPA, \nbut I believe such brinkmanship is far more likely to result in a long \nbreak in ATPA than it is a quick expansion.\n  Fortunately, in the case of both GSP and ATPA it is possible to \nextend these tariff benefits retroactively. If the U.S. importers are \nable to shift funds and wait, there is a good chance they will \nultimately receive the promised benefits from these programs.\n  Sadly, this is not the case with the expiration of the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance program. This program provides income support and \ntraining benefits to workers who have lost their jobs due to trade. It \nprovides them the opportunity to train for a new job and rebuild their \nlives. Given that they are unemployed, they are generally not in a \nposition to absorb a three month or a six month break in benefits.\n  I understand that the Department of Labor plans to advise the state \nagencies that work with them to administer TAA plan to advise those \nagencies to keep paying benefits because they expect the program to be \nreauthorized. The Department of Labor's advise is sound; indeed, I hope \nto win passage for a considerable expansion of TAA.\n  Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that state agencies will keep \noperating based upon this federal promise and borrow money from other \nprograms to support TAA. In fact, in at least 5 states, state law \nprohibits such fund shifting.\n  This raises the prospect that some of the 35,000 TAA recipients \naround the United States will receive a very nasty Christmas present--\nthe unexpected halt of the benefits on which they depend to rebuild \ntheir lives and support their families.\n  Mr. President, I believe Congress is sometimes criticized unfairly. \nSometimes, however, the rush of events diverts attention from some of \nthe glaring errors we make.\n  The stubborn obstinance of some of the other body to extend TAA is, \nin my view, a shameful example of playing politics with the interest of \nthose citizens that can least afford it. I hope this example is not \nlost on journalists, editorial writers, and, ultimately, voters. \nSomeone should be held accountable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13932-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss legislation that \nestablishes the National Museum of African American History and Culture \nPresidential Commission. On Monday, December 17, 2001, the Senate \npassed, with my support, H.R. 3442 which establishes the National \nMuseum of African American History and Culture Presidential Commission. \nThe Presidential Commission will develop and recommend a legislative \nplan of action for creating a national museum on the National Mall that \nrecognizes the unique historical and cultural legacy of African \nAmericans. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the legislation, \nintroduced by Representative John Lewis, on December 11, 2001 by voice \nvote.\n  The African American legacy is one of gradual steps that have moved \nthis group of Americans from slavery to full partnership in our society \nand culture. African Americans have played a central part in the \ndevelopment of our country's democratic institutions and our commitment \nto individual freedom and equal rights. Despite this history, there is \ncurrently no national museum located in Washington, D.C. on the \nNational Mall devoted to telling the African American story. I believe \nthis museum is the next stage in recognizing the burdens born by \nAfrican Americans and celebrating their unique contributions to our \nnation.\n  Many notable African Americans have made contributions in the areas \nof science, medicine, the arts and humanities, sports, music and dance. \nIt is right to honor this legacy on a national level. I believe that by \nestablishing this museum this nation will be able to finally honor the \nlegacy of African Americans properly. By placing this museum on the \nNational Mall, we will finally place the history of African Americans \nin a national light, where it belongs.\n  The legislation creates a 23 member commission made up of individuals \nwho specialize in African American history, education and museum \nprofessionals. The commission has nine months to present its \nrecommendations to the President and Congress regarding an action plan \nfor creating a national museum honoring African Americans. The \nCommission will decide the structure and make-up of the museum, devise \na governing board for the museum, and among other action items, will \ndecide whether to place the museum within the Smithsonian's Arts and \nIndustries Building, which is the last existing space on the National \nMall.\n  This museum will commemorate and honor the 400 years of African \nAmerican history in this country and beyond. Legislation was introduced \njust about every session of Congress between 1919 and 1929 to create a \nmemorial building to house exhibits demonstrating the achievements of \nAfrican Americans in art, science, invention and all aspects of life. I \nam both proud and pleased to be associated with this project and look \nforward to seeing this legislation signed into law by the President in \nthe near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13932-4", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13932-S13933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE POLICE CORPS PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LOTT. It is my understanding there are concerns with the Police \nCorps Program. It appears that funding from within the current fiscal \nyear is not being made available to certain States.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the minority leader's concerns with Police \nCorps. I have been told that OMB and the Department of Justice have \nrectified this situation. Both organizations have agreed that any funds \navailable for Police Corps in fiscal year 2002 and unexpended balances \nfrom prior fiscal years will be made available for new programs if \ncurrently eligible participants have not used the funding provided for \ntheir State.\n\n[[Page S13933]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have the same understanding. OMB and Justice have \ndecided that available funds can be used from the current balances. I \nam glad this issue has been worked out.\n  Mr. KERRY. I very much appreciate the comments of Senators Lott, \nStevens, and Gregg concerning the Police Corps program, which provides \nscholarships on a competitive basis to students who earn their \nbachelor's degrees, complete approved Police Corps training, and then \nserve for four years on patrol with law enforcement agencies in areas \nof great need. The Police Corps gives States funding to provide \nresidential police training and to provide local and State agencies \nthat hire Police Corps officers $10,000 a year for each of an officer's \nfirst 4 years of service. The fiscal year 2002 Senate Commerce, \nJustice, State and Judiciary Appropriations bill, under the leadership \nof Chairman Hollings and Ranking Member Gregg, included $30 million for \nthe Police Corps program. However, I was very disappointed that this \namount was reduced to $14.435 million in the conference report, which \nincluded legislative language that the Police Corps program has \nsufficient unobligated balances available to allow the program to \nmaintain its activities in fiscal year 2002 at the prior year level.\n  I am very concerned that the Office of Justice Programs is not \nplanning to provide appropriate funding for the Police Corps program in \nfiscal year 2002. It is my understanding that the Office of Justice \nPrograms' plan for the Police Corps program could limit the ability of \nlocal law enforcement agencies to address violent crime by decreasing \nthe number of officers with advanced education and training who serve \non community patrol in high-crime areas. This could negatively affect \nthe Police Corps program in my home State of Massachusetts, which is \ncurrently updating its training curriculum to provide the rigorous \nphysical and moral police training that will help Police Corps recruits \nwork effectively in high-crime areas within Massachusetts. As our \nnation remains on high alert due to recent terrorist attacks, the \nPolice Corps program will play a crucial role in training future \npolicemen and policewomen to stop terrorist activities before they hurt \ninnocent Americans.\n  It is my understanding that there are unobligated funds available to \nprovide the Police Corps program with the funding necessary to increase \nthe number of recruits above the modest demonstration level of \napproximately 25 trainees per state per year and to assist in resolving \nthe current backlog of funding requests for the program.\n  I believe that the Department of Justice should provide such funds as \nare necessary to maintain the current level of activity in Police Corps \noperations and to begin to resolve the current backlog of funding \nrequests for the program. I look forward to working with Chairman \nHollings, Ranking Member Gregg and others to assure that the Police \nCorps program is treated fairly by the Office of Justice Programs this \nyear and in future years, and to insure that this important program \nreceives adequate funding in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13933-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              BIOTERRORISM\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the \nimportant achievement the Senate has made today in defending our \nhomeland. Just over two months ago, my state of Florida was the site of \nthe first in a series bioterrorist attacks on our Nation that \nculminated here in Washington, DC. While the repercussions evolving out \nof the anthrax attacks on our mail system pale in comparison to the \nenormous tragedy of September 11, the families of those who suffered \ntragic deaths after being exposed to anthrax laced letters and those of \nus who continue to be displaced on Capitol Hill understand the very \nreal dangers associated with the elusive threat of bioterrorism.\n  In the wake of the anthrax attacks, we, as a Nation, began to realize \nthat we were not fully prepared to effectively and comprehensively \nrespond to biological threats. The attack in Boca Raton, FL elicited an \narray of missteps and symptoms of inadequate preparation at all levels \nof government. Because Floridians, and Americans, had never faced such \na threat before, the necessary communication lines had not been formed \nand many emergency responders were not properly equipped to handle this \nnew type of crisis. The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001, passed \nby the Senate today, is an important first step at increasing our \nability to respond to, and prevent, future biological attacks at the \nFederal, State, and local levels. It will enhance our ability to detect \nan attack by improving disease surveillance systems and public health \nlaboratories. It will improve our ability to treat victims of an attack \nby increasing hospital capacity for disease outbreaks. It will also \nenhance our ability to contain an attack by expanding pharmaceutical \nstockpiles and accelerating the development of new treatments. Finally, \nthis bill seeks to target future bioterrorist threats in a \ncomprehensive manner by protecting our food sources and other potential \ntargets.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a portion of the \nbill that I believe is essential to our Nation's coordinated prevention \nand response initiative. Like many Americans, I sought out additional \ninformation about the threat of bioterrorism after anthrax was \ndiscovered in Florida, New York, New Jersey, and Washington, DC. In the \ncourse of my research efforts, I had the opportunity to visit with some \nof the professors, researchers, and scientists that work for the \nUniversity of South Florida Center for Biological Defense. The Center \nfor Biological Defense is a joint project of the University of South \nFlorida College of Public Health and the Florida Department of Health. \nThe Center focuses on a full spectrum of studies and programs, ranging \nfrom research and development to outreach and educational seminars. The \nCenter has implemented a multifaceted approach to biological defense \nresearch that utilizes a number of universities throughout the state of \nFlorida to implement its studies and projects. The Center for \nBiological Defense has laboratory programs that are dedicated to \nimproving surveillance systems, developing early detection \ncapabilities, rapidly identifying pathogens, and fully understanding \nthe factors that affect the toxicity of biological agents. Moreover, \nthe Center concentrates on efforts to enhance health care preparedness, \nto strengthen hospital hygiene and containment capabilities, and to \ncoordinate vital educational and training programs for emergency \nmanagement and health professionals, which has proven to be a crucial \ncomponent of the response efforts to the anthrax contamination \noccurring over the course of the past 2 months.\n  While the preeminent focus of the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of \n2001 is on our government agencies and their crucial missions, a \nportion of this bill recognizes our Nation's universities as a critical \ncomponent of the United States bioterrorism defense plan. Centers \nacross the Nation, like Florida's Center for Biological Defense, do \ncritical bio-defense work at the local, State, and national level \neveryday. In fact, it is these programs that have coordinated first \nresponder training programs, developed products capable of identifying \nbiological contamination on site, and developed new techniques for \ncontaining disease and preventing the spread of contagious pathogens. I \nam delighted that the Senate has been proactive in acknowledging the \ntremendous value of these programs in an effort to encourage their \nreceipt of additional Federal grants in the future.\n  I am pleased that I was able to be part of the effort to draft and \npass the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001 and I am thankful to my \nfellow Senators for ensuring the passage of this vital bi-partisan \nlegislation prior to the holiday recess. I look forward to passing a \nfinal version of this bill at the conclusion of the conference between \nthe House and Senate, as I believe that implementation of this bill \nwill not only ensure our preparedness for any future biological \nthreats, but will also quell the concerns and fears of the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13933-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13933-S13934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  MTBE\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, for the third day this \nweek, I have come to the floor to speak about MTBE.\n  This is the gas additive that has become a huge concern for millions\n\n[[Page S13934]]\n\nacross the Nation because of the contamination it has caused.\n  That is certainly true of many communities throughout New Hampshire \nwhere it has become a crisis. And the crisis will continue to escalate \nunless it is dealt with.\n  I was pleased last week when the majority leader made a commitment to \nme that the Senate will vote on MTBE legislation before the end of \nFebruary.\n  Until the day of that vote arrives, I will continue to come to the \nfloor to remind Senators of the terrible impact that MTBE is having on \nthe Nation. And remind them why it is important that we act now.\n  In 1990, the Clean Air Act was amended to include a clean gasoline \nprogram. That program mandated the use of an oxygenate in our fuel--\nMTBE was one of two options to be used.\n  The program with MTBE is that when it is leaked or spilled, it moves \nthrough the ground very quickly and into the water table.\n  Many homes in New Hampshire and across the nation have lost use of \ntheir water supply because of MTBE contamination.\n  Many others have had to install expensive water treatment systems in \norder to drink the water or even shower.\n  According to the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, \nthere may be up to 40,000 private wells with some MTBE contamination. \nOf those, up to 8,000 may have MTBE contamination over state health \nstandards.\n  So far this week, I have talked about the problems faced by families \nand small businesses throughout the regions of New Hampshire.\n  Today I want to talk about the Sojka family who have a home on \nCobbetts Pond in Windham.\n  The water supply for the home is a deep, bedrock on-site well.\n  Just about two years ago, the Sojkas began noticing that the water \nhad a strange odor and that it left a residue on their hands.\n  So they did a little test of their own to see if there really was \nanything unusual with their water. Their son Brian filled up a bowl \nfull of tap water and let it sit overnight. They were horrified with \ntheir finding next morning. The water had a slick oily film floating on \ntop--the same water that the family had been drinking, bathing in, and \ncleaning their food with.\n\n  As a result, the Sojkas had their water tested. The test revealed \nMTBE contamination at a level twice as high as the State standard.\n  They contacted the State of New Hampshire for help--by now, it had \nbecome quite common for the state to get this type of request.\n  The state began providing bottled water to the family. Just like the \nMiller family I spoke of yesterday, the Sojka's pointed out similar \nconcern--that while bottled water is fine for drinking, it doesn't help \nwith other daily needs such as: bathing; washing fruits and vegetables; \nand cooking.\n  Within a few months of the initial tests at the Sojka home, the MTBE \ncontamination levels in the well jumped up by almost 8,000 percent.\n  Unbelievable contamination!\n  Last summer, the State installed an elaborate and cumbersome water \ntreatment system on the Sojka's property. Unlike the Millers that I \nspoke of yesterday, who had a system installed in their home, the \nsystem needed for the Sojka's was too large to fit in the home\n  The State had to build a shed separate from the house for the \ncommercial water treatment system. The system consists of an enormous \ncommercial air stripper and two 6 cubic foot carbon units.\n  Such a system costs in the neighborhood of $20,000.\n  Fortunately for the family, the state is providing the system and \ncost of operation and maintenance to the tune of an additional $5,000 \nper year.\n  Can you imagine having a large chuck of your back yard being occupied \nby a commercial water treatment system.\n  It is terrible that this has to happen to any family. And it is \nhorribly wrong for federal mandate to cause such pain.\n  This problem isn't unique to New Hampshire--it exists in Maine, \nCalifornia, Nevada, Texas, New York, Rhode Island, and on and on.\n  We would be delinquent in our duties as United State Senators if we \nwere to sit back and do nothing about this.\n  We must act soon.\n  I have a bill that has been reported out of committee two years in a \nrow that will address these problems.\n  Mr. President, the time to act is now--it is time to help out the \nfamilies who have fallen victim to a Federal mandate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13934-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13934-S13935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Mr. CLELAND.

Mr. President, the Senate recently passed legislation \nreauthorizing an important child welfare program known as Promoting \nSafe and Stable Families. Under the auspices of this Social Security \nAct grant program, States are able to provide services to at-risk \nfamilies to prevent the need for children to enter the foster care \nsystem.\n  Four types of services are included in the program: family \npreservation; community-based family support; time-limited family \nreunification; and adoption promotion and support. In addition, the \nprogram provides funding for state court improvement projects. I cannot \nproceed without praising Iowa's court improvement project which, under \nthe leadership of Judge Terry Huitink and Judge Stephen Clarke, has \nproduced valuable research to streamline the court process for children \nwaiting to be adopted. The Iowan project also provides training for \njudges in order to increase understanding of the needs of children in \nthe foster care system.\n  The reauthorization passed by the Senate ensures that money will be \navailable for the next five years at an annual minimum of $305 million \nper year. An additional $200 million is authorized to be spent from \ndiscretionary funds determined annually by Senate appropriators. I am \nalso pleased the 2002 Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and \neducation appropriations legislation included $70 million in \ndiscretionary spending for the Safe and Stable program, for a total \nfunding level of $375 million in fiscal year 2002. In fact, I and some \nof my Senate colleagues are sending a letter to President Bush tomorrow \nrequesting that full funding of $505 million for the program be \nincluded in the Administration's fiscal year 2003 budget.\n  The Promoting Safe and Stable Families program is a valuable weapon \nin the fight against child abuse and neglect. The Federal Government \nspends billions of dollars each year to provide services to children \nwho have already been placed in the foster care system. Much less money \nis spent on providing services before removal from the home is \nnecessary. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that \nbetween 1999 and 2003, money spent on removing children from their \nhomes and placing them in foster and adoptive homes will exceed by nine \ntimes the amount of money spent on services and prevention. \nFurthermore, annual spending during this period for removal and \nplacement is expected to increase by thirty-five percent, from $4.8 \nbillion to $6.5 billion, while annual spending for prevention and \nservices is expected to increase by only nine percent, from $0.57 \nbillion to $0.62 billion.\n  More than one hundred thirty thousand children are waiting to be \nadopted out of foster care in the United States, and at least 4,500 of \nthose children live in Iowa. Each child deserves a loving family and a \nsafe environment. Promoting Safe and Stable Families grants provide \ncritical services to vulnerable families and children, and I am pleased \nthe Senate fulfilled its duty and acted to reauthorize the program.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Enhanced \nborder Security Act of 2001. We must take the long term steps to \nstrengthen the security at our borders. I want to commend my \ncolleagues, Senators Kennedy and Feinstein, Brownback and Kyl, for \ntheir tireless work to address border security issues.\n  The bill we will be voting on today, the Enhanced Border Security Act \nof 2001, was a product of the thoughtful merging of two bills. As an \noriginal cosponsor of Senators Kennedy and Brownback's initial version \nof this bill, I have worked closely with the four principal sponsors to \nintegrate the best of each of these two pieces of legislation, and have \nbeen very please with the outcome of this effort.\n  This bill addresses what I consider to be one of the most important \nissues in our fight against terorism--how we can effectively secure our \nborders from terrorists. This bill address border security by \nincreasing the number of border patrol and immigration personnel at the \nborders; improving the quality and sharing of identity information; \nimproving the screening of foreign nations seeking to enter the U.S. on \nvisas; and improving awareness of the comings and goings of these \nforeign nationals as they enter or exit our country.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have been honored to work \nclosely with Senators Kennedy and Feinstein to find ways to better \nprotect our borders and provide necessary support to the men and women \nwho work for the State Department, the Immigration and Naturalization \nService and the U.S. Customs Agency.\n  I, along with many of my colleagues, am currently pressing for \nfunding to triple the number of Immigration and Naturalization Service \nand U.S. Customs personnel on our northern border and improve border \ntechnology, the authorization for which was included in the USA Patriot \nAct. In the past, a severe lack of resources at our northern border has \ncompromise the ability of border control officials to execute their \nduties. I am pleased that Congress made the tripling of these resources \na priority for national security, and I will continue to fight for full \nfunding of this measure. This bill also addresses these needs by \nincreasing INS inspectors and border patrol staffing each by 200 \npersons per year for the fiscal year 2002-2006. The bill also \nauthorizes $150 million in spending for improving technology and \nfacilities at our borders.\n  The Enhanced Border Security Act of 2001 addresses several other \ncritical issues. In hearings this session before the Immigration \nSubcommittee and the Technology and Terrorism Subcommittee, as well as \nthe full Judiciary Committee, we heard repeated calls for better \nsharing of law enforcement and intelligence information as it relates \nto admitting aliens into the United States. The bill addresses this \nproblem by mandating INS and Department of State access to relevant FBI \ninformation within one year. I am pleased that the authors of the bill \nhave included provisions to protect the privacy and security of this \ninformation, and require limitations on the use and repeated \ndissemination of the information.\n  Two of the most important provisions of this legislation address \ninternational cooperation in enhancing border security. Protecting U.S. \nborders requires the assistance and cooperation of our closest allies. \nIndeed, we share an interest in protecting our respective borders. \nCitizens of several countries, including most European countries, Japan \nand Canada, can enter the U.S. without visas. And this is as it should \nbe. But the U.S. must, with new urgency, continue to engage Canada, \nMexico and other countries that may be interested in sharing law \nenforcement and intelligence information to protect our respective \nborders. We must improve information sharing, and must improve the \ntechnology to make sure information is shared with the right people and \nin a timely manner.\n  In October, we passed a major anti-terrorism bill that contained a \nnumber of provisions that will enable our law enforcement community and \nthe intelligence community to obtain and share vital information \nregarding persons who are a threat to the U.S. One of the most \nimportant new tools I was pleased to have had included in USA Patriot \nAct is a requirement that State and Justice develop a visa technology \nstandard to help secure our border and make certain each individual who \nseeks entry into our country on a visa is the person he or she claims \nto be and there is no known reason to keep that person out.\n  We must work with our allies to take advantage of this technology \nstandard to improve interoperability on an international scale. We \nshould do what we can to eliminate technological barriers to \ninformation-sharing regarding dangerous individuals and to address our \nmutual concern for border security. To this end, this bill requires the \nDepartment of State to report to Congress within six months on how best \nwe\n\n[[Page S13936]]\n\ncan undertake ``perimeter'' screening with our partners, Canada and \nMexico. Further, the bill requires the Department of State, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service and the Office of Homeland \nSecurity to report to Congress within 90 days on how best to facilitate \nsharing of information that may be relevant to determining whether to \nissue a U.S. visa. Our borders are only as secure as the borders of \nthose countries whose citizens we allow into our country without a \nvisa.\n  The provisions we have achieved in the USA Patriot Act laid the \nfoundation for more specific provisions to assure the best use of \ntechnology to improve the security at our borders. This bill fulfills \nthe promise of the USA Patriot Act to assure information sharing will \nbe thoughtfully implemented in short order.\n  With the enactment of the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the federal \ngovernment committed to developing a visa technology standard that \nwould facilitate the sharing of information related to the \nadmissibility of aliens into the United States. I proposed this \nlanguage recognizing that, for many years, the U.S law enforcement and \nintelligence communities have maintained numerous, but separate, non-\ninteroperable databases. These databases are not easily or readily \naccessible to front-line federal agents responsible for making the \ncritical decisions of whether to issue a visa or to admit an alien into \nthe United States.\n  To build on and fulfill the goals of establishing this standard, this \nbill will do three things. First, it will require technology be \nimplemented to track the initial entry and exit of aliens travelling on \na U.S. visa. We know now that several of the terrorists who attacked \nAmerica on September 11th were traveling on expired visas. We have had \nthe law in place for several years now, but due to concerns about \nmaintaining the flow of trade and tourism across our borders--concerns \nI share--the provisions of Section 110 have not been fully implemented. \nTechnology will address those concerns, allowing electronic recordation \nand verification of entry and exit data in an instant.\n  Second, I believe it is necessary to require the Department of State \nand Justice to work with the Office of Homeland Security to build a \ncohesive electronic data sharing system. The system must incorporate \ninteroperability and compatibility within and between the databases of \nthe various agencies that maintain information relevant to determining \nwhether a visa should be issued or whether an alien should be admitted \ninto the United States. This legislation will require interoperable \nreal-time sharing of law enforcement and intelligence information \nrelevant to the issuance of a visa or an alien's admissibility to the \nU.S. The provision will require that information is made available, \nalthough with the appropriate safeguards for privacy and the protection \nof intelligence sources, to the front-line government agents making the \ndecisions to issue visas or to admit visa-holding aliens to the United \nStates.\n  Keeping terrorists out of the U.S. in the first place will reduce the \nrisks of terrorism within the U.S. in the future. Aliens known to be \naffiliated with terrorists have been admitted to the U.S. on valid \nvisas simply because one agency in government did not share important \ninformation with another department in a timely fashion. We must make \nsure that this does not happen again.\n  Until now, we had hoped that agencies would voluntarily share this \ninformation on a realtime and regular basis. This has not happened, and \nalthough I know that the events of September 11 have led to serious \nrethinking of our information-sharing processes and procedures, I think \nit is time to mandate the sharing of fundamental information.\n  Advancements in technology have provided us with additional tools to \nverify the identity of individuals entering our country without \nimpairing the flow of legitimate trade, tourism, workers and students. \nIt is time we put these tools to use.\n  Improving our national security is vitally important, but I will not \nsupport measures that compromise America's civil liberties. The bill we \nare voting on today includes a number of safeguards to protect \nindividuals' rights to privacy. The bill provides that where databases \nare created or shared, there must be protection of privacy and adequate \nsecurity measures in place, limitations on the use and re-dissemination \nof information, and mechanisms for removing obsolete or erroneous \ninformation. Even in times of urgent action, we must protect the \nfreedoms that make our country great.\n  I urge a favorable vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13936-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13936-S13937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO COMMISSIONER JOHN F. TIMONEY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the long and \ndistinguished career of one of our Nation's top police executives, \nPhiladelphia Police Commissioner John F. Timoney.\n  Commissioner Timoney will leave the Philadelphia Police Department in \nearly January, and I want to highlight some of his achievements. I \nbelieve John's record of achievement will benefit America's police \nofficers for years to come.\n  John Timoney immigrated to the United States from Ireland at the age \nof 13. In 1969, after graduating from high school, he joined the ranks \nof the New York Police Department. He spent the first twelve years of \nhis career as a patrol officer and later a narcotics investigator on \nthe streets of Harlem and the South Bronx. As his reputation for \nintegrity, innovation, and perseverance grew, he rose through the \ndepartment's management structure, eventually assuming the position of \nChief of Department, the highest ranking uniformed position in the \ndepartment. It was during Mr. Timoney's tenure in the upper echelons of \nthe NYPD that New York's crime rate began to drop precipitously, due in \nno small part to the new management structure he instituted, merging \nthe Housing and Transit Police Department with the NYPD. In 1996, upon \nhis departure from the NYPD, then-Chief Timoney had accrued over 65 \nDepartment Medals, including the prestigious Medal of Valor.\n  After retiring from the NYPD, John entered the world of private \nsecurity consulting, and offered his expertise and advice to law \nenforcement authorities all across the country and around the world. He \nserved as Vice Chairman of the Irish Commission on Domestic Violence, \nand he advised Britain's Patton Commission, which focused on policing \nNorthern Ireland.\n  In March of 1998, Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell appointed John \nCommissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department. His tenure in that \nposition was marked by the same commitment to excellence and \nimprovement which characterized his career in New York. John brought \nthe innovative Compstat system to Philadelphia, and helped to \nreinvigorate the department. Running a department of 7,000 officers and \n900 civilian employees is no easy task, and Commissioner Timoney's \nefforts to modernize the department have been rewarded by a decline in \nPhiladelphia's crime rate.\n  While I thank John profusely for what he has done to make the streets \nsafer for millions of New Yorkers and Philadelphians, I rise today for \nanother reason: to thank Commissioner Timoney for the lessons that his \nexpertise and experience have taught the entirety of the law \nenforcement community. While his achievements as a cop on the beat \ndeserve our thanks, I want to make special mention of the contribution \nhe has made to our understanding of how police departments can better \nemploy their resources to combat crime across the country.\n  Commissioner Timoney's career in the upper echelons of law \nenforcement have been marked by two major paradigm shifts. Without \nthem, law enforcement would not be nearly as successful. And because \nCommissioner Timoney's work represents what I think is the best of law \nenforcement--because I believe that we at the Federal level ought to \nencourage and promote police departments around the nation to promote \njust this kind of progress--I want to draw special attention to it.\n  First, Commissioner Timoney was at the forefront of efforts to get \nboth the New York and Philadelphia Police Departments to embrace \nCompstat, a high-tech system which allows police departments to monitor \nand analyze crime data better, empowering them to re-deploy resources \nas needed.\n\n[[Page S13937]]\n\nCompstat was revolutionary policing in both New York and Philadelphia, \ncontributing to dramatic crime reductions in both cities.\n  Second, Commissioner Timoney has been an outspoken proponent of \ncommunity policing, which was an integral portion of 1994's crime bill. \nThe Commissioner has set a high standard in the practice of policing \nmulti-ethnic and multi-racial communities by empowering precinct \ncaptains and other officers in local areas to develop constructive \nrelationships with members of the communities they police. I've always \nbelieved that the more integrated cops are with the communities they \nserve the better. Commissioner Timoney has lived that principle, and \nthe great accomplishments of his career are due in no small part to his \npromotion of community policing.\n  I am grateful to be able to call John Timoney a friend.

Mr. President, I would like to take a minute to bring to \nthe attention of this great body the words of Rachel Bennett. Rachel is \na 13-year old constituent who has written ``Whispers of Liberty,'' a \nmoving poem about the events of September 11. These terrorist attacks \nhad a profoundly sobering effect on most of the world. As Americans we \nwere forcefully reminded of the ideals and principles which unite us as \na nation. I have read and heard many explain the significance and \naftermath of September 11, but few have done so as well as Rachel. She \npoignantly reminds us of the dreams that were shattered by the \nterrorists, while at the same time she reminds us of the values and \nideas that have rallied Americans to help one another deal with these \ntragedies. I would like to read this poem for the record:\n\n                          Whispers of Liberty\n\n                          (By Rachel Bennett)\n\n     How could a moment\n     So change everything?\n     A speechless nation\n     Cried out in despair\n     In unison as one.\n     How could in a moment\n     So many lives be put out,\n     Like a field of flowers\n     Closing in the mid of summer\n     Never to bloom again?\n     And in that moment,\n     How many chances\n     Of being a grandfather,\n     A husband, a mother\n     Of knowing the joys\n     Of life and love\n     Be gone?\n     Like a candle\n     Doused with tears of despair,\n     Our nation wept\n     For the twin brothers\n     Who know lie in a\n     Silent reverie\n     As two lions\n     Suddenly tamed\n     A ghastly graveyard\n     Of pride and greatness.\n     Yet buried within\n     The solid and proud\n     Red, white, and blue\n     Of American pride.\n     A stoic symbol\n     Of freedom and unity\n     In a world\n     Of stricken terror.\n     Its red, the blood of\n     The innocent whose\n     Lives were stolen from them;\n     Its white,\n     Purity and strength;\n     And its blue, the melancholy tears\n     Of sadness.\n     These bands of red\n     And white\n     Bring us together\n     As one.\n     A single\n     Voice declaring freedom\n     And a fearless life\n     For all the world.\n     Strength resonating\n     From the richness\n     Of the colors\n     Bind us together\n     In a single dance\n     Of peace and\n     A single whispered word--\n     Liberty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13937-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WILLIAMSON, WEST VIRGINIA\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deepest \ngratitude to and admiration for the citizens of Williamson in Mingo \nCounty, West Virginia for their generosity and sacrifice on behalf of \nothers. Their donation of approximately $26,000 to the ``Families of \nFreedom Scholarship Fund,'' to aid the children of those lost in the \nterrorist attacks on our country over three months ago, is symbolic of \nthe tremendous compassion and unity of the American people. I would \nlike to thank the citizens of Williamson on behalf of all the families \nwho will be able to take advantage of this scholarship fund. They have \nreached deep into their hearts and pockets to send the children \naffected by the September 11 attacks a truly beautiful gift.\n  Earlier this month, I met with Williamson Mayor Estil ``Breezy'' \nBevins, Fire Chief Grover ``Curt'' Philips and Police Chief Roby Pope \nwhen they presented $26,000 in donations in Senator Byrd's office. \nShortly after September 11, the City Council voted to donate $5,000 to \nthe victims of the attacks on the World Trade Center. Over $15,000 was \ncollected on September 14 through a ``boot drive'' where police \nofficers, firefighters and others took to the streets to stop cars to \ncollect money. As I told Mayor Bevins, Williamson's trememdous efforts \nand energy symbolize the spirit of ``small-Town America.''\n  I suggested that the town consider sending their donations to the \n``Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund,'' which former President \nClinton and former Majority Leader Bob Dole chair together. The Fund \nprovides educational assistance for the children and spouses of those \nkilled or permanently disabled in the terrorist attacks of September \n11. I would like to thank my friend and colleague Senator Rockefeller \nfor contacting my office to seek guidance on directing the donations. I \nam very grateful to Senators Byrd and Rockefeller for joining me in \nreceiving the people of Williamson's donation earlier this month.\n  This small town in southern West Virginia, thousands of miles away \nfrom the Twin Towers, has experienced its own share of adversity, \nincluding a devastating flood in 1977. Perhaps Williamson's struggle to \novercome its own set of hurdles has made the citizens there especially \nsympathetic to the tremendous obstacles that the people of New York \nCity are facing. At the same time as Williamson has reached out to \nthose affected by the terrorist attacks in New York City, they are \nworking to tackle financial difficulties in their own backyard and I \napplaud their efforts. An aggressive economic development effort is \nunderway to secure a wood products park, most aquaculture and a \nstronger market for coal.\n  Many Americans have felt a personal need in their everyday lives to \nreach out to their neighbors, coworkers or even strangers to offer \nassistance, both large and small. We saw it in New York with people \nstanding in line for hours to donate blood, and with families donating \nfood to rescue workers who were toiling around the clock, or companies \nwho wanted to contribute funding and resources. ``What can I do to \nhelp?'' is a common, if not universal refrain that Americans have \nspoken, or thought quietly to themselves, since the attacks. The people \nof Williamson have matched those noble words with action, and New \nYorkers thank them from the bottom of our hearts for their outpouring \nof compassion.\n  Winston Churchill once said, ``We make a living by what we get. We \nmake a life by what we give.'' During this time of tremendous grief and \nanxiety that's being felt in all corners of the world, the citizens' of \nWilliamson efforts to ensure that children who have been affected by \nthese terrible attacks are not forgotten will provide comfort to many \nand inspiration for us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13937-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13937-S13938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RETIREMENT OF U.S. ATTORNEY JAMES TUCKER\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, one of the best and most respected \nattorneys to have ever served in our State as an assistant U.S. \nAttorney is retiring. James Tucker has served the U.S. Department of \nJustice in the Southern District of Mississippi for 30 years.\n  I have an enormous amount of respect and appreciation for the way \nJames Tucker has carried out the important responsibilities of his job. \nHe\n\n[[Page S13938]]\n\nwas a true professional in every respect. He was completely honest and \ntrustworthy, and he was tenacious in bringing to justice those who \nviolated the laws of the United States.\n  I commend him for a job well done and wish him much continued success \nand satisfaction in the years ahead.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Clarion Ledger of \nDecember 17, highlighting his illustrious career be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Top Corruption Fighter Leaving Post\n\n                          (By Jerry Mitchell)\n\n       Mississippi's top corruption fighter over the past 30 \n     years--Assistant U.S. Attorney James Tucker--is leaving the \n     U.S. attorney's office to go into private practice.\n       ``If you could combine honor, integrity, courage and \n     expertise in the same person, what you'd have is James \n     Tucker,'' Attorney General Mike Moore said ``they don't make \n     'em that way anymore. He is the ultimate professional.''\n       Jan. 3 will mark Tucker's last day of work at the U.S. \n     attorney's office, where he has worked since 1971. After \n     that, he'll join the Butler Snow law firm in Jackson, where \n     he'll be part of the litigation division.\n       Tucker said he is sad to be leaving on one hand but is \n     enthused about his new job. ``After 30 years with the \n     Department of Justice, it hurts a little to cut the string, \n     but I'm looking forward to a challenging new career.''\n       A no-nonsense retired Naval Reserve officer, Tucker has \n     shunned the limelight, despite taking on very public \n     prosecutions of Mississippi public officials, including \n     Operation Pretense, which led to convictions of 43 county \n     supervisors and 11 vendors on corruption charges.\n       His long list of those prosecuted has included members of \n     the Mississippi Senate, the Highway Commission, the Public \n     Service Commission and the Jackson City Council.\n       His work also helped put former Biloxi Mayor Pete Halat \n     behind bars on federal charges in connection with the 1987 \n     killing of Halat's former law partner, Vincent Sherry and his \n     wife, Margaret.\n       ``I've always had strong feelings about public officials \n     violating the trust,'' Tucker said. ``I always felt if I had \n     the power to right those kinds of wrongs, I ought to do it.''\n       In 1983 and 1998, the Provine High School graduate received \n     the highest award an assistant U.S. attorney can receive from \n     the Justice Department--the Superior Performance Award.\n       ``That's one of my great honors,'' Tucker said, ``winning \n     that award twice.''\n       Perhaps better than an award was the comment he said he \n     received the other day from a current county supervisor: ``He \n     said, `You don't realize it, but what y'all did in Pretense \n     has helped us honest supervisors for years and years and will \n     for years to come. Because of that, we can threaten people \n     with another Pretense if they fool around (with corruption).' \n     ''\n       Moore credited Tucker with cleaning up corruption in \n     Mississippi: ``He's helped return integrity to public \n     office.''\n       Tucker's expertise has helped pave the way for many other \n     lawyers, including Moore, who first go to know Tucker when as \n     a district attorney in Pascagoula he pursued corruption cases \n     against local supervisors.\n       ``He really helped me through those tough times, and he's \n     continued to be my friend,'' Moore said. ``He was a mentor to \n     me.''\n       Defense lawyer John Colette of Jackson said what makes \n     Tucker special is his ability to remain calm, even amidst a \n     storm, such as during the 1990 trial of Newton Alfred Winn, \n     convicted in connection with the disappearance of Jackson \n     socialite Annie Laurie Hearin.\n       But that calmness belies a quiet ruthlessness, he said.\n       As someone has remarked, Colette said, Tucker is the kind \n     of prosecutor who slits the throat of a defense lawyer, who \n     doesn't realize it until his head is in his lap.\n       Now that Tucker's gone, he joked, ``I'm going to start \n     trying all my cases in federal court.''\n       What may say the most about Tucker is that he has the \n     admiration of not only the defense bar, but judges as well, \n     Colette said.\n       ``He's probably the most competent prosecutor I ever \n     heard,'' said U.S. District Judge William H. Barbour Jr. \n     ``The district was lucky to have him for so many years.''\n       Even as Mississippi has changed U.S. attorneys in the \n     Southern District, Tucker has remained as the chief of the \n     criminal division.\n       Former U.S. Attorney Brad Pigott said he relied on Tucker \n     during his tenure.\n       ``He's an ideal public servant,'' Pigott said. ``He's \n     personally modest and quiet. I've spent some time with him in \n     the foxhole, I can vouch for his integrity in every way. He \n     deserves a very wonderful reputation.''\n       Defense lawyers say Tucker helped provide continuity to the \n     sometimes revolving door of the U.S. attorney's office, \n     serving once as interim U.S. attorney.\n       ``Many people, including me, felt that with him there, \n     there was somebody to talk to who would listen,'' said \n     defense lawyer Tom Royals of Jackson.\n       ``It's a real loss to our justice system to see James \n     Tucker leave,'' said defense lawyer Dennis Sweet of Jackson. \n     ``He's a tremendous lawyer, and he's been tremendously fair. \n     I just hope whoever replaces him does as good a job for the \n     U.S. attorney's office as he has.''\n       Current U.S. Attorney Dunn Lampton said he is certainly \n     going to miss Tucker. ``He's an institution,'' Lampton said. \n     ``He knows more off the top of his head than you can find out \n     doing research in books.''\n       Because of Tucker, Lampton said he never worried about the \n     criminal side of his office.\n       Now he'll have to find a replacement, which he'll probably \n     choose from within his office, he said. ``We'll all have to \n     work together to take up the slack.''\n       Those outside legal circles also praise Tucker.\n       ``There was a time when James Tucker was the only defense \n     standing between us and total corruption in Mississippi,'' \n     said veteran journalist Bill Minor, who wrote about Tucker in \n     his new book, Eyes on Mississippi: A Fifty-Year Chronicle of \n     Change. ``In my estimation, he ranks among the true heroes \n     that I've known over my 54-year career.''\n       Former Public Safety Commissioner and FBI agent Jim Ingram \n     said Tucker will be sorely missed by all of Mississippi. \n     ``Almost all of us can be replaced. He can't.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13938-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF DENIS GALVIN UPON HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE \n                         NATIONAL PARK SERVICE\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize and thank Denis Galvin, the Deputy Director of the National \nPark Service, who will be retiring at the end of this year after a \ncareer of almost 40 years with the Park Service. The Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources has jurisdiction over national park \nissues, and we have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to work \nclosely with Mr. Galvin over the years.\n  Since beginning his tenure with the Park Service in 1963 as a civil \nengineer at Sequoia National Park, Mr. Galvin has held several \npositions with the Park Service throughout the country, including a \nperiod in the Southwest Regional Office in Santa Fe. He also worked for \nseveral years in Boston in the Northeast Regional Office, and as the \nDirector of the Denver Services Center, the planning, design, and \nconstruction arm of the Park Service. Since 1985 Mr. Galvin has held \ntwo positions that brought him into frequent contact with the Congress \nand our Committee, as the Associate Director for Planning and \nDevelopment from 1989 to 1997, and twice as the Deputy Director of the \nNational Park Service, from 1985 to 1989, and again from 1997 until \nnow.\n  In his capacity as Associate Director and Deputy Director, Mr. Galvin \nhas been involved in every major policy issue facing the National Park \nService. He has been one of the National Park Service's greatest \nresources, and his knowledge and judgment about national park issues is \nvery much respected, both within the agency and here in Congress. \nWhenever the Committee held a hearing on an especially important \nlegislative issue affecting the National Park Service, we would often \nrequest that Mr. Galvin testify, so that the members of the Committee \ncould benefit from his expertise and advice. Because of his broad and \nvaried background, he could speak with as much knowledge on the merits \nof particular construction project within a park as he could on general \npolicy issues affecting the entire park system.\n  I would like to recognize his efforts, especially in his role in the \nNational Park Service leadership, to maintain and protect the integrity \nof the National Park System. The Park Service has been fortunate to \nhave had many strong and far-sighted leaders in its history. We have \nbeen extremely fortunate that Denis Galvin has continued in that great \ntradition. As he embarks on a new chapter in his life I would like to \ntake this opportunity to thank Denny for all of his assistance to me \nand to other members of the Senate, and I extend my best wishes upon \nhis retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13938-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13938-S13939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CARAN KOLBE McKEE\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a loyal \nfriend and trusted advisor who left my staff in late August. Caran \nKolbe McKee came to work for me 14 years ago. She served the people of \nIowa in a number of capacities in my office. In every case, Caran \ndemonstrated remarkable leadership qualities, steadfastness of purpose, \nand the kind of problem-solving\n\n[[Page S13939]]\n\nability that can make our Government work for the people in the best \nway possible.\n  Caran came to the Senate in 1987, when she joined my staff as \nassistant press secretary. Two years later, she became my press \nsecretary. During this time, she dealt with a range of important \nissues, including the Gulf War, Supreme Court nominations, whistle-\nblower protections, a farm bill, civil rights legislation, a campaign \nto apply labor and employment laws to Congress, and the budget battle \nof 1990. She made certain that Iowans had access to accurate and timely \ninformation through the news media and fostered a better understanding \nof the way in which the issues addressed by Congress affect the lives \nof individuals and families.\n  In 1994, Caran took on new challenges as a special assistant. She \ndeveloped initiatives and reached out to the grassroots. Caran brought \nto her work a great appreciation for the people who make Iowa the \nextraordinary place that it is. She grew up on a farm in Western Iowa, \ngraduated from Iowa State University, and maintains many close family \nties in Iowa.\n  Caran is the kind of person who is always looking ahead and making a \nplan to improve things for others no matter what their stage and place \nin life. Just last week, President Bush signed into law legislation re-\nauthorizing the Drug Free Communities Act, a bill I sponsored in the \nSenate. During his remarks, the President took time to recognize a \ncoalition I launched in Iowa to address our state's growing drug \nproblem. Called ``Face It Together''--or FIT--it is the first-ever \ncommunity-based, statewide anti-drug coalition. The goal is to help \nIowans work together to keep their neighborhoods, schools, workplaces \nand communities drug-free. I hope to see this productive effort \ncontinue in the years ahead. No individual deserves more credit for \nmaking FIT a reality and a success than Caran Kolbe McKee. Her vision \nfor the project, gift for bringing people together and dedication to \nmaking the program happen were vitally important.\n  In recent years, Caran also managed my correspondence with Iowans. In \nthe Senate, I work hard to made the process of representative \ngovernment work. I keep in close touch with Iowans by returning home \nwhen the Senate is not in session. And since 1981, I have conducted a \nmeeting in each of Iowa's 99 counties at least one time every year. I \nam committed to an active dialogue with constituents, so at town \nmeetings I always say representative government is a two-way street. \nWhile I have come to them for a meeting about the issues, they also \nhave a responsibility to write to me expressing concerns and views and \nasking questions. Well, each and every one of these letters or e-mail \nmessages deserves and receives as answer from me. Caran made sure that \nIowans who wrote or called received a reply that was not just a piece \nof paper but a substantive, informative response. In this way, she \nhelped representative government work for the people in a fundamental, \nmeaningful way.\n  Caran Kolbe McKee was a true public servant. She was a mentor to many \nof her fellow staff members. And she was an inspiration for the way she \nhandled challenges--both professional and personal--with compassion, \nstrength and courage. Now Caran has decided to spend more time with her \nfamily. She will be greatly missed, but I admire her decision and wish \nher the very best. Above all, I extend to her my deepest \nthanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13939-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RETIREMENT OF NOAA SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE, EUGENE PROULX\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to express \nappreciation and congratulations to Eugene Proulx on the occasion of \nhis retirement as the Special Agent in Charge of the Southeast \nEnforcement Division of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service. For \nover 28 years, Gene has dedicated himself to the protection of our \nnation's oceans and living marine resources. His service of 3 years \nwith the United States Coast Guard and 25 years with the National \nMarine Fisheries Service's Office for Law Enforcement (OLE) have been \nexemplary, and he is being appropriately honored for this service at an \nevent to be held on December 21st in the Southeast region.\n  His commitment and leadership with the OLE have been reflected \nthrough his service as a Special Agent, National Training Coordinator, \nAssistant Special Agent in Charge, Deputy Special Agent in Charge, and \nas Special Agent in Charge and Acting Chief. Gene's service as a \nSpecial Agent in Charge included assignments in both the Southwest and \nSoutheast Divisions in addition to his many years of service as an \nagent at various duty posts in the Northeast Division as well as \nseveral assignments to Headquarters in Silver Spring as both an agent \nand as the Acting Chief of the Office for a period of three months.\n  Gene has been the example of a public servant who routinely gives 100 \npercent towards his responsibilities. His enthusiasm, dedication and \nenergy level are widely known. His corporate knowledge, fisheries \nexpertise, common sense, interpersonal skills and gracious humility are \nall traits that are exemplary and have facilitated his contributions to \nNOAA and our nation's resource missions. The accomplishments of the \nOffice of Law Enforcement in the areas of Vessel Monitoring Systems, \nSanctuaries Enforcement, Accreditation, and Cooperative Enforcement \nwere all strongly facilitated through the support of Gene's vision and \nleadership.\n  Gene's work with the national Cooperative Enforcement program and the \nState Joint Enforcement Agreements have provided a long-lasting \nfoundation for this important program. In particular, the state of \nSouth Carolina and its fisheries resources have benefited greatly \nthrough his work. In large part, Gene was responsible for convincing \nSouth Carolina that working jointly with NMFS could serve to \nsubstantially improve protection of our fishery resources far beyond \nthe level we could achieve working separately. His initiative led to a \nJoint Enforcement Agreement that is improving the management and \nprotection of South Carolina's precious marine resources. This program \nhas proven so successful that it is now the ``gold standard'' model of \nmarine resource enforcement, and it is being established in coastal \nstates around the nation. These cooperative programs and relationships \nwill be the legacy of Gene's leadership.\n  In closing, although we hate to see him go, I once again wish to \ncongratulate Agent Proulx on his exemplary career. Through his tireless \nefforts, he has made a difference in protecting the marine resources of \nSouth Carolina and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13939-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13939-S13940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN MEMORY OF THE HONORABLE DERAN KOLIGIAN\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

And, on behalf of the Senate, I extend our \nthoughts and prayers to the Koligian Family on the loss of an \nextraordinary man.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Fresno Bee, Dec. 13, 2001]\n\nDeran Koligian--A Powerful Voice in Fresno County, State Politics Falls \n                                 Silent\n\n       The odds suggest we shall not soon see the likes of Deran \n     Koligian in public life. The longtime Fresno County \n     supervisor, who died Tuesday at the age of 74, embodied a \n     rare set of skills and virtues. He was a bluntly honest \n     farmer, a man of the soil who so deeply loved his roots he \n     lived his entire life on his family's original 40-acre \n     homestead. He was also a talented and shrewd politician, in \n     the very best sense: clear about his philosophy and\n\n[[Page S13940]]\n\n     objectives, civil in his behavior and capable of inspired \n     compromise when conditions demanded it.\n       Koligian spent most of his adult life in public service. He \n     enlisted in the Army at age 18, fought in the Philippines in \n     World War II, and came home to attend Fresno State. The \n     family farm sustained him, but could not contain him. He \n     served many years on local school boards and was first \n     elected to the county Board of Supervisors in 1982. In doing \n     so, he became the first Armenian-American elected to public \n     office in the county.\n       Defending Valley agricultural lands against urban \n     encroachment was among Koligian's most important principles. \n     He almost single-handedly pushed Fresno's growth away from \n     his district, mostly lying to the west of Freeway 99, and out \n     to the northeast. He was immensely popular among farmers for \n     his defense of agriculture. He wasn't able to stop westward \n     sprawl completely--no one individual could--but it is only \n     recently that significant residential development has taken \n     place on his turf.\n       Koligian was deeply opposed to the county using bonds to \n     raise money for capital expenditures, arguing that it was \n     fiscally irresponsible. He usually managed to persuade the \n     rest of the board to support that position. It was one of the \n     bones of contention between Koligian and The Bee, and he won \n     the argument more often than he lost.\n       But--as with most of his adversaries--we always had a deep \n     respect for Koligian. His combination of honesty and \n     political savvy is one we do not often see, and we are all \n     the poorer for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13940-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING DR. DONALD J. COHEN\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I honor Dr. Donald J. \nCohen, a doctor, an author, an outstanding psychiatrist, a true \nprofessional, and caregiver and friend to the thousands of people who \nhad the good fortune of knowing him. Today I grieve for my friend, as \nhe recently passed away after only 61 short years on this Earth. I \ncould think of no better tribute to this great man than to name the \nvery program he envisioned so many years ago to help the victims of \nviolence-related stress in his honor. Thus, I submitted an amendment to \nthe Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill to amend \nSection 582 of the Public Health Service Act to rename this critically \nimportant grant program, the ``Donald J. Cohen National Child Traumatic \nStress Initiative.'' I am proud to say that this amendment has been \naccepted by both the House and Senate and for that I thank my \ncolleagues.\n  Dr. Cohen did more in his 61 years than most anyone else could ever \nhope to accomplish in a lifetime. He started at Brandeis University in \n1961 on the course to a medical career and then went on to graduate \nfrom Yale University School of Medicine in 1966. Over the following 35 \nyears, Dr. Cohen dedicated his life to helping children and \nadolescents. Donald spent virtually all of his adult life working \ntirelessly to develop and promote programs to assist children. I \nrecently learned from my colleague, Senator Dodd, that Dr. Cohen was \nthe first person to suggest a special health insurance program for \nchildren that ultimately became the Childrens' Health Insurance \nProgram. Today, this program throughout the Nation provides health care \nfor millions of children who would otherwise go without the basic care \nthey need to grow up healthy and flourish.\n  Dr. Cohen was a well-respected and world-renowned physician and \nteacher. Over the course of his illustrious career, he held many \nfaculty positions at the Yale University School of Medicine, \nculminating with his appointment as the child Psychiatrist-in-Chief of \nthe Yale Children's Hospital and Director of the Child Study Center at \nYale School of Medicine. He held these positions for the past 18 years, \nwhich, as anyone in medicine will tell you, is an incredible testimony \nto his stature and leadership.\n  He has been honored by the Institute of Medicine, the National \nAcademy of Sciences, the National Commission on Children, and the \nAmerican Psychiatric association for his outstanding work. He received \nnumerous lifetime research awards, including the Strecker Award from \nthe Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital and the Agnes Purcell \nMcGavin Award for Prevention from the APA. He was recognized as a \nSterling Professor of Child Psychiatry, Pediatrics and Psychology. He \nserved as President of the International Association of Child and \nAdolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions since 1993 and published \nover 300 papers and books. Dr. Cohen was also awarded a Doctor of \nPhilosophy, Honoris Causa, from the Bar Ilan University in Israel.\n  As you can see, Dr. Donald Cohen was quite a remarkable man. So many \npeople have been touched in some way by this great man's dedication.\n  It can be said that Dr. Cohen indeed achieved what most of us strive \nfor, to make a difference. For those of us who knew him, for those of \nus in whose life Donald made a difference, his passing comes painfully \ntoo soon. We mourn and pray that Donald's soul will be embraced in the \nwarmth of eternal life and that God will comfort and strengthen \nPhyllis, his wife, their children and grandchildren, and all of the \nfamily, friends, colleagues and patients who will miss him. I know the \nspirit and warmth of Dr. Donald J. Cohen will burn on in the hearts of \nthose who grieve him. It is with spirit that I ask my colleagues to \nhonor this man with the dedication of the Donald J. Cohen National \nChild Traumatic Stress Initiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13940-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13940-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S13940-4", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13940-S13941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2199) to amend \nthe National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act \nof 1997 to permit any Federal law enforcement agency to enter into a \ncooperative agreement with the Metropolitan Police Department of the \nDistrict of Columbia to assist the Department in carrying out crime \nprevention and law enforcement activities in the District of Columbia \nif deemed appropriate by the Chief of the Department and the United \nStates Attorney for the District of Columbia, and for other purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has agreed to the amendment \nof the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2657) to amend title 11, District of \nColumbia Code, to redesignate the Family Division of the Superior Court \nof the District of Columbia as the Family Court of the Superior Court, \nto recruit and retain trained and experienced judges to serve in the \nFamily Court, to promote consistency and efficiency in the assignment \nof judges to the Family Court and in the consideration of actions and \nproceedings in the Family Court, and for other purposes.\n  The message further announced that the House has agreed to the \namendment of the Senate to the concurrent resolution (H.

A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the products of Russia; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, at the request of the Administration, I \nrise today to offer legislation to repeal the Jackson-Vanik amendment \nto Title IV of the 1974 Trade Act and to authorize the extension of \nnormal trade relations to the products of the Russian Federation.\n  Congress passed the Jackson-Vanik amendment as a means to deny \nPermanent Normal Trade Relations to communist countries that restricted \nemigration rights and were not market economies. Jackson-Vanik \ncontinues to apply to the Russian Federation today despite the findings \nof successive Administrations that Russia had come into full compliance \nwith requirements of freedom of emigration, including the absence of \nany tax on emigration. Furthermore, although Russia's transformation \nhas been imperfect, substantial progress has been made toward the \ncreation of a free-market economy.\n  Since the fall of the Soviet Union, there have been dramatic changes \nin all aspects of life in Russia. It is clear that the Jackson-Vanik \namendment played a role in bringing about these changes and in \npromoting freedom of emigration in many countries in the former Soviet \nUnion.\n  But, the time has come to move beyond the Cold War era.\n  Since 1991, Congress has authorized the removal of Jackson-Vanik \nrestrictions from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, the \nSlovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Kyrgyszstan, Albania, and \nGeorgia. Because Russia continues to be subject to Jackson-Vanik \nconditions, the Administration must submit a semi-annual report to the \nCongress on that government's continued compliance with freedom of \nemigration requirements. The Administration reports that this \nrequirement continues to be a major irritant is U.S. relations with \nRussia. The changed circumstances that have permitted the removal of \nother communist countries from Title IV reporting now apply equally to \nRussia.\n  I understand there remain those with concerns about extending \nnondiscriminatory treatment to the products of the Russian Federation. \nBut I would simply point out that the U.S. and Russia concluded a \nbilateral trade agreement on June 17, 1992 and that Russia is currently \nin the process of acceding to the World Trade Organization. In other \nwords, the time has come to take the next step in the U.S.-Russian \nbilateral relationship, namely, Permanent Normal Trade Relations. It is \nfor that purpose that I introduce this legislation today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM:\n  S. 1863. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \ntreatment for foreign tax credit limitation purposes of certain \ntransfers of intangible property; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill clarify the proper tax treatment of intangible assets transferred \nto foreign corporations. This bill is necessary to avoid trapping \nunwary taxpayers who relied on Congressional intent when it made \nchanges to this area of the tax code in 1997.\n  Transfers of intangible property from a U.S. person to a foreign \ncorporation\n\n[[Page S13946]]\n\nin a transaction that would be tax-free under Code section 351 or 361 \nare subject to special rules. Pursuant to section 367(d), the U.S. \nperson making such a transfer is treated as 1. having sold the \nintangible property in exchange for payments that are contingent on the \nproductivity, use, or disposition of such property and 2. receiving \namounts that reasonably reflect the amounts that would have been \nreceived annually over the useful life of such property. The deemed \nroyalty amounts included in the gross income of the U.S. person by \nreason of this rule are treated as ordinary income and the earnings and \nprofits of the foreign corporation to which the intangible property was \ndistributed are reduced by such amounts.\n  Prior to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (the ``1997 Act''), the \ndeemed royalties under section 367(d) were treated as U.S.-source \nincome and therefore were not eligible for foreign tax credits. The \n1997 Act eliminated this special ``deemed U.S. source rule'' and \nprovided that deemed royalties under section 367(d) are treated as \nforeign-source income to the same extent that an actual royalty payment \nwould be so treated. The 1997 Act reflected a recognition that the \nprevious rule was intended to discourage transfers of intangible \nproperty to foreign corporations, relative to licenses of such \nintangible property, but that the enhanced information reporting \nincluded in the 1997 Act made it unnecessary to continue to so \ndiscourage transfers relative to licenses.\n  The 1997 Act intended to eliminate the penalty provided by the prior-\nlaw deemed U.S. source rule under section 367(d) and that had operated \nto discourage taxpayers from transferring intangible property in a \ntransaction that would be covered by section 367(d). Prior to the 1997 \nAct, in order to avoid this penalty, taxpayers licensed intangible \nproperty to foreign corporations instead of transferring such property \nin a transaction that would be subject to section 367(d). With the 1997 \nAct's elimination of the penalty source rule of section 367(d), it was \nintended that taxpayers could transfer intangible property to a foreign \ncorporation in a transaction that gives rise to deemed royalty payments \nunder section 367(d) instead of having to structure the transaction \nwith the foreign corporation as a license in exchange for actual \nroyalty payments.\n  The 1997 Act's goal of eliminating the penalty treatment of transfers \nof intangible property under section 367(d) is achieved only if the \ndeemed royalty payments under section 367(d) not only are sourced for \nforeign tax credit purposes in the same manner as actual royalty \npayments, but also are characterized for foreign tax credit limitation \npurposes in the same manner as actual royalty payments. Without a \nclarification that the deemed royalty payments under section 367(d) are \ncharacterized for foreign tax credit limitation purposes in the same \nmanner as an actual royalty, there is a risk in many cases that such \ndeemed royalties would be characterized in a manner that leads to a \nforeign tax credit result that is equally as disadvantageous as the \nresult that arose under the penalty source rule that was intended to be \neliminated by the 1997 Act. The bill I am introducing today provides \nthe needed clarification of the foreign tax credit limitation treatment \nof a deemed royalty under section 367(d), ensuring that the penalty \nthat was intended to be eliminated with the 1997 Act is in fact \neliminated.\n  The bill clarifies that the deemed income inclusions under section \n367(d) upon a transfer of intangible property to a foreign corporation \nare characterized for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation \nrules in the same manner as an actual royalty is characterized. The tax \ntreatment of such a transfer of intangible property to a foreign \ncorporation thus would be the same as the tax treatment that applies if \nthe intangible property is made available to the foreign corporation \nthrough a license arrangement.\n  The bill's provision would be effective for income inclusions under \nsection 367(d) on or after August 5, 1997, which is the effective date \nof the 1997 Act provision eliminating the special deemed U.S. source \nrule under section 367(d). Like the 1997 Act provision, the bill's \nprovision would be effective for transfers made, and for royalties \ndeemed received, on or after August 5, 1997.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1863\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nNurse Corps and recruitment and retention strategies to address the \nnursing shortage, and for other purposes; considered and passed.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Nurse \nReinvestment Act. This bill is a down payment to help address the \nnursing shortage in this country by bringing more people into the \nnursing profession and by retaining nurses. This bill combines the \nNursing Employment and Education Development Act, S. 721, introduced by \nSenator Tim Hutchinson and myself and the Nurse Reinvestment Act, (S. \n1597), introduced by Senators Kerry and Jeffords. We have all worked \ntogether to bring this important legislation before the Senate today.\n  This bill is sorely needed, because we have a nursing shortage. In \nMaryland, 15 percent of the nursing jobs are vacant. Last year, it took \nan average of 68 days to fill a nurse vacancy, and we need about 1,600 \nmore full-time nurses to fill those vacancies. There were 2,000 fewer \nnurses in Maryland in 1999 than there were in 1998. The shortage exists \nacross the United States, and will get worse in the future. Nationwide, \nwe need 1.7 million nurses by the year 2020, but only about 600,000 \nwill be available. The need for this bill was clear at the Subcommittee \non Aging's hearing on the nursing shortgage earlier this year.\n  We depend on nurses every day to care for millions of Americans, \nwhether in a hospital, nursing home, community health center, hospice, \nor through home health. They are the backbone of our health care \nsystem. If we don't effectively address the crisis in nursing, those \nhospitals, nursing homes and clinics will soon be on life support.\n  This bill is a down payment. It doesn't address the fact that nurses \nare underpaid, overworked, and undervalued, but it does focus on \neducation and other important areas. This bill seeks to help bring men \nand women into the nursing profession, and help them to advance within \nit. The bill does this under five major approaches:\n\n[[Page S13947]]\n\n  Creates a National Nurse Service Corps Scholarship Program, which \nprovides scholarships in exchange for at least two years of service in \na critical nursing shortage area or facility\n  Provides grants for outreach at primary and secondary schools; \nscholarships or stipends to nursing students from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds, education programs for students who need assistance with \nmath, science, or other areas; dependent care and transportation \nassistance; establishment of partnerships between schools of nursing \nand health care facilities to improve access to care in underserved \nareas\n  Creates state and national public awareness and education campaigns \nto enhance the image of nursing, promote diversity in the nursing \nworkforce, and encourage people to enter the nursing profession\n  Creates ``career ladder'' programs with schools of nursing and health \ncare facilities to encourage individuals to pursue additional education \nand training to enter and advance within the nursing profession\n  Enables Area Health Education Centers, AHECs, to expand their junior \nand senior high school mentoring programs for nurses and develop \n``models of excellence'' for community-based nurses\n  Trains individuals to provide long-term care to the elderly and \nexpands educational opportunities in gerontological nursing\n  Creates internship and residency programs that encourage mentoring \nand the development of specialties\n  Provides grants to improve workplace conditions, reduce workplace \ninjuries, promote continuing nursing education and career development, \nand establish nurse retention programs\n  Provides scholarships, loans, and stipends for graduate-\nlevel education in nursing in exchange for teaching at an accredited \nschool of nursing, to help ensure that we have enough teachers at our \nnursing schools.\n\n  Creates a National Commission on the Recruitment and Retention of \nNurses to study and make recommendations to the health care community \nand Congress on how to address: the nursing shortage in the long-term, \nnursing recruitment and retention, career advancement within the \nprofession and attracting individuals into the profession.\n  This bill is about nursing education, but it's also about \nempowerment. We can empower people to have a better life and go into a \ncareer to save lives.\n  The bill will empower the single mom who has been working in a \nminimum wage job to forge a better life for herself and her family. It \nwill help her get a scholarship to help pay for tuition, books, and lab \nfees, and by funding child care programs to help her balance work and \nfamily.\n  The bill will empower the nurse who has a baccalaureate degree, but \nwants to get a Master's degree so she can teach nursing at a community \ncollege. It will help her get loans or scholarships and living stipends \nto pursue that degree.\n  This bill will also fund partnerships between schools of nursing and \nhealth care facilities to train individuals who will provide long-term \ncare for the elderly. Our population is aging, more than 70 million \nAmericans will be over age 65 by 2030. This means more people will need \ncare provided by nurses and other individuals specifically trained to \ncare for the unique health needs of older Americans.\n  I look forward to the Senate's speedy passage of this important \nlegislation and to working with our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives to enact a strong bill that gets behind our Nation's \nnurses. I also want to thank Senators Kennedy, Gregg, and Frist for \ntheir hard work in moving this legislation forward, as well as Senators \nLieberman and Clinton for their important contributions to this bill.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am proud to be a lead cosponsor of \nthe legislation we are introducing today to address the critical \nshortage of nurses in our country. After holding two hearings earlier \nthis year to examine the nurse shortage and its impact on our health \ncare delivery system. I introduced S. 721, the Nurse Employment and \nEducation Development Act, NEED Act. This bipartisan legislation seeks \nto encourage individuals to enter the nursing profession, provide \ncontinued education and opportunities for advancement within the \nprofession, and to bolster the number of nurse faculty to teach at our \nnursing schools. Most importantly, its legislation would establish a \nNurse Service Corps, which would provide financial assistance to \nindividuals for nurse education in exchange for 2 years of service in a \nnurse shortage area.\n  The NEED Act won unanimous approval by the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee on November 1, and I am pleased that it \nhas served as the basis for the legislation we are introducing today.\n  The nursing profession is suffering from a serious decline in \npracticing nurses due to a shrinking pipeline. The nursing profession \nas a whole is aging, the average age of Registered Nurses is 43.3 \nyears, while nurses under age 30 comprise less than 10 percent of \ntoday's nurse workforce. Large numbers of nurses are retiring or \nleaving the profession, and only a small number of nurses and nurse \neducators are taking their place. By the year 2020, when millions of \nBaby Boomers will retire, it is projected that nursing needs will be \nunmet by at least 20 percent. For this reason, we need to employ \ninnovative recruitment techniques, including a Nurse Service Corps, \npublic service announcements, and outreach efforts at elementary and \nsecondary schools to promote nursing as a viable, fulfilling career \noption. To address the needs of the elderly, the bill will provide \ngrants for gerontological education and training.\n  Hospitals, nursing homes, community health centers and other health \ncare facilities are desperately seeking nurses to fill vacant positions \nso they can continue to provide safe, quality health care. In Arkansas, \nhospitals have reported over 750 nursing vacancies. To encourage nurses \nto stay and advance within the profession, the nursing bill provides \nfor a career ladder program and encourages hospitals and other \nemployers to develop innovative retention strategies. The bill also \nencourages speciality training and mentors through an internship and \nresidency program, in order to fill the void created by experienced \nnurses leaving the profession.\n  Finally, the bill addresses the critical need for nurse educators. \nThe number of nursing school graduates in Arkansas is at its lowest in \na decade, and nursing students have been turned away because of the \nlack of faculty to teach them. There are approximately four hundred \nnurse faculty vacancies in nursing schools nationwide. Therefore we \ninclude two provisions, a nurse faculty fast-track loan repayment \nprogram and a stipend and scholarship program, both of which provide \nfinancial assistance to masters and doctoral students who will teach at \nan accredited school of nursing for each year of assistance.\n  This has been a team effort. I want to thank Senators Mikulski, \nKerry, and Jeffords for their contributions to this important \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators \nJeffords, Hutchinson and Mikulski in re-introducing the Nurse \nReinvestment Act. This legislation will increase the number of nurses \nin our country, and also ensure that every nurse in the field has the \nskills he or she needs to provide the quality care patients deserve.\n  We are in the midst of a serious nursing workforce shortage. Every \ntype of community, urban, suburban and rural, is touched by it. No \nsector of our health care system is immune to it. Across the country, \nhospitals, nursing homes, home health care agencies and hospices are \nstruggling to find nurses to care for their patients. Patients in \nsearch of care have been denied admission to facilities and told that \nthere were ``no beds'' for them. Often there are beds, just not the \nnurses to care for the patients who would occupy them.\n  Our Naiton has suffered from nursing shortages in the past. However, \nthis shortage is particularly severe because we are losing nurses at \nboth ends of the pipeline. Over the past five years, enrollment in \nentry-level nursing programs has declined by 20 percent. Lured to the \nlucartive jobs of the new economy, high school graduates are not \npursuing careers in nursing in the numbers they once had. Consequently, \nnurses under the age of 30 represent only 10 percent of the current \nworkforce. By 2010, 40 percent of the nursing\n\n[[Page S13948]]\n\nworkforce will be over the age of 50, and nearing retirement. If these \ntrends are not reversed, we stand to lose vast numbers of nurses at the \nsame time that they will be needed to care for the millions of baby \nboomers enrolling in Medicare.\n  The Nurse Reinvestment Act will support the recruitment of new \nstudents into our Nation's nursing programs. The bill will fund \nnational and local public service announcements to enhance the profile \nof the nursing profession and encourage students to commit to a career \nin nursing. Our legislation will also expand school-to-career \npartnerships between health care facilities, nursing colleges, middle \nschools and high schools to show our youth the value of a nursing \ndegree.\n  Our legislation will ensure that barriers to higher education do not \ndissuade Americans who are interested in nursing from pursuing a degree \nin the field. The Nurse Reinvestment Act will support education for \nstudents who need help getting-up to speed on math, science and medical \nEnglish. Our legislation will also ensure that there is support for \nsingle moms and dads with children who need a hand in daycare or a lift \nin getting to their classroom because they are without transportation.\n  Still, is it not enough to simply encourage more individuals to enter \nthe nursing profession, we must also ensure that our schools of nursing \nhave enough professors to teach them. The Nurse Reinvestment Act \nprovides for a fast-track facility development program, which \nencourages master's and doctoral students to rapidly complete their \nstudies through loans and scholarships. Individuals receiving financial \nassistance through the fast-track faculty program must agree to teach \nat an ascredited school of nursing in exchange for this assistance.\n  In addition to recruiting new nurses, our legislation will reinvest \nin nurses who are already practicing by providing them with education \nand training at every step of the career ladder and at every health \ncare facility in which they work. It will ensure that nurses can obtain \nadvanced degrees, from a B.S. in Nursing to a PhD in Nursing. It will \nenable nurses to access the specialty training they require to learn \nhow to treat a specific disease or utilize a new piece of technology. \nOur bill will also help colleges and universities develop curriculum in \ngerontology and long-term care so that nursing students can pursue \nconcentrations, minors and majors in this growing field of health care \nand be ready to apply their knowledge to the current and future senior \npopulation.\n  To assist institutions in providing advanced education and training \nfor nurses across the career ladder, our bill will strengthen the \npartnerships between colleges of nursing and health care facilities. \nGrants will be available to support such initiatives as the teaching of \na course in gerontology in the conference rooms of a hospital or \nnurusing home. Grants will also support the use of distance learning \ntechnology to extend education and training to rural areas, and \nspecialty education and training to all areas.\n  The Nurse Reinvestment Act will authorize, for the first time in \nhistory, a National Nurse Service Corps. Separate from, though modeled \nafter, the National Health Service Corps, the NNSC will administer \nscholarships to students who commit to working in a health care \nfacility that is experiencing a shortage of nurses. In urban, suburban \nand rural communities across the country, where facilities turn away \npatients due to staff shortages, the NNSC will send qualified nurses to \nserve and provide the care that patients deserve.\n  Our country boasts the best health care system in the world. But, \nthat health care system is being jeopardized by the shortage plaguing \nour nursing workforce. Indeed, state-of-the-art medical facilities are \nof no use if their beds go unfilled and their floors remain empty \nbecause the nurses needed to staff them are not available. The Nurse \nReinvestment Act not only seeks to increase the numbers of new nurses \nin our country, but also ensures that all nurses have the skills they \nneed to provide the high quality care that makes our health care system \nthe best in the world.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am especially pleased that the Senate \nis scheduled to consider and vote on the Nurse Reinvestment Act. When \nwe pass this measure, it will represent a good day for the future of \nnursing in America and a good day for the future for patient-care. I \nwant to take this opportunity to tell our colleagues a little about \nthis legislation and to congratulate and complement my fellow Senators \nwho worked so hard to see this effort through. My good friend from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry, was the original sponsor of the Nurse \nReinvestment Act and with me crafted an innovative set of solutions to \nthe nursing shortage problem. Since then, this bill has been \nstrengthened significantly by the inclusion of a complimentary measure \nauthored by my colleagues on the HELP Committee, Senator Hutchinson and \nSenator Mikulski. The measure we are considering today has been \nbenefited by this collaboration.\n  As I have stated before, we are facing a looming crisis in this \ncountry. The size of our nursing workforce remains stagnant, while the \naverage age of the American nurse is on the rise. Over the past five \nyears, enrollment in entry-level nursing programs has declined by 20 \npercent. Nurses under the age of 30 represent only 10 percent of the \ncurrent workforce. By 2010, 40 percent of the nursing workforce will be \nover the age of 50, and nearing retirement. In Vermont we are facing an \neven greater crisis because these numbers are worse. Only 28 percent of \nnurses are under the age of 40 and Vermont schools and colleges are \nproducing 31 percent fewer nurses today than they did just five years \nago.\n  We have a compelling need to encourage more Americans to enter the \nnursing profession and to strengthen it so that more nurses choose to \nstay in the profession. All facets of the health care system will have \na role to play in ensuring a strong nursing workforce. Nurses, \nphysicians, hospitals, nursing homes, academia, community organizations \nand state and federal governments all must accept responsibility and \nwork towards a solution. Part of the responsibility to launch that \neffort begins with us today as we make a decision on the vote for the \nNurse Reinvestment Act.\n  The Nurse Reinvestment Act expands and improves the federal \ngovernment's support of ``pipeline'' programs, which will maintain a \nstrong talent pool and develop a nursing workforce that can address the \nincreasingly diverse needs of America's population. The Nurse \nReinvestment Act provides for a comprehensive public awareness and \neducation campaign on a national, state and local level that will \nbolster the image of the profession, encourage diversity, attract more \nnurses to the workforce, and lead current nurses to take advantage of \ncareer development opportunities.\n  The legislation creates a National Nursing Service Corps Scholarship \nProgram authorized at $40 million that will provide scholarships to \nindividuals to attend nursing schools in exchange for a commitment to \nserve two years in a health facility determined to have a critical \nshortage of nurses. This scholarship program is designed to greatly \nhelp the recruitment of nursing students by providing them tuition, \nother reasonable and necessary educational fees and a monthly stipend \npaid to the student.\n  The Act also authorizes the ``Nurse Recruitment Grant Program'' to \nsupport outreach efforts by nursing schools and other eligible \nhealthcare facilities to inform students in primary, junior and \nsecondary schools of nursing educational opportunities and to attract \nthem to the nursing profession. The grant program provides appropriate \nstudent support services to individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds \nand creates community-based partnerships to recruit nurses in medically \nunderserved rural and urban areas. Further, the ``Area Health Education \nCenters Program'' will award grants to nursing schools that work in \npartnership in the community to develop models of excellence.\n  The ``Career Ladder Programs'' will assist schools of nursing, health \ncare facilities or partnerships of the two to develop programs that \nwill encourage current nursing students in active nurses alike, to \npursue further education and training. This will be achieved through \nscholarships, stipends, career counseling, direct training and distance \nlearning programs.\n\n[[Page S13949]]\n\nAnd, in light of our aging baby-boomer generation, specific grants are \noffered to schools and health care facilities so that they might place \na further emphasis upon encouraging students to study long-term care \nfor the elderly.\n  In addition to the provisions that were included in the original bill \nI co-sponsored with my colleague Senator Kerry, there are provisions \nadded by our colleagues which, I am happy to have included in this \nfinal piece of legislation. Those provisions will provide for the \ndevelopment of internship and residency programs to encourage the \ndevelopment of specialties and student, loan, stipend and scholarship \nprograms for those who would like to seek a masters or doctorate degree \nat a school of nursing. The final bill was also strengthened by \nprovisions added through the efforts of Senator Lieberman and Senator \nClinton.\n  Once again, I want to applaud my colleagues Senator Kerry, Senator \nMikulski and Senator Hutchinson for their tireless work on the Nurse \nReinvestment Act and for the work of their staffs. In particular, I \nwant to recognize the efforts of Kelly Bovio in Senator Kerry,'s \noffice, Kate Hull in Senator Hutchinson's office and Rhonda Richards \nwith Senator Mikulski. This effort was also advanced with the help of \nSarah Bianchi and Jackie Gran who are members of Senator Kennedy's \nstaff, Steve Irizarry with Senator Gregg and Shana Christrup with \nSenator Frist. Finally, in my own office, I want to note the efforts of \nPhilo Hall, Angela Mattie, Eric Silva and Sean Donohue.\n  Adequate health care services cannot survive any further diminishing \nof the nursing workforce. All patients depend on the professional care \nof nurses, and we must make sure it will be there for them. I urged my \ncolleagues to join me and the bill's cosponsors in support of this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the introduction of \na very important bill to address the nursing workforce shortage. At the \nbeginning of November, we reported two different bills from the Senate \nHELP Committee designed to address the nursing shortage in this \ncountry, the Hutchinson-Mikulski ``Nursing Employment and Education \nDevelopment Act'' and the Kerry-Jeffords ``Nursing Reinvestment Act.'' \nI was an original cosponsor of the Hutchinson legislation and a strong \nsupporter of that bill. At that time, I voiced my concern that we are \nmarking up two rather similar proposals to deal with the nursing \nshortage, and I requested that the differences be worked out before the \nbill was discussed on the Senate floor. I am happy today to report the \nthe final reconciliation is complete, and we have a consensus bill that \nfirmly addresses the nursing workforce shortage issue. I thank Senator \nHutchinson for his hard work in ensuring that we could reach this \npoint.\n  We are in the midst of a direct care workforce shortage. Not only are \nfewer people entering and staying in the nursing profession, but we are \nlosing experienced nurses at a time of growing need. Today, nurses are \nneeded in a greater number of settings, such as nursing homes, extended \ncare facilities, community and public health centers, professional \neducation, and ambulatory care facilities. Nationwide, health care \nproviders, ranging from hospitals and nursing homes to home health \nagencies and public health departments, are struggling to find \nqualified nurses to provide safe, efficient, quality care for their \npatients. That's why it is important to have a new Nursing Corps, which \nwill provide scholarships to qualified individuals in exchange for \ndirect care service in a variety of settings as well as to allow others \nto know about the numerous possibilities within the profession by \nauthorizing public service announcements.\n  Though we have faced nursing shortages in the past, this looming \nshortage is particularly troublesome because it reflects two trends \nthat are occurring simultaneously: 1. A shortage of people entering the \nprofession; and 2. The retirement of nurses who have been working in \nthe profession for many years. Over the past five years, enrollment in \nentry-level nursing programs has declined by twenty percent, mirroring \nthe declining awareness of the nursing profession among high school \ngraduates. Consequently, nurses under the age of thirty represent only \nten percent of the current workforce. By 2010, forty percent of the \nnursing workforce will be older than fifty years old and nearing \nretirement. If these trends continue, we stand to lost vast numbers of \nnurses at the very time that they will be needed to care for the \nmillions of baby boomers reaching retirement age. To deal with the \nincreased need for nurses to care for the elderly, this bill has a \nprovision to assist with both the necessary training and educational \ndevelopment of gerontological nurses as well as to strengthen the \nability of nurses to obtain additional training and certification \nthrough the career ladders program.\n  Further, greater efforts must be made to recruit more men and \nminorities to this noble profession. Currently, only ten percent of the \nregistered nurses in the United States are from racial or ethnic \nminority backgrounds, even though these individuals comprise twenty-\neight percent of the total United States population. In 2000, less than \nsix percent of the registered nurses were men. We must work to promote \ndiversity in the workforce, not only to increase the number of \nindividuals within the profession, but also to promote culturally \ncompetent and relevant care. Within the combined nursing shortage bill, \none grant program directly addresses the need to increase funding for \nthe training of minority and disadvantaged students to make it easier \nfor individuals to enter the nursing profession.\n  Even if nursing schools could recruit more students to deal with the \nshortage, many schools could not accommodate higher enrollments because \nof faculty shortages. There are nearly four hundred faculty vacancies \nat nursing schools in this country. And, an even greater faculty \nshortage looms in the next ten to fifteen years as many current nursing \nfaculty approach retirement and fewer nursing students pursue academic \ncareers. Therefore, I strongly support the two provisions to assist \nwith faculty development and training, the fast track nursing faculty \nloan program and the stipend and scholarship program.\n  In addressing these direct care staffing shortages, we must work \ntogether to develop innovative solutions to address this growing issue. \nAs reported in the Memphis Commercial Appeal on May 10, there are steps \nthat Congress can take to increase funding for specific programs and \nreduce regulatory requirements. However, a comprehensive strategy must \nalso include other sectors of the health care system, hospitals, health \ncare professionals, educators, and the general public, to successfully \ndeal with this looming shortage. That's why it is important to also \ninclude a provision to deal with developing retention strategies and \nbest practices in nursing staff management.\n  I am extremely supportive of this legislation, and I want to thank \nSenator Hutchinson again for his hard work in addressing this critical \nissue. I also want to commend my other colleagues, including Senator \nMikulski, for her efforts. Senator Hutchinson clearly has shown \ntremendous leadership in this area. He understands the need to address \nthe nursing shortage issue, and he is largely responsible for getting \nus to this point today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nin introducing the Nurse Reinvestment Act. Our goal in this bipartisan \nlegislation is to do as much as we can to alleviate the nursing \nshortage experienced by health care facilities across the United \nStates. Increasing the number of nurses is an essential part of the \nongoing effort to reduce medical errors, improve patient outcomes, and \nencourage more Americans to become and remain nurses.\n  The Nation's nurses provide care for Americans at the most vulnerable \ntimes in the lives. We must act now to halt the decline in the number \nof nurses. Enrollment in schools of nursing is falling, and the average \nage of the nursing workforce is rising. Across the country, communities \nare losing vast numbers of nurses, just as we need more to care for the \nmillions of aging baby boomers and deal with the many medical \nchallenges facing our hospitals.\n  The current shortage means that too many nurses now have to care for \ntoo many patients at once, undermining the high quality of care that \nnurses want to give, and patients deserve. A\n\n[[Page S13950]]\n\nrecent survey by the American Nurses Association showed that 75 percent \nof nurses believe that the quality of nursing care at their facility \nhas declined. More than half of those surveyed said that the time they \ncan spend with patients has decreased. A nurse in Massachusetts said \nthat she would not go the hospital where she worked, if she needed \ncare.\n  Nationally, the shortfall is expected to rise to 20 percent in the \ncoming years. Yet nurses themselves are already seriously questioning \nthe quality of bedside treatments now being provided on intensive care \nunits, in emergency rooms, and at the bedsides of patients where they \nwork.\n  Their questions are call for help. This legislation can be \nsignificant in strengthening the nursing profession, and responding to \nthe urgent need.\n  The Nurse Reinvestment Act will recruit new students into schools of \nnursing through outreach programs, public awareness and education \ncampaigns, and area health education centers. It establishes a national \nnurse service corps, which will offer scholarships to bring individuals \ninto the profession and place them in medically under-served areas and \nfacilities. The Act expands school-to-career partnerships to show \nyouths the high value and importance of a nursing degree. It invests in \ntoday's nurses by providing education and training at every step of the \ncareer ladder, and by helping them obtain advanced degrees, from a B.S. \nin Nursing to a Ph.D. in Nursing. It includes provisions developed by \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Clinton to help health care facilities \nretain nurses.\n  Our country has the best health care system in the world. But that \nsystem is being jeopardized today by the shortages plaguing the nursing \nworkforce. Even our best medical facilities are in deep trouble if \ntheir beds go unfilled and their floors remain empty because there are \nno nurses to staff them.\n  I commend Senator Mikulski, Senator Kerry, Senator Hutchinson, and \nSenator Jeffords for their leadership in this initiative. Bringing more \nnurses into the profession will help to ensure that nurses are ready \nand able to provide the highest quality of care to their patients. The \nNurse Reinvestment Act is a significant step that Congress can take to \nsupport the Nation's nurses, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor \nof the Nurse Reinvestment Act of 2001. I want to congratulate my \ncolleagues, particularly Senators Mikulski, Hutchinson, Kerry and \nJeffords, for their extraordinary efforts to put together this \nexcellent bill. I also want to thank the Committee for including the \nprovisions of the Lieberman-Ensign ``Hospital Based Nursing Initiative \nAct of 2001'' in the bill.\n  By now, everyone knows that the nation faces a critical shortage of \nnurses. The shortage has already severely impacted states in many areas \nof the country, including Connecticut, and I fear it will jeopardize \nour ability to provide quality health care to patients. A recent report \nby the Government Accounting Office projected that the growing national \nnursing shortage will hit a peak in ten years.\n  While pay is a major factor cited in the report, it is not the \nprimary reason nurses are leaving the profession. The study also cites \npoor or unsafe working conditions, lack of respect from physicians and \npatients, barriers to participation in the hospital administration \ndecision-making process, lack of opportunity to continue their \neducation, and lack of recognition for accomplishments. We must do more \nto attract new people to the nursing profession and retain the quality \nnurses who currently provide us care. The Nurse Reinvestment Act will \ndo just that.\n  I want to take just a minute to talk about the specific provisions \nthat were part of the ``Hospital Based Nursing Initiative Act.'' This \nlegislation contained two proposals to help retain nurses in the \nhospital setting: a competitive grant program that would provide \nfunding to hospitals that actively work to retain their nurses and a \nscholarship program for registered nurses who hold an associates or \ndiploma degree who wish to obtain a bachelor's degree in nursing.\n  As part of the Nurse Reinvestment Act, these incentives have been \nbroadened to apply to the nursing workforce in all health care \nfacilities, providing a critical stimulus for these facilities to \nretain their nurses.\n  While the ominous projections about the growing nursing shortage \nlooms over the health care industry, it is clear that now is the time \nto act. I am encouraged that Congress is acting quickly and decisively \nto actively add to the nurse workforce and to provide critical \nincentives to keep nurses on the job.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1865. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to study \nthe suitability and feasibility of establishing the Lower Los Angeles \nRiver and San Gabriel River watersheds in the State of California as a \nunit of the National Park System, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing today a \nbill that will take an important first step in restoring the San \nGabriel River and Lower LA River, which run through Los Angeles, CA. \nThese two rivers have suffered from years of abuse and neglect. For far \ntoo long, we have channeled, redirected, constricted, polluted, and \nsimply ignored these two rivers. The result is that substantial \nportions of these rivers look nothing like their natural form. Instead \nof soft bottoms covered with aquatic grasses, stream banks lined with \ntrees and bushes, and waters teaming with fish, these rivers have \ncement bottoms, cement banks, and little remaining wildlife.\n  Today, we begin what will be a long, slow process in turning the tide \nfor these two urban waterways. This bill directs the Secretary of \nInterior to conduct a study of the suitability and feasibility of \nprotecting and restoring these two rivers by making them a part of our \nnational park system. The long term vision I have is to see these \nrivers restored to a more natural state so that they can be a home to \nsouthern California's unique fish and wildlife.\n  Just as important to me is that these rivers be restored so they can \nserve as a source of outdoor recreation for one of our Nation's most \ncongested urban areas. Most communities in Los Angeles are desperate \nfor open space. They seek outdoor areas where children can play, adults \ncan meet, and people of all ages can find respite from the daily hustle \nand bustle of some of our most economically and socially stressed \nneighborhoods.\n  What I am proposing would be an unprecedented urban restoration \neffort. But that does not mean it is impossible. Far from it. This \nvision is shared by Congresswoman Hilda Solis, who first introduced \nthis bill in the House of Representatives. I look forward to working \nhand in hand with her to ensure that this dream becomes a reality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1865\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lower Los Angeles River and \n     San Gabriel River Watersheds Study Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (2) Watershed.--The term ``watershed'' means--\n       (A) the Lower Los Angeles River and its tributaries below \n     the confluence of the Arroyo Seco;\n       (B) the San Gabriel River and its tributaries in Los \n     Angeles County and Orange County, California; and\n       (C) the San Gabriel Mountains located within the territory \n     of the San Gabriel and Lower Los Angeles Rivers and Mountains \n     Conservancy (as defined in section 32603(c)(1)(C) of the \n     State of California Public Resource Code).\n\n     SEC. 3.

REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Resources \n     of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources of the Senate a report on the findings, \n     conclusions, and recommendations of the study required by \n     section 3(a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 1867. A bill to establish the National Commission on Terrorist \nAttacks Upon the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce with my colleague \nSenator McCain legislation to establish the National Commission on \nTerrorist Attacks Upon the United States. This Commission will have a \nbroad mandate to examine and report upon the facts and causes relating \nto the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks occurring at the World \nTrade Center and at the Pentagon, and it will be charged with making a \n``full and complete accounting of the circumstances surrounding the \nattacks, and the extent of the United States' preparedness for, and \nresponse to, the attacks.'' It will ``investigate and report to the \nPresident and Congress on its findings, conclusions, and \nrecommendations for corrective measures that can be taken to prevent \nacts of terrorism.''\n  Certain events stand out in our history for having left an indelible \nmark of pain and sorrow on America. The infamous attack on Pearl Harbor \nnot only roused a slumbering giant, but also raised difficult questions \nabout why our great Navy had been caught unawares. The tragic \nassassination of President John F. Kennedy evoked powerful feelings of \nsorrow and loss, but also searching questions about the identity and \nmotives of the assassin. And on this past September 11, the United \nStates suffered assaults on its territory unparalleled in their \ncruelty, destruction and loss of life. Americans were stunned both by \nthe magnitude of the loss and the maliciously simple plan that had \ncaused the carnage. Here too, alongside their grief and rage, the \nAmerican people have been asking questions: Why was this plan so \nsuccessful in achieving its evil goals? Were opportunities missed to \nprevent the destruction? What additional steps should be taken now to \nprevent any future attacks?\n  In the immediate aftermath of both Pearl Harbor and the Kennedy \nassassination, special commissions were formed to conduct \ninvestigations and answer similar questions. These precedents provide \nus with important models as we seek answers to such questions, and then \nuse the findings to move forward with strategies to respond to the \nscourge of terrorism. Like many of my constituents, I too want to know \nhow September 11 happened, why it happened, and what corrective \nmeasures can be taken to prevent it from ever occurring again. The \nAmerican people deserve answers to these very legitimate questions \nabout how the terrorists succeeded in achieving their brutal \nobjectives, and in so doing, forever changing the way in which we \nAmericans lead our lives.\n  To be successful, this Commission must have a number of resources, \nincluding enough time, a top level staff, ample investigatory powers, \nand adequate funding, all of which we have provided for in this \nlegislation. But most critically, it must have broad bipartisan \nsupport. This Commission must not become a witch-hunt. The events of \nSeptember 11 were so cataclysmic that there is enough responsibility to \nbe shouldered by multiple parties. The overriding purpose of the \ninquiry must be a learning exercise, to understand what happened \nwithout preconceptions about its ultimate findings.\n  Just as Presidents Roosevelt and Johnson turned to national leaders \nof their day, Justice Roberts and Chief Justice Warren, to spearhead \nthe Pearl Harbor and Kennedy assassination inquiries, respectively, \nthis Commission must also draw upon the great reservoir of bipartisan \ntalent that our nation possesses to answer crucial and fundamental \nquestions. We expect that members appointed to this blue-ribbon \nCommission will be prominent U.S. citizens, though not currently \nserving in public office, with ``national recognition and significant \ndepth of experience in such professions as governmental service, law \nenforcement, the armed services, legal practice, public administration, \nintelligence gathering, commerce, including aviation matters, and \nforeign affairs.''\n\n  To help ensure that members of the Commission will possess some of \nthese substantive areas of expertise, which are so critical to \nunderstanding and analyzing the events of September 11, 10 of its 14 \nmembers will be appointed by the Senate and House chairmen, in \nconsultation with their ranking minority members, of the Congressional \ncommittees that oversee Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, Armed Services, \nJudiciary, and Commerce. President Bush will appoint the four remaining \nmembers of the Commission, including the Chairman, who in turn will \nappoint the staff. In an effort to mandate bipartisanship, or perhaps \nmore accurately, non-partisanship, no more than 7 of the Commission's \n14 members may be from one political party.\n  Though some of the Commission's recommendations may include \n``proposing organization, coordination, planning, management \narrangements, procedures, rules, and regulations,'' we cannot wait for \nthe findings of this report to begin the process of strengthening our \nNation's homeland defense. That process, of course, is already \nunderway, and must continue to occur at a rapid pace to ensure the \ncontinued protection of American lives and property. This Commission \nwill not issue its first report until six months after its first \nmeeting, and its final report will be issued another year after that. \nRather than wait for these reports to be researched and submitted, we \nmust continue the process we have already started to pro-actively \naddress vulnerabilities that undermine our daily safety. We have \nalready received the valuable input of numerous other experts and \nCommissions, some of which even issued their prescient warnings before \nthe events of September, such as the Hart-Rudman Commission. When this \nproposed Commission completes its investigation and makes its final \nrecommendations, those suggestions and conclusions will augment the \nrecord we have already developed on ways we can continue to safeguard \nour nation.\n  The Commission is not only the right thing to do, but this is the \nright time to do it. Understandably, the initial months after September \n11 were preoccupied first with mourning, and then with prosecution of \nthe war. There were legitimate concerns that a robust investigation \ninto the causes of September 11 would siphon resources from the ongoing \nwar effort. But with the first stage of the war against terrorism now \ndrawing to a close, and with many perplexing questions still before us, \nwe must now begin in earnest the process of finding answers to how it \nhappened. This Commission should not be at odds with the war effort of \nany federal agency; rather, its efforts will complement the internal \nreview processes some agencies are undergoing.\n  Determining the causes and circumstances of the terrorist attacks \nwill ensure that those who lost their lives on this second American \n``day of infamy'' did not die in vain. In so doing, this Commission \nwill not only pay tribute to those who perished, but it will ensure \nthat their survivors, and all the citizens of this great nation, \ncontinue to live life secure in the knowledge that the U.S. government \nis doing all within its powers to preserve their lives, liberties, and \npursuits of happiness.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1867\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.\n\n       There is established the National Commission on Terrorist \n     Attacks Upon the United States (in this Act referred to as \n     the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. 2.

Eight members of the Commission \n     shall constitute a quorum.

FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION.\n\n       The functions of the Commission are to--\n       (1) conduct an investigation into relevant facts and \n     circumstances relating to the terrorist attacks of September \n     11, 2001, including any relevant legislation, Executive \n     order, regulation, plan, practice, or procedure;\n       (2) review and evaluate the lessons learned from the \n     terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 regarding the \n     structure, coordination, and management arrangements of the \n     Federal Government relative to detecting, preventing, and \n     responding to such terrorist attacks; and\n       (3) submit to the President and Congress such reports as \n     are required by this Act containing such findings, \n     conclusions, and recommendations as the Commission shall \n     determine, including proposing organization, coordination, \n     planning, management arrangements, procedures, rules, and \n     regulations.\n\n     SEC. 5.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Commission \n     to carry out this Act $3,000,000, to remain available until \n     expended.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend Joe \nLieberman in introducing legislation calling for a blue-ribbon \ncommission to examine the facts surrounding the September 11th attacks, \nand to propose reforms to better defend our country in the future.\n  After Pearl Harbor and President Kennedy's assassination, the \nPresident and Congress established boards of inquiry to investigate \nthese tragedies and recommend measures to prevent their recurrence.\n  The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington represent a \nwatershed in American history--the end of an era of general peace and \nprosperity, and a terrible awakening to the threats against our people \nthat lurk within, and beyond, our shores.\n  To prevent future tragedies, we need to know how September 11th could \nhave happened, and explore what we can do to be sure America never \nagain suffers such an attack on her soil.\n  I believe President Bush and his team have responded forcefully, \nadmirably, and with a sense of purpose in this time of trial. But \nneither the Administration nor Congress is capable of conducting a \nthorough, nonpartisan, independent inquiry into what happened on \nSeptember 11th, or to propose far-reaching reforms needed to protect \nour people and our institutions against the enemies of freedom.\n  As we did after Pearl Harbor and the Kennedy assassination, we need a \nblue-ribbon team of distinguished Americans from all walks of life to \nthoroughly investigate all evidence surrounding the attacks, including \nhow prepared we were and how well we responded to this unprecedented \nassault.\n  It will require digging deep into the resources of the full range of \ngovernment agencies. It will demand objective judgment into what went \nwrong, what we did right, and what else we need to do to deter and \ndefeat depraved assaults against innocent lives in the future.\n  This is no witch hunt. Our enemies would be strengthened if their \nattacks caused us to turn on ourselves, consumed not with the \nmalevolence of our foes but with our own failings.\n  We are a proud nation, a strong nation. However horrible, September \n11th reminded us of our love of country, our fierce patriotic pride. It \nhighlighted the distinctive accomplishments of our civilization, and \nthe sacrifices we will endure to defend it against evil. It made us \nstronger.\n  That said, if there were serious failures on the part of individuals \nor institutions within the government or the private sector, we have a \nright to know, indeed a need to know. But to work, this must be a \nlearning exercise, without preconceptions about the inquiry's ultimate \nfindings.\n  The commission's members should include leading citizens not now \nholding public office, but with broad experience in national affairs. \nThe commission should have an adequate budget, a top-level staff, and \nample investigatory resources--including subpoena power, if it is \nneeded to uncover the truth.\n  To be effective and legitimate, the commission should be given a \nbroad mandate to discover facts and recommend corrective actions. It \nshould be given time to proceed with care and deliberation. It should \nhave the stature and significance afforded by its grave mission of \ntelling the whole truth about September 11th, and telling us what we \nneed to know to protect against future tragedy.\n  To be credible, this inquiry must be independent from ongoing \ngovernment operations, but it must of necessity draw on the resources \nof government. The commission's conclusions and recommendations will \nhave enduring meaning only if they are valued by those of us who can \nset them in motion--the President, the Congress, and all concerned \nAmericans.\n  Our best defense now lies in pursuing our enemy overseas, and working \nhere at home to adapt to the challenges of this new day. We can rid the \nworld of terrorism's scourge. But it will take time, and our campaign \nwill likely inspire further, desperate tests of our resolve.\n  More Americans may die before we are through. In this moment when we \nenjoy peace at home, even as brave Americans risk their lives for us \noverseas, let us marshal our resolve to defend our homeland, not merely \nthrough force of arms, but through reasoned introspection into how \nSeptember 11th happened, what we've learned, and how we can apply those \nlessons to the defense of the American people.\n  More than 2 years ago, the bipartisan Hart-Rudman Commission on \nNational Security envisioned a time when terrorists and rogue nations \nwould acquire weapons of mass destruction and ``mass disruption.''\n  ``Americans will likely die on American soil,'' the commission \nwarned, ``possibly in large numbers.''\n  That time has come. The worst has happened. But it must not happen \nagain. We hope history will judge America well for her response to \nSeptember 11th--the incredible bravery of so many Americans, and the \nmeasures we have already put in place to prevent future acts of \ncatastrophic terrorism.\n  The commission is an integral part of our response to the attacks of \nSeptember 11. Its mission is urgent. The American people clearly share \nour sense of urgency about protecting our country. I hope our proposed \ncommission can channel that sense of urgency into a mandate for reform \nof the way we defend America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 1868. A bill to establish a national center on volunteer and \nprovider screening to reduce sexual and other abuse of children, the \nelderly, and individuals with disabilities; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nChild Protection Improvement Act of 2001.\n  Today, 87 million of our children are involved in provided by child \nand youth organizations which depend heavily on volunteers to deliver \ntheir services. Millions more adults are also served by public and \nprivate voluntary organizations. Organizations across the country, like \nthe Boys and Girls Clubs, often rely solely on volunteers to make these \nsafe havens for kids a place where they can learn. The Boys and Girls \nClubs and others don't just provide services to kids, their work \nreverberates throughout our communities, as the after-school programs \nthey provide help keep kids out of trouble. This is juvenile crime \nprevention at its best, and I salute the volunteers who help make these \nprograms work.\n  Unfortunately, some of these volunteers come to their jobs with less \nthan the best of intentions. According to the National Mentoring \nPartnership, incidents of child sexual abuse in child care settings, \nfoster homes and schools ranges from 1 to 7 percent. Volunteer \norganizations have tried to weed out bad apples, and today most conduct \nbackground checks on applicants who seek to work with children. \nUnfortunately, these checks can often take months to complete, can be \nexpensive, and many organizations do not have access to the FBI's \nnational fingerprint\n\n[[Page S13954]]\n\ndatabase. These time delays and scope limitations are dangerous: a \nprospective volunteer could pass a name-based background check in one \nstate, only to have a past felony committed in another jurisdiction go \nundetected.\n  Today I am introducing a bill designed to solve some of these \nproblems. The National Child Protection Improvement Act of 2001 creates \na new, FBI national center to conduct criminal history fingerprint \nchecks at the request of volunteer organizations. Funds are authorized \nso that volunteer organizations could have the national checks \nperformed at no cost to them, the Federal government ought to be \nsupporting those groups who seek to safeguard our kids, and this is a \nmodest investment that deserves to be made. Other child-serving \norganizations who sought the services of the new national center would \nhave checks conducted at a minimal cost. My bill envisions as many as \n10 million background checks conducted per year at this center, enough \nto prevent felons and other dangerous members of society from getting \nanywhere near our kids. States perform many of these checks today, so \nto help them do their jobs better my bill authorizes $5 million per \nyear to hire personnel and improve fingerprint technology so that they \ncan update information in national databases.\n  All of us understand the positive impact that volunteer organizations \nare making. Now we need to give these groups the tools and resources \nthey need to ensure absolute safety for the children they serve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1868\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to establish an inventory, \nregistry, and information system of United States greenhouse gas \nemissions to inform the public and private sector concerning, and \nencourage voluntary reductions in, greenhouse emissions; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nrepresents an important step towards the goal of addressing the threats \nposed by global climate change. I am pleased to be joined on this bill \nby Senator Jeffords and Senator Lieberman. They are recognized \nenvironmental leaders in the Senate, and are long-standing, outspoken \nadvocates for taking action to mitigate climate change. I appreciate \ntheir help in introducing this legislation today.\n  Climate change is an enormously complex issue in every aspect. \nScientifically. Economically. Politically. But complexity is no excuse \nfor inattention or inaction. Because the health and viability of the \nglobal ecosystems upon which we all depend are at stake. The time to \nact is now.\n  Earlier this year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \nrecently released its Third Assessment Report, and the science is \nincreasingly clear and alarming. We know that human activities, \nprimarily fossil fuel combustion, have raised the atmospheric \nconcentration of carbon dioxide to the highest levels in the last \n420,000 years. We know that the planet is warming, and that the balance \nof the scientific evidence suggests that most of the recent warming can \nbe attributed to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. We know \nthat without concerted action by the U.S. and other countries, \ngreenhouse gases will continue to increase.\n  Finally, we know that climate models have improved, and that these \nmodels predict warming under all scenarios that have been considered. \nEven the smallest warming predicted by current models, 2.5 degrees \nFahrenheit over the next century, would represent the greatest rate of \nincrease in global mean surface temperature in the last 10,000 years.\n  If these trends continue, the results may be devastating. People in \nmy home State of New Jersey treasure their Jersey Shore. Like all \ncoastal areas, the Jersey Shore is threatened by projected changes in \nsea levels due to climate change. I am concerned about this impact. And \nI am concerned about other climate change impacts across New Jersey, \nthe country and the globe.\n  I believe we need to take reasonable steps today start dealing with \nthis issue. And I think this bill will make an important incremental \nstep.\n  The main provisions of the bill establish a system that would require \ncompanies to estimate and report their emissions of greenhouse gases, \nas well\n\n[[Page S13956]]\n\nas a place where companies can register greenhouse gas emissions \nreductions. In addition, the bill would require an annual report on \nU.S. greenhouse gas emissions. I'd like to go through each of these \ncomponents in more detail.\n  First, the bill requires EPA to work with the Secretaries of Energy, \nCommerce and Agriculture, as well as the private sector and non-\ngovernmental organizations to establish a greenhouse gas emission \ninformation system. For the purposes of the bill, greenhouse gases are \ncarbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, \nperfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. EPA is directed to establish \nthreshold quantities for each of these gases. The threshold quantities \nwill trigger the requirement for a company to report to the system, and \nare included to enable exclusion of most small businesses from the \nreporting requirements. Companies that emit more than a threshold \nquantity of each gas will be required to report their emissions on an \nannual basis to EPA. The requirements will be phased in, beginning with \nstationary source emissions in 2003. The following year, in 2004, \ncompanies subject to the reporting requirements will need to submit to \nEPA estimates of other types of greenhouse gas emissions, such as \nprocess emissions, fugitive emissions, mobile source emissions, forest \nproduct-sector emissions, and indirect emissions from heat and steam.\n  Just as important as the reporting system is the greenhouse gas \nregistry established by the bill. The bill requires EPA to work with \nthe same set of actors to establish this greenhouse gas registry, which \nwill enable companies to register greenhouse gas reductions. Many \ncompanies are voluntarily implementing projects to reduce emissions or \nsequester carbon. The registry would establish a place for companies to \nbe able to put these projects on public record in a consistent and \nreliable way.\n  Taken together, these provisions of the bill will accomplish several \nimportant goals. First, they will create a reliable record of the \nsources of greenhouse gas emissions within our economy. This will \nprovide the public and private sector with important information that, \nif necessary, can be used to identify the most cost-effective ways to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Perhaps more importantly, these provisions will provide a powerful \nincentive for companies to continue to make voluntary greenhouse gas \nreductions. By requiring emissions reporting, and making that \ninformation available to the public, companies may face increased \nscrutiny with respect to their greenhouse gas emissions. But they will \nalso have a place where they can register their greenhouse gas \nreductions project in a consistent and uniform way. This will enable \ncompanies to demonstrate the actions that they are taking to reduce \ntheir emissions, and will assist them in making the case for credits if \na mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction program is ever enacted.\n  Finally, the bill requires EPA to annually publish a greenhouse gas \nemissions inventory. This will be a national account of greenhouse gas \nemissions for our Nation, and will incorporate the information \nsubmitted to the greenhouse gas information system and registry. EPA \nhas issued such a report for several years now, and this provision is \nintended to explicitly authorize and expand the scope of this report.\n  I know that there are technical challenges associated with measuring \ngreenhouse gas emissions and reductions. But many advances have been \nmade in recent years, often in a cooperative way, with industry, \nenvironmental groups and governments at the table. It's my intent that \nthe systems and protocols developed under this bill conform to the best \npractices that have been and continue to be developed in this fashion.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in this legislation. Let's start \ntaking reasonable steps to address the threat of climate change. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1870\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Greenhouse Gas \n     Emissions Inventory and Registry Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) human activities have caused rapid increases in \n     atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other \n     greenhouse gases in the last century;\n       (2) according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n     Change and the National Research Council--\n       (A) the Earth has warmed in the last century; and\n       (B) the majority of the observed warming is attributable to \n     human activities;\n       (3) despite the fact that many uncertainties in climate \n     science remain, the potential impacts from human-induced \n     climate change pose a substantial risk that should be managed \n     in a responsible manner; and\n       (4) to begin to manage climate change risks, public and \n     private entities will need a comprehensive, accurate \n     inventory, registry, and information system of the sources \n     and quantities of United States greenhouse gas emissions.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     mandatory greenhouse gas inventory, registry, and information \n     system that--\n       (1) is complete, consistent, transparent, and accurate;\n       (2) will create accurate data that can be used by public \n     and private entities to design efficient and effective \n     greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies; and\n       (3) will encourage greenhouse gas emission reductions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, we are now near the end of the first \nsession of the 107th Congress. It has been an exceedingly long and \ndifficult year. There have been many changes, surprises and tragedies.\n  One politically significant event that particularly dismayed me was \nthe President's modification of his campaign pledge to reduce emissions \nof four major pollutants, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and \ncarbon dioxide, emitted by power plants. In March, he wrote to several \nSenators telling them he would no longer support mandatory emissions \nreductions for carbon dioxide, an important greenhouse gas. This struck \nme as a return to a 1950s-style energy and environmental policy.\n  On a more optimistic role, however, that reversal and the \nadministration's unilateral withdrawal and disengagement from the \ninternational negotiations to implement the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol has created more \ninterest and activity on this matter than ever on Capitol Hill and in \nthe media.\n  Now, many Members are asking themselves whether Congress should just \nproceed without the Administration. In fact, the Daschle-Bingaman \nenergy legislation contains a significant climate change title that \ndoes just that. This subject will contain to receive a great deal of \nattention in the Environment and Public Works Committee and elsewhere \nas we try to implement through statute our existing national commitment \nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels.\n  Today, I am joining with Senators Corzine and Lieberman in \nintroducing a bill to amend the Clean Air Act to require reporting of \ngreenhouse gas emissions from major sources and to create a voluntary \nregistry for those sources to document their emissions reduction \nefforts. This new system will be maintained and operated by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, which has the greatest Federal agency \nexperience and capability in monitoring enforcing and tracking air \nemissions. The information generated by this system will be of great \nassistance in developing a national trading system in carbon emission \ncredits. The U.S. is a global leader in the creation and operation of \nsuch systems and must not lag behind doors in the international \ncommunity.\n  We have been waiting some time for the Administration to make known \nthe results of its climate change policy review and for a constructive \nmulti-pollutant legislative proposal. There is no question that the \nterrible events of September 11, have had a devastating effect on our \ncitizenry and the government. But, we are a great nation and the \nFederal Government must be capable of working on a variety of domestic \nand international fronts, even in the face of great adversity. There \nare few, if any, environmental issues more compelling than global \nwarming and its effects.\n  As many Senators may recall, Congress and the previous Bush \nAdministration worked together and were very productive during the Gulf \nWar on many pieces of environmental legislation, not the least of which \nwas the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. That was a different time, \nbut that situation demonstrates that given the right level of attention \nand resources, we can accomplish a great deal working together even \nunder stressful circumstances.\n  The Administration's unilateral approach to this important subject is \npuzzling. The U.S. is responsible for approximately 25 percent of the \ntotal carbon loading to the atmosphere. This man-made pollution is \nleading to a warming of the entire planet through the greenhouse \neffect, according to the National Academy of Sciences. Surely, we \nshould do our share to reduce these emissions to protect our \nenvironmental and economy, and our global neighbors. That is the most \ncertain way to protect our long-term interests and reduce the impacts \nof proceeding with business as usual.\n  We have asked a great deal of our friends across the globe as part of \nour\n\n[[Page S13959]]\n\nresponse to terrorism, particularly of our friends in the European \nUnion. We must not forget that they too have an agenda for the \ninternational community and that agenda includes concerted action on \nclimate change. Ignoring that agenda for too long may create \nunnecessary trade and tariff barrier problems for U.S. goods and \nservices. Already, the pending adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in \nEuropean Union countries and elsewhere poses, complex accounting and \ntrade issues for U.S. multi-nationals operating in Annex I countries.\n  The Administration's silence on this clearly growing problem is also \npuzzling. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric and the World \nMeteorological Organization say that 2001 will be the second warmest \nyear on record since records have been kept in the mid-1800s. Recently, \nthe Washington Post reported on the New England Regional Assessment of \nthe Potential Consequence of Climate Variability and Change.\n  The Assessment, which is one of the many regional assessments being \nconducted pursuant to the Global Change Research Act of 1990, found \nthat the Northeast's climate is likely to become hotter and more flood-\nprone. The region may see a 6-9 degrees fahrenheit overall temperature \nincrease over the next 100 hundreds due to the global warming caused by \ngreenhouse gas emissions. This would cause sugar maples to disappear \nfrom Vermont forests, threaten coastal areas with rising sea levels, \nexacerbate existing air pollution problems and harm cold-weather-\ndependent industries like skiing.\n  There are varying claims about the economic effects related to global \nwarming and climate change. Effects that will occur beyond the normal \neconomic forecasting period are difficult to determine. But, some \nstudies have suggested that when a doubling of atmospheric \nCO2 occurs, sometime in the next 50-70 years according to \nmost models, the cost to the U.S. economy could be between 0.3 percent-\n6 percent of GDP in 2000 dollars. While the nature of the exact impacts \nof climate change on forestry, construction, hydropower, and \nagriculture are disputed, most sectors will see losses, according to \nstudies for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, \nPennsylvania Academy of Science, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Yale University, Pew Center on \nGlobal Climate Change, and the Institute for International Economics.\n\n  These effects can be lessened by purposeful and strong leadership in \nthe Congress and the White House. We have the technological ability to \nrevolutionize our use of fossil fuels through efficiency and process \nchanges, and to radically increase our production of renewable energy \nin all forms. These steps can dramatically and cost-effectively reduce \ncarbon emissions in the near term, according to studies done by the \nDepartment of Energy and various think-tanks. However, we must do \nsomething soon to stimulate that revolution.\n  Providing information on waste generation and release into the \nenvironment has been a great success of the Toxic Release Inventory. \nEducating the public and the market about wasteful behavior has \nstimulated major emissions reductions. The bill we are introducing \ntoday should be similarly successful in promoting innovation and \nefficiency in all major carbon emitting sectors, in addition to \npreparing the appropriate infrastructure for a national carbon credit \ntrading system.\n  Early in the next session, the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee will mark up S. 556, the Clean Power Act, which requires \nreductions in greenhouse gas emission from the power generating sector. \nThat sector's emissions have risen approximately 26 percent above 1990 \nlevels and are expected to grow 1.8 percent annually without some \nFederal action. This is well beyond our international treaty \ncommitments on a sector basis. The majority of those facilities are \nalready required to report their carbon dioxide emissions to EPA.\n  I am hopeful that we can proceed with a tri-partisan, consensual \nmarkup of the Clean Power Act. But, two elements may preclude our \nability to achieve some agreement. First, the Administration may go \nforward with proposals to modify the New Source Review, NSR, program. \nThis possibility gravely concerns me and other Members of the \nCommittee, given the lack of transparency in the Administration's \nproceedings on the pending NSR enforcement actions and the \n``consistency'' review by the Department of Justice. And, second, \nperhaps more importantly, there is a distinct lack of constructive \nengagement with the Committee on a multi-pollutant bill or any clear \nprogress on an Administration proposal.\n  Next year promises to be very busy in the energy and environmental \npolicy arena. We cannot afford to simply recreate the debates that \noccurred during the Energy Policy Act of 1992. We know the world to be \na much different place now and fraught with greater and more complex \ndangers like global warming. It would be irresponsible in the extreme \nfor Congress or the White House to take actions that increase, rather \nthan decrease, the likelihood of those dangers.\n  I look forward to working with the Administration and my colleagues \non a variety of actions to make progress in adapting to the climate \nchange we have already caused and on reducing greenhouse gas emissions \nto prevent greater future damage that our great-grandchildren will have \nto face.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the article to which I referred in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 17, 2001]\n\n                     Northeast Seen Getting Balmier\n\n                          (By Michael Powell)\n\n       New York.--New England's maple trees stop producing sap. \n     The Long Island and Cape Cod beaches shrink and shift, and \n     disappear in places. Cases of heatstroke triple.\n       And every 10 years or so, a winter storm floods portions of \n     Lower Manhattan, Jersey city and Coney Island with seawater.\n       The Northeast of recent historical memory could disappear \n     this century, replaced by a hotter and more flood-prone \n     region where New York could have the climate of Miami and \n     Boston could become as sticky as Atlanta, according to the \n     first comprehensive federal studies of the possible effects \n     of global warming on the Northeast.\n       ``In the most optimistic projection, we will end up with a \n     six- to nine-degree increase in temperature,'' said George \n     Hurtt, a University of New Hampshire scientist and co-author \n     of the study on the New England region. ``That's the greatest \n     increase in temperature at any time since the last Ice Age.''\n       Commissioned by Congress, the separate reports on New \n     England and the New York region explore how global warming \n     could affect the coastline, economy and public health of the \n     Northeast. The language is often technical, the projections \n     reliant on middle-of-the-road and sometimes contradictory \n     predictive models.\n       But the predications are arresting.\n       New England, where the regional character was forged by \n     cold and long, dark winters, could face a balmy future that \n     within 30 to 40 years could result in increased crop \n     production but also destroy prominent native tree species.\n       ``The brilliant reds, oranges and yellows of the maples, \n     birches and beeches may be replaced by the browns and dull \n     greens of oaks,'' the New England report concludes. Within 20 \n     years, it says, ``the changes in climate could potentially \n     extirpate the sugar maple industry in New England.''\n       The reports' origins date to 1990, when Congress passed the \n     Global Change Research Act. Seven years later, the \n     Environmental Protection Agency appointed 16 regional panels \n     to examine global warming, and how the nation might adapt. \n     These Northeast reports, completed about two months ago, are \n     among the last to be released. (The mid-Atlantic report, \n     which includes Washington, was completed a year go.)\n       The scientists on the panels employed conventional \n     assumptions, such as an annual 1 percent increase in \n     greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. They conclude that global \n     warming is already occurring, noting that, on average, the \n     Northeast became two degrees warmer in the past century. And \n     they say that the temperature rise in the 21st century ``will \n     be significantly larger than in the 20th century.'' One \n     widely used climate model cited in the report predicted a \n     six-degree increase, the other 10 degrees.\n       The Environmental Protection Agency summarizes the findings \n     on its Web site.\n       ``Changing regional climate could alter forests, crop \n     yields, and water supplies,'' the EPA states. ``It could also \n     threaten human health, and harm birds, fish, and many types \n     of ecosystems.''\n       Yale economist Robert O. Mendelsohn is more skeptical. He \n     agrees that mild global warming seems likely to continue--but \n     argues that a slightly hotter climate will make the U.S. \n     economy in general, and the Northeast in particular, more \n     rather than less productive. A greater risk comes from \n     spending billions of dollars to slow emissions of greenhouse \n     gases.\n       ``Even in the extreme scenarios, the northern United States \n     benefits from global\n\n[[Page S13960]]\n\n     warming,'' said Mendelsohn, editor of the forthcoming \n     ``Global Warming and the American Economy.'' ``To have New \n     England lead the battle against global warming would be \n     deeply ironic, because it will be beneficial to our \n     climate and economy.''\n       The scientists on the Northeastern panels estimated that \n     Americans have a grace period of a decade or two, during \n     which the nation can adapt before global warming accelerates.\n       ``We will face an increasingly hazardous local environment \n     in this century,'' said William Solecki, a professor of \n     geography at Montclair State University in New Jersey and a \n     co-author of the climate change report covering the New York \n     metropolitan region. ``We're in transition right now to \n     something entirely new and uncertain.''\n\n\n                              heat island\n\n       New York City, the nation's densest urban center, is \n     armored with heat-retaining concrete and stone, and so its \n     median temperature hovers five to six degrees above the \n     regional norm. The city, the New York report predicts, will \n     grow warmer still. Within 70 years, New York will have as \n     many 90-degree days a year as Miami does now.\n       If temperatures and ozone levels rise, the report says, the \n     poor, the elderly and the young--especially those in crowded, \n     poorly ventilated buildings--could suffer more heatstroke and \n     asthma.\n       But such problems might have relatively inexpensive \n     solutions, from subsidizing the purchase of air conditioners \n     to planting trees and painting roofs light colors to reflect \n     back heat.\n       ``The experience of southern cities is that you can cut \n     deaths and adapt rather easily,'' said Patrick Kinney of the \n     Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, who \n     authored a section of the report.\n       Rising ocean waters present a more complicated threat. The \n     seas around New York have risen 15 to 18 inches in the past \n     century, and scientists forecast that by 2050, waters could \n     rise an additional 10 to 20 inches.\n       By 2080, storms with 25-foot surges could hit New York \n     every three or four years, inundating the Hudson River \n     tunnels and flooding the edges of the financial district, \n     causing billions of dollars in damage.\n       ``This clearly is untenable,'' said Klaus Jacob, a senior \n     research scientist with Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty \n     Earth Observatory, who worked on the New York report and is \n     an expert on disaster and urban infrastructure. ``A world-\n     class city cannot afford to be exposed to such a threat so \n     often.''\n       Jacob recommends constructing dikes and reinforced seawalls \n     in Lower Manhattan, and new construction standards for the \n     lower floors of offices.\n       Sea-level rise could reshape the entire Northeast \n     coastline, turning the summer retreats of the Hamptons and \n     Cape Cod into landscapes defined by dikes and houses on \n     stilts. Should this come to pass, government would have to \n     decide whether to allow nature to have its way, or to spend \n     vast sums of money to replenish beaches and dunes. \n     Complicating the issue is the fact that some wealthy coastal \n     communities exclude non-resident taxpayers from their \n     beaches.\n       ``Multimillionaires already are armoring their property \n     with sandbags, but they can't do it on their own,'' said \n     Vivian Gornitz of Columbia's Center for Climate Systems \n     Research, author of the report's section on sea rise. ``You \n     would be asking taxpayers to pay for restoring beaches they \n     can never walk on, and they might demand access.''\n\n\n                            mild new england\n\n       Farther north, global warming could change flora and fauna, \n     and perhaps the culture itself.\n       Compared with a century ago, the report notes, ice melts a \n     week earlier on northern lakes. Ticks carrying Lyme disease \n     range north of what scientists once assumed was their natural \n     habitat. Moist, warm winters have led to large populations of \n     mosquitoes, with an accompanying risk of encephalitis and \n     even malaria.\n       ``The present warming trend has led to another growing \n     health problem,'' the report states, ``in the incidence of \n     red tides, fish kills and bacterial contamination.''\n       Hot, dry summer months, the report continues, ``are ideal \n     for converting automobile exhaust . . . into ozone.'' Because \n     winds flow west to east, New England already serves as \n     something of a tailpipe for the nation. The report notes that \n     a study of ozone pollution and lung capacity found that \n     hikers on Mount Washington, New Hampshire's highest peak, \n     ended their treks in worse condition than when they started.\n       These findings are not definitive. Rising temperatures \n     could exacerbate the effects of harmful ozone--but anti-\n     pollution laws are also cutting emissions.\n       ``There is a little tendency to be alarmist in global \n     warming studies,'' Kinney said. ``We could keep ozone in \n     check.''\n       A warmer New England could help some economic sectors. As \n     oak and hickory replace maples and birch, so commercial \n     forestry might grow. Shorter winters could translate into \n     longer growing seasons, lower fuel bills and less money spent \n     on frost-heaved roads. The foliage and ski industries would \n     suffer, but lingering autumns could bring more tourists and \n     dollars to the coastal towns of Maine and Massachusetts.\n       ``People complain that we'll lose the sugar maple, but 100 \n     years ago, New England was 80 percent farmland,'' said Yale \n     economist Mendelsohn. ``In fact, an entire landscape has \n     shifted in the past 100 years, and most people have no idea \n     it was once so different.''\n       Perhaps--though cold has defined New England for almost 400 \n     years, and some historians caution that the cultural shift \n     could prove disorienting. The region reflects its climate; \n     the literature is austere, the houses stout. For the 19th \n     century naturalists of the region, a clammy southern heat \n     represented moral slackness.\n       ``Surviving winter has become our self-selecting filter,'' \n     said Vermont archivist Gregory Sanford. ``What will we brag \n     about if we live in a temperate zone and go around in \n     Hawaiian shirts and sandals?''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1871. A bill to direct the Secretary of Transportation to conduct \na rail transportation security risk assessment, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to introduce \nthe Safe Rails Act of 2001. This bill will protect the lives of \nmillions of Americans by providing our Nation's freight railroads and \nhazardous materials shippers with the ability to enhance the security \nof hazardous materials shipped on the Nation's freight rail network.\n  The Safe Rails Act will require the Department of Transportation to \nfocus its attention on the significant potential for harm to human \nhealth and public safety posed by terrorist attacks on our Nation's \nfreight rail infrastructure. In performing the risk assessment called \nfor in the bill, the Secretary of Transportation will be able to make \nuse of the expertise of the various companies and industries involved \nin the transportation of hazardous materials. Upon completion of the \nassessment, the Secretary will administer a 2-year Rail Security Fund \nto assist railroads and hazardous materials shippers in paying the \nextraordinary costs associated with their post-September 11 activities \nto secure rail infrastructure and rolling stock.\n  Among the painful lessons we have learned from the sad and alarming \nevents of the past three months, one of the most obvious is that \nsecurity measures for much of our Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure needs immediate improvement. Americans had, for the most \npart, taken for granted that life in the United States was safe from \nthe senseless violence that occurs all too often elsewhere on the \nplanet. When terrorists used hijacked airlines as missiles against our \npeople, or transformed the mail into a means of spreading illness and \ndeath, we awoke in this country to the potential for harm that exists \nin the misuse of things we depend upon every day.\n  We depend on few things like we depend on our transportation system. \nI hope my colleagues in the Senate will agree with me that to \nadequately protect our homeland security, it is absolutely necessary \nthat Congress, the administration, and the various transportation \nindustries cooperate on a comprehensive evaluation and enhancement of \ntransportation security. I believe we must act soon, and not wait for \nour ocean-going vessels, our long-haul trucks, or our passenger rail \nsystem to be used as tools of terrorist aggression against our fellow \ncitizens.\n  I have offered this legislation today because the threat to Americans \nfrom a terrorist act against a freight railroad carrying hazardous \nmaterials may be greater than the threats against all of those other \nmodes combined. Several analyses undertaken even before September 11 \npoint to the chemical industry and the railroads that carry the bulk of \nits products as likely targets of terrorism. Our economy, and indeed, \nour public health, depend on the movement of these chemicals. In the \ndays immediately after September 11, for example, a disruption of rail \ntraffic resulted in some major cities having only a few days' supply of \nwater-purifying chlorine at their disposal. It is quite obvious, I \nbelieve, that we must safeguard movement of these life-saving, although \npotentially dangerous, chemicals.\n\n  There is legislation before the Senate that would protect the 21 \nmillion passengers Amtrak carries every year. I would encourage all my \ncolleagues to support this common-sense legislation. Before we enact \nthat legislation and think we have completed our job, I would just say \nto my colleagues that the passenger rail traffic in this Nation covers \nonly about one-sixth of the 140,000 miles in the country's freight rail \nnetwork.\n  The freight rail network, which passes through or near virtually \nevery\n\n[[Page S13961]]\n\nsmall town and large city in the country, carries more than 1.7 million \ncarloads, many millions of tons, of chemicals and other hazardous \nmaterials each year. More than 50,000 carloads of ``poison by \ninhalation'' chemicals, including chlorine, are transported within a \nfew miles of a huge percentage of our population. It is not my purpose \nto alarm my colleagues or the public at large. The simple fact is, \nhowever, the Safe Rails Act will protect millions of Americans living \nor working in proximity to the facilities manufacturing these hazardous \nmaterials, or the trains carrying them.\n  Very briefly, the Safe Rails Act would require the Secretary of \nTransportation to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the security \nrisks on our entire rail system, with special emphasis given to a \nsecurity needs assessment for the transportation of hazardous \nmaterials.\n  The bill creates a Rail Security Fund, to be administered by the \nSecretary, to reimburse or defray the costs of increased or new \nsecurity measures taken by railroads, hazardous materials shippers, or \ntank car owners, in the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11. \nIn conducting the required assessments, the Secretary will consult with \nand may use materials prepared by the railroad, chemical, and tank car \nleasing industries, as well as any relevant security analyses or \nassessments prepared by Federal or State law enforcement, public \nsafety, or regulatory agencies.\n  The Secretary will develop criteria to determine the appropriateness \nof full or partial reimbursement for various security-related \nactivities. The Secretary may consider, but will not be limited to, \nusing the Fund to help pay for costs incurred due to the following \nsecurity-related activities: unanticipated rerouting or switching of \ntrains or cargoes, and the express movement of hazardous materials to \naddress security risks; hiring additional manpower required to increase \nsecurity of the entire rail network, including rail cars on leased \ntrack; the purchase of equipment or improved training to enhance \nemergency response in hazardous materials transportation \nincidents; improvements in critical communications essential for rail \noperations and security, including: Development and deployment of \nglobal positioning tracking systems on all tank cars transporting high \nhazard materials; and development of secure network to provide \nhazardous materials shippers and tank car owners information regarding \ncredible threats to shipments of their products or rolling stock; \ninvestment in the physical hardening of critical railroad \ninfrastructure to enable it to withstand terrorist attacks; tank car \nmodifications, or storage of additional tank cars in excess of the \nnumber normally stored on-site at shippers' facilities, as mandated by \nfederal regulators; research and development supporting enhanced safety \nand security of hazardous materials transportation along the freight \nrail network, including: technology for sealing rail cars; techniques \nto transfer hazardous materials from rail cars that are damaged or \notherwise represent an unreasonable risk to human life or public \nsafety; systems to enhance rail car security on shipper property.\n\n  Mr. President, the Safe Rails Act is crucially important legislation \nfor the safety and security of our country, and for the protection of \nhuman health all along our Nation's rail network. I thank the chairman \nof the Commerce Committee for his commitment to mark this bill up early \nnext year. I strongly urge the leadership of the Senate to schedule \nconsideration of this legislation early in the next session of the \n107th Congress, and I encourage my colleagues to support its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1874. A bill to reduce the disparity in punishment between crack \nand powder cocaine offenses, to more broadly focus the punishment for \ndrug offenders on the seriousness of the offense and the culpability of \nthe offender, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a bill entitled the \nDrug Sentencing Reform Act of 2001. This bill provides a measured and \nbalanced approach to improving the statutory and guidelines system that \ngoverns the sentencing of drug offenders.\n  This bill makes two important changes to our Federal sentencing \nsystem for drug offenders: First, it reduces the disparity in sentences \nfor crack and powder cocaine from a ratio of 100-to-1 to 20-to-1. It \ndoes so by reducing the penalty for crack and increasing the penalty \nfor powder cocaine.\n  Second, the bill shifts some of the sentencing emphasis from drug \nquantity to the nature of the criminal conduct, the degree of the \ndefendant's criminality. The bill increases penalties for the worst \ndrug offenders that use violence and employ women and children as \ncouriers to traffic drugs. The bill decreases mandatory penalties on \nthose who play only a minimal role in a drug trafficking offense, such \nas a girlfriend or child of a drug dealer who receives little \ncompensation.\n  In short, this bill will make measured and balanced improvements in \nthe current sentencing system to ensure a more just outcome, tougher \nsentences on the worst and most violent drug offenders and lighter \nsentences on lower-level, nonviolent offenders.\n  To understand the changes that I propose, it is necessary to review \nhow we got to the present system.\n  Prior to the promulgation of the Sentencing Guidelines in 1984, \njudges in the Federal court system had very broad discretion to \nsentence drug offenders. Because judges had different views on \nsentencing, one defendant who committed a crime could receive parole \nwhile another defendant guilty of the exact same criminal conduct could \nreceive literally 20 years in prison. See, e.g., United States \nSentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual 2 (Nov. 2000).\n  Further, because of the existence of the parole system, convicts \ngenerally served only one-third of the sentence announced by the judge. \nId. There was no truth in sentencing. Thus, the old sentencing system \nlacked uniformity, honesty, and certainty.\n  In 1984, a bipartisan Congress enacted and President Reagan signed \nthe Sentencing Reform Act as part of the Comprehensive Crime Control \nAct, Pub. L. No. 98-473, Title II, 98 Stat. 2019 (1984). The Sentencing \nReform Act created the Sentencing Commission and instructed it to \npromulgate sentencing guidelines that would provide more effective, \nmore uniform, and more fair sentences. See generally United States \nSentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual 2 (Nov. 2000). As part of this \nreform, Congress abolished the parole system and substantially reduced \ngood behavior adjustments. Id. at 1.\n  The Sentencing Commission went to work in studying empirical data on \naverage sentences imposed for various crimes prior to the Sentencing \nReform Act. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \n9-10 (Nov. 2000). It then made adjustments for acceptance of \nresponsibility and provision of substantial assistance to the \ngovernment. Id. at 10.\n  On April 13, 1987, the Sentencing Commission submitted its first set \nof Sentencing Guidelines to Congress. See United States Sentencing \nCommission, Guidelines Manual 1 (Nov. 2000). After the prescribed \nperiod, the Guidelines took effect on November 1, 1987, and applied to \nall offenses committed on or after that date. Id. at 1.\n  In applying the Guidelines to a particular case, a judge must \ngenerally:\n  1. Determine the base offense level for the offense of conviction;\n  2. Apply applicable adjustments for the type of victim, the \ndefendant's role in the offense, and whether the defendant obstructed \njustice;\n  3. Determine the defendant's criminal history category; and\n  4. Determine the guideline range based on the defendant's offense \nlevel and criminal history category. See U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.1 (2000).\n  After all the factors are considered, the judge is required to \nsentence within a narrow range.\n  Thus, the promulgation of the Sentencing Guidelines and the repeal of \nthe parole system promoted uniformity, honesty, and certainty in \nsentencing.\n  In 1989, in Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361 (1989), the \nSupreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Sentencing \nGuidelines. Thus, Federal prosecutors, criminal defense attorneys, and \nFederal judges have been applying the Sentencing Guidelines for over a \ndecade.\n\n[[Page S13962]]\n\n  In setting the guideline ranges for particular offenses, the \nSentencing Commission has to take into account any minimum or maximum \nsentences established by Congress.\n  In 1986, Senator Dole introduced on behalf of the Reagan \nadministration the Drug-Free Federal Workplace Act of 1986. S. 2849, \n99th Cong. 2d Sess. Sec. 502 (1986). See United States Sentencing \nCommission, Special Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing \nPolicy 117 (1995). That bill proposed several mandatory minimum \nsentences for drug trafficking offenses based on the quantity of the \ndrug involved in the offense.\n  Under the bill, 500 grams of powder cocaine would have triggered a 5-\nyear mandatory minimum, while it would have taken 25 grams of crack to \ntrigger the same 5-year mandatory minimum. This was a 20-to-l ratio of \npowder to crack.\n  Ultimately, Congress passed and President Reagan signed the Omnibus \nAnti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 that set tough mandatory minimum sentences \nfor various quantities of illegal drugs. Pub. L. No. 99-570, 100 Stat. \n3207 (1986). With respect to cocaine, the law was amended to provide \nthat a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence would be triggered by \ntrafficking just 5 grams of crack cocaine or by trafficking 500 grams \nof powder--a 100-to-1 ratio. 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(B)(ii) & (iii). A \n10-year mandatory minimum sentence was imposed for trafficking 50 grams \nof crack or 5 kilograms of powder cocaine, again a 100-to-1 ratio. 18 \nU.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(a)(A)(ii) & (iii).\n  Congress, and those of us in the law enforcement field at the time \nbelieved that there was substantial justification for a large \ndifferential between crack and powder cocaine. Because crack was cheap, \naddictive, and believed to serve as a catalyst for crime, Congress \nwanted to keep it off the streets and out of poor neighborhoods, which \nwere largely minority neighborhoods. Congress sought to accomplish this \nwith stiff penalties. See United States Sentencing Commission, Special \nReport to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 115-21 (1995) \n(discussing legislative reasons for crack and powder cocaine \nsentences). Congressman Charles Rangel of New York, stated in 1986:\n\n       We all know that crack is the newest and most insidious \n     addition to the drug culture. It is cheaper than cocaine, and \n     more addictive. Young people who experiment with crack often \n     become habitual users because of its highly concentrated \n     narcotic effect. They become addicts before they know what is \n     happening.--132 Cong. Rec. H3515-02 (1986) statement of Rep. \n     Rangel).\n\n  Congressman Rangel, who chaired the Select Committee on Narcotics \nAbuse and Control, called drug dealers\n\n     the entrepreneurs of dealing with the sale of death on the \n     installment plan. (They) have now, in a very sophisticated \n     way, packaged crack which allows our younger people for \n     smaller amounts of money to become addicted.--``Crack,'' \n     Cocaine Derivative, Called Serious Health Threat, Houston \n     Chronicle, July 16, 1986.\n\n  Senator Lawton Chiles of Florida was one of the leaders in the Senate \non the fight against crack. He stated:\n\n       The whole Nation now knows about crack cocaine. They know \n     it can be bought for the price of a cassette tape, and make \n     people into slaves. It can turn promising young people into \n     robbers and thieves, stealing anything they can to get the \n     money to feed their habit.--132 Cong. Rec. S 26446, 26447 \n     (1986) (statement of Sen. Chiles).\n\n  Senator Chiles also stated with regard to the bill imposing the heavy \npenalties on crack,\n\n       The Senate bill contained the Democratic three-tiered \n     penalty system which will impose mandatory sentences and \n     large fines against major drug traffickers and kingpins. . . \n     . I am very pleased that the Senate bill recognizes crack as \n     a distinct and separate drug from [powder] cocaine. . . .--\n     132 Cong. Rec. S14270-01 (1986) (statement of Sen. Chiles).\n\n  A principal reason for the 1986 crack law was to keep crack from \nspreading across America and to keep it out of our neighborhoods, \nespecially minority neighborhoods.\n  Congress continued to follow this line of reasoning in 1988, when it \npassed and President Reagan signed into law the Anti-Drug Abuse Act. \nPub. L. No. 100-690, 102 Stat. 4181 (1988). In addition to the \nmandatory minimum penalties enacted in 1986 for the trafficking in \ncrack cocaine and other drugs, this act added a mandatory minimum \nsentence of 5 years for the simple possession of crack cocaine. 21 \nU.S.C. Sec. 844.\n  Mandatory minimum sentences at the Federal and State levels for \nvarious crimes have generally been successful. They have reflected the \nseriousness with which we as a society take certain crimes and they \nhave reduced crime by keeping recidivist criminals off the streets for \nlonger periods of time. A 1982 Rand study reported that some repeat \noffenders committed 232 burglaries per year and some committed 485 \nthefts per year. See Jan M. Chaiken & Marcia R. Chairken, Varieties of \nCriminal Behavior 44 (Rand 1982). By locking up these repeat offenders, \nwe could prevent a crime a day in some cases.\n  This effort to lock up the worst offenders has resulted in a \nsubstantial increase in Federal and State prison populations. In fact, \nsince 1990 our State and Federal prison populations have increased by a \ntotal of 79 percent. See Bureau of Justice Statistics, Prisoners in \n2000 1 (2001).\n  And mandatory minimums did not operate alone. We also made progress \nin reducing drug use, a cause of crime, down to very low levels. With \nsolid leadership and antidrug education programs we drove drug use by \nyoung people down. The University of Michigan's Monitoring the Future \nStudy showed that drug use among 12th grade school children dropped by \n76 percent from 1986 to 1992. Lloyd D. Johnston, et al. Monitoring the \nFuture: National Results on Adolescent Drug Use 14 (Univ. of Mich. \n2000).\n  This dual approach of locking up recidivists and reducing drug use \ndrove crime rates down. From 1990 to 1999, the crime index offenses \nreported by the FBI, including property crimes and violent crimes, fell \nto their lowest level since 1973. See Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nCrime in the United States--1999 6(2000) (stating that crime index \noffenses for 1999 were the lowest since 1973); Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, Uniform Crime Reports 2000 1(2001), stating that during \n2000, crime index offenses remained stable. Thus, the War on Drugs and \nthe War on Crime that began in the mid and late 1980s bore fruit in the \n1990s.\n  That the system put in place in the 1980s produced good results in \ngeneral, does not mean that it is perfect. With respect to drug \nsentencing in particular, the primary focus of the mandatory minimums \nand the Sentencing Guidelines on quantity has resulted in a blunt \ninstrument that data now shows is in need of refinement.\n  Since the establishment of mandatory minimums for drug trafficking, \nthe Bureau of Prisons published a study on the recidivism of federal \nprisoners convicted for various offenses. Federal Bureau of Prisons, \nRecidivism Among Federal Prison Releases in 1987: A Preliminary Report \n(1994). For those prisoners convicted of general drug crimes and \nreleased after serving their terms, 34.2 percent were rearrested within \n3 years. Id. at 12. For those convicted of firearm and explosive \ncrimes, 48.6 percent were rearrested. Id. For those who committed \ncrimes against the person, such as robbery or violent assault, 65 \npercent were rearrested. Id. Thus, possession of dangerous weapons and \nviolence appear to be better indicators of recidivism than the quantity \nof drugs possessed or distributed.\n  The 1986 mandatory minimums based on the quantity of crack cocaine \nsold or possessed, while appropriately reflecting that drug's more \nserious effects, failed to keep crack off the streets. The use of crack \nhad grown rapidly in the early and mid-1980s and by 1987 and 1988, \ncrack was available across America, including my home town of Mobile, \nAL, and small towns all over Alabama. See, e.g., Lloyd D. Johnston, et \nal. Monitoring the Future: National Results on Adolescent Drug Use 16 \n(Univ. of Mich. 2000) (noting that crack use grew rapidly from 1983-\n1986); James Coates & Robert Blau, Big-City Gangs Fuel Growing Crack \nCrisis, Chicago Tribune, Sept. 13, 1989, at C1, noting that crack use \nbegan in Fort Wayne, IN, in 1986 and spread rapidly through that city. \nThough the tough penalties did not stop the geographical spread of \ncrack, they did, in my opinion, play a role in slowing the rate of \nincrease in use that would have occurred without the tough penalties.\n  The mandatory minimums for crack were intended to protect minority \nneighborhoods from the spreading influence of crack. Still, the tough \npenalties for crack created the appearance\n\n[[Page S13963]]\n\nof racial bias because the distributors and users of crack are largely \nAfrican-American.\n  Parenthetically, let me note that criminal statutes, as they are \nwritten, are not biased, they simply required punishment for those who \nbreak them regardless of race, sex, nationality, or religion. Thus, \njust because more males commit Federal crimes than females, it is not \nunfair or sexist to punish males with all the severity society \nconcludes is necessary to stop or reduce crimes that both sexes commit. \nSee United States Sentencing Commission, 2000 Sourcebook of Federal \nSentencing Statistics 15 (Table 5) (reporting that 85.7 percent of \nFederal offenders are male and 14.3 percent are female).\n  Because everyone knows that crack carries heavy penalties, I cannot \nconclude that it is discriminatory to punish all who possess or \ndistribute it with equal severity. My experience does lead me to \nconclude, however, that where an overwhelming majority of those \nconvicted of crack offenses are African-American, and the penalties for \ncrack offenses are the most severe, we should listen to fair-minded \npeople who argue that these sentences fall too heavily on African-\nAmericans.\n  One of the facts used in the argument for changing crack sentences is \nthe percentage of crack defendants that are African-American. In 1995, \nthe Sentencing Commission issued report showing that of the defendants \nconvicted for crack cocaine offenses, 88.2 percent were African-\nAmerican. United States Sentencing Commission, Cocaine and Federal \nSentencing Policy 152 (1995). Of the persons sentenced for powder \ncocaine offenses, 32 percent where white, 27.4 percent African-\nAmerican, and 37 percent Hispanic, Id.\n  This generated stories in newspapers, like one from the Birmingham \nPost-Herald that reported:\n\n       At first, many of the nation's black leaders supported the \n     hard line against drugs. Inner-city church ministers decried \n     the crack epidemic that seemed to blaze through \n     their neighborhoods. But as the disparities in jail \n     sentences became increasingly obvious, support for the \n     policy dried up among many blacks. . . .''--Thomas \n     Hargrove, Drug's Form Influences Length of Sentence, \n     Birmingham Post-Herald, Nov. 17, 1997, at A1, A9 \n     (describing differences in punishments for crack and \n     powder cocaine).\n\n  As data from the Sentencing Commission became available during the \nmid-1990s, many federal and state officials, including myself, began to \ndoubt whether the 100-to-1 ratio between powder and crack cocaine \ncontinued to be justifiable.\n  We in the public service asked ourselves: ``If in light of our \nexperience, we can conclude that crack sentences are disproportionately \nsevere, why should we not act to improve them?''\n  In 1995 and 1997, the Sentencing Commission unanimously concluded \nthat the crack-powder disparity was no longer justified. See United \nStates Sentencing Commission, Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy \n198-200 (1995); United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to \nthe Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 2 (1997).\n  Moreover, in 1995, the Sentencing Commission, most of the members of \nwhich are federal judges, passed two amendments to the Guidelines to \nreduce the disparity in sentences between crack and powder cocaine. \nSpecifically, the amendments would have adopted a starting point for \nthe guidelines of equal amounts of crack and powder cocaine--a 1-to-1 \nratio at the 500-gram level, and would have provided a sentencing \nenhancement for violence and other harms associated with crack cocaine. \nSee United States Sentencing Commission, Cocaine and Federal Sentencing \nPolicy 1 (1997). Congress, however, passed and President Clinton signed \na law that rejected the amendments and directed the Sentencing \nCommission to study the issue more thoroughly. Pub. L. No. 104-38, 109 \nStat. 334 (1995).\n  In 1997, the Sentencing Commission responded with a study entitled, \n``Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy.'' The study recommended a \nreduction in the crack-powder differential from 100-1 to approximately \n5-to-1. United States Sentencing Commission, Cocaine and Federal \nSentencing Policy 9 (1997). Specifically, the Commission recommended to \nCongress that the trigger points for the 5-year mandatory minimum for \npowder be lowered from 500 grams to a range of 125 to 375 grams and for \ncrack be raised from 5 grams to a range of 25 to 75 grams. Id.\n  Moreover, some judges who did not sit on the Sentencing Commission \nbegan speaking out against the crack-powder differential. See, e.g., \nPete Bowles, Judge Known for Unusual Sentences, Newsday, May 22, 1998, \nat A39 (quoting Judge Jack Weinstein as characterizing the Sentencing \nGuidelines as ``cruel, excessive and unnecessary,'' and saying, ``I \nsimply cannot sentence another impoverished person whose destruction \nhas no discernible effect on the drug trade''). And some have said that \njudges may have used downward departures more often than they should \nhave to reduce drug sentences to a level that they view as more just. \nIndeed, Professors Frank Bowman and Michael Heise, citing a downward \ntrend in drug sentences have stated, ``a pervasive disposition toward \ndiscretionary evasion of Guideline and statutory law has important \nimplications for the ongoing struggle among the courts, the Justice \nDepartment, the Congress, and the Sentencing Commission for control of \nsentencing policy.'' See Frank O. Bowman III & Michael Heise, Quiet \nRebellion? Explaining Nearly a Decade of Declining Federal Drug \nSentences, 86 Iowa L. Rev. 1043, 1049-50 (2001).\n  To date, however, Congress has declined to address the issue. Many \nsay it is because of a fear of being called ``soft on crime.'' \nRegardless, we can wait no longer. Based on our experience, the strong \nposition of the Sentencing Commission, which is not a ``soft on crime'' \ngroup, and plain fairness, we must act. Congress' refusal to act, in my \nview, has been unfortunate.\n  And in light of our experience, we can conclude that crack sentences \nare disproportionately severe, why should we not act to improve them? \nTo improve these guidelines, to fix them where they are broken, is to \nstrengthen the system, to reduce judicial manipulation, and to restore \nconfidence in the system's fairness.\n  We must remember, however, that the goals of the drug sentencing are \nstill valid today, to save babies from being addicted to the drugs \ntheir mothers take during pregnancy, to save teenagers from wasting \ntheir youth on drugs that lead to crime, to save young girls from being \nforced into prostitution to feed a habit, and to save adults from \nwasting their lives on nonproductive and damaging drugs.\n  I challenge any of you to visit a drug court and look at the \ndefendants before and after the drug court program. The transformation \nfrom a hopeless criminal on drugs to productive citizen off of drugs \nwill convince anyone of the danger and destructiveness of illegal \ndrugs.\n  Does an easing of these tough sentences, but not gutting of them, \ncarry risks. Some, but not much:\n  1. Some will say that it represents proof that the war against drugs \nis a failure, but as I just explained, the War on Drugs is just as \nworthy a cause today as it used to be;\n  2. Some will say that we are less serious, but a balanced reform will \ntreat dangerous crimes more seriously;\n  3. Some will say that it may ease a bit the pressure a prosecutor can \nput on a drug dealer to cooperate, but a balanced approach will retain \nsufficient leverage for a prosecutor to do his job justly;\n  4. Some will say that heavy sentences have had some ability to reduce \ndistribution, but of course, after a modest decrease the penalties will \nremain tough.\n  After thoughtful review, and consideration in light of my own \nexperience in prosecuting drug offense, I have concluded that we must \nreform the justness of our means to match the legitimacy of our goals. \nWe must restore justness to sentencing for crack trafficking and other \ndrug crimes which will maintain public confidence in the federal \ngovernment's anti-drug efforts and make those efforts more rational and \njustifiable.\n  Today, I propose a bill to make two modest changes to the current \nsentencing system:\n  First, the bill will reduce the crack-powder sentencing disparity \nfrom the current 100-to-1 ratio to a 20-to-1 ratio--the same ratio \nproposed by the Reagan Administration in 1986. This bill would trigger \nthe 5-year mandatory minimum sentence for trafficking at 20 grams of \ncrack--not 5 grams--and at 400 grams of powder cocaine--not 500\n\n[[Page S13964]]\n\ngrams. The 10-year mandatory minimum would be triggered by trafficking \n200 grams of crack and by trafficking 4 kilograms of powder.\n  The reduction in the amount of powder cocaine required to trigger the \nmandatory minimum from 500 grams to 400 grams reflects that 400 grams \nis almost a pound of cocaine--a large amount--worth well over $10,000. \nAlso, this increase in the penalty for powder cocaine reflects that \npowder cocaine is imported and used as the raw material used to make \ncrack. United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report: Cocaine and \nFederal Sentencing Policy vi (1995). Finally, the increased penalty \nresponds to the powder cocaine use rates among high school students.\n  According to the University of Michigan Study entitled Monitoring the \nFuture, powder cocaine use among 12th grade students had risen by 61.3 \npercent from 1992 to 2000, although there was a slight decline from \n1999 to 2000. Further, more than twice as many 12th grade students used \npowder cocaine than crack in 1992 and in 2000.\n\n                          12TH GRADERS DRUG USE\n                              [In percent]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                   Drug                       1992      2000     Change\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPowder....................................       3.1       5.0      61.3\nCrack.....................................       1.5       2.2      46.7\nPercent Greater...........................     106.7               127.2\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  See Lloyd D. Johnston, Monitoring the Future: National Results on \nAdolescent Drug Use 14 (Univ. of Mich. 2000) (Table 2).\n  We need to discourage those who are dealing powder cocaine to our \nhigh school students and those who are providing a supply market of \npowder cocaine that enable the manufacture of crack. This bill does \nthis by providing a small increase in the penalty for powder cocaine.\n  The bill's decrease in the penalty for crack reflects that a \nprincipal reason for creating the much more severe sentence on crack, \nto prevent the spread of crack use, has failed. Crack is used \nthroughout America.\n  The bill's approach of narrowing, but not eliminating, the sentencing \ndisparity between crack and powder cocaine by changing the penalties \nfor both drugs parallels the 1997 Sentencing Commission recommendation \nof increasing penalties and decreasing penalties on crack. United \nStates Sentencing Commission, Special Report to Congress: Federal \nSentencing Policy 9 (1997). Further, it is consistent with the \nbipartisan Act of Congress that President Clinton signed in 1995 \nrejecting the Sentencing Commission's attempt to equalize the penalties \nfor crack and powder cocaine. That act stated, ``the sentence imposed \nfor trafficking in a quantity of crack cocaine should generally exceed \nthe sentence imposed for trafficking a like quantity of powder \ncocaine.'' Pub. L. No. 104-38, 104th Cong. 1st Sess. Sec. 2(a)(1)(A) \n(1995). The bill changes the penalties for crack and powder to reduce \nthe 100-to-1 disparity, but retains a reasonable distinction, a 20-to-1 \nratio, between crack and powder.\n  The bill also reduces the 5-year mandatory minimum penalty for the \nsimple possession of 5 grams of crack to just 1 year. This reflects \nthat crack is a more serious drug than most other drugs, but that the \nsentence need not be unjustifiably harsh.\n  Second, the bill increases emphasis on defendant's criminality, as \nopposed to a heavy emphasis on the quantity of drug involved. This bill \nrequires a sentencing enhancement for violence or possession of a \nfirearm, or other dangerous weapon, associated with a drug trafficking \noffense. This reflects that use of a dangerous weapon or violent action \nresults in higher recidivism rates than drug use along. See Federal \nBureau of Prisons, Recidivism Among Federal Prison Releases in 1987: A \nPreliminary Report 12 (1994).\n  Further, the bill requires an additional enhancement if the defendant \nis an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in the drug trafficking \noffense and a ``superaggravating'' factor applies. Superaggravating \nfactors include using a girlfriend or child to distribute drugs, \nmaintaining a crack house, distributing a drugs to minor, an elderly \nperson, or a pregnant woman, bribing a law enforcement official, \nimporting drugs in the United States from a foreign country, or \ncommitting the drug offense as a part of a pattern of criminal conduct \nengaging in as a livelihood. These sentencing enhancements will apply \nto offenses involving cocaine, methamphetamines, marijuana, and all \nillegal drugs.\n  Aside from the girlfriend factor, many of the superaggravating \nfactors are already available in certain cases. The bill would employ \nthese punishments in drug cases as sentencing enhancements, instead of \nstatutory penalties, thus allowing a Federal prosecutor to obtain \nthe tougher penalty by proving the superaggravating criminal conduct by \na preponderance of the evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. \nFurther, the bill will make some enhancements easier to establish. For \nexample instead of proving that a victim had a particular vulnerability \nto a crime, a prosecutor could simply show that the victim was 16 years \nold.\n\n  The offenders to which these sentencing enhancements apply are the \nmost culpable members of the drug trade that prey on young women, \nschool children, and the elderly, and bring violence into our \nneighborhoods. Their sentences should reflect the criminality of their \nconduct, not simply the quantity of drugs with which they are caught.\n  While providing sentencing increases for the worst offenders, the \nbill limits the impact of mandatory minimums on the least dangerous \noffenders. The bill caps the drug quantity portion of a sentence for a \ndefendant who plays a minimal role at 10 years, base offense level 32 \nunder the Sentencing Guidelines. This is very significant because \ncouriers, who are often low-level participants in a drug organization, \ncan have disproportionate sentences of 20 or 30 years simply because \nthey are caught with a large amount of drugs in their possession. By \ncapping the impact of drug quantity on the minimal role offenders, the \nbill allows a greater role for the criminality, or lack of criminality, \nof their conduct in determining their ultimate sentence.\n  For example, the bill provides a decrease for the super-mitigating \nfactor of the girlfriend or child who plays a minimal role in the \noffense. These are often the most abused victims of the drug trade, and \nwe should not punish them as harshly as the drug dealer who used them.\n  Existing adjustments could then be made for factors such as the role \nin the offense, acceptance of responsibility, and provision of \nsubstantial assistance to the government.\n  The bill also establishes a 3-year pilot program for placing elderly, \nnonviolent prisoners in home detention in lieu of prison. It allows the \nAttorney General to designate 1 or more Federal prisons at which \nprisoners who meet the following criteria could be placed in home \ndetention.\n  The prisoner: 1. is at least 65 years old; 2. has served the greater \nof 10 years or one-half of his sentence; 3. has never committed a \nFederal or State crime of violence; 4. is not determined by the Bureau \nof Prisons to have a history of violence or to have committed a violent \ninfraction while in prison; and 5. has not escaped or attempted to \nescape.\n  My experience tells me, that elderly prisoners who are nonviolent and \nwho have served a substantial amount of their sentence generally pose \nno threat to the community. Removing them from prison and placing them \nin home detention could save the federal government money and free up \nspace to house the most dangerous criminals.\n  The bill, however, would require an independent study on recidivism \nand cost savings. At the end of 3 years, Congress could decide whether \nto continue or expand the pilot program.\n  There are those on the Left of the political spectrum who want to \nsubstantially restrict or even repeal mandatory minimums for some drug \noffenders and oppose all drug penalty increases. I firmly disagree with \nsuch an approach. The Sentencing Guidelines and mandatory minimum \nstatutes have been a critical component of a criminal justice system \nthat treats equal conduct equally. It increases deterrence because \ncriminals know they will not be able to talk themselves out of jail. It \nis a great system. By following the balanced approach that I have \nproposed, we improve the guidelines and improve sentencing. My goal is \nto have our sentencing system consistently impose the right sentence to \nincapacitate, deter, punish, and rehabilitate the criminal. Because \nCongress has set the rules, we\n\n[[Page S13965]]\n\nmust act to improve them. The courts cannot do it for us.\n\n  There are those on the Right side of the political spectrum, however, \nwho do not want to decrease any drug penalty whatsoever. While I \nrespect their view, I can not embrace it. The mandatory minimums have \nbeen in effect since 1986 and the Sentencing Guidelines have been in \neffect since 1987. We are not in a position to reflect on what the \neffects have been.\n  As we have seen from experience, the 100-to-1 disparity in sentencing \nbetween crack cocaine and power cocaine, which falls the hardest on \nAfrican-Americans, is not justifiable. See, e.g., 145 Cong. Rec. S. \n14452-14453 (1999), (statement of Sen. Sessions,to-1 ratio is a \nmovement in the right direction,'' but questioning whether solely \nincreasing penalties on crack was justifiable). It is simply unjust.\n  Further, the focus of the drug sentencing system on quantity of \ndrugs, which has sent the girlfriends of drug dealers, who act as mere \ncouriers, to prison for long terms, should be adjusted to increase the \nemphasis on the criminality of conduct. This will free up prison space \nfor violent drug offenders.\n  Trust me on this. The federal drug sentences are tough. In practice--\nas they play out in actual time served, they are tougher than any State \ndrug sentences that I know of. This legislation will in no way change \nthe seriousness with which drugs are taken. Please know that I will \nresist with all the force I can muster any attempt to destroy or \nundermine the integrity or effectiveness of the Sentencing Guidelines. \nThis bill simply targets the toughest sentences to those who deserve it \nmost.\n  The Drug Sentencing Reform Act of 2001 takes a measured and balanced \napproach to modifying the sentencing system that we have used for over \na decade. By increasing penalties on the worst offenders and decreasing \npenalties on the least dangerous offenders, we will increase the focus \nof our law enforcement resources on the drug traffickers that endanger \nour families and decrease the focus on those defendants who pose less \ndanger.\n  I commend this bill to my colleagues to study and debate. I challenge \nthem to cast aside the politics of the Left and the Right and to \nsupport this bill on the merits as a matter of plain, simple justice.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly on the \nlegislation that my good friend from the State of Alabama, Senator \nSessions, has introduced today. That legislation, the ``Drug Sentencing \nReform Act of 2001,'' addresses the disparity between sentences handed \ndown to those who traffic in power cocaine and those who traffic in \ncrack cocaine. I am proud to cosponsor this bill, and I hope that we \ncan promptly act on it when we return next year.\n  This legislation provides a balanced and measured solution to the \ndisparity problem without undermining our efforts to pursue \nrelentlessly those who make their living peddling these poisons. At the \nsame time that we reduce the crack-powder sentence ratio from 100 to 1 \nto 20 to 1 and reduce sentences for girlfriends and children who play \ntruly minimal roles in drug crimes, we increase sentences for those who \nplay leadership roles in trafficking organizations. The bill also \nincreases sentences for those who use firearms or violence in carrying \nout their drug crimes.\n  As a former federal prosecutor, United States Attorney, and Attorney \nGeneral of Alabama, Senator Sessions is uniquely qualified to lead the \nSenate on this issue. Since at least 1998, he has done just that. Both \nin the Judiciary Committee and on the floor of the Senate, Senator \nSessions has worked tirelessly to bring about a more just sentencing \nstructure for cocaine offenses. This legislation represents the right \napproach, and it deserves the support of all of my colleagues.\n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Stevens, \n        Mr. Specter, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \n        Dodd):\n  S. 1876. A bill to establish a National Foundation for the Study of \nHolocaust Assets; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce with \nSenator Clinton, the Holocaust Victims' Assets Restitution Policy and \nRemembrance Act. This legislation will create a public/private \nFoundation dedicated to educating and to completing the necessary \nresearch in the area of Holocaust-era assets and restitution policy and \nto promote innovative solutions to restitution issues. The Foundation \nis authorized for ten years at a cost of $100 million, after which it \nwill sunset and ``spin off'' its research results and materials to \nprivate entities. It is able to accept private funds as well as public \ndollars.\n  The need for the Foundation comes from the work of the Presidential \nAdvisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States. I was \nproud to have served as a Commissioner along with several of my \ncolleagues in the Senate. The Commission identified a number of policy \ninitiatives that require U.S. leadership, including: further research \nand review of Holocaust-era assets in the United States and world-wide; \nproviding for the dissemination of information about restitution \nprograms; creating a simple mechanism to assist claimants in obtaining \nresolution of claims; and, supporting a modern database of Holocaust \nvictims' claims for the restitution of personal property.\n  The Commission determined that ``our government performed in an \nunprecedented and exemplary manner in attempting to ensure the \nrestitution of assets to victims of the Holocaust. However, even the \nbest intentioned and most comprehensive policies were unable, given the \nunique circumstances of the time, to ensure that all victims' assets \nwere restituted.''\n  I believe this Foundation will provide a focal point for work between \nFederal and State governments to cross-match property records with \nlists of Holocaust victims. It will work with the museum community to \nfurther stimulate provenance research into European paintings and \nJudaica. It will promote and monitor the implementation by major \nbanking institutions of the agreement developed in conjunction with the \nNew York Bankers Association. Finally, it will work with the private \nsector to develop and promote common standards and best practices for \nresearch on Holocaust-era assets.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in creating this \nFoundation to finish the work of the Holocaust Assets Commission. I \nurge all my colleagues to co-sponsor this important legislation that \nwill solve restitution issues and engender needed research on Holocaust \nassets in the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 1877. A bill to clarify and reaffirm a cause of action and Federal \ncourt jurisdiction for certain claims against the Government of Iran; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we all remember the dark days of the Iran \nhostage crisis between 1979 and 1981. Fifty-two Americans were taken \nhostage in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held in captivity by the \nAyatollah Khomeini and his followers for the ensuing 444 days in the \nnewly-established Islamic Republic of Iran. They were brutalized by \ntheir captors and the pain and suffering of these brave Americans and \ntheir families throughout that ordeal cannot be over-estimated.\n  A constituent of mine, Ms. Kathryn Koob, from Waverly, IA, is one of \ntwo women former hostages who endured this nightmarish experience. Last \nDecember, she joined the other 51 American heroes taken hostage and \ntheir families in filing a lawsuit in the Federal District Court of the \nDistrict of Columbia seeking redress of this grievous miscarriage of \njustice and payment by the Government of Iran for the damages and \ninjuries they incurred. If these plaintiffs are successful, the Federal \ncourts could order payment from Iranian cash and assets still frozen in \nthe United States.\n  Incredibly, the U.S. Justice and State Departments in mid-October \nand, at the latest possible hour, intervened in this case, Roeder v. \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, seeking to vacate the Federal judge's \ndefault judgment in favor of the former hostages and their families and \nto have this lawsuit dismissed altogether. De facto the Bush \nAdministration is siding with the Government of Iran and against our \nown people who were taken hostage and treated so cruelly during the \nEmbassy takeover. How could this be, especially when we are\n\n[[Page S13966]]\n\nunited as a Nation in a war against terrorism and the U.S. State \nDepartment itself continues to document and declare the Government of \nIran as the number one state sponsor of terrorism in the world today?\n  The Government of Iran has never had to pay one cent to any of the \nAmericans taken hostage or their families. If U.S. Justice and State \nDepartment attorneys get their way, the Government of Iran will never \nhave to pay anything and the hostages and their families will never be \ngiven their day in Federal court to pursue justice and be awarded \ncompensation.\n  That is why I am today introducing legislation, The Justice for \nFormer U.S. Hostages in Iran Act, to prevent this grave injustice from \nbeing compounded. My bill would reaffirm the clear intent of this \nCongress expressed in four prior enactments and make crystal clear that \nthis group of hostages and their families have the right to pursue \ntheir Federal lawsuit to its rightful conclusion and to be eligible to \nreceive compensatory damage awards from the Government of Iran, should \nthe Federal courts so determine on the merits.\n  The position of the U.S. Justice and State Departments, contrary to \nthe claims and interests of the American hostages and their families, \nis that the U.S. Government must honor a little-known executive \nagreement called the Algiers Accords that Presidents Carter and Reagan \nentered into in January, 1981 in order to get our hostages released \nfrom captivity inside Iran. The Algiers Accords, among other \nprovisions, required the U.S. to immediately transfer to Iran through\n  Algeria $7.9 billion in frozen assets in exchange for the freedom of \nour people. But also buried in the fine print of the Algiers Accords is \none very specific provision which singularly strips the hostages and \ntheir families of their rights and flatly prohibits any of them from \never being able to sue the Government of Iran and make that regime pay \nfor their pain and suffering. Ironically, under the terms of the \nAlgiers Accords, U.S. companies can take the Iranians before an \ninternational tribunal at The Hague and recover damages for their lost \nproperty, but the Americans actually taken hostage and their families \nalone, are prohibited from doing the same. This is patently unfair to \nthose American heroes and their families who suffered the most from \nthis hellish experience.\n  The Algiers Accords is not a treaty. It was never submitted to the \nSenate for ratification for obvious reasons. It is a shabby executive \nagreement that was negotiated under extreme duress and entered into \nbetween the executive branch of our government and the Government of \nIran because the Government of Iran, at that time, was daily \nthreatening otherwise to put all of our hostages on trial in Iran as \n``spies'' and to execute them. In fact, the Algiers Accords, from their \ninception, have functioned as little more than a ransom pact with \nkidnappers acting in the name and under the sponsorship of the \nGovernment of Iran.\n  Last week, the Federal judge hearing this case expressed a reluctance \nto make a final judgment and to order the Government of Iran to pay \ndamages unless the Congress takes further legislative action to clearly \nand irrefutably abrogate the Algiers Accords insofar as necessary to \nallow the Americans held hostage and their families to sue in federal \ncourt and recover damages from the Government of Iran. The next court \nproceeding is this unresolved matter has been scheduled for January 14.\n  I appeal to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to co-sponsor \nthis legislation with a sense of urgency and fairness. Unless the \nCongress acts promptly to reaffirm and clarify our prior enactments, \nthe U.S. Justice and State Departments will block the only path still \nopen to the hostages and their families to pursue justice, to get a \nfederal court judgment against the Government of Iran for its brutal \nand criminal misconduct, and to require this on-going state sponsor of \ninternational terrorism to pay for the pain, suffering and injuries \nthey inflicted on Kathryn Koob and these other courageous Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1877\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish programs to address the health care \nneeds of residents of the United States-Mexico Border Area, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the U.S./\nMexico Border Health Improvement Act. The issue of public health along \nthe U.S./Mexico Border is as vast and varied as the 2000-mile Border \nitself. With the enactment of the NAFTA agreement, and the tremendous \ngrowth in population in the region, the Border represents, for both \ncountries, the area of both greatest potential and enormous challenge. \nFrom San Yisidro to Brownsville, and from Tijuana to Matamoros, over 10 \nmillion people call the Border region home. At the same time, the U.S. \nBorder population is growing three times as fast as the rest of the \nNation's, and the population of Mexico's border cities is expected to \ndouble over the next decade. For this reason, I am pleased to be joined \nby Senator Bingaman to offer legislation on the critical issue of \nimproving U.S./Mexico Border Health.\n  The Border region is like a ``top ten'' list of substandard living \nconditions: the highest poverty rate; the lowest education rate; \nhighest unemployment; worst environmental degradation; and the worst \nrecord for all major public health indicators.\n  The statistics are mind-numbing, but it is the sad reality of the \nhuman suffering and of the individuals, families, and communities \nbehind those numbers that is so heart wrenching. Diabetes, HIV, \nhepatitis, tuberculosis, and birth defects all remain \ndisproportionately and unacceptably high. Meanwhile, childhood \nimmunizations, screenings, health education, and the ratio of health \ncare providers to the general population all remain unacceptably low.\n  This legislation that I offer today provides for a comprehensive \nborder health program to address this woeful situation that includes \nthe creation of an office of Border Health within Health and Human \nServices, authorizations for community health centers, and dental \noutreach programs. This bill also directs the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to recruit and retain quality members of the National \nHealth Service Corps for service\n\n[[Page S13967]]\n\nin the border region, while requesting authorization for the \nrecruitment, training and retaining of bilingual health professionals, \n``promotor(a)s.''\n  As a member of the United States Senate, I have worked very hard to \nimprove the health of Border residents in the short term, but more \nimportant, to putting in place the infrastructure and institutions \nnecessary to ensure a good, healthful life for our Nation's people well \ninto the twenty-first century.\n  I commend the Senator from New Mexico for his support on this issue, \nand I urge other Senators to join us in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1878\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States/Mexico Border \n     Health Improvement Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States-Mexico Border Area is the area \n     located in the United States within 100 kilometers of the \n     border between the United States and Mexico.\n       (2) In the United States, the United States-Mexico Border \n     Area encompasses 46 counties in California, Arizona, New \n     Mexico, and Texas.\n       (3) Presently, the United States-Mexico Border Area is \n     experiencing explosive population growth. In the United \n     States, this region currently has 11,500,000 residents. \n     However, this number is expected to exceed 22,000,000 by the \n     year 2025. The population of the region in Mexico is growing \n     at an ever faster rate. In total, the population of the \n     communities in both countries is expected to double between \n     the years 2020 and 2025.\n       (4) With 11,500,000 residents and a 2,000-mile expanse, the \n     United States-Mexico Border Area has the population and size \n     of a State of the United States. If the region was such a \n     State, it would rank--\n       (A) last in access to health care;\n       (B) second in death rates (due to hepatitis);\n       (C) third in deaths related to diabetes;\n       (D) first in the number of tuberculosis cases;\n       (E) first in schoolchildren living in poverty; and\n       (F) last in per capita income.\n       (5) In addition to the specific health problems listed in \n     paragraph (5), hundreds of thousands of Area residents also \n     each day face increased health risks due to being exposed to \n     the polluted water, soil, and air of the region.\n       (6) Every county in the United States-Mexico Border Area in \n     the United States has at least a partial health professional \n     shortage area designation. Twenty-five percent of such \n     counties have severe shortages and lack adequate primary care \n     physicians. The shortage of dentists is also severe in many \n     Area localities.\n       (7) According to GAO, the United States-Mexico Border Area \n     contains hundreds of colonias. Colonias are substandard \n     developments that typically lack running water, sewerage \n     systems, and electricity. Many of the residents of colonias \n     are migrant farmworker families.\n       (8) Due to the poor living conditions in the colonias, the \n     United States-Mexico Border Area has a much higher rate of \n     waterborne infectious diseases. The occurrence of hepatitis \n     A, for example, is 3 times the national rate, and the \n     occurrence of salmonella and shigella dysentery occur is 2 to \n     4 times the national rate.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to resolve the claims of Cook Inlet Region, Inc., to \nlands adjacent to the Russian River in the State of Alaska; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the\n\n[[Page S13970]]\n\n``Russian River Land Act''. The purpose of this legislation is to \nratify an agreement that settles a land ownership issue at the Russian \nRiver on the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska between the U.S. Forest Service, \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Cook Inlet Region, Inc., CIRI, \nan Alaska Native Corporation.\n  The legislation ratifies an agreement reached between CIRI and the \nagencies after three years of negotiations and it covers the lands at \nthe confluence of the Kenai and Russian Rivers in Alaska.\n  The area surrounding the confluence of the Russian and Kenai Rivers \nis rich in archaeological cultural features. It is also the site of \nperhaps the most heavily used public sports fishery in Alaska. Because \nof the archaeological resources at Russian River, Cook Inlet Region, \nInc., made selections at Russian River under the section of the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act that allowed for selections of historical \nplaces and cemetery sites. The lands at the confluence are managed in \npart by the U.S. Forest Service and in part by the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service.\n  Seeking to protect the public's access to the sport fishery at \nRussian River, the two federal agencies and Cook Inlet Region, Inc., \nreached an agreement that requires the Federal legislation in order to \nbecome effective. Because this agreement provides for continuing \nownership and management by the two Federal agencies of the vast \nmajority of lands at Russian River, the public's right to continue \nfishing remains unchanged from its current status.\n  I congratulate the U.S. Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service \nand CIRI for finding a way to fulfill the intent of the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act in a way that fully protects the interests of the \npublic. I also congratulate all three parties on reaching final accord \non the longstanding unresolved issue of land ownership at Russian \nRiver.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 1880. A bill to provide assistance for the relief and \nreconstruction of Afghanistan, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am introducing the Afghanistan \nFreedom and Reconstruction Act of 2001. This legislation is a \ncomprehensive framework for U.S. bilateral and multilateral assistance \nfor the humanitarian relief and long-term reconstruction and \nrehabilitation of Afghanistan. It is a companion to H.R. 3427, \nintroduced by Representatives Lantos and Ackerman in the House.\n  The last pockets of Taliban resistance are being routed, and the new \ninterim administration of Afghanistan is set to assume power in Kabul \nin 2 days. Freedom is returning to Afghanistan. Its men and women are \nlistening to music again and women are leaving their homes unescorted, \ncautiously optimistic about their future after enduring years of \nrepressive rule.\n  Now is the time for decisive action by Congress and by the \nadministration to demonstrate to the people of Afghanistan and \nthroughout the Muslim world that the war against the al-Qaida and the \nTaliban was neither a war against Muslims, nor against ordinary \nAfghans. The United States has led the effort to eliminate the \nterrorist network in Afghanistan, and now it must lead the peace effort \nby helping the Afghan people reclaim their country and rebuild their \nlives.\n  The United States did not live up to its commitment to the Afghan \npeople after the Soviets were defeated in the 1980s. I regret to say we \nwalked away. If we break or commitment again, Afghanistan is likely to \nremain an isolated incubator of terrorist activities, and regional \ninstability will continue. We would not now be focused on Afghanistan \nhad the events of September 11 not occurred. Those horrific events have \ndriven home the truth that the indivisibility of human security is not \njust an empty slogan, but a fact, which we ignore at our peril.\n  The causes of the Afghan tragedy include nearly all the horrors that \nstalk failed states: meddling and invasion by neighboring states, \ninternecine warfare leading to a takeover by brutal fanatics, \noppression of a majority of the population, especially women and, \nfinally, the Taliban's fateful decision to host international \nterrorists.\n  The cures for Afghanistan's agony are less obvious, but one is clear. \nThe rival political and ethnic groups must take advantage of the \nhistoric opportunity that emerged in Bonn and make a genuine commitment \nto the peaceful sharing of power. They must establish a government \nbroad and effective enough to meet the basic needs of the people. The \nsame narrow-minded factionalism that originally left the country \nvulnerable to backward mullahs, greedy warlords and predatory neighbors \ncontinues to pose a threat to the country now.\n  One other thing is clear: the United States must lead the \ninternational community in moving quickly and decisively in a long-term \ncommitment to the reconstruction of Afghanistan. The people of \nAfghanistan have endured 23 years of war and misery. The conflict has \nthreatened international stability and placed enormous burdens on the \npeople's limited means. The Bush administration has said that it will \nnot let Afghanistan descend into chaos. But, talk is not enough. We \nmust act by committing significant resources. We must show Afghans that \nour commitments are not hollow. We must show genuine solidarity and \nreal generosity now.\n  It is time to reverse more than a decade of neglect. The United \nStates, in partnership with the international community, must be \nwilling to make a multi-year, multinational effort to rebuild \nAfghanistan. Current estimates of the cost of assisting Afghanistan \nrange from $5 billion over 5 years to $40 billion over a decade. The \nUnited States should be the lead financial contributor to the \nrehabilitation and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan, and we believe \nshould contribute as much as $5 billion to this effort over the next 5 \nyears.\n  The reconstruction effort must focus on education, particularly for \ngirls, which has proven to give the greatest return for each assistance \ndollar. Creation of secular schools will help break the stranglehold of \nextremism and allow both boys and girls to make positive contributions \nto the development of their society. The effort must also focus on \nrebuilding basic infrastructure, repairing shattered bridges and roads, \nremoving land mines, reconstructing irrigation systems and drilling \nwells. We must also rebuild the health infrastructure by establishing \nbasic hospitals and village clinics.\n  Over the past few months, I have held a series of hearings in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Near Eastern and \nSouth Asia Affairs regarding the humanitarian and reconstruction needs \nof Afghanistan. Based on these hearings, I am convinced we must help \nthe Afghan people live in a society where they can feed their children, \nlive in safety and participate fully in their country's development \nregardless of gender, religious belief or ethnicity.\n  The Afghan Freedom and Reconstruction Act of 2001 does just that. \nThat bill:\n  Expresses a sense of Congress on the U.S. policy towards Afghanistan, \nincluding promoting its independence, supporting a broad-based, multi-\nethnic, gender-inclusive, fully representative government, and \nmaintaining a significant U.S. commitment to the relief, rehabilitation \nand reconstruction of Afghanistan.\n  Authorizes $400 million for humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan in \nfiscal year 03, including $75m for refugee assistance and $175m for \nfood aid.\n  Authorizes such sums as may be necessary for a multinational security \nforce in Afghanistan, in fiscal year 02 and fiscal year 03.\n  Authorizes $1.175 billion for rehabilitation and reconstruction \nassistance for fiscal years 2002-2006, to be distributed by USAID, with \nconditions for each year to ensure that benchmarks laid out in the \nDecember 5, 2001, Bonn Agreement between the various Afghan factions \nare being met; assistance for agriculture, health care, education, \nvocational training, disarmament and demobilization, and anticorruption \nand good governance programs; a special emphasis on assistance to women \nand girls; a report on assistance actually provided; and authority to \nprovide some of this assistance through a multilateral fund and/or \ninternational foundation.\n\n  Authorizes the President to furnish such sums as may be necessary to \nfinance a multilateral fund or international foundation, to assist in \nsecurity, rehabilitation, and reconstruction\n\n[[Page S13971]]\n\nefforts in Afghanistan, as described above.\n  Authorizes $60 million for Democracy and human rights initiatives for \nFY02 through FY04.\n  Authorizes $62.5 for a contribution to the U.N. Drug Control Program \nfor FY02 through FY04 to reduce or eliminate the trafficking of illicit \ndrugs in Afghanistan.\n  Authorizes $65 million for a new secure diplomatic facility in \nAfghanistan.\n  The legislation's message is simple: the United States is not only a \ngreat Nation, but a generous Nation. We keep our word, and stand ready \nto match our words with our actions. We must not turn our backs again \non the people of Afghanistan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Miller):\n  S. 1881. A bill to require the Federal Trade Commission to establish \na list of consumers who request not to receive telephone sales calls; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation along \nwith my friend and colleague from Georgia, Senator Miller, to help \nindividuals whose personal time is interrupted by the constant \nannoyance of telephone solicitors. Our bill, modeled after a \nConnecticut statute, would require the Federal Trade Commission to \nestablish a ``no-call'' list of consumers who do not wish to receive \nunsolicited telemarketing calls.\n  A Department of Labor survey reports that 84 percent of Americans \nwould trade income for more free time. People want to spend more time \nin the evening with their families, whether it be sitting down to \ndinner together, relaxing in front of the television, helping children \nwith homework, or catching up with household chores. I suspect most \npeople do not want to be inconvenienced with intrusive, unsolicited \ntelemarketing calls during the evening or anytime throughout the day.\n  Telemarketing revenue increased from $492.3 billion in 1998 to $585.9 \nbillion in 2000, which translates into millions of phone calls every \nyear. While many sales pitches are made on behalf of legitimate \norganizations and businesses, consumers still lose more than $40 \nbillion a year to fraudulent sales of goods and services over the \ntelephone. It is time to empower consumers with the ability to stop \nmost unsolicited calls, legitimate or otherwise, from entering their \nhomes and disturbing their lives.\n  In Connecticut, people now have the right to place their name on a \n``do not call'' list and more than 225,000 households have contacted \nthe Department on Consumer Protection to take advantage of the new law. \nAll telemarketers are required to consult that list and are prohibited \nfrom contacting households on the list. Other states, including \nAlabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Missouri, \nNew York, North Carolina, Oregon, and Tennessee, have enacted similar \nlaws.\n  States are taking this action because a 1994 Federal law to curb \nunsolicited telemarketing, while a good beginning, has not fully \nsucceeded in protecting families' privacy. In fact, individual \nconsumers must keep track of every telemarketer they have contacted to \ndetermine if a solicitation call was made in violation. There are \nnumerous exemptions to the Federal law, as well, as because there are \nno penalties for calls made in ``error,'' it has proved difficult to \nenforce.\n  Direct Marketing Association members do not oppose the Connecticut \nlaw. It is their belief that consumers placing their name on a list \nwould never buy a product from a telemarketer anyway, and thus the list \nsaves telemarketers time and resources.\n  Our legislation would take much of the burden off of consumers. At \nthe same time, a comprehensive and universal law actually could help \ntelemarketers by streamlining the process. The legislation we are \nintroducing today would require the Federal Trade Commission to \nestablish a ``no sales solicitation calls'' listing of consumers who do \nnot wish to receive unsolicited calls. Although certain types of calls \nwould be exempt, including calls from any company with whom a consumer \ncurrently does business, non-profits looking for donations, pollsters, \nand those publishing telephone directories, a violation of the ``no \ncall'' list would be deemed an unfair or deceptive trade practice and \nthe telemarketer could be fined.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important consumer legislation \nand I ask that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  I think the chair and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1881\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Act of \n1999 to revise eligibility and other requirements for loan guarantees \nunder that Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAppropriations.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I introduce, on behalf of myself \nand Senators DeWine, Dayton, Specter, Mukulski and Bayh the ``Emergency \nSteel Loan Guarantee Amendments of 2001.'' These amendments to the \nSteel Loan Guarantee Act of 1999 are designed to make the loan \nguarantee program more accessible to companies in urgent need of \nassistance as they attempt to recover from the devastating impacts of \nenormous, unfair import surges, as well as the effects of the current \nrecession.\n  A strong domestic steel industry is essential to our national \nsecurity. To ensure the continuing viability of this critical industry \nand to deal with the current crisis, we must act quickly, and we must \nact comprehensively.\n  First, the Administration must provide immediate and decisive strong \nrelief in the pending Section 201 steel import surge investigation. \nThat relief needs to include substantial tariffs as well as quotas.\n  Second, we need a formula for industry-wide sharing of the huge \nretiree health-care cost burdens resulting from the massive layoffs \nduring the 1970's and 1980's. We must protect retirees health care \nneeds without undermining the ability of companies attempting to \ncompete in an increasingly challenging marketplace. Several colleagues \nand I have previously introduced legislation to accomplish this, and we \nhave urged the Administration to support us in this effort as past of a \ncomprehensive solution to the steel crisis we face today.\n  Finally, companies urgently need access to capital to sustain their \noperations. This is precisely what the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee \nAct of 1999 was designed to insure. The tireless efforts and foresight \nof Senator Byrd led to the creation of the Emergency Steel Loan \nGuarantee Board in 1999, but since then massive import surges, the \ncurrent economic downturn and apparently overly-restrictive \ninterpretations of the Board's authority have made it all but \nimpossible for struggling steel firms to meet the Board's eligibility \ncriteria.\n  The bill we introduce today is designed to address these concerns. It \nprovides the Board with the necessary flexibility to provide these \nessential loan guarantees. In particular, the bill would do the \nfollowing: 1. Clarify that a company that has placed its facilities on \n``hot idle status'' is eligible to receive a loan guarantee. 2. \nIncrease the amount of loans guaranteed with respect to a single \nqualified steel company to $350,000,000. 3. Permit the Steel Loan \nGuarantee Board to guarantee a loan where there is a fair likelihood of \nrepayment, assuming vigorous and timely enforcement of our trade laws \nand general economic prosperity. 4. Provide flexibility to the Board in \nstructuring security arrangements to maximize participation of lenders. \n5. Expand the scope of lenders permitted to participate in a loan \nsubject to the guarantee to include public and private institutions, \nincluding the company's existing lenders. 6. Require the Board to adopt \nform of guarantee regulations no less favorable than those used in \nother government programs, including the Export-Import bank. 7. Include \nas a requirement for loan guarantees that the company's business plan \nmaximize both retention of jobs and capacity consistent with the long-\nterm economic viability of the company. 8. Increase the loan guarantee \nlevel for all loans to 95 percent.\n  The recent economic conditions facing the U.s. iron ore and steel \nindustry are of particular concern in Minnesota. We are extremely proud \nof our State's history as the Nation's largest producer of iron ore. \nThe taconite mines on the Iron Range in Minnesota and in our sister \nState of Michigan have provided key raw materials to the Nation's steel \nproducers for over a century.\n\n[[Page S13973]]\n\n  You will not find a harder-working, more committed group of workers \nanywhere in this country than you find in the iron ore and taconite \nindustry. This is a group of people who work under the toughest of \nconditions, are absolutely committed to their families, and who now \nface dire circumstances, through no fault of their own. Unfairly traded \niron ore, semi-finished steel and finished steel products are taking \ntheir jobs.\n  Earlier this year, LTV Steel Mining Company halted production at its \nHoyt Lakes, MN mine, leaving 1,400 workers out of good paying jobs and \naffecting nearly 5,000 additional workers. We need to act and we need \nto act now. Workers in the steel, iron ore and taconite industries want \nnothing more than the chance to do their jobs. The bill we introduce \ntoday is one part of the answer. I urge my colleagues to join with me \nin moving this legislation as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague and friend \nfrom Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, to introduce the Emergency Steel \nLoan Guarantee Amendments Act. This legislation would improve the \nEmergency Steel Loan Guarantee program.\n  Our steel industry is on the brink of financial collapse because of \nunfair and illegal trade practices. To date, some 25 U.S. steel \ncompanies, including LTV Steel in Cleveland, Ohio, have filed \nbankruptcy. These companies employ thousands of workers and are \nresponsible for providing benefits to their retirees. If our steel \nindustry goes under, the consequences to our nation, and particularly \nOhio, would be grave. Steel is vitally important to our military and \neconomic security. During times of crisis, the industry has been a \nsource of strength for America. With our economy sputtering and our \nnation fighting a new war on terrorism, we need a healthy steel \nindustry now more than ever.\n  In 1998, more than 41 million tons of steel found their way to U.S. \nmarkets. This was an 83 percent increase over the 23 million net ton \naverage for the previous eight years. While in 1999 some claimed that \nthe steel import crisis was over, they were soon reminded how volatile \nthe situation really is. In 2000, 37.8 million tons of steel flooded \nU.S. markets. This was almost as high as the record 1998 import levels.\n  For almost 50 years, foreign steel producers have received direct and \noften illegal assistance from their governments in the form of \nsubsidies or market intervention. This has contributed to a worldwide \nover production of steel. In 1999, the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, OECD, found that world steel making \ncapacity remained ``well-above'' production between 1985 and 1999. Much \nof this excess steel has been shipped to the United States and priced \nwell below U.S. steel. In some cases, these imports were dumped, \nsubsidized, and shipped in such increased quantities as to inflict \nserious financial harm to U.S. producers.\n  As a key supporter of the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee program, I \nbelieve that we must modify the program to make it work better. It is \ntrue that we have changed it this year; extending its life and \nincreasing the portion of the loan covered by the guarantee from 85 \npercent to in some cases 95 percent. However, we need to do more. The \nWellstone/DeWine legislation would clarify that a company, such as LTV, \nwhich has placed its facilities on ``hot idle status'' is eligible to \nreceive a loan guarantee. It would also increase the amount of loans \nguaranteed with respect to a single qualified steel company to \n$350,000,000; permit the Steel Loan Guarantee Board to guarantee a loan \nwhere there is a fair likelihood of repayment, assuming vigorous and \ntimely enforcement of our trade laws and general economic prosperity; \nprovide flexibility to the Board in structuring security arrangements \nto maximize participation of lenders; expand the scope of lenders \npermitted to participate in a loan subject to the guarantee to include \npublic and private institutions, including the company's existing \nlenders; require the Board to adopt a form of guarantee regulations no \nless favorable than those used in other government programs, including \nthe Export-Import bank, and; increase the loan guarantee level for all \nloans to 95 percent.\n  We in the steel community are grateful for the President's leadership \nin initiating the Section 201 trade investigation, and we were \ngenerally pleased with the International Trade Commission's \nrecommendations. I was pleased to see the Customs Service proceeding in \na timely manner with the release of dumping and subsidy offset payments \nto the victims of illegal trade practices, including LTV, under the \nContinued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act. However, without these \nchanges to the Emergency Steel Loan program, many of our steel \ncompanies will not survive. We have an opportunity to send a powerful \nmessage to the world that America is standing by our steel industry in \nits time of need just as the industry has stood by America in her time \nof need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 1885. A bill to establish the elderly housing plus health support \ndemonstration program to modernize public housing for elderly and \ndisabled persons; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 1886. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nbusiness credit for supported elderly housing; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills that \nwill help address a growing problem in America, our ability to provide \nsafe and affordable housing that meets the needs of older Americans. \nCurrently there are 35 million Americans over 65 years old. That number \nwill double within the next thirty years. By 2030, 20 percent of the \nU.S. population will be over 65 years old.\n  Both of the bills that I am introducing will promote the development \nof assisted living programs to provide a wide range of services, \nincluding medical assistance, housekeeping services, hygiene and \ngrooming, and meals preparation. Providing these services will in turn \ngive older Americans greater opportunities to decide for themselves \nwhere they live and how they exercise their independence.\n  The first bill I am introducing is the ``Elderly Plus Supportive \nHealth Support Demonstration Act,'' which will provide Federal grants \nto allow public housing authorities around the country to develop new \nstrategies for providing better housing for senior citizens. Nearly one \nthird of all public housing units are occupied by senior citizens. This \nfigure has been steadily growing in recent years and will undoubtedly \ncontinue to grow in the future. It is critically important that we \nremain committed to providing low-income seniors with safe and \naffordable housing.\n  Unfortunately, as we examine the public housing stock across the \ncountry, we find a bleak situation. Over 66 percent of existing public \nhousing units are more than 30 years old and most are not designed to \nmeet the needs of older Americans. For example, too few of our housing \nunits are equipped with equipment and features that facilitate mobility \nfor those in wheelchairs. Even such simple things as having a kitchen \ncounter top that can be reached from a wheelchair may make the \ndifference between a senior being able to stay in her home or having to \nleave, often to be sent to an institution where seniors have less \nindependence and control over their lives. The ``Elder Housing Plus \nHealth Support Demonstration Act'' will give public housing authorities \nthe tools they need to improve our public housing stock so our seniors \nwill not be prematurely forced out of their homes.\n  The second bill that I am introducing is the ``Assisted Living Tax \nCredit Act,'' which will provide a tax incentive to help construct \nassisted living housing for low- and moderate-income Americans. The \ncurrent stock of assisted living facilities is inadequate to meet \ndemand in certain places around the country and the stock of \nmoderately-priced units is even tighter. The demand for assisted living \nunits will only increase as our population ages and this highly desired \nhousing choice should be available to all Americans. The ``Assisted \nLiving Tax Credit Act'' will help make assisted living arrangements \navailable to those who have previously been priced out of the market.\n  The scarceness of affordable assisted living units has social costs \nthat we\n\n[[Page S13974]]\n\nmust consider as we set national housing policies for the future. \nOften, the cost of taking care of an aging family member can be \ndevastating to American families. Too often, working men and women are \ntorn between the need to maintain their jobs and the desire to provide \nthe best possible care to their aging family members.\n  Advances in medicine are allowing us to live longer, healthier lives. \nLongevity is a great blessing, but it also poses significant challenges \nfor individuals, families, and society as whole. One of the largest \nchallenges we will face in the decades ahead is the challenge of \ndefining new kinds of housing that respond to the needs of our growing \nelderly population.\n  It is my hope that the bills I am introducing today will generate \nearnest discussion on these important matters and will ultimately lead \nto action to ensure that every American senior can live in security and \ndignity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the ``Elderly Housing Plus \nHealth Support Demonstration Act'' be printed in the Record.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Elderly Housing Plus Health \n     Support Demonstration Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) there are not fewer than 34,100,000 Americans who are \n     65 years of age and older, and persons who are 85 years of \n     age or older comprise almost one-quarter of that population;\n       (2) the Bureau of the Census of the Department of Commerce \n     estimates that, by 2030, the elderly population will double \n     to 70,000,000 persons;\n       (3) according to the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development report ``Housing Our Elders--A Report Card on the \n     Housing Conditions and Needs of Older Americans'', the \n     largest and fastest growing segments of the older population \n     include many people who have historically been vulnerable \n     economically and in the housing market--women, minorities, \n     and people over the age of 85;\n       (4) many elderly persons are at significant risk with \n     respect to the availability, stability, and accessibility of \n     affordable housing;\n       (5) one third of public housing residents are approximately \n     62 years of age or older, making public housing the largest \n     Federal housing program for senior citizens;\n       (6) the elderly population residing in public housing is \n     older, poorer, frailer, and more racially diverse than the \n     elderly population residing in other assisted housing;\n       (7) two-thirds of the public housing developments for the \n     elderly, including those that also serve the disabled, were \n     constructed before 1970 and are in dire need of major \n     rehabilitation and reconfiguration, such as rehabilitation to \n     provide new roofs, energy-efficient heating, cooling, utility \n     systems, accessible units, and up-to-date safety features;\n       (8) many of the dwelling units in public housing \n     developments for elderly and disabled persons are undersized, \n     are inaccessible to residents with physical limitations, do \n     not comply with the requirements under the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990, or lack railings, grab bars, \n     emergency call buttons, and wheelchair accessible ramps;\n       (9) a study conducted for the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development found that the cost of the basic \n     modernization needs for public housing for elderly and \n     disabled persons exceeds $5,700,000,000;\n       (10) a growing number of elderly and disabled persons face \n     unnecessary institutionalization because of the absence of \n     appropriate supportive services and assisted living \n     facilities in their residences;\n       (11) for many elderly and disabled persons, independent \n     living in a non-institutionalization setting is a preferable \n     housing alternative to costly institutionalization, and would \n     allow public monies to be more effectively used to provide \n     necessary services for such persons;\n       (12) congregate housing and supportive services coordinated \n     by service coordinators is a proven and cost-effective means \n     of enabling elderly and disabled persons to remain in place \n     with dignity and independence; and\n       (13) the effective provision of congregate services and \n     assisted living in public housing developments requires the \n     redesign of units and buildings to accommodate independent \n     living.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish a demonstration program to make \n     competitive grants to provide state-of-the-art health-\n     supportive housing with assisted living opportunities for \n     elderly and disabled persons;\n       (2) to provide funding to enhance, make safe and \n     accessible, and extend the useful life of public housing \n     developments for the elderly and disabled and to increase \n     their accessibility to supportive services;\n       (3) to provide elderly and disabled public housing \n     residents a readily available choice in living arrangements \n     by utilizing the services of service coordinators and \n     providing a continuum of care that allows such residents to \n     age in place;\n       (4) to incorporate congregate housing service programs more \n     fully into public housing operations; and\n       (5) to accomplish such purposes and provide such funding \n     under existing provisions of law that currently authorize all \n     activities to be conducted under the program.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for renewal of project-based assisted \nhousing contracts at reimbursement levels that are sufficient to \nsustain operations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nintended to correct serious inequities created by existing statutes \naffecting owners, financing agencies, and low-income residents \nparticipating in one of HUD's Section 8 multifamily rental subsidy \nprograms.\n  I have worked closely with the Maine Congressional Delegation on this \nmatter, as well as the Maine State Housing Authority and several \nhousing projects in Maine, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment--HUD. At issue is HUD's interpretation of Section 524 of \nthe Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 \nas it relates to the renewal of Section 8 ``moderate rehabilitation'' \ncontracts in Maine and elsewhere.\n  The effect of HUD's interpretation of current law results in the \napplication of HUD ``published Fair Market Rents.'' Such rents are \noften well below the actual comparable market rent. If this problem is \nnot addressed, and addressed soon, I am very concerned that we could \nlose this affordable rental housing stock in Maine, resulting in the \ndisplacement of the residents of these properties.\n  The Maine Delegation worked with HUD over the last year to try to \nidentify an administrative solution to this problem, but have been \nadvised by HUD that we must pursue a change in law to enable the \nprojects to obtain reimbursements at a level sufficient to sustain \noperations. Accordingly, the legislation I am introducing today will \ncorrect the portion of the statute that could result in the loss of \nthis critical housing stock.\n  The program involved is the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation \nprogram, which is administered by local and state housing agencies \nthroughout the nation. Existing law, contained in Section 524 of the \nMultifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997, as \namended--MAHRA--regarding renewal of expiring project-based Section 8 \ncontracts, treats contracts under the Moderate Rehabilitation\n\n[[Page S13979]]\n\nProgram in a fundamentally different way from contracts under the New \nConstruction, Substantial Rehabilitation, and Loan Management Set-Aside \nprograms.\n  Section 524(b)(3) of MAHRA provides a separate and distinct formula \nfor calculating renewal rents for expiring contracts under the Moderate \nRehabilitation program. The formula is more restrictive than the \nformula applicable to expiring contracts under other Section 8 \nprograms, based on an assumption that the debt service payments on the \noriginal moderate rehabilitation financing would not be a continuing \nobligation of the project owner after expiration of the original \nsubsidy contract.\n  The assumption was correct as to many projects under the Moderate \nRehabilitation program, but it is not true as to some significant \nprojects serving particularly vulnerable populations, including two \nvery important community projects located in Maine, which I will \ndescribe later.\n  Perhaps an even greater concern than the formula itself, however, is \na ruling by HUD's Office of General Counsel that Section 524(b)(3) \npresents the exclusive method for renewal of expiring contracts under \nthe Moderate Rehabilitation program. In order to appreciate the drastic \nand problematic results of this opinion, it is necessary to understand \nthe relationship between the Section 8 renewal legislation and the \nMark-to-Market program, also enacted by MAHRA.\n  According to HUD, housing subsidy contracts are expiring on thousands \nof privately owned multifamily properties with federally insured \nmortgages. Many of these contracts set rents at amounts higher than \nthose of the local market. As these subsidy contracts expire, the Mark-\nto-Market program will reduce rents to market levels and will \nrestructure existing debt to levels supportable by these rents.\n  The basic principle of this integrated legislative structure is that \nfor projects financed by FHA-insured mortgages, expiring Section 8 \ncontracts which are subsidizing rents higher than market rents in the \narea will be renewed at rents reduced to a level not higher than the \nmarket rents. Where this reduced rent will not support debt service on \nthe FHA-insured mortgage, the mortgage will be restructured pursuant to \nMark-to-Market. The basic tradeoff is that while the Federal Government \nmay bear some cost in the FHA insurance fund, it will be a lesser cost \nthan continuing to subsidize above-market rents.\n  However, not all Section 8 projects are financed by FHA-insured \nmortgages. Many, instead, are financed by State housing agency bond-\nfinanced mortgages without FHA insurance, and some are even \nconventionally financed. The legislation provides, therefore, for an \nimportant ``exception'' to the requirement that rents be reduced upon \nrenewal to market rents. Under Sections 524(b)(1) and (2), Section 8 \ncontracts for ``exception'' projects--which are principally projects \nnot eligible for Mark-to-Market because their mortgages are not FHA-\ninsured--may be renewed at rents not exceeding the lower of current \nrents, as adjusted by an operating cost adjustment factor, and a \n``budget-based rent'' approved by HUD, notwithstanding that such rents \nmay exceed market rents in the area.\n  The effect of the HUD ruling that Section 524(b)(3) provides the \nexclusive authority for renewing expiring contracts in the Moderate \nRehabilitation program is that ``exception'' project treatment under \nSection 524(b)(1) and (2) is made unavailable for Moderate \nRehabilitation projects. The irony of this is that while the majority \nof Section 8 New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation projects, \nand of course all Loan Management Set-Aside projects, are financed by \nFHA-insured mortgages--and therefore non-insured projects are truly the \n``exception'' under those programs--the opposite is true in the \nModerate Rehabilitation program.\n  Information provided by HUD indicates that not more than \napproximately 13 percent of all units ever subsidized under the \nModerate Rehabilitation program were in projects financed by FHA-\ninsured mortgages. Non-insured mortgages, therefore, were the rule, not \nthe exception, in the Moderate Rehabilitation program.\n  The impact of this circumstance is well illustrated by two projects \nin Maine, both of which represent vital community resources for highly \nvulnerable low-income populations.\n  Loring House is a 104-unit development in Portland. The building \noriginally was the Portland City Hospital, which was closed by the City \nin the early 1980s. It was converted to a residential facility for \nelderly and handicapped residents with significant public participation \nand support, including tax-exempt bond first mortgage financing by the \nMaine State Housing Authority, Moderate Rehabilitation Section 8 rental \nsubsidies from the Portland and Westbrook public housing authorities, \nand second mortgage operating deficit financing by the Portland Housing \nDevelopment Corporation.\n  The Loring House Section 8 contract expired in stages commencing \nDecember 31, 2000. The Loring House mortgage financing is not FHA-\ninsured, but based on the HUD opinion I described, ``exception'' \nproject treatment was denied. Under the Section 524(b)(3) formula, the \nSection 8 contract rents were reduced approximately 14 percent on \nrenewal--this notwithstanding that the project was already incurring \nsubstantial operating deficits, supported by public operating deficit \nfinancing, even under the previous rents. The ultimate financial risk \non this development is borne by the Maine State Housing Authority.\n  Loring House is an important community resource aside from the \nsubstantial public stake in its financing. Since 1985, the resident \npopulation has undergone a significant transformation, attributable \nlargely to deinstitutionalization of two state mental institutions and \nconcentration of State-supported comprehensive mental health services \nin the Portland area.\n  It is estimated that currently 70 percent of the tenant population \nare impacted by mental health, mental retardation and/or substance \nabuse issues. This change in population served has increased the total \nindependence of the project on project-based assistance if it is to \ncontinue to serve this population. The only feasible avenue to \nfinancial survival of this facility, much less to its continued ability \nto serve its special population, is availability of ``exception'' \nproject treatment.\n  Maison Marcotte is a 128-unit congregate care facility located in \nLewiston. The building was built originally in the 1920s as a nursing \nhome on a health care campus owned by the Sisters of Charity Health \nSystem.\n  Following construction of a new nursing home on the campus in the \nearly 1980s, the Health System ground leased the former nursing home to \na for-profit development group which renovated the facility into \nseveral discrete uses, including a kitchen and cafeteria facility for \nthe health care campus, a wing of physician offices, and 128 one-\nbedroom congregate care units. The renovation was assisted by a 110-\nunit Moderate Rehabilitation award by the Lewiston Housing Authority; \n18 units are private-pay.\n  A nonprofit subsidiary of Sisters of Charity Health System took over \npossession and operation of the facility following a Chapter 11 \nreorganization of the for-profit developer in the late 1980s. The bank \ndebt on the facility was refinanced in 1993 by a tax-exempt bond \nfinanced first mortgage loan made by the Maine State Housing Authority \nwhich matures in 2023. The mortgage financing is not FHA-insured. The \nModerate Rehabilitation HAP Contract expires October 31, 2001.\n  The current Moderate Rehabilitation contract rents for the one-\nbedroom units are substantially lower than the private-pay rents for \nsimilar units in the facility. Nevertheless, contract renewal pursuant \nto the existing Section 524(b)(3) formula would result in a 20-percent \nrent reduction, which clearly would threaten survival of the project. \nThe financial risk, again, is borne solely by the Maine State Housing \nAuthority.\n  The property might appear to have the option of opting out and \nconverting to all private-pay units at the higher rental, but that is \nnot the desire of the nonprofit operator nor would it be consistent \nwith the low-income use restrictions arising from the tax-exempt bond \nissue. The only feasible outcome for this facility which would permit \ncontinuance of its commitment to very low-income elderly residents is \nrenewal at ``exception rent'' pursuant to Section 524(b)(1).\n  I find it inconceivable that Congress consciously intended to impose \nthe financial impact of Section 8 rent reductions in cases such as \nthese onto State housing finance agencies. I also have no reason to \nthink that the circumstances of these two projects, in which state \nhousing agencies have undertaken the financing risk of long-term \nmortgages backed by short-term rental subsidy contracts because of the \nimportant public purposes of the projects, are unique to the State of \nMaine.\n\n[[Page S13980]]\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today, therefore, would correct this \ninequity by simply striking subsection (b)(3) of Section 524. Under \nthis legislation, the renewal of expiring contracts in the Moderate \nRehabilitation program would be governed by the same renewal rent \nprovisions as are applicable to expiring contracts in the New \nConstruction and Substantial Rehabilitation programs, including the \navailability of ``exception'' project rents where the project financing \nis not FHA-insured.\n  Finally, the legislation would also strike one other current \nprovision of the Section 8 renewal legislation which singles out \nModerate Rehabilitation projects for unfavorable treatment and, more \nimportantly, excludes Moderate Rehabilitation projects from the \nimportant policy preference for encouraging Section 8 project owners to \ncontinue their participation in the program and thereby maintain the \navailability of the units for low-income occupancy.\n  An essential tool for the preservation program, as strengthened by \namendments to MAHRA enacted in 1999, is the ability to permit Section 8 \nowners currently receiving below-market rents under expiring contracts \nto receive rent increases upon renewal up to the level of market rents \nin the area, in exchange for a commitment to remain in the program for \nnot less than an additional 5 years. Expiring contracts under the \nModerate Rehabilitation program were excluded from this authority. \nHowever, from the standpoint of lower-income families needing \nsubsidized housing opportunities in their communities, I believe the \npreservation of units which happen to be subsidized under the Moderate \nRehabilitation program is no less vital than preservation of units \nunder other subdivisions of the Section 8 program.\n\n  The Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program, while relatively small \nin comparison to the New Construction or Substantial Rehabilitation \nprograms, is nevertheless widespread throughout the nation, in both \nlarge and small communities. It also has suffered a marked attrition of \nunits, presumably due in large part to owner opt-outs in recent years. \nInformation provided by HUD indicates that out of the total of \napproximately 120,000 units that we assisted under the Moderate \nRehabilitation program, 52,000 units remained in the program in May \n2000.\n  HUD information also indicated that 113 separate housing agencies in \n42 States across the nation plus Puerto Rico, including State as well \nas local agencies, had 100 or more units under contract in May 2000. \nSince many if not most Moderate Rehabilitation project owners receive \nrents under their original contracts that are lower than market rents, \nit cannot be doubted that the ability to receive market rents could \nencourage many owners to remain in the program and to continue to \nprovide affordable housing opportunities for their communities.\n  Accordingly, the legislation I am introducing today would also strike \nthe current exclusion of contracts under the Moderate Rehabilitation \nprogram from the ability to receive renewal rents increased to market \nrent levels.\n  The overall effect of my legislation is to place expiring contracts \nunder the Moderate Rehabilitation program on an equal footing with \nother expiring Section 8 contracts having similar characteristics in \nterms of comparison of contract rents with market rents and in terms of \nfinancing source--HUD-insured or non-insured.\n  I believe that preservation of these critical housing units is an \nimperative to my constituents and the communities I represent, as well \nas communities and projects elsewhere. As such, I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1889. A bill to provide for work authorization for nonimmigrant \nspouses of intracompany transferees, and to reduce the period of time \nduring which certain intracompany transferees have to be continuously \nemployed before applying for admission to the United States; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1890. A bill to provide for work authorization for nonimmigrant \nspouses of treaty traders and treaty investors; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to introduce companion measures to \ntwo House bills that would end the barring of the spouses of `E' and \n`L' nonimmigrant visa holders from work authorization while they are in \nthe United States. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 2277 and \nH.R. 2278 with broad bipartisan support earlier this year and the \nSenate Judiciary Committee approved the House versions of both bills by \nunanimous consent earlier today.\n  The companion to H.R. 2277 amends the Immigration and Nationality Act \nto authorize the husbands and wives of treaty traders or treaty \ninvestors working in the United States, or E visa holders, to work \nthemselves. The companion to H.R. 2278 is very similar, granting \nemployment authorization to the spouses of intracompany transfers, or L \nvisa holders. This measure would also allow individuals to apply for L \nvisas after six months, rather than one year, of employment with the \ncompany with which they are working in the United States. I believe \nthat both of these bills are very reasonable and deserve the support of \nthe Senate.\n  Both pieces of legislation would end practices that deserve change as \nthey currently stand. It is not right to force one spouse in a family \nto forgo employment simply because the other is working in the United \nStates. Granting employment authorization to the spouses of E and L \nvisa recipients makes it easier for foreign countries and multinational \ncompanies to persuade highly qualified employees, who are used to \nhaving both spouses actively employed, to relocate to the United \nStates.\n  The time requirement for L visa applicants also warrants change. \nCurrent law requires that an L visa not be granted unless the applicant \nhas been employed for at least 1 year with the employer in question. In \nmany situations, this is too restrictive. This requirement inhibits \nfirms who wish to hire individuals with specialized skills to meet the \nneeds of clients in the United States. A shorter prior employment \nperiod would allow companies to meet the needs of their clients in a \nmore timely manner.\n  I thank the House of Representatives and especially Congressman \nGekas, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims, \nfor their hard work on these bills. Given the work between the House \nand Senate on these bills, I feel comfortable urging my colleagues to \ngive these issues all due attention and support these measures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1891. A bill to extend the basic pilot program for employment \neligibility verification, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I stand to introduce a companion bill to \nH.R. 3030, the House bill that would extend a pilot program for \nemployment eligibility verification of non-citizens. This bill would \nextend the program, set to expire this year, for two more years.\n  This basic pilot program, available to employers in California, \nFlorida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas, was authorized in \n1996, and has proved to be an incredibly effective resource since them. \nThe program allows participating employers to electronically access \ncertain government databases in order to verify the employment \nauthorization of non-citizens. Electronic confirmation of this \ninformation provides a critical tool for employers to ensure that they \nare not hiring unauthorized aliens. This program allows employers to \nprotect themselves from the employer sanction provisions of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act, while providing meaningful deterrence \nto would-be employers who lack appropriate authorization from the INS.\n  During this time of increased national security, we can all \nappreciate any tool that will facilitate enforcement of our immigration \nlaws. After communication between the House and the Senate on this \nissue, and the favorable report from the Senate Judiciary Committee \nthis morning, I have little doubt that my colleagues in the Senate will \nrecognize the useful nature of the Pilot Program and support its \nextension.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S.J. Res. 30. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States regarding the appointment of \nindividuals to serve as Members of the House of Representatives in the \nevent a significant number of Members are unable to serve at any time \nbecause of death or incapacity; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \ndiscuss language for a proposed constitutional amendment that would \nprovide for the appointment of temporary Representatives by a Governor \nif fifty percent or more of the members of the House were killed or \nincapacitated. I place this\n\n[[Page S13981]]\n\nlanguage in the Record not with the intention of urging its passage \nthis session, but rather to afford my colleagues an opportunity to \noffer their comments and suggestions, and to afford them the \nopportunity to consider co-sponsoring this proposed amendment.\n  The events of September 11 and the subsequent anthrax attacks \ndirected against members of Congress and other Americans highlight the \nvery real possibility that the Senate and House of Representatives \ncould suffer catastrophic casualties that would prevent either or both \nbodies from fulfilling their essential roles in the governance of our \nNation. Despite the morbidity of such a scenario, it is essential that \nwe put in place a contingency plan for the effective continuance of our \ndemocracy. The Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution allows for the \ntemporary replacement of Senators by appointment by the Governor of \ntheir respective States. However, no such provision applies to members \nof the House. Only a proposed amendment to the United States \nConstitution would remedy this deficiency.\n  The only means to replace members of the House is by special \nelection. Article 1, Section 2, clause 14, states that ``[w]hen \nvacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive \nAuthority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such \nVacancies.'' My legislative language proposes that if at any time, \nfifty percent or more of the Members of the House of Representatives \nare unable to carry out their duties because of death or incapacity, \neach Governor of a State represented by such Member would have the \npower to appoint an otherwise qualified individual to take the place of \nthe Member as soon as practicable after certification of the Member's \ndeath or incapacity. Article I, Section 4, clause I states that ``a \nMajority of each [House] shall constitute a Quroum to do Business.'' \nAccordingly, this extraordinary measure giving a Governor the power of \nappointment of a replacement Member would be triggered, when due to \ndeath or incapacity, the House would not have a quorum to conduct \nbusiness.\n\n  My proposed amendment requires an individual appointed to take the \nplace of the Member to serve until a Member is elected to fill the \nvacancy by a special election to be held at any time during the 90-day \nperiod which begins on the date of the individual's appointment, except \nthat if a regularly schuled general election for the office was \nscheduled to be held during such period or 30 days thereafter, no \nspecial election would be held, and the Member elected in such \nregularly scheduled general election would fill the vacancy upon \nelection. Further, my proposed amendment allows for the appointed \nindividual to be a candidate in the special election or regularly \nscheduled general election.\n  The Governor would be required to appoint a person of the same party \nas the ``replaced'' member. This stipulation would ensure that the \ncitizens of a congressional district would continue to be represented \nby a Congressperson from the same party.\n  While I understand that this is an issue we would rather not grapple \nwith, it is imperative that we deliberate and ensure that, in case of a \ncatastrophe, our system of governance will continue to remain strong \nand stable.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are 361 public ports in the United States which \n     have a broad range of characteristics, and all of which are \n     an integral part of our Nation's commerce.\n       (2) United States ports conduct over 95 percent of United \n     States overseas trade. Over the next 20 years, the total \n     volume of imported and exported goods at ports is expected to \n     more than double.\n       (3) The variety of trade and commerce that are carried out \n     at ports has greatly expanded. Bulk cargo, containerized \n     cargo, passenger transport and tourism, intermodal \n     transportation systems, and complex domestic and \n     international trade relationships have significantly changed \n     the nature, conduct, and complexity of port commerce.\n       (4) The United States is increasingly dependent on imported \n     energy for a substantial share of supply, and a disruption of \n     supply would seriously harm consumers and our economy.\n       (5) The top 50 ports in the United States account for about \n     90 percent of all the cargo tonnage. Twenty-five United \n     States ports account for 98 percent of all container \n     shipments. Cruise ships visiting foreign destinations embark \n     from 16 ports. Ferries in the United States transport \n     113,000,000 passengers and 32,000,000 vehicles per year.\n       (6) In the larger ports, the activities can stretch along a \n     coast for many miles, including public roads within their \n     geographic boundaries. The facilities used to support \n     arriving and departing cargo are sometimes miles from the \n     coast.\n       (7) Ports often are a major locus of Federal crime, \n     including drug trafficking, cargo theft, and smuggling of \n     contraband and aliens. The criminal conspiracies often \n     associated with these crimes can pose threats to the people \n     and critical infrastructures of port cities. Ports that \n     accept international cargo have a higher risk of \n     international crimes like drug and alien smuggling and trade \n     fraud.\n       (8) Ports are often very open and exposed and, by the very \n     nature of their role in promoting the free flow of commerce, \n     are susceptible to large scale terrorism that could pose a \n     threat to coastal, Great Lake, or riverain populations. Port \n     terrorism could pose a significant threat to the ability of \n     the United States to pursue its national security objectives.\n       (9) United States ports are international boundaries, \n     however, unlike United States airports and land borders, \n     United States ports receive no Federal funds for security \n     infrastructure.\n       (10) Current inspection levels of containerized cargo are \n     insufficient to counter potential security risks. Technology \n     is currently not adequately deployed to allow for the non-\n     intrusive inspection of containerized cargo. Additional \n     promising technology is in the process of being developed \n     that could inspect cargo in a non-intrusive and efficient \n     fashion.\n       (11) The burgeoning cruise ship industry poses a special \n     risk from a security perspective.\n       (12) Effective physical security and access control in \n     ports is fundamental to deterring and preventing potential \n     threats to port operations, and cargo shipments.\n       (13) Securing entry points, open storage areas, and \n     warehouses throughout the port, controlling the movements of \n     trucks transporting cargo through the port, and examining or \n     inspecting containers, warehouses, and ships at berth or in \n     the harbor are all important requirements that should be \n     implemented.\n       (14) Identification procedures for arriving workers are \n     important tools to deter and prevent port cargo crimes, \n     smuggling, and terrorist actions.\n       (15) On April 27, 1999, the President established the \n     Interagency Commission on Crime and Security in United States \n     Ports to undertake a comprehensive study of the nature and \n     extent of the problem of crime in our ports, as well as the \n     ways in which governments at all levels are responding.\n       (16) The Commission has issued findings that indicate the \n     following:\n       (A) Frequent crimes in ports include drug smuggling, \n     illegal car exports, fraud (including Intellectual Property \n     Rights and other trade violations), and cargo theft.\n       (B) Data about crime in ports has been very difficult to \n     collect.\n       (C) Internal conspiracies are an issue at many ports, and \n     contribute to Federal crime.\n\n[[Page S13988]]\n\n       (D) Intelligence and information sharing among law \n     enforcement agencies needs to be improved and coordinated at \n     many ports.\n       (E) Many ports do not have any idea about the threats they \n     face from crime, terrorism, and other security-related \n     activities because of a lack of credible threat information.\n       (F) A lack of minimum physical, procedural, and personnel \n     security standards at ports and at terminals, warehouses, \n     trucking firms, and related facilities leaves many ports and \n     port users vulnerable to theft, pilferage, and unauthorized \n     access by criminals.\n       (G) Access to ports and operations within ports is often \n     uncontrolled.\n       (H) Coordination and cooperation between law enforcement \n     agencies in the field is often fragmented.\n       (I) Meetings between law enforcement personnel, carriers, \n     marine terminal operators, and port authorities regarding \n     security are not being held routinely in the ports. These \n     meetings could increase coordination and cooperation at the \n     local level.\n       (J) Security-related equipment such as small boats, \n     cameras, and vessel tracking devices is lacking at many \n     ports.\n       (K) Detection equipment such as large-scale x-ray machines \n     is lacking at many high-risk ports.\n       (L) A lack of timely, accurate, and complete manifest \n     (including in-bond) and trade (entry, importer, etc.) data \n     negatively impacts law enforcement's ability to function \n     effectively.\n       (M) Criminal organizations are exploiting weak security in \n     ports and related intermodal connections to commit a wide \n     range of cargo crimes. Levels of containerized cargo volumes \n     are forecasted to increase significantly, which will create \n     more opportunities for crime while lowering the statistical \n     risk of detection and interdiction.\n       (17) United States ports are international boundaries \n     that--\n       (A) are particularly vulnerable to threats of drug \n     smuggling, illegal alien smuggling, cargo theft, illegal \n     entry of cargo and contraband;\n       (B) may present weaknesses in the ability of the United \n     States to realize its national security objectives; and\n       (C) may serve as a vector or target for terrorist attacks \n     aimed at the population of the United States.\n       (18) It is in the best interests of the United States--\n       (A) to be mindful that United States ports are \n     international ports of entry and that the primary obligation \n     for the security of international ports of entry lies with \n     the Federal government;\n       (B) to be mindful of the need for the free flow of \n     interstate and foreign commerce and the need to ensure the \n     efficient movement of cargo in interstate and foreign \n     commerce and the need for increased efficiencies to address \n     trade gains;\n       (C) to increase United States port security by establishing \n     a better method of communication amongst law enforcement \n     officials responsible for port boundary, security, and trade \n     issues;\n       (D) to formulate requirements for physical port security, \n     recognizing the different character and nature of United \n     States ports, and to require the establishment of security \n     programs at ports;\n       (E) to provide financial incentives to help the States and \n     private sector to increase physical security of United States \n     ports;\n       (F) to invest in long-term technology to facilitate the \n     private sector development of technology that will assist in \n     the non-intrusive timely detection of crime or potential \n     crime;\n       (G) to harmonize data collection on port-related and other \n     cargo theft, in order to address areas of potential threat to \n     safety and security;\n       (H) to create shared inspection facilities to help \n     facilitate the timely and efficient inspection of people and \n     cargo in United States ports;\n       (I) to improve Customs reporting procedures to enhance the \n     potential detection of crime in advance of arrival or \n     departure of cargoes; and\n       (J) to promote private sector procedures that provide for \n     in-transit visibility and support law enforcement efforts \n     directed at managing the security risks of cargo shipments.\n\n     SEC. 102.

Mr. President, in a few moments I am going to ask that \nthe Senate take up and pass the tax extenders legislation. It is \nunfortunate that the Congress, along with the President, were unable to \nagree on a stimulus to the American economy that would provide not only \na boost to the American economy, but also assistance to those who have \nlost unemployment compensation benefits as a consequence of the decline \nin the economy accelerated by the events of September 11, as well as \nthose who have lost health insurance as a consequence of losing their \njobs.\n  It is almost axiomatic that the economy is in tough shape. I do not \nexpect with a high degree of certainty that the Congress is going to \ncome back to where we would like to be very quickly.\n  There are some small points which I think we should keep in mind. One \nis that auto sales broke records with zero percent financing, and the \nauto companies get most of their income from financing. So they were \nnot making any money these past couple of months, which means reports \ncoming out next quarter and even this quarter will not be high.\n  The same applies to retail sales. It is the Christmas season. We know \nstores across the country, in order to encourage more sales, are giving \ntremendous discounts, which clearly discounts that company's income.\n  We are going to have to face a stimulus package and should this next \nyear. I hope we do it in a much more accommodating manner than we have \nin the last several weeks.\n  I am not going to get into the blame game. I am not going to say who\n\n[[Page S14030]]\n\ncaused this collapse. I have lots of ideas. That is history. What \nhappened happened. It is now time to go forward. I urge my colleagues, \nafter appropriate rest and a break over the holidays, when they are \nrested up, to come back with renewed vigor and renewed dedication and \nperseverance to working together and, most important, listening to the \nother side.\n  Too often we tend to talk, and we do not listen enough. If we were to \nlisten a little more, even for a nanosecond, I think that would be \nprogress. I urge my colleagues to listen to different points of view \nnext year.\n  Nevertheless, I think we should salvage whatever we can, and part of \nthat is what is called the tax extenders. These include matters that \nare very important for the economy and for people who are relying on \nthem. One is the work opportunity tax credit which helps people find \njobs.\n  The Joint Committee on Tax estimates 450,000 to 525,000 will be hired \nwith this credit next year. It expires this year. All provisions I \nmentioned expire this year, and I think it is important to keep those \nin existence so next year people can rely upon them.\n  Another is extending the qualified zone academy bond that authorizes \n$400 billion in bonds to States in the calendar year 2002. That is to \nrenovate schools and purchase equipment. That expires this year and \nwill terminate unless this legislation I mentioned passes.\n  A key point, and I urge my colleagues to listen to this, it is a \nmatter of confidence and certainty. These are provisions upon which so \nmany people in our country depend. Over the years, they have been on \nagain, off again. It is like a yo-yo.\n  It is no way to do business. People need certainty, a little more \nthan they have today in these uncertain times, a little more ability to \npredict the future. If we could pass this legislation tonight, \nextending the extenders, that would enable people with more certainty \nto know they can count on an existing law.\n  This is not new law. This is an extension of existing law. It is not \nright for us to be not continuing that legislation because, otherwise, \nwe will wake up next year, January 1 or 2, and these are not in effect. \nThere are many other of them that are very good and, again, it creates \nthat uncertainty.\n  One, for example, is AMT for individuals. That is the alternative \nminimum tax credit. That is an extender. According to the Joint \nCommittee on Tax, 900,000 Americans will be subject to the AMT without \nthis relief, as one of the extenders we have.\n  Four hundred thousand of those will be taxpayers with incomes between \n$50,000 and $75,000. Those are really middle-income Americans. If we do \nnot extend this extender, then those people will be subject to the AMT \ntax.\n  In addition, this package includes an extension of a GSP, that is a \ngeneralized preference for trade. That is a trade provision that is in \nthe law today. The Andean Trade Preference Act extends that. It is in \nthe law today, in addition to trade adjustment assistance.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to think of Americans and pass this \nrequest.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 33, H.R. 8; that the Baucus substitute \namendment at the desk be agreed to; the bill as amended be read a third \ntime and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, I concur with many of the \nstatements my friend from Montana made; it is very important for us to \nwork together more than we have done in the last few months. The \nunanimous consent request, if I am reading it correctly, says the \nSenate wants to substitute the extenders for H.R. 8, which is the \nrevenue package that passed April 6. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That package would be a substitute for it? In other \nwords, this was a bill that would basically, over a 10-year period of \ntime, eliminate the death tax, I believe, and the Senator wants to \nstrike all that language and put in a 2-year extender bill; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This is 1 year. There is no intention to repeal any of \nthe tax provisions that passed earlier this year.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am reading this as a substitute for the House bill. I \nbelieve it is a substitute for the House bill. If the Senator modifies \nthis and makes it in addition to the House bill, at least this Senator \nwould not object. But if it is striking the House bill, I feel \nconstrained to object.\n  If the Senator is willing to move it, in addition to the House bill, \nI will not object at this time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will respond to my colleague that my intention is to \ntake up the bill that is already on the calendar.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I know.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And strike out the substance of it; take it up and pass \nit back with these provisions.\n  I might answer my friend, this is the procedure we have to follow in \norder to pass these extenders.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Further reserving the right to object, again I will \nobject if it is striking the House bill. The House passed a bill with a \ngood vote. I do not remember exactly what it was. If it is in addition \nto the House bill, I would not object.\n  I ask my colleague--and I think I hear the Senator saying he is not \ngoing to--is it not the intent of the Senator not to pass the House-\npassed bill? I was hoping we could make a deal.\n  I might mention we might have to notify a few other Senators before \nwe do this by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I see. It is now more clear to me what is happening.\n  Mr. NICKLES. My intention was, if we want to repeal the death tax and \npass the extenders, this Senator would have no objection. I am sure we \ncould whip it and see if there would be no objection.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I understand. I am sure the Senator would love to do \nthat, and I am also sure there would be other Senators who would \nobject.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Presiding Officer might like for us to do that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Given all the objections that approach will take, I was \nasking the Senator to consider the approach I am suggesting.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Further reserving the right to object, if the Senator is \nnot going to agree to pass the House-passed language that passed in \nApril with the extenders language, then I ask the Senator to modify his \nrequest and let us take up the stimulus package that did have the \nextenders, that did have many other provisions that would have helped \nthe unemployed, that did have some things that would help stimulate the \neconomy, that did some things that would help New York in addition to \nwhat we have already done today. So I ask my colleague to modify his \nrequest, let us take up the stimulus package, the H.R. 3529, which was \nreceived from the House.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the request be modified so that at first \nthe Senate would proceed to consideration of H.R. 3529, which is the \nstimulus package received by the House; the bill be read a third time \nand passed, with no intervening action or debate.\n  I would add, before the Chair rules, the bill has extender language \nthat my colleague from Montana is requesting and therefore it would \naccommodate his request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I believe the Senator made a unanimous \nconsent request that would change my unanimous consent request, at \nleast as I understand it. I ask the Senator if he will modify his \nrequest to substitute the stimulus bill that passed the Senate Finance \nCommittee instead of the bill that passed the House.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, there are many important issues on the\n\n[[Page S14031]]\n\nagenda and the one that was being discussed is one of the most \nimportant, but not the only. There is other business that needs to get \ndone before we leave, which is an issue that is of great concern and an \nissue I wanted to bring to the attention of the Senators.\n  Before I get into that subject area, which relates to families and \nchildren and adoption, I want to thank the leadership. I thank Senator \nKennedy and Senator Frist, the main sponsors of the bioterrorism \nlegislation, for agreeing in a colloquy submitted on behalf of myself \nand Senator McConnell from Kentucky to add a provision that will help \nall hospitals to call on FEMA funds that may be available in the event \nof another terrorist attack when hospital resources are called on to \nassist victims of those attacks or if the hospitals are harmed \nthemselves. I very much appreciate it because it seemed to be an \noversight in the legislation.\n  As that bill moves to conference, I particularly thank them for their \nsensitivities to provide funding for all hospitals in the event that \nthat situation were to occur. Of course, we are all hopeful it does not \nand are working very hard to see it does not, but I thank them for \nagreeing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S14031-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14031-S14032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TWELVE FAMILIES NEED CAMBODIAN VISAS TO BRING THEIR CHILDREN HOME\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Ohio and others \nare waiting to speak on other matters before we leave, but last night \nthere was a troubling expose done on a very unfortunate circumstance, \nand that circumstance involves 12 American families who are stuck in \nCambodia because they are unable to obtain visas for their newly \nadopted children. They are unable to get those visas to come back to \nthe United States safely with these children to celebrate what would \nhave been a joyous homecoming on these holidays.\n  We are all getting ready to join our families and loved ones in our \nhome States for Christmas and for the holidays. It is not just parents \nbeing reunited with children and children with parents, but \ngrandchildren, aunts, uncles, and cousins. This holiday season, as we \nhave all said, is going to be even that much more special because of \nthe challenges before our Nation and the events of September 11 and \nsubsequent events that make us realize how important our families are \nto us and our loved ones.\n  We are mindful as we leave today, happy with some of the successes we \nhave had, of the pain and suffering that will be felt during this \nholiday season by 3,000 families and many more who were directly \naffected, who will not have a loved one present for the holidays.\n  For the record, there is not anything I can offer at this moment--no \npiece of legislation, no fix that I can offer at this moment--but it is \nmy intention to work with all the Senators and to work with the INS, to \nwork with the State Department over the course of the next several days \nand weeks and months, if necessary, to make sure these American \nfamilies can get the visas, take their children safely and come to the \nUnited States.\n  According to the INS and according to the story and the details I \nknow, there is concern that there is fraud and abuse in Cambodia and \ntherefore that is why the visas were not issued. I acknowledge that, \nunfortunately, in the whole area of adoption, both domestic and \ninternational, there is some fraud and abuse. We need to do everything \nwe can to make sure that fraud and abuse is stamped out. This Senate, \nthis House, and this Congress, with the help of President Clinton as \nwell as President Bush and both State Departments in the last \nadministration and this administration, are working diligently on that.\n  We have passed a Hague treaty, an international treaty aimed \nspecifically at making the system of adoption more transparent, \neliminating the middleman, reducing time, and encouraging people to \nadopt children from all over the world because there are so many \nchildren who need a home and so many families who want to add children \nto their families, to build and strengthen their families through \nadoption.\n  Denying visas to 12 American families who pay their taxes, good \ncommunity citizens, people who are doing everything they think is \nright, and then denying the visas is, I suggest, not the right \napproach. I am hoping our INS, with our new Commissioner, Mr. Ziglar, \nwho we all know very well and who I have spoken to directly about this \nissue, as well as the State Department and Secretary Powell and others, \nwill look into this matter and come to an understanding and agreement \nto allow these children to come with their families.\n  These children are 6 months to 31 months old. I have learned if \nchildren are not adopted in Cambodia by the age of 8, under the \nCambodian rules and regulations, children are not able to be adopted. \nSo there is an urgency. There are time issues here. It is very \nimportant to try to work through this situation to help these families \nwho are from Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, Maine, Virginia, \nOklahoma, Washington, and Arizona; none from Louisiana.\n  As the chair of the adoption caucus, I bring this to the attention of \nthe Senate. I will be working as much as I can over the next weeks and \nmonths to make sure this issue is resolved. There are procedures that \ncan be used to focus on eliminating abuse and corruption but holding up \nfamilies who have gone through the process, sometimes excruciating \ndetail, without specific allegations of fraud in these individual \ncases, is beyond where I think we need to go.\n  In conclusion, we need to promote adoption, helping the system to be \ntransparent and encouraging people by saying, it is not too long, it is \nnot too tough, it is not too difficult, and it is worth it to bring \nsome of these children to our country and to provide permanency and \nlove to so many who have so little to hope for.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these details printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Why These 12 Notices of Intent To Deny Should Be Revoked\n\n       The Consular Officials in Cambodia reviewed each child's \n     documents PRIOR to the child being legally adopted under \n     Cambodian law. The documents were again reviewed by Consular \n     Officials prior to the parents being notified that all was in \n     order and scheduling of their interviews. So the U.S. State \n     Department had two opportunities to identify problems prior \n     to the parents traveling to Cambodia to bring home their \n     child. These children are now officially adopted by American \n     citizens. To deny these children visas for no specific, \n     concrete reason, is to make orphans out of these children all \n     over again.\n       INS should revoke the Notice of Intent to Deny Letters it \n     issued in the recent Cambodian cases for the following \n     reasons.\n       1. INS did not conduct a case-by-case investigation.\n       INS has a policy to adjudicate cases on a case-by-case \n     basis. This policy is predicated on the premise that each \n     case has unique facts, documents and circumstances. In \n     reviewing the seven (7) Notice of Intent to Deny Letters, the \n     matters addressed are exactly alike. The cases do not even \n     reflect correct information about the children and their \n     respective ages. Specifically, the letters focus on children \n     that are infants. However, in review of the children is \n     issue, a significant number of children are not infants.\n       One child is 31 months old;\n       One child is 25 months old;\n       One child is 23 months old;\n       One child is 20 months old;\n       One child is 10 months old;\n       Seven children are approximately 6 months old; and\n       DOB May 8th 2001 and abandoned May 14 (Munson).\n       It is important to note that all of the children have been \n     in the Asian Orphanage Association for at least six (6) \n     months. These children have been processed through the \n     Cambodian judicial system and have been adopted by American \n     families in accordance with the laws of Cambodia.\n       2. The investigation is flawed: INS only investigated cases \n     that were facilitated by a Cambodian man, Serey Puth--it did \n     not investigate orphans from other orphanages or children who \n     came through other facilitators; INS interviewed secondary \n     sources when persons holding primary roles were available; \n     faulty translations; and erroneous information in the Notice \n     of Intent to Deny.\n       (a) The only children that were targeted in this \n     investigation were children that has been processed through a \n     Cambodian facilitator, Serey Puth. Children who were placed \n     through other orphanages and other facilitators were not \n     investigated.\n       (b) Generally, INS protocol is to conduct extensive \n     investigations. Statements are taken under oath by competent \n     investigators and translators. Usually, primary parties are \n     interviewed. This did not occur in these cases.\n\n[[Page S14032]]\n\n       INS only interviewed three persons. Mrs. Phorn Phon, the \n     wife of a village chief for Chaneng Mang village, Mr. Yo a \n     member of the staff of the Asian Orphanage Association and a \n     villager on motorcycle.\n       It would have been more appropriate to interview the chief \n     instead of the chief's wife. It is not sound reasoning to \n     expect the wife of the village chief to know everything that \n     the chief knows.\n       It would have been more direct and informative to interview \n     Serey Puth, the owner and director or the Asian Orphanage \n     Association than Mr. Yo a staff member of AOA. Mr. Yo has the \n     responsibility of listing children in the orphanage's \n     registry, making sure the premises are clean and in good \n     repair. He is not privy as to the circumstances of the \n     particular cases. He would not know when and where children \n     were born.\n       Additionally, Serey Puth, the director and owner of the AOA \n     orphanage was available and willing to meet with the INS \n     officials. Although he had just moved the location of his \n     office, it would not have been difficult to locate him.\n       It would have been more credible to interview persons in \n     authority than to interview someone who drove by the chief's \n     dwelling on a motorcycle and claimed he was the deputy chief \n     of a village near by.\n       (c) There is a serious problem with the comprehension and/\n     or translations. Here are three examples of erroneous \n     interpretations by the translator.\n       (i) The Notice of Intent to Deny letter contains the \n     following pertinent statement by Mr. Yo. ``Mr. Yo was then \n     asked if he thought that it was reasonable to accept the \n     answers that he had given and he said he did not.''\n       Please note that this statement is taken directly from the \n     Notice of Intent to Deny. The only explanation for such a \n     dialogue is that Mr. Yo did not understand the investigator's \n     question or Mr. Yo has some serious competency problems.\n       (ii) When the INS investigator asked Mr. Yo where Serey \n     Puth was, Mr. Yo responded that Serey Puth, the orphanage \n     director and owner, was out in the country as in the \n     countryside. However, the translator interpreted his answer \n     to be that Serey Puth was out of the country. Serey Puth \n     never left the country during the nine day INS investigation.\n       (iii) The Chief's wife was asked if any children were \n     abandoned in the village and she stated that there were not. \n     That is true, children from her village had not been \n     abandoned. However, children from other whereabouts had been \n     abandoned to the village.\n       Review of these examples illustrates how words not properly \n     translated can lead to very unfavorable conclusions.\n       (d) The Intent to Deny states that a raid was conducted of \n     the Asian Orphanage Association premises. This is false. The \n     Cambodian officials conducted a raid of a medical center, not \n     AOA. Some of the children from the orphanage were being \n     treated at the medical center.\n       Additionally, the Intent to Deny states that ``accusations \n     of baby trafficking have been levied against the director.'' \n     This too is false! Evidence from the Cambodian newspapers \n     confirm the allegations made herein.\n       3. Cambodian government authorities are satisfied that \n     their law has been fully complied with.\n       MOSALVY, a Cambodian governmental entity (Ministry of \n     Social Affairs, Labor, Vocational Training and Youth \n     Rehabilitation) informed the American prospective adoptive \n     parents that they had been approved to adopt specific \n     Cambodian children. Additionally, MOSALVY issued a \n     Certificate of Adoption for each of the children in issue. \n     Had there been any irregularities regarding these children, \n     it would seem that the Cambodian government would have been \n     aware of the problems. Furthermore, if the Cambodian \n     government believes that the Asian Orphanage Association did \n     not comply with Cambodian law, then MOSALVY has the ability \n     to revoke the Certificates of Adoption.\n       In addition, under the old Cambodian Law, if it was not \n     known where a child was born, the place of birth was picked \n     randomly. In the last year, the law has been changed. \n     Currently, when an abandoned child is found, his place of \n     birth is where he was found. However, at the time that the \n     children were born and registered with vital records, the \n     orphanage director complied with the law of that time--he \n     picked a place of birth.\n       INS sent Jean M. Christiansen from the INS District Office \n     in Bangkok to investigate the cases. While in Cambodia for \n     nine days, her staff conducted an investigation. Under her \n     pen, INS issued Notices of Intent to Deny to the American \n     families. INS should revoke its Notices of Intent to Deny.\n\n         CAMBODIAN CASES THAT RECEIVED NOTICES OF INTENT TO DENY\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Adoptive parents' State                 DOB          DOA\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPennsylvania..................................      5-05-99      1-01-01\nIllinois......................................     10-10-99     11-26-99\nIllinois......................................      1-07-00      2-10-01\nNY............................................      2-04-00      3-10-00\nNY............................................      2-10-01      4-25-01\nMaine.........................................      2-27-01      3-14-01\nIllinois......................................      5-01-01      5-06-01\nVirginia......................................      5-05-01      5-12-01\nOklahoma......................................      5-08-01      5-14-01\nArizona.......................................      5-18-01      5-25-01\nWashington....................................      5-22-01      5-29-01\nArizona.......................................      5-29-01      6-01-01\nIllinois......................................      6-14-01      6-21-01\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDOB: Date of birth.\nPOA: Place of abandonment.\n\n\n                                                  CAMBODIAN CASES TO RECEIVE NOTICES OF INTENT TO DENY\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       Place of     Place of\n            State and contact                  DOB          DOA         birth     abandonment    US agency or facilitator         Orphanage contact\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPennsylvania.............................      5-05-99      1-01-01  ...........  ...........  ............................

Mr. President, we are getting close to wrapping up this \nsession. We did a lot of good things this year and some things we \ndidn't get done. One thing we did not get done was passage of the \nstimulus package. That is unfortunate. It became way too partisan. It \ndid not need to be. Recessions are not partisan. We have a lot of \npeople out of work who need help. A lot of companies want to grow. We \ncould have done that.\n  Senator Grassley worked hard with the Bush administration. There was \na lot of movement on this side of the aisle to help pass the stimulus \npackage. It didn't happen. I regret that very much. We could have \nhelped the economy, and we could have helped a lot of unemployed \npeople.\n  Senator Baucus mentioned earlier that he hopes when people come back \nthey are less partisan and more intent on getting some positive results \nfor the American people. That needs to happen. I hope we do not hear: \nWell, we cannot bring something out unless it passes two-thirds on our \nside. That does not belong in the Senate. The Senate is a deliberative \nbody, and we should have a chance to try to pass things, and pass them \nby majority vote. Try to get something done, try to make a positive \ncontribution toward helping the economy, not a strictly Democrat or \nRepublican package, but a package that helps the economy.\n  The House passed good legislation last night. Not perfect. Maybe we \ncan improve upon it and help our economy and help the unemployed.\n  As we wind down, there are several nominations that are pending that \nshould be confirmed. It is not fair to this administration. It is not \nfair to some of these individuals who have been languishing, waiting to \nbe confirmed with no action. There are five district court nominees, \nFederal judges. We have confirmed 27; if we do 5 more, that will be 32. \nDuring President Clinton's first year, we confirmed 27 of 47. President \nBush nominated 60. We have confirmed 27, not quite half. We confirmed \nover half for President Clinton, and if you look at what we did for the \nfirst President Bush or what we did for Ronald Reagan, we confirmed 91 \npercent of Ronald Reagan's judges and a much higher percentage for \nPresident Bush. We should confirm more than we have today. There are \nfive on the calendar. There is no reason not to confirm these \nindividuals. We all know they will be confirmed. Why not let them go \nahead and assume their duties?\n\n  We have a judge from Alabama, a judge from Colorado, a judge from \nNevada, a judge from Texas, a judge from Georgia. We have judges from \nDemocrat States and Republican States. Let's not hold these five \nindividuals hostage. We can pass them tonight and I urge my colleagues \nto help do that.\n  We also have four U.S. attorneys, from Alabama, New York, Arkansas, \nand one from New Jersey. They need to be confirmed. They should be \nconfirmed.\n  We have a couple of marshals who are pending. There is no reason why \nthey should not be confirmed--actually just one marshal and one to be \nChairman of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. Let's confirm \nthese individuals. Let's do it tonight. Somebody says: Why are you \ndoing it tonight? We confirmed more judges, more U.S. attorneys--all \nthose are always done by voice votes.\n  We have Janet Hale to be Assistant Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. Secretary Thompson is entitled to have his Assistant \nSecretary for Health and Human Services be confirmed. So I urge my \ncolleagues to vote on that nomination or to approve that nomination.\n  We also have a couple of other positions. We have James Lockhart III \nto be Deputy Commissioner of Social Security. That is an important \nposition.\n  In the Department of Energy, we have Michael Smith, actually one of \nmy constituents. He happens to be secretary of energy of the State of \nOklahoma. He has been nominated to be Assistant Secretary of Energy \ndealing with fossil fuels. Secretary Abraham is completing his first \nyear and he doesn't have his Assistant Secretary dealing with fossil \nfuels. We are now importing about 58 percent of our energy needs and he \ndoesn't even have an Assistant Secretary dealing with fossil fuels.\n  One of the first bills we are going to be wrestling with next year is \nan energy bill. We have a commitment from the majority leader that we \nare going to take up energy early next year. That is great. You would \nthink the administration would be entitled to have their Assistant \nSecretary to help the negotiations, to help prod Congress along. So I \nurge my colleagues to approve his nomination. He was reported out of \nthe Energy Committee unanimously, as I believe Beverly Cook was, from \nIdaho, to be Assistant Secretary of Energy dealing with environment, \nsafety, and health.\n  Also Margaret S.Y. Chu, of New Mexico, to be Director of the Office \nof Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, Department of Energy.\n  There is no reason why we cannot do most of these nominees. Most of \nthese nominees passed by unanimous votes in the committees. Why can't \nwe confirm these individuals?\n  I urge Senator Daschle and Senator Reid and others to help.\n  There are a couple of others who are very important. The Department \nof State, John Hanford. John Hanford is an individual with whom many of \nus worked in the Senate for years. He worked for Senator Lugar. He \nhelped myself and others when we ended up passing the International \nReligious Freedom Act. Senator Lieberman was a principal sponsor of \nthat, and Senator Specter. The administration nominated John Hanford \nIII, of Virginia, to be Ambassador at Large for International Religious \nFreedom. When you think of the battles we have going on all across the \nworld with religious freedom, and some of it is in Afghanistan and some \nin Pakistan and some in Sudan where you have individuals who are held \ncaptive, imprisoned, enslaved because of their religion, wouldn't it \nmake sense for us to get our Ambassador at Large for International \nReligious Freedom confirmed so he can go to work and help protect and \npromote religious harmony and freedom throughout the world? Hopefully, \nhis nomination will be confirmed tonight.\n\n  We have several other people in the Department of State who were \nconfirmed by the Foreign Relations Committee unanimously who should be \nconfirmed tonight. Many of these were just reported by the committee, \nby Senator Biden. I thank him for doing that. I am looking at John Ong, \nwho is to be Ambassador to Norway and John Price to be Ambassador \nExtraordinary to the Republic of Mauritius; Arthur Dewey, of Maryland, \nto be Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and \nMigration.\n  Some of these, again, were just reported out. I thank my colleagues. \nWe should be able to get those through as well, not to mention Gaddi \nVasquez, of California, to be Director of the Peace Corps.\n  I mention these. These are not all. I did not mention Gene Scalia. I \nwould really urge my colleagues--Gene Scalia has been on the calendar. \nHe was nominated in, I believe, April, one of the earliest nominees of \nthis administration, to be Solicitor of the Department of Labor. \nSecretary Chao is entitled to have a Solicitor. One of the most \nimportant positions in the Department of Labor is Solicitor. He has to \nmake all kinds of rulings. It is very important that she have her \nSolicitor. I urge my colleagues, let's have a vote. If we cannot have \nit today, let's have it in January; let's vote up or down.\n  Somebody said we may have to file cloture. I can think of several \npeople, including the previous Solicitor of Labor, to whom many on this \nside might have had a philosophical objection, but we did not require \ncloture. You should not require cloture on most nominees. You should \nnot require cloture hardly ever on nominees unless they are really out \nof the Main Street. We had a vote on Joycelyn Elders and I opposed that \nnomination very significantly, but it was an up-or-down vote.\n  I think people are entitled to have a difference of opinion and have \na debate. If we have a difference of opinion, let's discuss it. This is \nthe Senate. But to not allow somebody to have a vote and hold their \ncareers in limbo for an unlimited period of time, it is not fair to \nthem, and I don't think it makes the Senate look very good.\n  Again, I urge our colleagues to move forward on Gene Scalia, to move \nforward on some of these other nominees,\n\n[[Page S14034]]\n\nmany of whom, I hope and expect to be confirmed tonight. I hope they \nwill. I urge the leadership on the Democrat side to work with us and \nsee if we cannot clear up as many nominees as possible, confirm as many \nnominees as possible on the Executive Calendar.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S14034-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14034-S14035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to express my disappointment \nthat the Senate did not have an opportunity today to vote on the White \nHouse and Senate Centrist Coalition compromise on the economic stimulus \npackage to aid dislocated workers. I think the stimulus package, if \npassed, would have made a real difference for the American people. It \nwould have helped individuals and families. It would have helped create \njobs, or at least maintain jobs. And it would have responded to the \nneeds of laid-off workers and their families.\n  Early this fall, when it became clear to me that our nation was in \nrecession, I decided to get actively involved in developing and \nadvocating a stimulus package. I recognized the package that was coming \nout of the House could not get through the Senate because it wasn't \nbalanced. So I gathered together with my other colleagues in the \nCentrist Coalition. Six of us from the Coalition were the ones who \nreally were the nucleus of it--I was one of them with Olympia Snowe and \nSusan Collins, and on the Democrat side there was John Breaux and two \nof my colleagues who were former Governors, Zell Miller, who was a \nformer Governor of Georgia, and Ben Nelson, the former Governor of \nNebraska.\n  We decided we would try to put something together that would be fair, \nand that would respond to the need to stimulate the economy, and at the \nsame time, respond to the human needs that we see throughout this \ncountry. We wanted to try to work something out, and see if we could \nget something through Congress and particularly through the Senate.\n  We worked very conscientiously on that package. We finally were able \nto get the ear of the White House and got them to be part of this \ncompromise package. Yesterday we were able to convince the leadership \nin the House of Representatives that it was a fair package, although a \nfar cry from the package they had adopted. We had hoped that, somehow, \nmiraculously, maybe, we would have had an opportunity to vote on that \npackage in the Senate.\n  The Republican leader, Senator Lott, talked about the fact that maybe \nduring the period of time we are in recess, pressure will build up and \nmaybe we will get a bill passed. Or maybe the pressure will not be out \nthere and we will not need to pass a piece of legislation. However, I \nam here to tell you that this legislation is needed now.\n  This afternoon I met with about 50 steelworkers from Cleveland, OH, \nfrom LTV steel. That company is in bankruptcy. Their jobs are gone and \nthey are displaced. They are petrified because they do not know how \nthey are going to be able to take care of their medical costs. Their \ncompany had a health plan, but COBRA is no longer an option because the \ncompany is out of business. They are worried about how they are going \nto provide health care for their families. They will get their \nunemployment benefits, but they are really concerned about how to pay \nfor their health care coverage.\n  I pointed out to them that the stimulus package the Centrist \nCoalition put together would subsidize their health care to the tune of \n60 percent. They were pleased to learn that their was hope that someone \nwould help them, that they could get insurance for their families to \nget them over this very difficult period. I can tell you: they are \nfrightened.\n  I think so often when we talk about stimulus packages, we get caught \nup in the dollar amounts and we don't talk about real people. That is \nwhat this is about. For example, the rebate program that is in our \nstimulus package would provide help to some 38 million low-income \nworkers who didn't qualify for rebate checks the last time around. \nThose rebates would mean $13.5 billion would go into the pockets of \nthose individuals to help them with their problems. And I am sure it \nwould help stimulate the economy because they would likely spend that \nmoney.\n  Some describe the reduction in marginal rates as an awful thing \nbecause of the fact that we would reduce the marginal rate from 27\\1/2\\ \ndown to 25 percent. I would like to point out that we are talking about \nsingle people who make between $28,000 and $68,000, and married couples \nwho make between $47,000 and $113,000. That is about one-third of the \ntaxpayers in this country, some 36 million people, who would have \nbenefitted if we had gone forward with these rate reductions. Between \nthe 38 million beneficiaries of the rebate checks, and the 36 million \nwho would benefit from the reduction in marginal rates, a total of 74 \nmillion Americans would have been able to take advantage of this \npackage.\n  The thing I would really like to concentrate on is the part of this \npackage that deals with health care. When we got started debating the \nstimulus package, the House passed a package that had something like $3 \nbillion for health care. Likewise, the President's package had also had \n$3 billion. Our centrist package had $13.5 billion. The Democratic \nFinance Committee proposal was $16.7 billion. At the end of the day, \nthe Centrist Coalition and White House compromise package had $21 \nbillion in it for dislocated workers' health care, money for the States \nfor national emergency grants, including $4 billion to the States for \nMedicaid funding.\n  Now I would like to talk about what we do for displaced workers.\n  First of all, we include an extension of 13 weeks of unemployment \nbenefits--benefits that would be available to those who became \nunemployed between March 15, 2001, and December 31 at the end of next \nyear. An estimated 3 million unemployed workers would qualify for \nbenefits averaging about $230 a week. Those extended benefits would be \n100-percent federally funded at a cost of about $10 billion to the \nFederal Government, so States wouldn't have to pick up the tab.\n  The bill would allow states to accelerate the transfer of $9 billion \nfrom State unemployment trust funds so they could distribute that money \nearlier than now possible. This transfer of money, which already \nbelongs to the states, would help State treasuries, which are in dire \nstraits today. This proposed advance would provide the States with the \nflexibility to pay administrative costs, provide additional benefits \nfor part-time workers, adopt alternative base periods, and avoid \nraising their unemployment taxes during the current recessionary times.\n\n  Next, let us look at health care benefits.\n  The Centrist Coalition and White House compromise proposal includes \n$19 billion in health care assistance for dislocated workers.\n  It provides a refundable, advanceable tax credit to all displaced \nworkers, who are eligible for unemployment insurance, for the purchase \nof health insurance--not just individuals who are eligible for COBRA \ncoverage.\n  Individuals with access to health insurance through a spouse wouldn't \nbe eligible and couldn't get the credit.\n  However, the credit is available to unemployed people who do not have \naccess to coverage through COBRA, since their employers did not provide \nhealth insurance or their employer went out of business. Under this \nbill, these individuals would have been able to get a 60-percent \nsubsidy of their health insurance costs without any cap on the dollar \namount of subsidy.\n  The proposal also includes reforms to ensure that people have access \nto health insurance coverage in the individual market. If a person has \n12 months of employer-sponsored coverage, rather than 18 months as \nunder the current law, health insurers are required to issue a policy \nand not impose any preexisting condition exclusion. In other words, if \nsomeone has a preexisting exclusion for which they would ordinarily be \ndisqualified from getting health insurance, this reform requires that \nthey be able to obtain health insurance.\n  The Centrist and White House proposal also includes $4 billion in \nenhanced national emergency grants for the States which Governors could \nuse to help all workers--not just those eligible for the tax credit. \nThey could use this to pay for health insurance in both public and \nprivate plans. In other\n\n[[Page S14035]]\n\nwords, we would be paying $4 billion out to the States so they can \nreach out and help people in their respective States who are not \ncovered by some of the particular provisions in the stimulus package.\n  Last if not least, the centrist package provides a $4.6 billion, one-\ntime grant to assist states with their Medicaid programs.\n  I worked with the National Governors Association and the Bush \nadministration to try to get them to understand that the State \ngovernments are not like the Federal Government. States are in deep \nbudgetary trouble because they have to balance their budgets every \nyear. The money isn't there for them to take care of the many needs \nthey face. This $4.6 billion grant would have gone out to the States to \nhelp them provide Medicaid for the neediest of our brothers and \nsisters. In many States they are going to have to cut Medicaid payments \nbecause they simply don't have the money since their State treasuries \nare in such deep financial trouble.\n  I hope my colleagues understand that this is not some kind of a game. \nWe are talking about real human beings.\n  This morning at a press conference, one of the reporters said to me: \nI understand the problem with this stimulus bill is that the majority \nleader has a problem with the philosophy of it.\n  I said that this bill responds to most of the concerns that have been \nraised by my colleagues from the other side of the aisle.\n\n  Think about it. When was the last time Congress gave serious \nconsideration to providing health care to unemployed workers? I don't \never recall such consideration before. But this time, we have been able \nto get a Republican administration and a Republican House of \nRepresentatives to consider providing health insurance to unemployed \nworkers. That was a breakthrough in terms of dealing with the \nunemployed and displaced workers in this country.\n  I happen to believe that if this proposal had come from the other \nside of the aisle and not from the centrist coalition and the White \nHouse, many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would have \nbeen very much in favor of this proposal.\n  I am hoping, as we all go home and look into the eyes of the people \nwho will come and see us because they have lost their jobs, and are \npanicked about health care for themselves and their families, that we \nstart to understand we have an obligation to touch their lives. And to \ndo this, the first thing we need to do when we come back to this \nchamber is pass a stimulus package that addressed the needs of \nunemployed men and women. We need to restore people's faith in their \neconomy and restore people's faith that we do care about them.\n  The thing that really bothers me about our failure to pass a stimulus \npackage, is that so many people anticipated we would do so. They really \ndid. They were counting on us, as did the financial markets. I think \nfrom a psychological point of view, we have really done a disservice to \nthe American people, particularly at a time when we are all going home \nto celebrate Christmas and the holidays.\n  What a lousy Christmas present we are giving to the people of \nAmerica. Shame on us. I hope when we come back in January that we will \nmake it up to them. They need our help.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when people become doctors they take the \nHippocratic oath which, among other things, instructs them to ``First, \ndo no harm.''\n  Maybe our Nation's leaders in Washington need to take a similar oath \nif they intend to operate on the economy.\n  Sadly, our friends in the Republican Party are steadfast in their \ninsistence that we enact legislation that would harm our economy. Their \nplan takes more than $200 billion out of Social Security and uses it \nmostly for tax breaks for wealthy individuals and profitable \ncorporations. It will do little to stimulate the economy, and even less \nfor the millions of newly unemployed Americans. Their plan will not \nmake the recession better, but it will make the deficit worse. This \nimpasse is regrettable--and it was completely avoidable.\n  Immediately after September 11, it became clear that the attacks \ndealt our economy--which already was slowing--a devastating blow. We \nall agreed--Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate--that America \nneeded an economic recovery plan. And Congress had a responsibility to \npass such a plan.\n  We asked the best financial thinkers in the country, economic \nleaders, such as Chairman Greenspan and Secretary Rubin: What should \nsuch a package contain?\n  Their advice led to the development of a set of bipartisan principles \nfor an economic recovery plan. Those principles were endorsed by the \nchairmen and ranking members of the Budget Committees in both the House \nand the Senate.\n  Rather than work together to develop a plan based on those \nprinciples, Republicans in the House chose to withdraw from bipartisan \nnegotiations and pass their own highly partisan economic plan.\n  The experts we consulted told us that the problem with the economy \nright now is that corporations have too much capacity and that \nconsumers have too little cash. That is it in a nutshell: Corporations \nhave too much capacity; consumers have too little cash. So we developed \na plan to address those problems.\n  The plan we put together included tax cuts for businesses that invest \nand create jobs in the near future. It had tax rebates for people who \nwere left out of the first round and unemployment and health benefits \nfor workers who have lost their jobs in this recession and as a result \nof the September 11 attacks.\n  Our plan did what economists say needs to be done--no more, no less. \nAnd it met the bipartisan standards agreed to by the budget leaders in \nboth Houses.\n  Early this morning the House passed a far different plan. Their plan \nspeeds up the tax cuts Congress passed last summer--months before the \nterrorist attacks. Their tax cuts give most of the benefits to the \nwealthiest individuals, and they will get those tax cuts not just next \nyear, but the year after that, and the year after that, and the year \nafter that. That is the first part of their plan.\n  The second part of the House Republican plan is to take the biggest \ncorporations in America and give them billions of dollars in new tax \nbreaks. Some profitable corporations would get permission not to pay \ntaxes at all.\n  Under their plan, companies such as Enron would get hundreds of \nmillions of taxpayer's money. Republicans are not proposing to do that \nfor police officers, for firefighters, for postal workers. They are not \nproposing it for hard-pressed, hard-working families. Maybe it would \nhelp if they did, but they are not.\n\n  They are proposing it for the biggest corporations in America, with \nno strings attached. The corporations do not need to create a single \njob to get this gift. They can lay off workers and still not have to \npay a dime in taxes under the Republican plan. That kind of plan does \nnot help the economy, and it does not help workers.\n  Since September 11, nearly a million American workers have lost their \njobs. Eight and a half million Americans are now out of work.\n  Often, the biggest worry when Americans lose their jobs is how to pay \nfor their health care. The average cost of keeping health care coverage \nis half of the average monthly unemployment check, half of a family's \ntotal monthly income. That is why only 20 percent of workers who are \neligible for COBRA coverage purchase it. Most simply cannot afford it.\n  The plan passed by the House provides an inadequate tax credit for \nindividuals to buy health care, and it leaves many of them at the whim \nof the private insurance market.\n  Under their plan, health insurance will remain out of reach for \nmillions of\n\n[[Page S14036]]\n\nlaid-off workers. The credit would require a parent to spend, on \naverage, a quarter of their unemployment check for COBRA coverage. For \nmost individuals not eligible for COBRA, the price tag would be even \nhigher.\n  One million displaced workers--part-time workers and recent hires--do \nnot even qualify for assistance under the plan.\n  Survivors of victims of September 11 do not qualify for assistance \nunder their plan. Employees, whose hours have been reduced and who have \nlost their health care as a result, do not qualify for their plan.\n  Their individual tax credit discriminates against older and sicker \nworkers. An insurer can refuse to cover a sick worker, can charge \nexorbitant prices based on age and health, and can refuse to provide \ncoverage for such basic needs as pregnancy, prescription drugs, or \nmental health.\n  All the worst practices of the insurance industry are fair game in \ntheir bill. What is worse, it would actually discourage laid-off \nworkers from taking a new job. Under the plan passed by the House, the \nmoment an individual goes back into the workforce, they lose their \neligibility for the insurance premium tax credit.\n  Say a recently laid-off worker has a sick spouse; if he wants to go \nback to work, he can't because his new job may not offer health \ninsurance for his wife. He would have to choose between freeing himself \nfrom unemployment and losing health care his wife needs.\n  That is their plan for health care. It gives workers insufficient \nhelp, and it discourages responsibility in the process.\n  On jobless benefits, Republicans say their plan extends jobless \nbenefits for all laid-off workers. But it doesn't. More than half of \nAmerica's laid-off workers held part-time jobs over recent hires. They \npaid into the unemployment system, but the House plan leaves them out.\n  A week ago, the whole world paused to remember the victims of \nSeptember 11, but the House-passed plan forgets the economic victims of \nthose attacks, and that is wrong.\n  Three days after September 11, we passed a $15 billion airline \nbailout package. Democrats tried to include help for laid-off workers \nin that plan. We were told: Now is not the time. There will be another \nchance soon. We are going to consider airline security. We can help \nworkers then.\n  Reluctantly, we agreed to wait. We tried to include our package of \nhelp for workers on airline security. Again, Republican colleagues \nfilibustered. Again, they said: This is not the time. We still need to \npass an economic stimulus package. We will help workers then.\n  We took them at their word. We included jobless and health benefits \nfor laid-off workers in our economic recovery plan. But instead of \njoining us, Republicans voted to kill our proposal. They said that \nhelping workers is not an emergency. We have waited. We have \ncompromised.\n  At Republican insistence, we dropped the measures to strengthen \nAmerica's homeland security from our plan, even though we believe such \nmeasures are essential to restoring confidence in our safety and our \neconomy. We said: We are willing to support larger tax cuts to let \nbusinesses write off more of their investment costs.\n  We also made a significant concession on health care. We believe the \nbest approach is to provide laid-off workers with a direct subsidy to \nhelp pay for COBRA premiums. But in the name of compromise, we said we \nwould be willing to move toward the Republican approach again and \nagain. We are willing to adopt an employer tax credit as long as it \nwill work and as long as it will pay 75 percent of health care costs. \nWe even said we will discuss additional tax cuts, such as the Domenici \npayroll tax holiday, the charitable choice legislation, and others, as \nlong as Republicans agreed to help workers. We made concession after \nconcession after concession to try to get an agreement both sides could \nsupport and the President could sign.\n  We have been willing to compromise on every part of this plan. The \nonly issue we couldn't compromise on was our fundamental principle: We \ncould not support a plan that does not adequately protect workers or \nhelp our economy.\n  By insisting once again on a bloated package of tax cuts that lack \nreal help for workers, the bill that passed in the House indicates that \nperhaps Republicans were never serious about achieving a negotiated \ncompromise in the first place.\n  Instead of political theatrics, instead of writing another bill with \nno chance of passing the Senate, instead of finger pointing and casting \nblame, we need to come together and pass a real economic recovery plan. \nWe need to pass a bill that helps the economy, helps workers, and meets \nthe standards that we all agreed to at the beginning of this process. \nAt the very least, we need a bill that first does no harm.\n  We may have missed our opportunity to get it done this year. If that \nis the case, it is regrettable. But we will again try. We will do all \nthat we can to get it done early next year, as we should.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it has been over three months since the \nterrorist atrocities of September 11. Since that day, the Nation's \nworkers have been among the Nation's most respected heroes. They have \ncome together in the face of new challenges, risking their lives in the \nrescue and recovery efforts, and in too many cases, losing their lives. \nOur hearts are heavy with those losses.\n  Our Nation's workers have come together, and the American people \nstrongly support our efforts to give them the support and assistance \nthey deserve. But our Republican colleagues in Congress have stalled \nour efforts to help these heroic workers. Senator Daschle proposed an \neffective and balanced plan to stimulate the faltering economy. It had \na majority of support in the Senate.\n  The provisions had the support of the nation's most preeminent \neconomists, including nine Nobel prize laureates. But our Republican \ncolleagues refused to even debate it. They said it wasn't an \n``emergency.''\n  Listen to what the economists say. They say the House Republican \nproposal ``will do little to assist a near term recovery and is likely \nto undermine growth in the economy.'' But also listen to what our \nvalues say, that we cannot abandon our fellow citizens in their time of \nneed. If there is any lesson from the tragedy of September 11, it is \nthis: that we are one American community, and the backbone of that \ncommunity comes from average Americans.\n  Millions of members of that community are hurting today because they \nlost their jobs. Yet, our Republican friends repeatedly say no to the \nvery actions that would help these families and strengthen our economy \nat the same time.\n  Democrats tried to negotiate in good faith, but Republicans have been \nunwilling to support any recovery package unless it contains tens of \nbillions of dollars for new tax breaks for wealthy individuals and \ncorporations that will jeopardize the nation's long-term fiscal health \nand threaten Social Security and Medicare. We cannot let Republicans \nhold laid-off workers hostage to these irresponsible and costly tax \nbreaks.\n  Republicans have also refused to agree to a proposal to provide real \nhealth insurance to the victims of this terrorist attack and the \ncurrent economic downturn. Instead, they offer only inadequate plans \nthat leave workers with sky-high premiums for meager health benefits, \nand that leave behind the survivors of September 11 and many other of \nour most vulnerable workers.\n  The Democratic economic recovery proposal puts money in the hands of \nthe people who will spend it immediately.\n  We strengthen unemployment insurance, and guarantee affordable health \ncare to laid-off workers on the front lines of the economic battle. \nThese workers deserve no less.\n  Every day that we fail to pass a stimulus package, we fail to help \nmore laid-off workers. The unemployment rate is now 5.7 percent, a 33 \npercent increase since the recession began. Over 8 million Americans \nwill start the year out of work, through no fault of their own. \nMillions of Americans are left with no paycheck and no golden \nparachute. We cannot accept a plan that fails these workers.\n  Health premiums can cost nearly $600 a month for a family--most of an \nunemployment check. That is why only\n\n[[Page S14037]]\n\nabout one in five laid-off workers today continue their coverage, even \nif they are eligible. Our plan covers 75 percent of the health care \npremium for those who are eligible to continue their coverage, but \ncan't afford the cost.\n  Some workers are not eligible for any continuing health plan. Our \nplan also allows states to cover these vulnerable workers. Taken \ntogether, our plan ensures that men and women who lose their jobs don't \nhave to worry about losing their health insurance as well.\n  Our plan also provides fiscal relief to the States, which face \nserious budget shortfalls, yet must meet yearly balanced budget \nrequirements. We increase Medicaid payments, so that States don't have \nto cut back on coverage, just as more workers need help. The head of \nthe Republican Governors' Association, Governor John Engler, said \nwithout this plan, a stimulus package is ``robbing Peter to pay Paul, \nbecause States will have to cut critical services, stifling the \npositive effect of any stimulus measures enacted at the federal \nlevel.''\n  Our Democratic plan assures 13 weeks of extended unemployment \nbenefits for laid-off workers.\n  The current recession is already 9 months old, and the two million \nworkers who have run out of unemployment insurance benefits should not \nhave to continue to wait for our help.\n  Our plan also makes part-time and low-wage workers eligible for \nunemployment benefits. In 1975, on average, 75 percent of unemployed \nworkers received unemployment benefits. Last year, the figure was only \n38 percent. Expanding coverage to include part-time and low-wage \nworkers will benefit more than 600,000 more of those who have been \nlaid-off, and it will also provide additional economic stimulus.\n  In addition, our plan supplements the current meager level of \nunemployment benefits, which do not replace enough lost wages to keep \nworkers out of poverty.\n  In 2000, the national average unemployment benefit only replaced 33 \npercent of workers' lost income, a steep drop from the 46 percent of \nworkers' wages replaced by jobless benefits during the recessions of \nthe 1970's and 1980's.\n  During an economic crisis, unemployed workers have few opportunities \nto rejoin a declining workforce. They depend on unemployment benefits \nto live. Adding $150 a month to unemployment benefits will stimulate \nthe economy and help these laid-off workers support their families \nwhile they look for a new job.\n  While Democrats have been negotiating an economic recovery package in \ngood faith, the House Republicans pulled the rug out from under those \nnegotiations. They walked away from the negotiating table, made harsh \npersonal attacks against our Democratic leader, and brought a separate \nRepublican bill, largely a repackaging of the previous bill--back to \nthe House floor.\n  The latest GOP plan is not an effort to stimulate the economy or help \nworkers. It is a Republican game of political hot potato, to avoid \nblame. They do not deserve credit for a misguided plan that does \nnothing for the economy and nothing for workers.\n  The latest House Republican bill fails the economy. It fails the \nstates, which are struggling to balance their budgets. It fails the \nmillions of workers who have been laid off through no fault of their \nown and are struggling to keep a roof over their families' heads and \nfood on their tables.\n  What it will do is blow a deep hole in our economy, estimated at $250 \nbillion, adding to deficits already expected next year. All of it will \nhave to come from the Social Security Trust Fund.\n  Our Republican colleagues are more concerned about helping wealthy \ncorporations and individuals than about stimulating the economy or \nassisting laid-off workers. The new House Republican bill continues to \ngut the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. They refuse to offer any \ntrue help for workers, but wealthy corporations will receive a promise \nthat they won't have to pay any income tax in future years.\n  The Republican bill also provides new tax reductions for wealthy \nindividuals. Only the top quarter of American families will receive any \nbenefit from these rate reductions and only the top 4.4 percent will \nreceive the full benefit.\n  The House bill also maintains a 30 percent bonus depreciation over \nthe next 3 years, even though nobody believes the recession will last 3 \nyears. With no incentive for immediate action, companies will not \ninvest, now when the economy is weak. Instead, they will get windfalls \nin later years.\n  At the same time, states will suffer revenue losses for the full 3 \nyears of this proposal, on top of the $35 to $50 billion budget \ndeficits they are already facing.\n  The Republican bill drains money from States, but it provides little \nfiscal relief. Since states must balance their budgets even in \nrecessions, the Republican plans will force still-larger budget cuts. \nThese losses in revenue will almost certainly result in deep cuts for \nMedicaid, education, and other vital State and local services.\n  The Republican bill clearly shortchanges workers. It does little to \nprovide unemployment benefits or affordable health care for laid-off \nworkers.\n  Perhaps the best and purest form of economic stimulus is to increase \nunemployment benefits for families, because they are sure to spend it \nquickly.\n  Yet, the unemployment insurance provisions in the bill passed by the \nHouse do not accomplish nearly enough. The bill leaves out hundreds of \nthousands of low-wage and part-time workers who have paid into the \nunemployment fund, but are not eligible for benefits under it.\n  The Republican plan fails to raise the meager level of benefits, \nwhich currently replace half or less of an individual's lost wages. A \nfew weeks ago, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee proposed \ntemporarily suspending income taxes on UI benefits as a way of raising \nthese meager benefits. That step would be slower and less inclusive \nthan a benefit increase, but at least it acknowledged that we need to \nraise benefit levels. However, even that tax suspension has been \ndropped from the latest Republican bill. Instead, that bill provides \nfunding for unemployment insurance that will most likely be used for \nemployer tax cuts, and to boost trust fund reserves instead of worker \nbenefits.\n  The Republican health proposals are also an empty promise to millions \nof Americans. Their plan leaves out hundreds of thousands of unemployed \nworkers. It excludes the survivors of the September 11 attack. It \nexcludes low-wage and part-time workers. Even for those are eligible, \nit provides an inadequate subsidy that most workers can't afford to \nuse.\n  The Republican plan leaves deserving Americans who are not eligible \nfor COBRA to the flawed individual insurance market which charges \nthousands of dollars for inadequate benefits. Their plan does not \nprevent HMOs and insurers from discriminating against sick and older \nworkers, or from charging unlimited premiums.\n  In these difficult economic times, it is wrong to ignore the needs of \nworking families. It is wrong to repeatedly help our Nation's most \nprosperous firms, while ignoring the needs of millions of workers.\n  It is wrong to tell workers, who have been laid off that they don't \ndeserve unemployment benefits. It is wrong to tell hard-working men and \nwomen that the price they must pay for the terrorist attack is to go \nwithout the health care they need and deserve. It is wrong to offer \nonly an empty promise with unlimited premiums. It is wrong to enact a \nstimulus plan that says yes to the greedy and no to the needy.\n  It is time to end the suffering of the millions of families who have \nlost jobs and health insurance in this economic downturn. It is time \nfor Congress and the President to listen to the voices of working \nfamilies, instead of powerful special interests.\n  Over the past 3 months, Congress has acted to help affected \nindustries receive the assistance that they need. Businesses have also \nreceived stimulus after stimulus from the Federal Reserve which has cut \ninterest rates 11 times. But business clearly has excess capacity \ntoday. Providing more benefits to business is not what will help this \ncountry recover most effectively.\n  Economic recovery will come best and quickest helping unemployed \nworkers pay for their groceries, their mortgage and their health costs. \nWe reject the Republican proposals, because we cannot accept a plan \nthat fails so many millions of workers. We owe it to all the Americans \nwho have lost their jobs to provide the support they need and deserve, \nand to provide it now.\n\n[[Page S14038]]\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, at the beginning of this year we passed a \nseries of tax cuts. This was a strong action in favor of hardworking \nAmericans. With the recent slowdown in the economy, we must again act, \nand act quickly, for the American worker. Historically, Congress has \nfailed to act quick enough to provide economic relief when it is \nneeded. Let us not repeat this error. It is imperative that we now take \nthis opportunity to act in unison to provide the American people with \nthe assistance they deserve.\n  Several economic stimulus packages have been proposed. The House has \nrecently passed a stimulus package that I feel will give the economy a \nmuch needed boost and provide dislocated workers with the temporary \nassistance they require. I, as well as many of my colleagues, have some \nreservations about certain items contained in this package. But for the \nsake of the economy and the American worker we must take quick and \ndecisive action now. Overall, this stimulus package is a positive and \nmuch-needed step in the right direction.\n  We must provide aid to dislocated workers. In times of a slow \neconomy, many hardworking Americans are forced from their jobs through \nno fault of their own. It is of the utmost importance that we provide \nthe support these hardworking Americans deserve. This package provides \naround 20 billion dollars in aid to these displaced workers, which \nincludes a measure that will provide a 13 week extension to \nunemployment benefits, supporting American individuals and families in \ntheir time of financial hardship. This also provides support to \nMedicaid. This assistance is a temporary and much needed helping hand \nto those whose families and way of life are currently threatened by the \nrecent economic downturn.\n  When we have taken care of these dislocated workers, we must look \nforward to what lies beyond the realm of short-term relief. History has \nshown us time and time again that overall economic growth is one of \nlong term planning. Here we have the opportunity to provide the economy \nwith a short and long term boost via a 10 year investment stimulus \npackage. This would provide almost $160 billion worth of support, \nthrough the year 2011, to small businesses and taxpayers. This package \ncalls for increased tax cuts for individuals, $60 billion of tax relief \nin Fiscal Year 2002 and $112 billion over the next 10 years. This \npackage will provide health care tax credits so that displaced workers \nand their families do not go without medical coverage. Furthermore, \nthis package provides increases in investment opportunities and net \noperating loss flexibility for small businesses.\n  This package, aptly named Economic Stimulus and Aid to Dislocated \nWorkers, is a good start. In the future, we will need to return to \nthese issues. We will need to provide more incentives for long term \neconomic growth and development. But our immediate action on this \npackage is crucial. We must act now, we must pass this stimulus bill \nbefore Christmas, because this is what the American people need and \ndeserve. I have commended my colleagues on the passage of the education \nschool reform bill; a bill that leaves no child behind. We must now \nensure that American families, workers, and the temporarily unemployed \nare not left behind. The President proposed an economic security \npackage in October. Now I stand before you in December and tell you \nthat the American people can wait no longer. We must support our \neconomy and our unemployed workers now. I humbly ask my fellow \nSenators: Put aside your differences and vote in unison for the \neconomy, for hardworking displaced Americans, and for the American \nfamily.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, at a time when so many Americans are out of \nwork, with out Nation at war and with, appropriately, calls for \nnational unity, I regret to say I have to come to the floor to address \nwhat I feel is the ultimate breakdown on unity. Rather than delivering \na responsible stimulus package that is targeted and temporary, my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have been working overtime to \nturn a legitimate policy debate into a personal exercise in \ndemonization. They have worked hard to turn a battle of ideas into a \nbattle of name calling. And their focus has been our leader Tom \nDaschle. They have called him obstructionist--partisan--divisive--and \nworse.\n  Now let me make clear for the record, I'm not worried about Tom \nDaschle. He's tough and resilient like the South Dakota prairie. He \nwon't buckle, he won't shrink from their charges, and Tom Daschle knows \nthat truth wins out in the end. He knows that what a different wartime \nleader, Abraham Lincoln, said is still true: ``If the end brings me out \nall right, what is said against me won't amount to anything. If the end \nbrings me out wrong, ten angels swearing I was right would make no \ndifference.'' By that measure, Tom Daschle will do just fine. But let's \nbe honest. This really isn't about Tom Daschle. It's about a Republican \nParty that knows their agenda won't stand up to the light of day and so \nthey need to make the debate about something else.\n  Can't pass drilling in an Arctic Refuge on its merits? Then do it \nbecause you're patriotic. Can't do that? Attach it to a ban on human \ncloning. Have that cynical effort rejected almost unanimously, then \njust blame the Democratic Leader. Can't ram backloaded, retroactive \ncorporate tax giveaways through Congress while ignoring workers? Well, \nthat must be because Tom Daschle is a partisan. Better to demonize the \nDemocratic leader than acknowledge that your stimulus bill is \nunacceptable because it won't stimulate the economy. Better to attack \nTom Daschle than admit that your bill is an insult to the working, \neveryday Americans who've been honored in words countless times since \nSeptember 11th but insulted by the first so-called stimulus bill that \nthe Republican House passed by one vote. Then, Senate Republicans \nprevented a vote on a balanced package put together by the Fiance \nCommittee.\n  Now, the House is set to vote on a supposed ``bipartisan \ncompromise''--``bipartisan'' because it may likely get 51 or 52 votes \nhere in the Senate. But it is not a stimulus bill. It's a tax cut bill \nthat will spend $211 billion over the next five years, with more than \nhalf of that cost coming after 2002, when the administration believes \nthat the economy will have already recovered. A ``bipartisan'' bill is \nnot one that barely gets enough votes for passage. A bipartisan bill is \none like the education bill we passed yesterday, which received 87 \nvotes. We were statesmen when we passed--almost unanimously--an \nemergency spending bill, a use-of-force resolution, a counterterrorism \nbill, an airline industry bailout, and an airport security bill that \nwill make the skies safer for millions of Americans. But in a Senate as \nclosely divided as this one, to call a bill ``bipartisan'' that gets \ntwo or three Democrats to vote for it is laughable.\n  There are still other ways in which statesmanship can be exercised. \nStatesmanship can be resisting bad ideas that take advantage of \nnational emotion to do unacceptable special interest favors for a \nfavored political constituency. That, regrettably, is what the \nRepublican stimulus bill is all about, although they will tell you it \nis for workers. But they do nothing to expand unemployment insurance to \nthe many thousands of laid-off workers who are not currently eligible \nfor benefits, and their ideas for health care simply will not work. And \nso we find ourselves divided--not because Tom Daschle is an \nobstructionist, but because a decades-old partisan agenda which was on \nits last legs before September 11th has been revived under the guise of \neconomic security. Average Americans are being denied unemployment \ninsurance and health care because Republicans want to hold out for more \nfor those who are doing fine as it is. So we have an impasse--we are \nfighting for everyone to be treated fairly--they're fighting to reward \nthose already rewarded with no guarantee it will be spent or invested \nin a way that has any immediate stimulative impact on an economy that \nneeds it. No wonder they'd rather just attack Tom Daschle--it is easier \nthan dealing in the truth and moving this economy forward and helping \nAmerica's workers.\n\n  It doesn't need to be this way. In early October, three weeks after \nthe terrorist attacks, Democrats and Republicans in the House and \nSenate agreed to a list of bipartisan principles for stimulus. These \nincluded the belief that the package should be temporary,\n\n[[Page S14039]]\n\nhelp those most vulnerable, impact the economy quickly, be broad-based, \nand include out-year offsets. The Republican leader of the Ways and \nMeans Committee in the House abandoned those bipartisan negotiations in \norder to push through his own partisan package by one vote. It is his \ntruculence, and the insistence of the Republicans that we reduce the \ncorporate Alternative Minimum Tax and cut individual tax rates even \nmore than we did in June, that have led directly to the situation we \nfind ourselves in today.\n  Mr. President, 700,000 Americans lost their jobs in October and \nNovember alone. The unemployment rate is not at 5.7 percent. The \ncountry is at war, we have an economy in negative growth, and we are on \nthe verge of returning to an era of deficits after finally putting our \nfiscal house in order. We should not be passing large, permanent tax \ncuts unless we can be certain that the cuts will have a stimulative \nimpact. The tax cuts proposed by most Republicans would not have that \neffect, since most of the costs occur after 2002. Again, this is not a \nstimulus bill--it is a $200 billion tax cut disguised as a stimulus \nbill. I still hope that the Senate can work to develop a bipartisan \nagreement, and I commend my leader for his continued efforts. We owe it \nto working Americans everywhere to pass a responsible bill. We know \nthat a real stimulus bill should contain some tax relief for \nbusinesses, provided that it will help spur new investment or address \ntemporary cashflow concerns. We know that we should provide some \ntemporary tax relief to those families who are likely to spend the \nmoney, thus helping generate some additional demand. We know that we \nneed to help unemployed workers make ends meet, and make sure that they \ndon't lose their health insurance as a result of the ripple effects \nfrom the terrorist attacks of September 11th.\n  And we know that we need to temporarily offset some of the impact of \nthe current downturn on the states, by increasing the federal Medicaid \nmatching rate, or FMAP. Let's be clear: Laid-off workers cannot \ncontribute to economic recovery. The answer is not to sit back and wait \nfor economic benefits to trickle down to workers already thrown off the \njob. Instead we must invest in health care, unemployment insurance, and \nworker retraining to help put money in their pockets and bring \ndislocated workers back into the economic mainstream of this country. \nWe need to do that even if we can't agree on how to boost the economy \nthrough tax cuts. That's why I introduced the Putting Americans First \nAct, to take these worker protections out of the stimulus debate and \nprovide a guarantee of immediate relief for those who have been hurt by \nthe economic recession. The legislation would empower the states to \nexpand unemployment compensation and health insurance coverage and \nprovide help to states in which welfare caseloads are sharply \nincreasing.\n  Common sense and common decency tells us now is not the time for a \ncorporate grab-bag of tax cuts, or for revisiting a debate about future \nmarginal tax rates--particularly when these rate cuts would do nothing \nfor more than three-quarters of the population. It is incumbent upon us \nto act in the best interests of our country as a whole, not in the \ninterests of a select few. All Americans want to see this economy get \nmoving again, and no Americans want to see this country begin a new \nchapter in our history where we hold back health insurance and \nunemployment benefits in tough times because Democrats won't agree to \nfurther permanent tax cuts.\n  Let's put things straight and meet the objectives of the American \npeople and not the objectives of an ideological minority, and let's \nstop demonizing those who disagree with us. We owe the American people \nbetter than what they have been given at one of the most important \ntimes in our Nation's history, and it's time the Congress delivered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, there is no question that we are now \nin the middle of a recession. Even before the terrorist attacks 3 \nmonths ago, economic growth had slowed dramatically and unemployment \nwas rising. Since September 11, the number of payroll jobs has declined \nby an average of 314,000 per month, unemployment has increased by an \naverage of 392,000 per month, and consumer confidence is at its lowest \nlevel in 7 years.\n  In response to their pessimistic mood and uncertainty about the \nfuture, consumers stayed away from shopping centers and retail sales \nfell by 2.4 percent in September, the largest one-month drop since \n1987. In Arkansas, more than three-fourths of employers indicate they \nhave no plans to expand in the next 6 months, whether by adding jobs, \nmaking capital investments, or seeking new business opportunities. On \nOctober 5, the President publicly urged Congress to send him an \neconomic stimulus package that encourages consumer spending, promotes \nbusiness investment, and helps dislocated workers.\n  The House of Representatives has now twice passed economic stimulus \nlegislation. I ask you, Mr. President, how many more Americans have to \nlose their jobs? How many more businesses have to file for bankruptcy? \nHow many more families do we have to see turned away from their own \ndoctor's office because their medical insurance has run out before we \nput petty politics aside and do something to help those that so badly \nneed our help.\n  I have received hundreds of letters, e-mails, faxes, and phone calls \nfrom people all over my home State of Arkansas, as I'm sure have all of \nmy colleagues, from people who need our help and need it now. Take for \nexample an e-mail I recently received from a constituent in West \nMemphis who wrote:\n\n       I am one of the 450,000 Americans who were laid off before \n     the September 11th attack, and I am going to need extended \n     unemployment benefits.\n       My plant in Forrest City is in the process of closing. My \n     last day was July 27. Since then, I have spent several hours \n     a day trying to find another job. Things are tough right now. \n     Plus, I have another problem--I am a few years away from \n     retirement. I'm too young to retire but too old to get \n     another job. I know that age discrimination is against the \n     law (wink, wink), but the truth is that not even the \n     government will hire a sixty year old.\n       In a couple of months, my $300 a week unemployment will run \n     out. When that happens, I will have to dip into my retirement \n     funds--if there's anything left by then--to pay the bills. An \n     extension of benefits will help some, and would be \n     appreciated. What I want more than government help, however, \n     is a job.\n       If your staff knows of agencies, websites, etc., which \n     specialize in senior jobseekers' need, I would appreciate \n     knowing about them. I have a lifetime of knowledge and \n     experience to offer a company, and I have kept up with the \n     latest philosophies of manufacturing, as well. There are just \n     more people than jobs right now.\n       This is NOT how and when I expected to retire!\n       Best Wishes--Mike\n\n  Some simply write and say: ``Please, I urge you help get an economic \nrecovery bill passed now.''\n  While each person has their own individual story to tell about the \neffects this recession is having on them, they are all saying the same \nthing: We need help now! We don't have time for you to play politics \nwith this one. People's lives and livelihoods are at stake.\n  One of, quite possible, the only good things to come out of the \nhorrific terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11th is that we \nsaw, even if for a limited time, real bipartisanship occur here on \nCapitol Hill. Well guess what . . . the American people saw \nbipartisanship in action and now expect it, and deserve it, every day. \nBipartisanship was once a word that was only spoken by those in \npolitical office. It is now being used by nearly every person that \ncontacts me. We need to listen to these people and do what they sent us \nhere to do. We need to work together today, not a month from now, and \nsend to the President an economic stimulus package before we go home \nfor the year.\n  A constituent of mine recently wrote me and said: ``Please quit \nbickering and pass an economic stimulus package. Senators, it seems \nthat the `ball is in your court'. Thank you, and God Bless America.'' I \nthink he summed it up rather nicely.\n  Mr. President, the ball is in our court, and we need to do something \nwith it. We need to pass an economic stimulus package today.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my serious \ndisappointment that we could not reach agreement on a stimulus package \nthat would both help America's workers and encourage immediate business \ninvestment to strengthen our economy. I intend to keep fighting for \nreal help for the workers who have lost their jobs\n\n[[Page S14040]]\n\nand need health care coverage until they get the assistance they need.\n  I think an economic recovery package is still important work to do. \nHad my Republican counterparts been willing to stay at the negotiating \ntable and keep talking, I would not have left my post until we reached \nagreement. As a conferee on this unique Leadership Conference, I am \nespecially disappointed that our work was abandoned by the Republican \nLeadership.\n  Unfortunately, the House Leadership chose to walk out on the tough \nwork of negotiation and move a partisan bill that includes numerous, \nmultiyear tax cuts for corporations and for the wealthiest Americans. \nThe House bill would do little to actually stimulate our economy and \nwould not provide real health care coverage for workers in need of \nmeaningful assistance to retain their health insurance.\n  Moreover, from what I can learn of the legislation which passed just \nhours ago, it will have significant costs after 2002, as much as $67 \nbillion. That means substantial deficit spending to finance corporate \ntax relief and additional tax cuts for the top 25 percent of all \ntaxpayers. Nearly 80 percent of West Virginia taxpayers would not get a \ndime from the tax rate changes proposed by the House Republicans, and \nto add insult to injury, their payroll taxes would pay for the \ncorporate tax breaks. I cannot support raiding billions of dollars from \nthe Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds.\n  Nearly a million people have lost their jobs in recent months as a \nresult of the economic downturn that was exacerbated by the September \n11 terrorist attacks on our Nation. Those families deserve the help \nthat the Senate Finance Committee package provided, substantial help to \npay for health insurance that they can count on and a temporary \nextension and improvement of unemployment benefits, which includes \nimproved benefits and makes part-time and low wage workers eligible. \nUnemployed Americans deserve access to affordable health care and to \nunemployment benefits as they seek new employment.\n  I deeply regret that the House Leadership conferees could not, or I \nshould say, would not, accept the Senate's worker package that provides \nimmediate, but temporary health care coverage for displaced workers and \nextended and improved unemployment insurance. The House approach on \nhealth care was inadequate and unworkable. It would not have guaranteed \nhealth care coverage to a single solitary worker. It failed to include \nneeded reforms to the insurance market to make insurance affordable, or \nto ensure that a decent benefit package was available.\n  I am deeply frustrated that the Republican conferees wanted to leave \nworkers at the mercy of the insurance industry. Under the House bill, \nworkers would have had to, on their own, seek affordable coverage on \nthe current, failed individual market, armed with limited resources and \nzero leverage. Older and sicker workers would have been left entirely \nout of luck with that kind of approach. I am frustrated that House \nLeaders insisted on promoting their ideology over existing programs \nthat could have been used to provide reliable health care coverage to \nworkers who need it.\n  I believe our economy would benefit from additional stimulus in the \nform of 1-year business incentives and additional individual tax cuts \nfor those taxpayers who were left out and did not benefit from the \nrebate checks last summer. I believe we could have come together on a \npackage that would have helped workers even as it provided business tax \ncuts like bonus depreciation and expensing for small businesses. We \ncould have helped many businesses who are having a hard time in this \neconomy by extending the carryback period for net operating losses, \nNOLs. I also firmly believe we could have reached accommodation on the \nissue of AMT relief, if only the House Leadership had been willing to \naccept real health care and unemployment coverage as part of the \npackage.\n  But the House chose to move forward with a plan that consists \nprimarily of tax cuts, not help for the workers who have been promised \nfor months, promised by both the President and Congress, that we would \nattend to their needs after the tragedy of September 11. Instead, the \nHouse bill's cost over both 5 and 10 years is over 90 percent tax cuts. \nLess than half of those tax cuts would come in 2002 because it is a \nback-loaded plan, not the temporary stimulus measure Congress and the \nPresident had mutually agreed was the goal of a stimulus package. \nCommon sense tells us that tax cuts in 2003 don't stimulate the economy \nduring our current downturn. There is strong evidence that the House's \nproposed tax cuts to higher income individuals would not stimulate the \neconomy in the out years, either, because wealthier individuals tend to \nsave rather than spend.\n  Finally, the House bill does not sufficiently address the desperate \nfinancial conditions of the States, or the fact that some of the \nbusiness tax provisions in the bill will actually mean the States lose \nbillions in revenue. The House bill, as far as I can estimate, does not \neven offset those costs. States are facing a collective, roughly $50 \nbillion deficit, and experts believe the House bill will cost States. \nEstimates are that West Virginia alone could lose $35 million in State \nrevenues because of policies embedded in the House Republican package. \nThat means West Virginia and other States would be more likely to cut \nhealth care to the poor and other low income programs just when the \neconomy makes the programs most essential.\n  In sum, workers did not get the help they need or deserve from the \nHouse Republicans' bill. They did not get the consideration they \ndeserve from the House Republican Leadership. And some useful business \ntax incentives, that combined with additional assistance for the \nunemployed, could have effectively stimulated our economy, won't pass \nthis year.\n  I had hoped we could have put our partisan and ideological \ndifferences aside to speed relief to workers and our ailing economy. I \nwill not give up until we help the people who are waiting to get their \nfair share of Federal assistance, just as other sectors of our economy \nhave been provided with Federal aid in this unusual time.\n  Today, in an effort to at least provide a short-term extension of \nunemployment benefits to workers on the verge of running out of \nassistance and facing the holidays, the Senate Majority Leader asked \nunanimous consent to take up and pass a 13-week extension of existing \nunemployment benefits. He asked for a one-time, 13-week extension of \nexisting benefits, no benefit improvements, no expanded eligibility, \njust a straight, short-term extension.\n  The Senate Republican Leader objected to that request, despite the \nfact that we have frequently extended these unemployment benefits in \nthe past. That tells you something about why the stimulus conference \ndid not produce legislation.

Mr. President, we are all tired. This has been a long \nday in what has been a long week and a long session. But before we go \nour separate ways for the holidays, I want to thank my colleagues for \nthe support and kindness they have shown me during my short time as \nmajority leader.\n  I thank our staffs, the many hard-working men and women who enable us \nto do our jobs--from the Capitol Police to the Official Reporters who \ntranscribe our debates, the people in the cloakroom, the people who \nserve our meals, the doorkeepers, the pages, and so many others. The \npublic may not know their names, but we know the Senate could not \nfunction without them.\n  On a very personal note, I want to say a special word of thanks to my \nown staff. In the last 3 months, they have experienced the horrors of \nSeptember 11 as we all did, but they have undergone an additional \nchallenge few of us ever have, or will, face.\n  Two months ago my staff, along with members of Senator Feingold's \nstaff, and law enforcement officers, were exposed to lethal levels of \nanthrax when a letter containing that deadly bacteria was opened in my \noffice. I am pleased to report that they are all healthy today, and I \nam proud to say that they have continued to work throughout all of this \ntime.\n\n[[Page S14041]]\n\n  They are victims of terrorism. Yet they have spent the last 2 months \ndedicated to the effort to protect the rest of America from a truly \nsimilar fate. Their courage and their grace is truly heroic and a \nsource of inspiration to me.\n  They are extraordinary people who have endured extraordinary \ncircumstances. I could not be more proud of them.\n  We started this year appropriately in unusual circumstances. For 17 \ndays between the day this Congress was sworn in and the day President \nBush was sworn in, Democrats held the majority in the Senate. I joked \nback then that I intended to savor every one of my 17 days as majority \nleader. As it turns out, those days were just a preamble.\n  For nearly 6 months now, I have again had the rare privilege of \nserving as majority leader of this Senate. While I can't say I have \nenjoyed every day of these last 6 months--our country has experienced \ntoo much sadness for that to be true--I am honored to have had the \nchance to work with all. I am proud of much of what we have been able \nto achieve together.\n  We made history this year, not just once, but over and over again. It \nwas a year ago this month that the Supreme Court issued its ruling--the \nfirst time in history that the Supreme Court had intervened to settle a \nPresidential election. We started this Congress last January as the \nfirst 50-50 Senate in our Nation's history. Some observers predicted we \nwould never be able to agree on a plan to divide power fairly and \nefficiently, but we did.\n  Then in late May, Senator Jeffords made his historic and \nextraordinary decision to leave his party and become the Senate's only \nofficially Independent Member. Never before had majority control of the \nSenate changed on the basis of one Senator's decision. Again, we made \nhistory, and we made it work.\n  Then came the horrific morning of September 11. Even now, more than 3 \nmonths later, it is hard to imagine the magnitude of that loss. If you \nread one name every minute, it would take more than 3 days to read the \nlist of all those who died on September 11.\n  A little more than a month later, the anthrax letter was opened in my \noffice. The Hart Building became the site of the largest anthrax spill \nanywhere, ever, and the largest biological weapons attack in our \nNation's history.\n  More than once during these 6 months I have found myself thinking \nabout the words of America's second President, John Adams.\n  In 1774, John Adams wrote in his diary of his concerns over the \nquality of the members of the Continental Congress, ``We have not men \nfor these times,'' he worried. ``We are deficient in genius, in \neducation, in travel, in fortune, in everything.''\n  That is how our Founders saw themselves: deficient in almost every \nway. Yet they went on to create the world's greatest experiment, now \nthe world's oldest democracy.\n  I suspect we have all wondered, at least once or twice since \nSeptember 11, whether the men and women of this Senate are equal to \nthese times. It would be hubris not to wonder.\n  As this year ends, we can take some pride knowing that we were \nlargely equal to our times.\n  In the days following the attacks, we demonstrated greater unity than \nI have ever experienced in my years in Congress. We worked with each \nother, and with the President, for the good of the Nation.\n  We gave the President the authority to use force to defeat terrorism.\n  We gave law enforcement new tools and authority to pursue terrorists.\n  We passed billions of dollars in emergency aid to help the \ncommunities and families and business devastated by the attacks of \nSeptember 11th rebuild and recover.\n  We also passed legislation to keep the airlines flying--and to make \nairports safer.\n  Those measures will help our nation recover from the terrorist \nattacks, and help prevent future attacks.\n  We also passed other important measures.\n  Earlier this week, we sent the President a new, bipartisan bill to \nstrengthen America's public schools. The new No Child Left Behind Act \nmarks the first major overhaul of our Nation's education system in more \nthan 35 years.\n  It is a blueprint for real educational progress that includes good \nideas from both parties. More importantly, it reflects the experiences \nand the needs of America's schoolchildren, parents, teachers, employers \nand many others who care deeply about America's schools.\n  We can all take some pride in having been a part of those bipartisan \nsuccesses.\n  At the same time, we must acknowledge, there have been occasions on \nwhich we were not equal to our times. There have been too many \ninstances when partisanship has prevented us from doing what needs to \nbe done. That is deeply regrettable.\n  We should have passed a genuine economic recovery plan to lift up \nAmerica's economy and help laid-off workers. In the first weeks after \nthe terrorist attacks, we worked together to craft such a plan. Even \nafter Republican leaders walked away from that bipartisan effort, we \ncontinued to try to reach out to them.\n  We compromised repeatedly on the details of our proposal--all to no \navail. In the end, we could not accept a plan that takes $211 billion \nout of Social Security and gives most of it, in the form of tax cuts, \nto the wealthiest individuals and corporations in this country. And our \ncolleagues would accept no less.\n  We should have passed a farm bill this year.\n  We talk a lot about families that have fallen on hard times in the \nlast year, especially those who are economic victims of September 11. \nAnd we should be concerned about these families.\n  But what about America's farm and ranch families? The recession \ndidn't start two quarters ago for them. They have been battling near-\nDepression conditions in the farm economy for years now.\n  Prices for many commodities are lower today than any time since the \nGovernment started keeping records, back in 1910.\n  If you don't know who these families are, come to South Dakota. \nYou'll see: they are some of the hardest-working people in this \ncountry. And they need our help.\n  We didn't pass a terrorism insurance bill.\n  We didn't finish work on the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is stuck in \na conference committee--along with campaign finance reform.\n  We didn't increase the minimum wage.\n  We didn't pass real election reform to protect the right of every \nAmerican to vote and have that vote counted.\n  As we leave for the holidays, I want to say to my colleagues, and to \nthe American people: We recognize that these are critically important \nissues. They will not go away. When this Senate returns next year, \nthese are among the items that will top our agenda.\n  Senator Stabenow spoke earlier today about an idea some of her \nconstituents proposed to her. They suggested America create ``living \nmemorials'' to the victims of September 11. These ``living memorials'' \nwould take the form of community service projects. Through them, the \nlove and courage of the people who died on September 11 will continue \nto live on.\n  It is a beautiful and fitting way to remember the victims. I \nencourage all of my colleagues to support it.\n  But there is perhaps an even more fitting way for us to remember the \nvictims of September 11. We must recapture the spirit of bipartisanship \nthat allowed us to accomplish so much together in the first weeks and \nmonths after the attacks.\n  The rescue workers did their job.\n  The firefighters continue to do their job.\n  We must put aside the partisanship and do our job.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for what we were able to do together \nthis year. And I wish them, and the American people, a peaceful holiday \nseason.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I very much appreciate the remarks of \nthe majority leader. He indicated that we should have passed a farm \nbill. We should have passed an energy bill as well, Mr. President. \nUnfortunately, the majority leader did not mention that.\n  I think it is fitting to once again discuss the priorities that were \nlaid before this body by our President--trade promotion, stimulus, \nenergy legislation.\n  So as we look at where we are in the Senate today, clearly, we have \nnot been responsive to our very popular President, nor have we been \nvery responsive to the Nation. Indeed, we labored several days on the \nfarm bill. Some have suggested that perhaps it is easier to address the \nextended benefits associated with that farm bill than the realities \nassociated with our increased dependence on foreign oil.\n  As I look at the session we have just completed, I think many of my \ncolleagues would agree that as we look at the completion of the year \nand the realization that we are coming back next year, we should review \nin some detail just what progress has been made relative to the \npriorities that were laid by our President before this body.\n  When this Congress began, I introduced a comprehensive bipartisan \nenergy measure with the senior Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Breaux. \nLater, the ranking member of the Energy Committee, Senator Bingaman, \nalong with Senator Daschle, introduced legislation that touched on many \nissues that were covered in our bill. That was March.\n  Shortly thereafter, Senator Daschle indicated that those problems, \nand more, demonstrate the overwhelming need for a new and comprehensive \nenergy policy. America is faced with a grave energy policy that will \nget worse if we do not act. Prior to the Memorial Day recess, the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources had almost completed its \nhearing schedule and we were discussing dates to mark up comprehensive \nenergy legislation. Again, the majority leader was supportive. On May \n16, he stated:\n\n       The problem needs comprehensive attention and the problem \n     needs bipartisan solutions. We are concerned about the lack \n     of consultation to date. There has been none. There doesn't \n     appear to be any real sense of urgency here.\n\n  I find that a rather curious statement since the only bipartisan \nmeasure remained one that I had introduced with Senator Breaux of \nLouisiana, and I was receiving complaints about how aggressive was the \nhearing schedule we were holding.\n  In May, we received the administration's comprehensive national \nenergy policy, and both the Senate and the House began to prepare for \ndebate on comprehensive, bipartisan, national security energy \nlegislation. We were pressured, perhaps, because the House had done its \njob. It had reported out its bill, H.R. 4, the energy bill. I stated \nthat I was committed to bringing a bipartisan measure out of the Energy \nCommittee in time for the debate prior to the July 4 recess.\n  Then, of course, we had a little change of control here, and our \ncurrent majority leader didn't seem quite as anxious or concerned with \nenergy legislation. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \nrather than proceeding to a markup, either on my bipartisan measure or \nthe new chairman's more limited bill, suddenly began to repeat \nhearings--in one case, hearings from the same witnesses who had \nappeared before us only a few weeks previously.\n  The majority leader still indicated a willingness to proceed even if \nit did not have the same sense of urgency. So on July 31, the majority \nleader stated:\n\n       The Democratic caucus is very supportive of finding ways \n     with which to pursue additional energy production. I think \n     production has to be part of any comprehensive energy policy.\n\n  This was encouraging since the only bipartisan bill that I had \nintroduced included significant domestic production.\n  In retrospect, we all should have known that when the majority leader \ngot around to finally introducing energy legislation, as he did several \nweeks ago, the only production that he would be supporting would be, \nevidently, foreign production from Iran and elsewhere in the OPEC \nnations, and the only jobs and economic stimulus created would be in \nCanada, as he indicated support for a pipeline, not specifying the \nroute and as a consequence, obviously favoring the alternative in \nCanada, which is very much opposed by my colleagues, Senator Stevens, \nRepresentative Young, and the Governor of the State of Alaska.\n  My point is, in their legislation they left the route selection \nneutral, and this is the one favored by the Canadians. On August 1 and \n2, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources finally began \nconsideration of research and development provisions of energy \nlegislation. The majority leader even announced on August 1:\n\n       There is a great deal of interest in our caucus in moving a \n     comprehensive energy bill in the early part of the fall. The \n     Energy Committee is going to be completing its work about \n     mid-September.\n\n  He was certainly correct in stating the Energy Committee would be \ncompleting its work in mid-September, but little did we know what he \nmeant was that he intended to shut down the committee and prevent us \nfrom reporting comprehensive bipartisan energy legislation.\n  When we returned in September and our schedule then continued to \nslide, the majority leader once again said on September 6:\n\n       I have indicated all along that it is our hope and \n     expectation to bring up energy before the end of the session, \n     and that is still my intention.\n\n  Like Charlie Brown, once again we believed that Lucy would not pull \nthe football away, but that was not the case. But it was fall and it \nwas football season, and the majority leader finally pulled the plug on \nthe pretense of concern.\n  It has always been clear that a bipartisan majority of the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources has been ready and willing to report \ncomprehensive legislation with a balance of conservation efficiencies, \nresearch and development, and domestic production.\n  When we on both sides of the aisle stated and indicated our intent to \npress for a firm schedule to report the legislation, then the majority \nleader, which in my opinion was in defiance of the rules of the Senate \nand of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, simply shut the \nEnergy Committee down.\n  I have been around here 21 years, Mr. President. I have never heard \nof that particular initiation by a majority leader of shutting a \ncommittee down.\n  On October 9, without consultation or advance notice, the members of \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources were told they were \nirrelevant and would not be allowed to consider any legislation for the \nremainder of the session.\n  I read from a press release from the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Bingaman:\n\n       At the request of the majority leader, Senator Daschle, the \n     Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Chairman Jeff \n     Bingaman, today suspended any further markup on energy \n     legislation for this session of Congress.\n\n  I remind my colleagues, there is no provision in the Senate rules for \nthe majority leader to abolish the work of a standing committee by \nedict. That is what happened. The rules of the Senate require each \ncommittee to meet at least once a month before the Senate and while the \nSenate is in session to address the business of the committee.\n  The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has not met in business \nsession since August 2. The business of the committee is, among other \nthings, energy. I wonder the reason for the reluctance of the majority \nleader. Was he fearful the Energy Committee might report bipartisan \nlegislation, for certainly no amendment from this Senator or any other \nRepublican could be reported without some support from the Democratic \nside. It is clear the Democrats control the committee by a 12-to-11 \nratio. I can only guess perhaps the majority leader would have been \nbetter off requiring the committee to approve any amendments perhaps by \ntwo-thirds of the Democratic members, as he seems to have set on other \nissues.\n  It has now been 4\\1/2\\ months since the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources has held a business meeting, and we are no closer to \nconsideration of comprehensive legislation than we were when the \nmajority leader assumed control of the Senate.\n  The majority leader has indicated and has finally introduced a \nwarmed-\n\n[[Page S14043]]\n\nover version of the legislation that he cosponsored almost 9 months \nago. The majority leader has again perhaps indicated that he intends to \nmove energy legislation if there is time. Clearly, there is no more \ntime. This is it. We are out.\n  On the other hand, he has indicated a willingness when we return to \ntake up energy sometime in January or February. Now we hear we are \ngoing to go back to an Agriculture bill. We have asked the majority \nleader to give us an indication of his willingness to take up a bill \nand give us an up-or-down vote on it, but the indications are we are \ngoing to have to have 60 votes.\n  It is extraordinary that this body in times of national security and \nthe tremendous activity associated with the Mideast, the OPEC nations, \nIsrael, Afghanistan, Iraq, as we look to those areas for our security \ninterests, would have to have a dictate, but 51 votes on the issue will \nnot do it. We are going to need 60 votes.\n  We are going to get those 60 votes if that is what it takes, but I do \nnot know of another time when the national energy security of the \nNation was at risk requiring more than 50 votes. A simple majority \nevidently will not do.\n  Let me make it clear to the majority leader--and I have the greatest \nrespect for him--I am prepared to come back and spend day after day, \nnight after night debating an energy policy in this Senate and get the \njob done. This is a priority of our President, a priority of our \nNation, a priority of our veterans, and a priority of our labor groups.\n  A few weeks ago both the President and Vice President called for the \nSenate to end this partisan charade and address energy legislation.\n  The President said in a radio address not so long ago:\n\n       Last spring, I sent to Congress a comprehensive energy plan \n     that encourages conservation and greater energy independence. \n     The House has acted. The Senate has not.\n\n  The President of the United States is correct. Rather than a spirited \ndebate on comprehensive energy legislation, reported from the Energy \nCommittee, developed in an open process, the majority leader has \nsavaged the reforms of the 1970s to craft partisan legislation behind \nclosed doors with only selected special interests allowed to \nparticipate.\n  There is a process to get advice from members of the Energy \nCommittee, and that is in a business meeting. When the majority leader \nsays his legislation represents input from the Energy Committee, he is \nnot being accurate. Make no mistake, the Energy Committee has had no \ninput on this legislation that has been introduced by the majority \nleader. I accept that the bulk of the bill was drafted by our \ncommittee, but the chairman is not the committee, and it is clear \nneither he nor our majority leader evidently trusts the makeup of the \ncommittee to address it in a bipartisan manner and vote it out.\n  The reforms of the 1970s were designed precisely to curb the \ndictatorial powers of committee chairmen, as our distinguished \nPresident pro tempore noted in his history of the Senate.\n  The Vice President hit the nail on the head a few weeks ago in his \ndiscussion with Tim Russert on ``Meet the Press'' when he said:\n\n       But there is a disagreement with respect to Senator Daschle \n     on energy. The House of Representatives has moved and passed \n     an energy bill last summer. The Senate has not acted. Tom \n     pulled it out of the Energy Committee so they are not \n     considering in committee an energy bill at this point. The \n     House has passed a stimulus package. The Senate has yet to \n     act. The House just passed trade promotion authority. The \n     Senate has yet to act. In the energy area, it is \n     extraordinarily important that we move for energy security, \n     energy independence. We are never going to get all the way \n     over to energy independence, but given the volatility of the \n     Mideast and our increasing dependence on that part of the \n     world for oil, it is important we go forward, for example, \n     with things like ANWR.\n\n  I am embarrassed at the lack of action of this body as we conclude \nthis year in not having taken up an energy bill. I grant the farm bill \nis important, but the farm bill is not about to expire. We do not have \nan energy bill in this country. We should have an energy bill.\n  I assume the majority leader will continue to find items he thinks \nare more important than our national energy security. We have seen it: \nRailroad retirement, raising the price of milk to consumers through \ndairy compacts. As I indicated, next year we are going to address this \nissue and we will seek votes on the issue. I do not believe, on behalf \nof our constituents, we should duck these difficult decisions. I know \nthe majority leader shares those views as well.\n  Some time ago, this body voted to initiate sanctions on Iran and some \nother nations in the Mideast that produce oil because we were not \nsatisfied with their record of human rights, we were not satisfied with \ntheir record of full disclosure relative to the development of weapons \nof mass destruction. I proposed an amendment to include Iraq. At the \ntime during the debate, the majority leader committed to me he would at \nsome time give me an up-or-down vote.\n  I have communicated with the majority leader and asked him for the \nup-or-down vote. I have not received a response. I hope I will receive \na response very soon because I think it is important to recognize the \nsituation with regard to Iraq. We know Saddam Hussein is developing \nweapons of mass destruction. We have evidence of that, even though we \nhave not had a U.N. inspector in that country for some time. We know he \nsmuggled the oil.\n  Many Americans perhaps do not recognize we are importing nearly a \nmillion barrels of oil a day from Saddam Hussein, yet we are enforcing \na no-fly zone over that country. We are putting the lives of many of \nour young men and women at risk.\n  What is he attempting to do? He is attempting to shoot down our \naircraft. He has almost succeeded, but it almost seems as though we \ntake his oil, put it in our aircraft, enforce the no-fly zone, which is \nlike an air wall blockade. What does he do with our money? He pays the \nRepublican Army, develops a weapons capability, a biological \ncapability, and aims it at our ally Israel. It is beyond me why this \nNation and our foreign policy should rely on Saddam Hussein and Iraq \nfor our energy needs when we have the capability at home.\n  Finally, I think it is interesting to reflect on where we are in the \neconomic stimulus. We could not reach a conclusion. Yet our economy is \nin recession. We need a stimulus. It would help get us back on the \nright track.\n  The discussions have focused on this for some time. We have talked \nabout ``immediate.'' We have talked about ``temporary.'' We have talked \nabout the creation of jobs, increasing consumer spending or otherwise \nincreasing domestic product. I think we make a big mistake if we only \nfocus on those stimulus ideas that are of a temporary nature. We should \nalso focus on stimulus elements that will ensure the long-term economic \ngrowth of our country. Otherwise, we will have to come to the Senate at \nthe end of each economic cycle and perhaps have this debate over again.\n  One such permanent stimulus would be the establishment of a national \nenergy strategy that ensures energy prices that remain constant, \naffordable, reliable sources of energy which play an important role in \nfostering economic growth and development.\n  We have seen high prices. We have seen sectors of our economy. We \nhave seen the situation in California. We have seen increasing costs. \nWe have seen the development in the OPEC countries of a cartel where, \nwhen they want the price to go up, they decrease the supply.\n  High energy prices reduce consumer disposable income, reduce \nspending, and inhibit economic growth. Our friend Martin Feldstein, the \nformer Chairman of the Council on Economic Advisers, noted since the \nend of World War II economic downturns have coincided with energy price \nincreases. This most recent economic downturn is no exception. We have \nseen a rapid increase in oil prices occurring the first half of this \nyear, followed by similar increases in natural gas and electricity.\n  The result of data from the Bureau of Economic Statistics shows that \nwhile the GDP grew at 5.7 percent in the second quarter of 2000, the \nmost recent data showed the GDP has declined by 1.1 percent for the \nthird quarter. So I think we acknowledge we are in a recession.\n  This is consistent with findings of the National Bureau of Economic \nResearch that, on an average, for every 10 percent increase in oil \nprices, economic output falls by 2.5 percent, real wages\n\n[[Page S14044]]\n\ndrop by 1 percent, and increases in oil prices reduce the number of \nhours worked and increase unemployment.\n  We recall what has happened over a period of time, and as a \nconsequence of that we could generalize that high prices for energy and \nnatural gas cause significant impacts on those sectors of our economy \nthat do not depend on oil.\n  America and the world move on oil. We have other sources of energy \nfor electricity. We have seen impacts across the board. Energy spending \nby American families increased by nearly 30 percent in 2000. Heating \nbills tripled for many Americans, particularly in the Northeast. Small \nbusinesses had a great increase in costs associated with energy. We \nhave seen this. Thousands of jobs were lost. These high energy prices \nwere the result of one unavoidable fact: Our energy supplies failed to \nmeet our growing energy demands.\n  For 10 years following the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, \nU.S. demand for energy increased over 17 percent, while total energy \nproduction increased only 2.3 percent. By the end of last year, we had \nsimply run out of fuel for the sputtering American economy. That has \nchanged as a consequence of the tragedy of September 11, but it will \nnot stay that way. OPEC will initiate the cartel to again decrease \nsupplies.\n\n  We have seen what happened to our economy as a consequence of energy \nprice increases. We know a national energy strategy that balances \nsupply and demand could reduce threats and future recessions. Alan \nGreenspan noted on November 13:\n\n       As economic policymakers understand the focus on the impact \n     of the tragedy of September 11 and the further weakening of \n     the economy that follows these events, it is essential that \n     we do not lose sight of policies needed to ensure long-term \n     economic growth.\n       One of the most important objectives for those policies \n     should be assured availability of energy.\n\n  As a consequence, the U.S. relies on foreign imported oil with more \nthan one-half of its petroleum needs. Much of this comes from the \nMiddle East, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait.\n  Consider the consequences of the oil embargo in 1973. At the time, \ntensions ran high in the Middle East. Then we were involved in the war \non terrorism.\n  It makes sense to consider our energy security in the context of an \neconomic stimulus package. We have not done that. It makes sense to \nensure our economic security by ensuring the availability of affordable \nenergy supplies.\n  One aspect we have not considered in this equation is the \ncontribution of ANWR. Talking about stimulus, there is hardly any \nsingle item we could have come up with that would have been a more \nsignificant and genuine stimulus package than opening ANWR in my State \nof Alaska.\n  What would it have done? It would have created $3.3 billion in \nFederal bonuses, money that would have come in from the Federal \nTreasury as a consequence of leasing off Federal land. This would have \nbeen paid for by competitive bidding by the oil companies. It was a \njobs issue. It would have created 250,000 new jobs in this country.\n  The contribution of the steel industry is extremely significant, as \nwell. We have a stimulus package not even considered in the debate \nbecause we could not have a debate. We did not have an energy bill.\n  It would have created 250,000 new jobs and $3.3 billion in new \nFederal bid bonuses. And the bottom line is, not a red penny by the \ntaxpayer. That is the kind of stimulus we need in this country.\n  As we look at the end of the year, we have to recognize the \nobligation that we have to come back and do a better job. We need an \nenergy bill. We need it quickly. We need a stimulus in this country. We \ncould and should consider a genuine stimulus that results in jobs that \ndo not cost the taxpayer money, and as a consequence spurs the economy.\n  I hope as we address our New Year's resolutions we can recognize the \nHouse has done its job in energy legislation. We did not do our job in \nthe Senate. I am very disappointed. I am sure the President and the \nAmerican public shares that disappointment.\n  We have not been honest with the American people because we have a \ncrisis in energy. Our national security is at risk. We are risking the \nlives of men and women in the Middle East over this energy crisis. We \nshould address it here and relieve that dependence.\n  I wish all a happy and joyous holiday season, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to ask the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama, Mr. Sessions, how long he will be speaking. The reason I ask, \nI know the Presiding Officer has an engagement. He has to leave within \nanother 20 minutes, from what I understand.\n  How much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Twelve minutes would be sufficient.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me deliver my speech. I ask unanimous consent, am I \ncorrect that the Presiding Officer needs to leave the Presiding Chair \nno later than 7:45, or is it 7:50?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 7:50.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama may proceed for not to exceed 12 minutes and I will do \nsomething not often done around here; I do it quite often. I wait and \nwait and wait, realizing I can get recognition almost any time I want, \nbut I am usually willing to accommodate another Senator, even if that \nSenator is on the Republican side. Not many will accommodate me in that \nfashion, but I am glad to accommodate them.\n  I ask consent that the Senator from Alabama have not to exceed, say, \n10 minutes, after which I be recognized, and that mine be the last \nspeech of the day. I don't mind relieving the Senator in the Chair, so \nI will ask that the Senator from Alabama go ahead of me.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am delighted to follow the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I want to make my speech about Christmas in the main. We \nrefer to this as a holiday. It is not a holiday to me. This is \nChristmas, which is something different. It marks the greatest event \nthat ever occurred in the history of man. It split the centuries in \ntwo. There is B.C. and there is A.D. It was a tremendous event. I \nbelieve in Christ. I am a Christian--not a very worthy one, but a \nChristian. I respect those who are of a different religion. I respect \nthose who believe that Christ was a historic figure but not the \nMessiah, but a prophet. That is all right. They have a right to believe \nthat.\n  Both would agree that it was a tremendous event. This is something \nbeyond just being a holiday. When someone wishes me happy holidays, I \nsay: No, Happy Christmas.\n  I want to make a statement about Christmas, so I ask unanimous \nconsent the Senator from Alabama proceed for 10 minutes and I follow \nhim.\n  I ask the question of the minority, while I am on the floor, Is there \nan intention on that side of the aisle to seek unanimous consent by \nSenator Brownback? If there is still the intention to make that \nrequest, I want to be here to object to it; if there is not, I may go \non my way happy.\n  I make that consent and I will see to it that the Chair gets relief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S14044-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14044-S14045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. I \nthank him for his fidelity to his faith and for his fidelity to this \nSenate and the courtesies and rules that need to be followed to make \nsure we live up to the high ideals on which this institution was \nfounded. He, more than anyone I know, has taught us the history, and \nthe importance, of what we are about. His courtesy to me, a first-term \nSenator, is typical of his many courtesies.\n  I simply say how deeply disappointed I have been that we will be \nleaving this body before Christmas without having passed a stimulus \npackage. Experts have said a good stimulus package, $75 to $100 \nbillion, would preserve 300,000 jobs in this country. That is a lot of \njobs. Those people, if they are working, will be happier. Those \nfamilies will be happier. The homes will be happier. They will pay \ntaxes. They will pay State and local sales taxes and other taxes. They \nwill pay Federal taxes. It will help us run our government.\n  But if they lose their jobs, there will be a sadness and an unease in \ntheir homes, a difficulty that otherwise would not take place, and the \ngovernment itself, State, local and Federal, will lose revenue.\n\n[[Page S14045]]\n\n  It is a big deal if we can affect the economy. I do not think there \nis any doubt. I have been convinced for a long time in the projections \nthat we could achieve a 1-percent or a half-percent increase in the \ngross domestic product by passing the stimulus package. That is \nimportant. I believe we should pass a bill.\n  No less than 2 weeks ago I became deeply concerned that we might \nactually leave this body without a bill being passed. At first I did \nnot think that was possible. We brought up a bill and disagreed, the \nHouse had passed a bill, and some here didn't like it but negotiators \nwere working together. The Finance Committee chairman and ranking \nmember, the majority leader, the Democratic leader and the Republican \nleader, they were all working and talking and surely a bill would pass, \nI thought. They would work out their differences.\n  Frankly, I never believed exactly what was in that bill, if it met a \nfew simple principles, would make a lot of difference. Probably, \nanother $100 billion, another $75 billion into the economy we would \nhave made an impact. There was no doubt in my mind if a middle-income \nfamily would have gotten a 2-percent reduction in the amount of money \nwithheld from their taxes they would have more money and they would \nspend it.\n  Because of my concern, I offered my own bill. As a matter of fact, we \nwere here one night until midnight. I sat around with some colleagues \nand refined my ideas and four of us introduced a stimulus package. It \nwas simple. It did not have a lot of complexity to it. Frankly, I did \nnot think anybody could find anything wrong with any of it or would \nobject to a bit of it. I said: We offered this bill; let's just vote on \nthat.\n  It had a number of provisions in it that I thought were worthwhile. \nMy favorite contribution, what I believe in and would like to see \naccomplished and really needs to be accomplished as part of this \npackage, or it may be more difficult to pass, is the advanced payment \nof the earned-income tax credit.\n  The Presiding Officer understands these finance issues a lot better \nthan I, but I can understand a little bit about low-income working \nAmericans. They are at a point with the earned-income tax credit where \nthe Federal Government gives them a tax credit. It is $31 billion a \nyear. It amounts to, for an average family with one child, a $2,000-\nper-year tax credit. They can get it when they work or on their tax \nrefund a year after they work. Since the earned-income tax credit was \ndesigned to encourage work, there has been a strong feeling it ought to \ngo on the wage that they earn.\n  What has happened, however, is that we have never accomplished that. \nOnly 5 percent of the workers take advantage of the opportunity to get \ntheir earned-income tax credit on their paycheck. If it were given to \nthem 100 percent, that would be a $1-an-hour pay raise with no \ndeductions from it. But we have never been able to figure out how to do \nit.\n  They finally passed, a day or so ago, an amendment that would allow \nthat to happen, but only 5 percent take advantage of it; 95 percent get \ntheir credit the next year.\n  So it is good public policy, in my view, that they get their credit \nearly. I believe in this time of stimulus, if we would make a \nconversion and pump in $15 billion or $20 billion extra on low-income \npeople's paychecks, many of whom may be out of work for a while, get \nanother job, lose work and find another job, they would have more money \nto take care of their families with and it would not cost the budget of \nthe country, the Treasury of the country, any money in the long run. It \nwould shift about $15 billion or more into this fiscal year but that \nmoney would be from the next fiscal year, and we would have $15 billion \nleft to spend next year. It is good public policy and a superb stimulus \nthat moves money forward and saves money next year.\n  We would have put in another item. We proposed reducing the median \nincome tax rate from 27 percent to 25 percent. It was planned to be \ndone anyway.\n  We extended the unemployment benefits, as most of the proposals have, \nfor an additional 13 weeks. We provided insurance and health benefits. \nWe provided a $5 billion fund for national emergency grants for States \nto help people who have been displaced or lost their job. And we \nadvanced the plans for 1 year for the child tax credit. This child tax \ncredit is a plan that would infuse about $6 billion or $8 billion into \nthe economy for families with children.\n  Those were some of the provisions we put in that plan. It could have \npassed. I don't believe anybody would have been upset about it. It had \nno business provisions in it that would upset anybody. It did have some \ndepreciation advancement.\n  I say we ought to have done something. That bill, other bills, the \nbill that almost reached conclusion, the bipartisan approach that \npassed the House last night, was sent over here, and we did not get a \nvote. So I am very disappointed.\n  I believe the leadership of this Senate made a mistake. We were not \neven allowed to vote on it or debate it. Everybody said we needed a \nstimulus package, but we never even got to bring the bill up for a \nvote. We had a number of Democratic Senators and certainly a large \nnumber of Democratic House Members who supported this bipartisan bill, \nand we could have passed it, but we did not and it is a great \ndisappointment to me.\n\n  I was pleased the Senator from Alaska discussed the energy bill that \ndid not pass this time, under the very same factors. I was in Mobile \nMonday of this week. On two different occasions a real estate person \nand a very fine doctor came to me and said: Jeff, I think you have to \ndo something about the energy situation. We are too dependent on Middle \nEastern oil. They have the ability to disrupt our economy and to affect \nour foreign policy and damage us in ways that we ought to defend \nagainst. You need to do something to reduce our dependence on middle \neastern oil. That is something I believe in very strongly.\n  The bill the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, has so eloquently \nargued for has conservation, reduced use of energy, as well as \nincreased production. Both of those steps together will help reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil. It will help reduce the amount of American \nwealth that goes out of our country to purchase this substance that it \nwould be better if we could purchase at home and keep that wealth at \nhome.\n  I believe we have had a number of opportunities to do better. I \nwanted a farm bill passed desperately. The President has made clear \nthat we do not have a fight over money on the farm bill. We are \nprepared to honor the $75 billion set-aside in our budget over 10 years \nfor farm programs. But there are some problems and serious \ndisagreements about some of the policy that was in that bill.\n  We could not get debate on it. Every amendment was rejected virtually \non a party line vote, so we ended up not passing an Agriculture bill. \nWe will have to come back and work on that because we need an \nAgriculture bill. We do not need to go into the summer without an \nAgriculture bill. So I am sure we will be back on that early next year. \nBut it could have been done this time.\n  So I will just say there were some great things accomplished this \nyear: the education bill, a bipartisan effort that passed. The tax \nreduction was a historic empowerment of individual working Americans, a \nvictory for the individual against the State and the power the State \nhas to extract what they earn from them and spend as the State wishes. \nBut it would empower them to utilize the wealth they have earned in the \nway they choose. If we had not done that, I am confident our economy \nwould be struggling even more today.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from West Virginia is ready to speak, \nand I am interested in hearing his remarks. I thank the Chair. I thank \nthe Senator from West Virginia for his time. I wanted to express these \nremarks before we recessed today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That\n\n[[Page S14046]]\n\nmeans he is paying attention to what is going on in the Senate. He is \nnot at the desk reading a magazine or a piece of paper, a newspaper. He \nis alert. I watched him.

They are watching the \nChair.\n  I have been a member of the State legislature in West Virginia and \nthe West Virginia House of Delegates. Those people in the State \nlegislatures watch the Presiding Officer of this body.\n  This is the premier upper house in the world. They should see the \npremier act of presiding on the part of the Senator who sits at that \ndesk. Teachers, college professors, students, political column writers, \nand editorialists watch.

Mr. President, as we head toward Christmas and the close of \nthis session of Congress and this turbulent and tragic first year of \nthe new millennium, I want to pause to remember a young woman who \npassed away this summer. Gloria Margaret Gillespie was a friend of \nmine.\n  Many Members of the Senate and staff will remember Gloria, for she \nworked in the Senate hair salon for 29 years. She cut my hair. Probably \nfor the first time that my hair was ever cut at that salon she cut--28 \nyears or 29 years ago. She worked there for 29 years.\n  She loved her work, and she loved her friends and she loved life. \nGloria had a cheerful, loyal, uplifting spirit. And her time on this \nEarth was far, far too brief. She was only 54 years of age when she \npassed away in Berea, KY, this past July--54.\n  Five years ago, Gloria began a battle with cancer. She had smoking-\nrelated lung cancer. But instead of withdrawing, she used her illness \nas a forum to warn others about the dangers of smoking.\n  Gloria did not win her battle with cancer, but to the end, even in \nthe face of great pain, she remained a fighter and a friend to all--\nsomeone who loved the Senate and someone who loved life.\n  Gloria Gillespie knew that each day is a gift. Each day is a gift. \nShe cherished each waking moment. She found great joy in seeing people \nalive. From childhood, Gloria possessed a deep and abiding faith in \nGod. That strong faith made her courageous and deeply appreciative of \nthe sheer wonder of the world that God created.\n  Her unfailing optimism was contagious, as was her impish laughter. \nShe brought a special kind of joy to all of her endeavors. She made the \nload a little lighter for all who knew her.\n  Gloria is survived by her parents, C.H. and Mary Frances Gillespie of \nBerea, KY, one niece, Lisa Gillespie, and one nephew, David Gillespie.\n  Along with all the members of her family and her legions of friends, \nI shall miss Gloria. But I shall think of her during this Christmas \nseason, and I shall never, never, never forget her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S14046-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MARIAN BERTRAM\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to remember a longtime Senate \nemployee who passed away on October 15 of this year. Marian Bertram \ndedicated 27 years of her life to public service and to the United \nStates Senate. She began her work at the Democratic Policy Committee in \n1971, eventually serving as the chief clerk of that committee. She \nretired from the Senate in October of 1998.\n  Marian Bertram served four Democratic Leaders, beginning with Mike \nMansfield and continuing on through my own tenure as Democratic Leader, \nGeorge Mitchell's, and Senator Daschle's leader terms.\n  She gained a deep understanding of the Senate's intricacies during \nthose years and researched and wrote the Democratic Policy Committee's \nLegislative Bulletin. She also shouldered the challenging task of \nproducing voting records and vote analyses for Democratic Members.\n  Marian was an able and very dedicated Senate employee and through it \nall she was unfailing good humored and professional.\n  My sympathy goes out to her many friends in the Washington area who \nwere shocked and saddened by her untimely death this fall.

They work \nhere at a sacrifice. We are paid well, but there are many here who \ncould earn much more money in other fields. There are many who come \nhere after earning much more money in other fields but who want to give \nsomething to the Nation, who want to serve. Here is the place--in this \nChamber--where Senators, since 1859, have served the Nation.\n  So I salute all Senators. I salute the leaders of the Senate--our \nDemocratic and Republican leaders of the majority and the minority.\n  I have been a majority leader. I have been a minority leader. I have \nbeen a majority whip. I know the kinds of problems with which they are \nconfronted every day. I know the demands that are made upon them by \ntheir colleagues. I know of the expectations that surround this Chamber \nand the expectations of our leaders. They spend a lot of time \nprotecting our interests and working on behalf of our interests. They \nspend many hours here when the rest of us are probably sleeping. They \ncarry to their beds problems that we don't know about. Many demands are \nmade on these leaders.\n  I sit here and I hear criticism of our majority leader. He is the \nmajority leader and was chosen by his colleagues for this job. He sets \nthe schedule. He decides the program.\n  So not only do I salute him for the great work that he does on behalf \nof the Nation every day, but I also have empathy with him. I know he \nmust go home troubled at night--troubled because he could not fulfill \nthe expectations of this Senator, or that Senator, troubled because he \nis sometimes unjustly criticized. I had all of these things happen to \nme.\n  So I thank Tom Daschle. He can't be everything to everybody. He has \nto do what he has to do. He has to do what he thinks is best. He has to \npromote the interests of the Senate. He has to promote the interests of \ngetting on with the work.\n  So does our majority whip. These are two fine Senators. There isn't a \nSenator here who doesn't think that he could do that job right there \nbetter--that majority leader's job. Every Senator thinks he can do it \nbetter. Every Senator thinks he can do the whip's job better. But they \ndo the best they can.\n  I want to pray for them in this season that we are entering. I want \nthem to know that we Senators, upon reflection, cannot help but thank \nthem for the work they do.\n  Somebody has to do this so we can leave the Senate when our speeches \nare made and go home. But they have to stay.\n  Senator Reid, the whip, stays around here. He stays around the \nChamber. He renders a tremendous service to his country.\n  I want to take this moment to thank him, to thank Tom Daschle, to \nthank the Republican leader, to thank the Republican whip, to thank the \nSenators--the ladies and the gentlemen--who preside, all of the members \nof the staffs in the cloakrooms and in the hallways, in the corridors, \nand those who provide the security of this Chamber, and the people who \nwork in it. I thank them all.\n\n[[Page S14047]]\n\n  Somebody appreciates you. You may not realize it, but somebody is \nwatching you. Somebody appreciates what you are doing. The people at \nthe desk up there, somebody appreciates you.\n  So I just want to express that appreciation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S14047-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE REAL STORY OF CHRISTMAS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Now, Mr. President, we are just a few days from Christmas, \na few days from the morning when millions of children tumble out of \ntheir warm beds, awaken their parents, rush to the family room, and \nlook, with gleeful delight, at the bows, the boxes, and the bundles \nunder the tree.\n  This is one of my favorite times of the year--a time of joy, a time \nof love, a time of family gatherings and warm memories.\n  I remember the Christmas presents waiting for me when I was a boy \nback there during the Great Depression in the hard hills of Mercer \nCounty in southern West Virginia. There was not an electric light in \nthe house--no electricity, no running water, but there was an orange or \na drawing book or a set of pencils or a set of water colors, or a \ngeography book that I had been wanting.\n  My family did not have great material wealth, but we always had a \nwealth of love. The two old people who raised me, they are in Heaven \ntonight. They are in Heaven. We did not have fancy toys in those days. \nWe celebrated the season for its true meaning: the birth of the Christ \nChild.\n  Now, I respect every man's or woman's religion. I respect their \nreligion. If it is Moslem, I respect their religion. I can listen to \nthe prayers of any churchman or any layman. I can respect them all \nbecause who am I? I am unworthy of God's blessings. I can respect them.\n  So my wife Erma and I have passed those lessons on to our children, \nour grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren.\n  In recent years, however, that meaning has been drowned out by a \nsociety that is focused more on the perfect gift or the latest gadget \nor the hottest-selling toy. Our attention is on store sales and Santa \nClaus rather than on the true meaning of Christmas.\n  Now, I am a Christian. I believe in Christ. I am not very worthy, but \nI believe in Him. I respect anyone who does not. I respect anyone who \nbelieves that He was, that He lived, He was a historic figure, He was a \nprophet. They may not believe He is the Messiah--I do--but it does not \nlesson my respect for others.\n  I will listen to them at any time. But I think all of us have to \nagree that this was a great event that happened that split the \ncenturies in two, and the years that were before Christ are numbered, \nthe years that are after Christ numbered differently. This was some, \nsome happening. No matter what we believe or do not believe, it is \nstill recognized by all that there was a man named Jesus Christ.\n  And so no matter what our religion, I think we ought to understand \nthis was more than just an ordinary happening, more than just an \nordinary man.\n  At its core, the season has not changed. Christmas will always be, to \nme, about a family that found no shelter but a manger, and also about a \nnewborn child who would become, in my viewpoint, the Saviour of the \nworld.\n\n  As Luke wrote in his Gospel:\n\n       And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I \n     bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all \n     people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a \n     Savior, which is Christ the Lord.\n\n  Good tidings. Great joy. How many people think of those words \nstanding in the long lines of their local shopping malls?\n  I worry that too many of us, in the hectic pace of the modern world, \nhave forgotten the true spirit of Christmas, have forgotten what this \nis really all about. They have forgotten the true meaning. The story of \nthe birth of Christ has been overshadowed by the pressures and the \nstrains of a commercialized holiday.\n  Families will spend hours at shopping malls, waiting in long lines, \nrather than in the company of loved ones or in a church or in a place \nof worship celebrating in song or prayer. They will become obsessed \nwith purchases and the gifts they may receive. Children will \nmeticulously craft the perfect list of toys and will worry that grandma \nwill again, this Christmas, buy them another sweater that they will \nnever wear. Sadly, the Christmas season has become the shopping season. \nA time for joy and spiritual reflection has drowned in the shallow \nwaters of greed.\n  That does not need to be. We can return to the true meaning of \nChristmas. During this holiday, I urge all Americans to reflect on \ntheir families and their faith--whatever their faith--and to read the \nstory of Jesus' birth in the Gospels. Look up into the night sky and \npick the Star of Wonder that led the wise men to Bethlehem to offer \ngifts to the Christ Child. Join with family and friends to sing a \nChristmas carol, share a meal, and reflect on the blessings we have \nbeen given. Visit each other, one another's church or synagogue or \nwhatever. Go join and visit and enjoy this season. Perhaps the \nmaterialism that has come to dominate the season will fade and we can \nbegin to truly understand the great and glorious story of Christmas.\n  And so, Mr. President:\n     'Twas battered and scarred, and the auctioneer\n     Thought it scarcely worth his while\n     To waste much time on the old violin,\n     But held it up with a smile:\n     ``What am I bidden, good folks,'' he cried,\n     ``Who'll start the bidding for me?''\n     ``A dollar, a dollar''; then, ``Two!'' ``Only two?\n     Two dollars, and who'll make it three?\n     Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice;\n     Going for three--'' But no,\n     From the room, far back, a gray-haired man\n     Came forward and picked up the bow;\n     Then, wiping the dust from the old violin,\n     And tightening the loose strings,\n     He played a melody pure and sweet\n     As a caroling angel sings.\n     The music ceased, and the auctioneer,\n     With a voice that was quiet and low,\n     Said, ``What am I bid for the old violin?''\n     And he held it up with the bow.\n     ``A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two?\n     Two thousand! and who'll make it three?\n     Three thousand, once, three thousand, twice,\n     And going, and gone,'' said he.\n     The people cheered, but some of them cried,\n     ``We do not quite understand\n     What changed its worth.'' Swift came the reply:\n     ``The touch of a master's hand.''\n     And many a man with life out of tune,\n     And battered and scarred with sin,\n     Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd,\n     Much like the old violin.\n     A ``mess of pottage,'' a glass of wine;\n     A game--and he travels on.\n     He is ``going'' once, and ``going'' twice,\n     He's ``going'' and almost ``gone.''\n     But the Master comes, and the foolish crowd\n     Never can quite understand\n     The worth of a soul and the change that's wrought\n     By the touch of the Master's hand.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to express my \nstrong support for the confirmation of Michael Hammond to be Chairman \nof the National Endowment for the Arts, and I urge the Senate to \nconfirm him.\n  Mr. Hammond is a distinguished composer, conductor, arts educator and \nscientist. His is the Dean of the Shepherd School of Music at Rice \nUniversity, where he is also a professor of music and a faculty fellow \nin neuroscience.\n  Mr. Hammond is an excellent choice to lead the Arts Endowment. He is \nalso one of the nation's leaders in the field of cognitive development \nand he understands the vast potential of the arts in early childhood \neducation. I welcome his leadership, and I believe that he will be an \noutstanding chairman for this very important agency.\n  During the consideration of his nomination by the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions, I submitted a number of \nquestions to Mr. Hammond. His responses are impressive and I ask \nunanimous consent that they may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Questions by Senator Edward Kennedy for Michael Hammond, Nominee for \n            Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts\n\n       1. Do you support the mission of the National Endowment for \n     the Arts and believe that there is a federal role in support \n     of the arts?\n       Yes. The Arts Endowment's mandate is to provide national \n     recognition and support to significant projects of artistic \n     excellence, thus preserving and enhancing our nation's \n     diverse cultural heritage. This is a noble and essential \n     national goal and I embrace it completely. I believe there \n     are important aspects of this task that can best be performed \n     at the federal level. If I have the opportunity to serve as \n     chairman, I will work to advance the Endowment's mandate in \n     every conceivable way.\n       2. Are there any circumstances under which you would \n     support the elimination of the agency?\n       No.\n       3. Due to budget cuts and the impact of inflation, the \n     NEA's spending power has been dramatically reduced. The \n     decline in funding has also reduced the agency's reach and \n     impact. How do you view the current funding? Will you \n     advocate for higher spending levels for the agency?\n       Although the Endowment's financial resources are limited, \n     it has a national voice that I believe should articulate \n     clearly and strongly the importance of the arts in enriching \n     the lives and shaping the aesthetic taste of all Americans. \n     It is now more important than ever that the Endowment make \n     performances and presentations of the highest artistic \n     quality accessible to our urban, rural and suburban \n     communities.\n       The Endowment's financial capability is important both for \n     the direct project grants it makes and for the matching money \n     grants generated from other sources. I would advocate for \n     spending levels that are more adequate in fulfilling the full \n     gamut of the Endowment's goals. Should I have the honor to be \n     the chairman, I would look for ways to stimulate more public \n     and private support for the arts and arts education.\n       4. How do you think the Endowment should best balance its \n     various programs which support the creation and presentation \n     of the arts with providing broad access to the arts?\n       Each of these tasks is crucial and the balance between \n     them, though difficult, must be reconsidered regularly. A \n     full review of the Endowment's activities in both these areas \n     (creation/presentation and broad access) would be a high \n     priority for me. Further, I would pursue these goals \n     nationwide in rural, urban and suburban communities, in close \n     cooperation with state and local arts groups and educational \n     organizations committed to the arts.\n       5. What do you think are the highest programming priorities \n     for the agency?\n       In the days following September 11, in ceremony after \n     ceremony, Americans turned to the arts, especially music and \n     poetry, for expressions of our anguish over our human losses \n     and for confirmation of our common commitments as Americans. \n     It is essential that the Arts Endowment help provide \n     opportunities for our citizens to experience works whose \n     meaning transcends the momentary and speak to us as human \n     beings, sharing one another's mortality and longing for \n     beauty and understanding.\n       At the same time the Endowment must, I believe, work to \n     create conditions favorable to our professional artists--\n     conditions in which they will be inspired to fulfill their \n     deepest artistic aspirations, encouraging all of us to \n     understand ourselves and one another in continuously new \n     ways. If I am given the opportunity to serve, I will also try \n     to direct the Endowment's efforts toward enlivening the \n     artistic culture of the nation from the ground up by \n     strengthening all forms of educational activity in the arts, \n     especially among the young. If there is to be a further \n     flowering of our artistic culture in the coming years, it \n     must begin by making the best achievements of our rich \n     heritage a reality in the lives of our young people.\n       6. You have had an extremely accomplished career in music \n     and music education. Do you have any thoughts about ways that \n     the agency can develop or initiate programs for young \n     children and the arts?\n       To ensure the artistic future of our country, I believe, \n     today's children and those of generations to come must have \n     the opportunity to learn by actual experience, the techniques \n     of music-making, the skills of drawing, painting and \n     sculpting, dance movement, poetry and other forms of \n     writing, and the art of acting and play-making. Such \n     experiences together with regular access to the finest art \n     can stimulate a child's imagination, engage the intellect, \n     create discipline, produce physical skill and enhance \n     curiosity and joy. Few may become professional artists, \n     but many will become grateful audiences for the arts. A \n     richer artistic culture can be brought into being with \n     consistent effort over time in this way.\n       Should I have the honor of serving as the chairman of the \n     National Endowment for the Arts, I will explore how the \n     agency can provide national leadership in promoting such \n     hands-on educational programs in the arts for children from \n     preschool through high school. The country has vast \n     educational resources both public and private for this \n     undertaking. These need to be surveyed, documented and \n     enhanced.\n       It is my understanding that grants for arts education are \n     now funded under two new Arts Endowment funding programs--\n     Challenge America and Arts Learning. The state arts agencies \n     also contribute very significantly to educational efforts in \n     the arts, as do a number of private organizations and \n     programs. The Endowment can advocate and promote models for \n     cooperation among these groups and incentives for imaginative \n     action.\n       From my own studies in neuroscience, I know there is a \n     growing body of information concerning cognitive development \n     among preschoolers showing their ability to discriminate \n     clearly among musical sounds, visual colors, movements and \n     language elements in a way that mandates programs of learning \n     in the arts at very early ages. I would actively pursue this \n     agenda and attempt to work closely with that growing body of \n     scientists and educators throughout the world who are \n     concerned with such early cognitive development.\n       7. How do you think the agency can best support K-12 \n     education programs?\n       First, there must be an accurate assessment of the programs \n     and institutions, both public and private, which are \n     addressing the matter of arts education for school-age young \n     people in each region of the country. Working with these \n     groups and with the state and regional arts agencies, the \n     Endowment can help to set goals for instruction and \n     experience at each stage of a student's life, in each of the \n     arts. The Endowment can encourage cooperative efforts \n     among arts groups to get the job done. It is a challenging \n     task that will require all our available institutional \n     resources as well as a new level of aspiration from all \n     quarters, including parents, schools, museums, community \n     centers, performing arts organizations, church groups, \n     Boys and Girls Clubs and many others. Much valuable work \n     is already being done in many parts of the country. These \n     efforts can serve as models for others.\n       I believe the Endowment can lead in certain aspects by \n     initiating conversations, encouraging fine teaching, \n     generating funding from corporations, foundations, private \n     benefactors and arts support groups. It can assist and \n     strengthen organizations that have valuable ideas but need \n     assistance in initiating them. It can connect outstanding \n     young artists to this effort, both as teachers and \n     practitioners. Finally, through its general grants programs, \n     the Endowment can increase access to outstanding performances \n     and exhibitions so that at every stage of a young person's \n     development, the arts at their best are regularly \n     experienced.\n       8. How do you feel that the federal role of the Arts \n     Endowment differs from the role of the state entities and \n     local agencies? Do you feel that these roles complement each \n     other well? Are there any changes that you would suggest for \n     either the federal role, or the way the Endowment supports \n     state and local initiatives?\n       If the opportunity to serve as chairman of the Arts \n     Endowment comes to me, I will make it a high priority to \n     become very familiar with our state and local arts agencies,\n\n[[Page S14049]]\n\n     their leaders and the important work they do. I will explore \n     with them ways in which their partnership with the Endowment \n     can be strengthened and broadened. They have played a vital \n     role in carrying out Challenge America and other important \n     Endowment programs. Many of them have been extremely \n     successful in promoting the arts in their own locales. I see \n     them as already valuable allies for the Endowment, and I \n     would hope that these alliances can be made even more \n     productive for our citizens everywhere.\n       9. Do you believe that the Arts Endowment should actively \n     pursue private funds to supplement its federal appropriation?\n       I understand that legislation gives the Endowment authority \n     to accept private gifts and donations. I also understand that \n     there is concern in the arts community that major fundraising \n     activities by the Arts Endowment could compete with, and \n     therefore, conceivably diminish the ability of arts \n     organizations to raise the funding necessary for their \n     survival. In the current economic climate, and following \n     September 11, the issue of financial support for arts groups \n     everywhere is especially serious. If I am confirmed, I would \n     approach this matter carefully and in a collegial spirit.\n       10. Will you continue the agency's efforts to build \n     partnerships and funding coalitions with other federal \n     agencies?\n       I support efforts to form coalitions and partnerships with \n     other federal agencies whenever these can enhance access for \n     Americans nationwide to projects of artistic quality. \n     Accordingly, I would examine the current inter-agency \n     agreements that the Endowment has entered into over the years \n     to see how these and other such cooperative efforts can help \n     to preserve our national artistic heritage and increase the \n     value of that heritage to our citizens, especially those who \n     may be otherwise underserved.\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 92) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 92\n\n       Whereas on May 1, 1951, Radio Free Europe inaugurated its \n     full schedule of broadcast services to the people of Eastern \n     Europe and, subsequently, Radio Liberty initiated its \n     broadcast services to the peoples of the Soviet Union on \n     March 1, 1953, just before the death of Stalin;\n       Whereas now fifty years later, Radio Free Europe/Radio \n     Liberty (in this concurrent resolution referred to as ``RFE/\n     RL'') continues to promote democracy and human rights and \n     serve United States national interests by fulfilling its \n     mission ``to promote democratic values and institutions by \n     disseminating factual information and ideas'';\n       Whereas Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty were \n     established in the darkest days of the cold war as a \n     substitute for the free media which no longer existed in the \n     communist-dominated countries of Central and Eastern Europe \n     and the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty developed a \n     unique form of international broadcasting known as surrogate \n     broadcasting by airing local news about the countries to \n     which they broadcast as well as providing regional and \n     international news, thus preventing the communist governments \n     from establishing a monopoly on the dissemination of \n     information and providing an alternative to the state-\n     controlled, party dominated domestic media;\n       Whereas the broadcast of uncensored news and information by \n     Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty was a critical element \n     contributing to the collapse of the totalitarian communist \n     governments of Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet \n     Union;\n       Whereas since the fall of the Iron Curtain, RFE/RL has \n     continued to inform and therefore strengthen democratic \n     forces in Central Europe and the countries of the former \n     Soviet Union, and has contributed to the development of a new \n     generation of political and economic leaders who have worked \n     to strengthen civil society, free market economies, and \n     democratic government institutions;\n       Whereas United States Government funding established and \n     continues to support international broadcasting, including \n     RFE/RL, and this funding is among the most useful and \n     effective in promoting and enhancing the Nation's national \n     security over the past half century;\n       Whereas RFE/RL has successfully downsized in response to \n     legislative mandate and adapted its programming to the \n     changing international broadcast environment in order to \n     serve a broad spectrum of target audiences--people living in \n     fledgling democracies where private media are still weak and \n     do not enjoy full editorial independence, transitional \n     societies where democratic institutions and practices are \n     poorly developed, as well as countries which still have \n     tightly controlled state media;\n       Whereas RFE/RL continues to provide objective news, \n     analysis, and discussion of domestic and regional issues \n     crucial to democratic and free-market transformations in \n     emerging democracies as well as strengthening civil society \n     in these areas;\n       Whereas RFE/RL broadcasts seek to combat ethnic, racial, \n     and religious intolerance and promote mutual understanding \n     among peoples;\n       Whereas RFE/RL provides a model for local media, assists in \n     training to encourage media professionalism and independence, \n     and develops partnerships with local media outlets in \n     emerging democracies;\n       Whereas RFE/RL is a unique broadcasting institution long \n     regarded by its audience as an alternative national media \n     that provides both credibility and security for local \n     journalists who work as its stringers and editors in the \n     broadcast region; and\n       Whereas RFE/RL fosters closer relations between the United \n     States and other democratic states, and the states of Central \n     Europe and the former Soviet republics: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) congratulates the editors, journalists, and managers of \n     Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on a half century of effort \n     in promoting democratic values, and particularly their \n     contribution to promoting freedom of the press and freedom of \n     expression in areas of the world where such liberties have \n     been denied or are not yet fully institutionalized; and\n       (2) recognizes the major contribution of Radio Free Europe/\n     Radio Liberty to the growth of democracy throughout the world \n     and its continuing efforts to advance the vital national \n     interests of the United States in building a world community \n     that is more peaceful, democratic, free, and stable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S14052-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REFERRING S. 846 TO CHIEF JUDGE OF U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS\n\n  Mr. REID.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 276, S. 1803.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1803) to authorize appropriations under the Arms \n     Export Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for \n     security assistance for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2695\n\n    (Purpose: To make managers' amendments to the text of the bill)\n\n  Mr. REID. I understand Senators Biden and Helms have an amendment at \nthe desk, and I ask unanimous consent it be considered.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to urge Senate adoption \nof S. 1803, the Security Assistance Act of 2001. This is legislation \nthat the Foreign Relations Committee reports out each year, either \nfree-standing or as a title in our State Department authorization bill.\n  But the substance of the Security Assistance Act is anything but \nroutine. It includes: foreign military assistance, including Foreign \nMilitary Financing, FMF, and International Military Education and \nTraining, IMET; international arms transfers; and many of our arms \ncontrol, nonproliferation and anti-terrorism programs.\n  The Security Assistance Act of 2001 covers those programs and \nincludes not only routine adjustments, but also some significant \ninitiatives. For example, a 5-year National Security Assistance \nStrategy is mandated, so as to provide country-by-country foreign \npolicy guidance to a function that may tend otherwise to operate on the \nbasis more of military or bureaucratic concerns.\n  Several provisions are designed to streamline the arms export control \nsystem, so as to make it more efficient and responsive to competitive \nrequirements in a global economy, without sacrificing controls that \nserve foreign policy or nonproliferation purposes. This is a vital \nenterprise. U.S. industry depends upon the efficient processing of arms \nexport applications, and U.S. firms lose contracts when the U.S. \nGovernment cannot make up its mind expeditiously.\n  At the same time, however, an ill-advised export license could lead \nto sensitive equipment getting into the hands of enemies or of unstable \nregimes. So there is a tension between the need for efficiency and the \nneed not to make the mistake that ends up putting U.S. lives at risk. \nThis bill addresses that tension by providing funds for improved \nstaffing levels, information and communications to enable the State \nDepartment to make quicker and smarter export licensing decisions.\n  The Security Assistance Act of 2001 includes several new \nnonproliferation and antiterrorism measures. For example, the ban on \narms sales to state supporters of terrorism, in section 40(d) of the \nArms Export Control Act, is broadened to include states engaging in the \nproliferation of chemical, biological or radiological weapons.\n  Subtitle III-C of this bill establishes an interagency committee to \ncoordinate nonproliferation programs directed at the independent states \nof the former Soviet Union. This provision is based on S. 673, a bill \nintroduced by Senator Hagel and me with the co-sponsorship of Senators \nDomenici and Lugar. It will ensure continuing, high-level coordination \nof our many nonproliferation programs, so that we can be more confident \nthat they will mesh with each other. The need for better coordination \nwas cited in the report, earlier this year, of the Russia Task Force \nchaired by former Senator Howard Baker and former White House counsel \nLloyd Cutler.\n  Section 308 of this bill encourages the Secretary of State to seek an \nincrease in the regular budget of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency, beyond that required to keep pace with inflation, and funds are \nauthorized for the U.S. share of such an enlarged budget. This \norganization is vital to our nuclear nonproliferation efforts, and its \nworkload is increasing. The lack of a sufficient assessed budget has \nimpaired its ability to hire and retain top-flight scientists, however, \nso the Committee believes that an increase in that budget is essential.\n  Subtitle III-B of this bill authorizes the President to offer Soviet-\nera debt reduction to the Russian Federation in the context of an \narrangement whereby a significant proportion of the savings to Russia \nwould be invested in agreed nonproliferation programs or projects. Debt \nreduction is a potentially important means of funding the costs of \nsecuring Russia's stockpiles of sensitive nuclear material, chemical \nweapons and dangerous pathogens, of destroying its chemical weapons and \ndismantling strategic weapons, and of helping its former weapons \nexperts to find civilian careers and resist offers from rogue states or \nterrorists. The Administration is reportedly considering this funding \noption, and this bill gives the President authority to pursue it.\n\n  A few changes were made in a managers' amendment to this bill, which \nI would like to summarize for the record.\n  The managers' amendment adds, at the request of Senator Feinstein of \nCalifornia, a new section 206 on congressional notification of small \narms and light weapons export license approvals. This section makes \nlicense approvals for commercial sales of such weapons, with a value \nover $1,000,000, subject to the prior notice provisions of section \n36(c) of the Arms Export Control Act. It also requires annual reports \non end-use monitoring of such arms transfers, the yearly value of such \ntransfers, the activities of registered arms brokers, and efforts of \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to stop U.S. weapons from \nbeing used in terrorist acts and international crime.\n  I want to commend Senator Feinstein for raising this issue, which is \ncentral to our efforts to stem wars and civil bloodshed in Africa and \nother regions. The United States leads the way on this issue, but we \nmust do more. Senator Feinstein's proposals for U.S. policy and \ninternational negotiations in this field are contained in S. 1555, \nwhich has been referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. I will \nwork with her and with my House and Senate colleagues in the coming \nweeks and months to see whether we can agree on further steps on small \narms and light weapons exports. Personally, I think we can do so.\n  The managers' amendment deletes subsection 221(c), and I am sorry \nthat we had to do this. This subsection would have returned to Israel \ncertain funds that Israel was forced to give back to the United States \ndue to a general rescission last year. This provision was first \nproposed by Republican staff to the Foreign Relations Committee, when \nthe Republicans were in the majority, but it was one that I heartily \nsupported. The $4,000,000 at stake may be a small amount of money, but \neach dollar we provide to Israel is given because it serves our \nnational security interests.\n  Unfortunately, the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nForeign Operations and the chairman of the full Appropriations \nCommittee objected strongly to this provision, not the least because it \nwas scored by the Congressional Budget Office as an appropriation. I \nintend to press this issue in the coming year, and I hope that my good \nfriends from Vermont and West Virginia will work with me to provide \nthese funds. If we are ever to have a lasting peace in the Middle East, \nwe must do all we can to give Israel confidence that the United States \nwill continue to help assure that country's continued sovereignty and \nwell-being.\n  Section 242, on funds for humanitarian demining programs, is amended \nin two respects. First, we have deleted any number for the Fiscal Year \n2003 authorization for these programs. I welcome this change, because \nit comes with suggestions that the Foreign Operations Subcommittee may \nlook favorably on an increase in that figure. I will work with that \nsubcommittee on this matter, and I would hope that in\n\n[[Page S14061]]\n\nconference we could insert a higher figure for Fiscal Year 2003 than \nthe $40,000,000 that has been spent on humanitarian demining each of \nthe last several years.\n  The second change is to delete subsection (b) of section 242. The \nForeign Relations Committee, in its desire to increase funds for \nhumanitarian demining, had suggested that the Secretary of State be \nauthorized to provide up to $40,000,000 from development assistance \nfunds in addition to the $40,000,000 authorized in the State \nDepartment's Nonproliferation, Anti- \nterrorism, Demining and Related Programs account. The Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee informs us that this is not tenable, and I \naccept their point that this would have been robbing Peter to pay Paul. \nI think we have made our point, however, that more funds are needed for \nthis program, which has an important political impact in addition to \nproviding humanitarian benefits.\n  Another provision that is deleted in the managers' amendment is \nsection 302, (on an interagency program to prevent diversion of \nsensitive U.S. technology). This was an effort to authorize the \nSecretary of State to institute new joint programs with the Department \nof Commerce and the Commissioner of Customs to improve our export \ncontrol, as well as a program to use retired inspectors and \ninvestigators from the U.S. Customs Service and the Bureau of Export \nEnforcement in our diplomatic missions overseas. Another committee \nquestioned our jurisdiction in this matter, and we did not have time to \nwork out this matter today, so we are dropping the provision. The need \nremains, however, to make more use of the many talents of current and \nformer Commerce and Customs personnel. Especially in our overseas \nmissions, those people can make contracts with law enforcement and \nborder control officials in foreign countries that traditional \ndiplomats have a hard time achieving. So I hope that we can work \nsomething out on this issue in the weeks and months to come.\n  Another provision in the managers' amendment inserts into section \n404, on improvements to the Automated Export System new subsections to \nextend the range of exporters that must file their Shippers' Export \nDeclarations electronically and to increase the penalties for failure \nto file and for filing false information. An earlier version of these \nsubsections was deleted by the Committee at the request of Senator Enzi \nof Wyoming, who spotted some faulty language. The version added to the \nmanagers' amendment was worked out with Senator Enzi and with the \nDepartment of Commerce, and I am pleased to thank my friend from \nWyoming, who is a new member of the Foreign Relations Committee, but an \nexpert in export control, for his sage counsel on this provision.\n  Section 602 of this bill, on nonproliferation interests and free \ntrade agreements, is deleted by the managers' amendment. There were \nquestions from other committees as to whether this was within our \njurisdiction. I hope we can resolve those concerns, because the fact \nremains that other countries' nonproliferation and export control laws \nand actions are relevant to the question of whether we should engage in \nfree trade with those countries.\n  The managers' amendment inserts into section 701 authorizing certain \nship transfers, a subsection authorizing the transfer of four KIDD-\nclass guided missible destroyers to Taiwan. This provision was \naccidentially omitted from the bill at the Committee's business \nmeeting. In fact, these ship transfers, and the others in this bill, \nhave already been enacted in the defense authorization act. The Foreign \nRelations Committee is the committee of jurisdiction on this matter, so \nwe do that in this bill.\n  One issue that is not addressed in this bill, but that is of \nconsiderable interest to Senator Milkulski and others, is the need for \na Center for Antiterrorism and Security Training in the Department of \nState. We tried to get funding for this in Fiscal Year 2001, but the \nexecutive branch went to the wrong subcommittee of the Appropriations \nCommittee and this center fell between the cracks. Now, as our \nAntiterrorism Assistance Program increases its course offerings for \nsecurity personnel from friendly countries, the need for a training \ncenter is greater than ever. The Security Assistance Act may not be the \nbest vehicle in which to address this issue, but I want to assure my \ngood friend from Maryland that we work on this and that we will assure \nthe State Department of our support for a new center.\n  Even with the managers' amendments this is a good bill that will \ncontribute to our national security. I am happy to urge support of it \nand I am very pleased that my colleagues appear ready to approve it.\n  Mr. REID. I ask consent the amendment be agreed to, the bill be read \nthe third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2695) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted and Proposed.'')\n  The bill (S. 1803), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  [The bill will appear in a future edition of the Record.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/20/senate-section/article/S14061-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14061-S14062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER FACILITIES\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing the \nSmith-Leahy Federal Judiciary Protection Act, S. 1099.\n  In the last two Congresses, I joined as an original cosponsor of \nidentical legislation introduced by Senator Gordon Smith, which \nunanimously passed the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate but \nwas not acted upon by the House of Representatives. I commend the \nSenator from Oregon for his continued leadership in protecting public \nservants in our Federal government.\n  Our bipartisan legislation would provide greater protection to \nFederal judges, law enforcement officers, and United States officials \nand their families. Federal law enforcement officers, under our bill, \ninclude United States Capitol Police Officers. United States officials, \nunder our bill, include the President, Vice President, Cabinet \nSecretaries and Members of Congress.\n  Specifically, our legislation would: increase the maximum prison term \nfor forcible assaults, resistance, intimidation or interference with a \nFederal judge, law enforcement officer or United States official from 3 \nyears imprisonment to 8 years; increase the maximum prison term for use \nof a deadly weapon or infliction of bodily injury against a Federal \njudge, law enforcement officer or United States official from 10 years \nimprisonment to 20 years; and increase the maximum prison term for \nthreatening murder or kidnapping of a member of the immediate family of \na Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 5 years imprisonment to \n10 years.\n  Our bipartisan bill has the support of the Department of Justice, the \nUnited States Judicial Conference, the United States Sentencing \nCommission and the United States Marshal Service.\n  It is most troubling that the greatest democracy in the world needs \nthis legislation to protect the hard working men and women who serve in \nour Federal government. Just a few months ago, I was saddened to read \nabout death threats against my colleague from Vermont after his act of \nconscience in declaring himself an Independent.\n  Senator Jeffords received multiple threats against his life, which \nforced around-the-clock police protection. These unfortunate threats \nmade a difficult time even more difficult for Senator Jeffords and his \nfamily.\n  We are seeing more violence and threats of violence against officials \nof our Federal government. In July, we commemorated the lives of two \nCapitol Police officers, Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John \nGibson, who were slain in the line of duty in the Capitol Building in \n1998. A courtroom in Urbana, Illinois, was firebombed recently, \napparently by a disgruntled litigant. And we also continue to mourn the \nvictims of the horrible tragedy of the bombing of the federal office \nbuilding in Oklahoma City in 1995.\n  In my home state during the summer of 1997, a Vermont border patrol \nofficer, John Pfeiffer, was seriously wounded by Carl Drega, during a \nshootout with Vermont and New Hampshire law enforcement officers in \nwhich Drega lost his life. Earlier that day, Drega shot and killed two \nstate troopers and a local judge in New Hampshire. Apparently, Drega \nwas bent on settling a grudge against the judge who had ruled against \nhim in a land dispute. I had a chance to visit John Pfeiffer in the \nhospital and met his wife and young daughter. As a federal law \nenforcement officer, Agent Pfeiffer and his family will receive greater \nprotection under our bill.\n  After the tragic events of September 11, it is even more important \nthat we protect the dedicated women and men throughout the Federal \nJudiciary and Federal government in this country who do a tremendous \njob under difficult circumstances. They are examples of the hard-\nworking public servants that make up the federal government, who are \ntoo often maligned and unfairly disparaged.\n  It is unfortunate that it takes acts or threats of violence to put a \nhuman face on the Federal Judiciary, law enforcement officers and U.S. \nofficials, to remind everyone in our democracy that these are people \nwith children and parents and friends. They deserve our respect and our \nprotection.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read the third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the several requests \nare granted.\n  The bill (S. 1099) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1099\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to H.R. 2869, \njust received from the House, now at the desk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will state the title of the \nHouse bill.\n  The legislate clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2869) to provide certain relief for small \n     business from liability under the Comprehensive Environmental \n     Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, and to \n     amend such Act to promote the cleanup and reuse of \n     brownfields, to provide financial assistance for brownfields \n     revitalization, and to enhance State response programs.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of colleagues \nregarding H.R. 2869, I ask unanimous consent the following letter be \nprinted in the Record:\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              Environmental Protection Agency,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 20, 2001.\n\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     Subject: Davis Bacon Act Applicability Under Brownfields \n         Legislation.\n     From: Robert E. Fabricant, General Counsel.\n     To: Marianne Horinko, Assistant Administrator, Office of \n         Solid Waste and Emergency Response.\n       As you know, the House of Representatives has passed a \n     bill, H.R. 2869, which we are informed would amend CERCLA to \n     add a new section 104(k), ``Brownfields Revitalization \n     Funding.'' We have been asked whether CERCLA, if amended as \n     proposed in H.R. 2869, would require that the Davis-Bacon Act \n     apply to contracts under loans made from a Brownfields \n     Revolving Loan Fund (BRLF) entirely with non-federal funds. \n     We have concluded that H.R. 2869 does not change the legal \n     applicability of the Davis-Bacon Act to the Brownfields \n     program. We have also concluded that this bill neither \n     requires nor prohibits the application of the Davis-Bacon Act \n     to contracts under BRLF loans made entirely with non-grant \n     funds, e.g., principal and interest loan payments. CERCLA \n     would continue to require that the Davis-Bacon Act apply to \n     contracts under BRLF loans made in whole or in part with \n     federal grant funds. Finally, state cleanup programs that \n     operate independently and are not funded under this bill are \n     not affected by the bill, and will operate in accordance with \n     applicable state law.\n       The proposed legislation would add section 104(k) to \n     CERCLA. New sections 104(k)(3)(A) and (B) authorize the \n     President to make grants ``for capitalization of revolving \n     loan funds'' for ``the remediation of brownfield sites.'' \n     Under section 104(k)(9)(B)(iii), each recipient of a \n     capitalization grant must provide a non-federal matching \n     share of at least 20 percent (unless the Administrator makes \n     a hardship determination). Section 104(k)(12), ``Funding,'' \n     authorizes the appropriation of $200 million for each of \n     fiscal years 2002 through 2006 to carry out section 104(k).\n       Under the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. 276a et seq., most \n     public building or public works construction contracts \n     entered into by the United States must stipulate that the \n     wages paid to laborers and mechanics will be comparable to \n     the prevailing wages for similar work in the locality where \n     the contract is to be performed. The Davis-Bacon Act does not \n     apply by its own terms to contracts to which the United \n     States is not a party, including contracts awarded by \n     recipients of federal grants in performance of a grant \n     project.\n       The proposed legislation is silent regarding the \n     applicability of the Davis-Bacon Act to BRLFs. However, an \n     existing provision of CERCLA section 104(g), extends the \n     reach of the Davis-Bacon Act beyond direct federal \n     procurement. That section applies Davis-Bacon Act prevailing \n     wage rate requirements to contracts ``for construction, \n     repair or alteration work funded in whole or in part under \n     this section.'' Since the new BRLF provision would fall \n     within section 104, it would be subject to the Davis-Bacon \n     requirements of section 104(g). However, CERCLA does not \n     define the precise meaning or scope of the quoted from \n     section 104(g).\n\n[[Page S14064]]\n\n       If a statute does not address the precise question at \n     issue, an agency may adopt an interpretation that is \n     reasonable and consistent with the statute and legislative \n     history. Since CERCLA does not address the precise question \n     at issue here, EPA may adopt a reasonable interpretation, \n     which would be entitled to deference. Chevron, USA v. NRDC, \n     467 U.S. 837 (1984). If H.R. 2869 is enacted, one reasonable \n     interpretation of CERCLA, as amended, would be that contracts \n     under every loan made from a BRLF that received a \n     capitalization grant pursuant to section 104(k) would be \n     subject to Davis-Bacon. Under this interpretation, Davis-\n     Bacon would apply to loans made entirely from payments of \n     principal and interest. The phrase in section 104(g), \n     ``funded in whole or in part under this section'' could be \n     construed to encompass every contract indirectly supported by \n     federal grant funds. This arguably would include all \n     contracts awarded by a BRLF, which might not exist but for \n     the EPA capitalization grant(s).\n       However, it would be at least equally reasonable to \n     interpret CERCLA, as amended by H.R. 2869, to require that \n     only contracts under BRLF loans made with the federal grant \n     funds and the associated 20 percent matching funds are \n     subject to Davis-Bacon. The phrase ``funded in whole or in \n     part under this section'' may reasonably be construed to mean \n     ``receiving funds authorized under this section.'' The funds \n     authorized under section 104 for BRLFs are the $200 million \n     authorized under section 104(k)(12). The phrase would also \n     include the 20 percent matching funds because when a grant \n     statute requires a non-federal match every expenditure of \n     grant funds includes the federal and non-federal share.\n       Under H.R. 2869, as passed by the House, the Agency would \n     have the discretion to decide whether to apply Davis-Bacon to \n     contracts under BRLF loans that are made solely with funds \n     other than the federal grant and match amount. However, any \n     loan that includes both grant funds and loan payments would \n     be subject to Davis-Bacon, because it would be funded in part \n     with funds authorized under section 104(k). See 40 CFR \n     31.21(f).\n       If you have any questions about this matter, please contact \n     me or John Valeri of this office.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, we take a historic step toward \nbolstering economic development. The Small Business Liability Relief \nand Brownfields Revitalization Act, H.R. 2869, will protect our small \nbusinesses. This bill will revitalize once abandoned factory sites. \nThis bill will give new life to our aging industrial sites. This bill \nwill provide hope and prosperity to locations long ago forgotten.\n  Earlier this year, the U.S. Senate declared a mandate in the form of \na 99-0 vote endorsing the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \nRestoration Act, S. 350. Unanimously, the Senate pledged its commitment \nto the redevelopment of potentially contaminated industrial sites. As \nChairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I have \ntaken that mandate seriously. I am pleased that, today, the House \nfollowed suit.\n  The Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act \nauthorizes $250 million a year over the next five years for assessment \nand cleanup grants, including petroleum sites, and State program \nenhancement. The bill would provide liability relief for three groups: \ncontiguous property owners, prospective purchasers, and innocent \nlandowners. Lastly, the bill outlines the parameters by which EPA may \nre-enter a site to protect human health and the environment.\n  We also have fulfilled another mandate today. Earlier this year, the \nSmall Business Liability Protection Act passed the House of \nRepresentatives 419-0; today, the Senate followed suit. This \nlegislation is a victory for small businesses, on which the foundation \nof our nation's economy stands. The Small Business Liability Protection \nAct provides Superfund liability relief for small businesses and others \nwho disposed of, or arranged disposal of, small amounts of hazardous \nwaste. The legislation also allows expedited settlements for a lesser \namount if a business can show financial hardship.\n  There are many who share in this victory. It was truly a bipartisan \nand bicameral effort. In particular, I would like to recognize the \nefforts of Senators Smith, Chafee, Baucus and Boxer. I also thank all \nthe Leadership offices, on both sides and in both Chambers, for their \ndedication to the passage of H.R. 2869.\n  I am very proud of this legislation. I am pleased to have played an \nintegral role in these efforts to encourage development of our urban \ncores, reduce development demands in greenfields, and promote our \neconomic base by supporting our small businesses. This new year's \nresolution has been many years in the making. I am gratified that our \ncommunities will reap the rewards of further tools to redevelop \nbrownfields and sustain small businesses in 2002 and beyond.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be read the \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand any statements relating thereto be printed in the Record with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank Senator Hatch, the ranking Republican member \nof the Judiciary Committee, for his hard work and support of this \nlegislation.\n  The last time Congress properly authorized spending for the entire \nDepartment of Justice (``DOJ'' or the ``Department'') was in 1979. \nCongress extended that authorization in 1980 and 1981. Since then, \nCongress has not passed nor has the President signed an authorization \nbill for the Department. In fact, there are a number of years where \nCongress failed to consider any Department authorization bill. This 21-\nyear failure to properly reauthorize the Department has forced the \nappropriations committees in both houses to reauthorize and appropriate \nmoney.\n  We have ceded the authorization power to the appropriators for too \nlong. Our bipartisan legislation is an attempt to reaffirm the \nauthorizing authority and responsibility of the House and Senate \nJudiciary Committees. I commend Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking \nMember Conyers of the House Judiciary Committee for working in a \nbipartisan manner to pass similar legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization \nAct, is divided into two divisions: the first division is a \ncomprehensive authorization of the Department; and the second division \nis a comprehensive authorization of expired and new Department grants \nprograms and improvements to criminal law and procedures.\n  Division A of our bipartisan legislation contains four titles which \nauthorize appropriations for the Department for fiscal year 2002, \nprovide permanent enabling authorities which will allow the Department \nto efficiently carry out its mission, clarify and harmonize existing \nstatutory authority, and repeal obsolete statutory authorities. The \nbill establishes certain reporting requirements and other mechanisms, \nsuch as DOJ Inspector General authority to investigate allegations of \nmisconduct by employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), \nintended to better enable the Congress and the Department to oversee \nthe operations of the Department. Finally, the bill creates a separate \nViolence Against Women Office to combat domestic violence.\n  Title I authorizes appropriations for the major components of the \nDepartment for fiscal year 2002. The authorization mirrors the \nPresident's request regarding the Department except in two areas. \nFirst, the bill increased the President's request for the DOJ Inspector \nGeneral by $10 million. This is necessary because the Committee is \nconcerned about the severe downsizing of that office and the need for \noversight, particularly of the FBI, at the Department. Second, the bill \nauthorizes at least $10 million for the investigation and prosecution \nof intellectual property crimes, including software counterfeiting \ncrimes and crimes identified in the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act \n(Public Law 105-147). The American copyright industry is the largest \nexporter of goods from the United States, employing more than 7 million \nAmericans, and these additional funds are needed to strengthen the \nresources available to DOJ and the FBI to investigate and prosecute \ncyberpiracy.\n\n  Title II permanently establishes a clear set of authorities that the \nDepartment may rely on to use appropriated funds, including \nestablishing permitted uses of appropriated funds by the Attorney \nGeneral, the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the \nFederal Prison System, and the Detention Trustee. Title II also \nestablishes new reporting requirements which are intended to enhance \nCongressional oversight of the Department, including new reporting \nrequirements for information about the enforcement of existing laws, \nfor information regarding the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), and the \nsubmission of other reports, required by existing law, to the House and \nSenate Judiciary Committees. Section 206(e) expands an existing \nreporting requirement regarding copyright infringement cases.\n  Title II also provides the Department with additional law enforcement \ntools in the war against terrorism. For instance, section 201 permits \nthe FBI to enter into cooperative projects with foreign countries to \nimprove law enforcement or intelligence operations. Section 210 of the \ncommittee approved bill also provided for special ``danger pay'' \nallowances for FBI agents in hazardous duty locations outside the \nUnited States, as is provided for agents of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration. At the insistence of a Republican Senator, section 210 \nhave regrettably been removed from the bill to ensure final passage.\n  Title III repeals outdated and open-ended statutes, requires the \nsubmission of an annual authorization bill to the House and Senate \nJudiciary Committees, and provides states with flexibility to use \nexisting Truth-In-Sentencing and Violent Offender Incarceration Grants \nto account for juveniles being housed in adult prison facilities. Title \nIII requires the Department to submit to Congress studies on untested \nrape examination kits, and the allocation of funds, personnel, and \nworkloads for each office of U.S. Attorney and each division of the \nDepartment.\n  In addition, Title III provides new oversight and reporting \nrequirements for the FBI and other activities conducted by the Justice \nDepartment. Specifically, section 308 codifies the Attorney General's \norder of July 11, 2001, which revised Department of Justice's \nregulations concerning the Inspector General. The section insures that \nthe Inspector General for the Department of Justice has the authority \nto decide whether a particular allegation of misconduct by Department \nof Justice personnel, including employees of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation\n\n[[Page S14073]]\n\nand the Drug Enforcement Administration, should be investigated by the \nInspector General or by the internal affairs unit of the appropriate \ncomponent of the Department of Justice.\n  Section 309 directs the Inspector General of the Department to \nappoint an official from the Inspector General's office to be \nresponsible for supervising and coordinating independent oversight of \nprograms and operations of the FBI until the end of the 2003 fiscal \nyear. This section also requires the Inspector General of the \nDepartment to submit to Congress not later than 30 days after enactment \nof this Act an oversight plan for the FBI. This section further \nrequires the Attorney General to submit a report and recommendation to \nthe House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary not later than 90 days \nafter enactment of this Act on whether there should be established a \nseparate office of Inspector General for the FBI that shall be \nresponsible for supervising independent oversight of programs and \noperations of the FBI.\n\n  In addition, the bill as passed by the committee, contains language \noffered as an amendment by Senator Feinstein to authorize a number of \nnew judgeships. I strongly support Senator Feinstein's amendment, and \nbelieve that the need for these new judgeships is acute.\n  Title IV establishes a separate Violence Against Women Office (VAWO) \nwithin the Department. The VAWO is headed by a Director, who is \nappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. In addition, \nTitle IV enumerates duties and responsibilities of the Director, and \nauthorizes appropriations to ensure the VAWO is adequately staffed. I \nstrongly support a separate VAWO office within the Department of \nJustice.\n  The 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization \nAct should result in a more effective, as well as efficient, Department \nof Justice for the American people.\n  Division B of our bipartisan legislation includes eight titles which \ncompile a comprehensive authorization of expired and new Department of \nJustice grants programs and improvements to criminal law and \nprocedures.\n  Title I authorizes Department of Justice grants to establish 4,000 \nBoys and Girls Clubs across the country before January 1, 2007. This \nbipartisan amendment authorizes Department of Justice grants for each \nof the next 5 years to establish 1,200 additional Boys and Girls Clubs \nacross the Nation. In fact, this will bring the number of Boys and \nGirls clubs to 4,000. That means they will serve approximately 6 \nmillion young people by January 1, 2007.\n  I am very impressed with what I see about the Boys and Girls Clubs as \nI travel around the country. In 1997, I was very proud to join with \nSenator Hatch and others to pass bipartisan legislation to authorize \ngrants by the Department of Justice to fund 2,500 Boys and Girls Clubs \nacross the Nation. We increased the Department of Justice grant funding \nfor the Boys and Girls Clubs from $20 million in fiscal year 1998 to \n$60 million in fiscal year 2001. That is why we have now 2,591 Boys and \nGirls Clubs in all 50 States and 3.3 million children are served. It is \na success story.\n  I hear from parents certainly across my State how valuable it is to \nhave the Boys and Girls Clubs. I hear it also from police chiefs. In \nfact, one police chief told me, rather than giving him a couple more \npolice officers, fund a Boys and Girls Club in his district; it would \nbe more beneficial. This long-term Federal commitment has enabled \nVermonters to establish six Boys and Girls Clubs--in Brattleboro, \nBurlington, Montpelier, Randolph, Rutland, and Vergennes. In fact, \nI believe the Vermont Boys and Girls Clubs have received more than a \nmillion dollars from the Department of Justice grants since 1998.\n\n  In May of this year at a Vermont town meeting on heroin prevention \nand treatment, I was honored to present a check for more than $150,000 \nin Department of Justice funds to the members of the Burlington club to \ncontinue helping young Vermonters find some constructive alternatives \nfor both their talents and energies, because we know that in Vermont \nand across the Nation Boys and Girls Clubs are proving they are a \ngrowing success at preventing crime and supporting young children.\n  Parents, educators, law enforcement officers, and others know we need \nsafe havens where young people can learn and grow up free from the \ninfluence of the drugs and gangs and crime. That is why the Boys and \nGirls Clubs are so important to our Nation's children. Indeed, the \nsuccess already in Vermont has led to efforts to create nine more clubs \nthroughout my home State. Continued Federal support would be critical \nto these expansion efforts in Vermont and in the other 49 States as \nwell.\n  Title II and III is the Drug Abuse Education, Prevention, and \nTreatment Act of 2001. I am pleased that we have included in this \npackage the version of S. 304 that the Judiciary Committee passed \nunanimously on November 29. This legislation ushers in a new, \nbipartisan approach to our efforts to reduce drug abuse in the United \nStates. It was introduced by Senator Hatch and I in February. Senator \nHatch held an excellent hearing on the bill in March, the Judiciary \nCommittee has approved it, and the full Senate should follow the \nCommittee's lead. This is a bill that is embraced by Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, as well as law enforcement officers and drug \ntreatment providers.\n  I have wanted to pass legislation like this for years. This \nlegislation provides a comprehensive approach to reducing drug abuse in \nAmerica. I hope that the innovative programs established by this \nlegislation will assist all of our States in their efforts to address \nthe drug problems that most affect our communities.\n  No community or State is immune from the ravages of drug abuse. \nEarlier this year, I held two town meetings up in Vermont to talk about \nthe most pressing drug problem in my State: heroin. Vermont has \nhistorically had one of the lowest crime rates in the nation, but we \nare experiencing serious troubles because of drug abuse. I was pleased \nthat so many Vermonters--parents, students, teachers, and concerned \ncommunity members, as well as professionals from our State's \nprevention, treatment, and enforcement communities--took time out of \ntheir busy schedules to discuss the way Vermont's heroin problem \naffects their lives. They have informed my thinking on these issues and \nrededicated me to reducing the scourge of drug abuse throughout our \nnation.\n  This bill will provide necessary assistance to Vermont and every \nother State. It contains numerous grant programs to aid States and \nlocal communities in their efforts to prevent and treat drug abuse. Of \nparticular interest to Vermonters, S. 304 establishes drug treatment \ngrants for rural States and authorizes money for residential treatment \ncenters for mothers addicted to heroin, methamphetamines, or other \ndrugs.\n\n  This legislation also will help States and communities reduce drug \nuse in prisons through testing and treatment. This is an effort I \nproposed in the Drug Free Prisons Act, which I introduced in the last \nCongress. It will fund programs designed to reduce recidivism through \ndrug treatment and other services for former prisoners after release. \nAs Joseph Califano, Jr., the president of the Center on Addiction and \nSubstance Abuse and former secretary of the Department of Health, \nEducation, and Welfare, told the National Press Club in January. ``The \nnext great opportunity to reduce crime is to provide treatment and \ntraining to drug and alcohol abusing prisoners who will return to a \nlife of criminal activity unless they leave prison substance free and, \nupon release, enter treatment and continuing aftercare.'' This \nlegislation will accomplish both of those goals. In addition, this bill \nwill authorize drug courts--another step I proposed in the Drug Free \nPrisons Act--and juvenile drug courts.\n  Through this legislation, we extend food stamps to people who are \nineligible under current law due to a past drug offense, but have \ncompleted or are enrolled in drug treatment. Senator Hatch and I wanted \nto go further, and the Judiciary Committee approved language that would \nhave also extended food stamps to those who were pregnant, seriously \nill, or had dependent children. At Senator Kyle's insistence, those \nprovisions have regrettably been removed from this amendment.\n  This legislation also includes a grant program to assist State and \nlocal law enforcement in developing new ways to\n\n[[Page S14074]]\n\nfight crime. This National Comprehensive Crime-Free Communities Act \nwill provide funding for 250 communities, including at least one from \nevery State, to support crime prevention efforts. It also provides \nfunding for each State to assist local communities by, among other \nthings, providing training and technical assistance in preventing \ncrime.\n  Our bipartisan bill, S. 304, represents a major step forward for our \ndrug policy. It is a bill that has been very important to Senator \nHatch, and it has been very important to me. I think it will greatly \nbenefit Vermonters, and citizens of every State, and I urge the Senate \nto give this bill its full support.\n  Title IV is similar to S. 1315, the Judicial Improvement and \nIntegrity Act of 2001, introduced by myself and Senator Hatch, to \nprotect witnesses who provide information on criminal activity to law \nenforcement officials by increasing maximum sentences and other \nimprovements to the criminal code.\n  This title would do a number of things, such as:\n  No. 1. Protect witnesses who come forward to provide information on \ncriminal activity to law enforcement officials by increasing maximum \nsentences where physical force is actually used or attempted on the \nwitness;\n  No. 2. Eliminate a loophole in the criminal contempt statute that \nallows some defendants to avoid serving prison sentences imposed by the \nCourt;\n  No. 3. Eliminate a loophole in the statute of limitations that makes \nsome defendants immune from further prosecution if they plead guilty \nthen later get their plea agreements vacated;\n  No. 4. Grant the government the clear right to appeal the dismissal \nof a part of a count of an indictment, such as a predicate act in a \nRICO count;\n  No. 5. Insure that courts may impose appropriate terms of supervised \nrelease in drug cases;\n  No. 6. Give the District Courts greater flexibility in fashioning \nappropriate conditions of release for certain elderly prisoners; and\n  No. 7. Clarify the District Court's authority to revoke or modify a \nterm of supervised release when the defendant willfully violates the \nobligation to pay restitution to the victims of the defendant's crime.\n  The only difference between this amendment and the earlier bill which \nwas cosponsored by Senator Hatch is additional language in the \nprovision dealing with newly imposed terms of supervised release for \ncertain elderly prisoners. The new language would limit such new terms \nto the unserved portion of the prison term which the judge is \nconsidering amending. I thank Senator Hatch for his assistance on this \nlegislation.\n  Title V is the Criminal Law Technical Amendments Act, which makes \nclerical and other technical amendments to title 18, United States \nCode, and other laws relating to crime and criminal procedure and is \nsimilar to H.R. 2137 as passed by the House of Representatives by 374-0 \nvote. I commend Chairman Sensenbrenner and Senator Hatch for their \nleadership on this technical corrections legislation.\n  Title VI clarifies that an attorney for the Federal Government may \nprovide legal advice and supervision on certain undercover activities \nfor the purpose of investigating terrorism. Title VI of the bill \nmodifies the McDade law, 28 U.S.C. 530B, which was included in the \nomnibus appropriations bill at the end of the 105th Congress. The \nMcDade law was intended to codify the principle--with which I strongly \nagree--that the Justice Department may not unilaterally exempt its \nlawyers from State ethics rules that apply to all members of the bar.\n  Unfortunately, the McDade law has had serious unintended consequences \nfor Federal law enforcement, delaying important criminal \ninvestigations, preventing the use of effective and traditionally \naccepted investigative techniques, and serving as the basis of \nlitigation to interfere with legitimate federal prosecutions.\n  Of particular concern, the McDade law is wreaking havoc on law \nenforcement efforts in Oregon, where an attorney ethics decision by the \nState Supreme Court--In re Gatti, 330 Or. 517 (2000)--has resulted in a \ncomplete shutdown of all undercover activity. The loss of this \nessential crime-fighting tool poses a serious and continuing problem \nfor law enforcement in that State, and threatens to hamstring \ninvestigations into all manner of criminal activity, including \nterrorism.\n\n  I have introduced a bill, together with Senators Hatch and Wyden, \nthat would remedy the problems caused by the McDade law while adhering \nto its basic premise: The Department of Justice does not have the \nauthority it long claimed to write its own ethics rules. The proposed \nlegislation, S. 1437, would clarify the ethical standards governing the \nconduct of government attorneys and address the most pressing \ncontemporary question of government attorney ethics--namely, the \nquestion of which rule should govern government attorneys' \ncommunications with represented persons. The Senate approved S. 1437 on \nOctober 11, 2001, as part of a broader antiterrorism bill (S. 1510), \nbut the House dropped this reasonable corrective legislation from the \nfinal antiterrorism package (H.R. 3162).\n  Title VI of Division B of the bill that the Senate passes today is a \nsubset of S. 1437, which will restore to Federal law enforcement in \nOregon the ability to use undercover techniques to investigate \nterrorist activities. This legislation is a much-needed step in the \nright direction; however, it is hardly a complete solution for the many \nserious problems caused by the McDade law. At a time when we need our \nFederal agents and prosecutors to move quickly to catch those \nresponsible for the recent terrorist attacks, and to prevent further \nattacks, we need to address these problems in a thorough and \ncomprehensive manner. I therefore urge my colleagues in the House both \nto approve title VI of this bill, and to consider the other provisions \nof S. 1437. We cannot afford to wait until more investigations are \ncompromised.\n  Title VII contains amendments, authored by Senator Sessions, that \nmodify the Paul Coverdell National Forensic Science Improvement Act of \n2000 (P.L. 106-561) to enhance participation by local crime labs and to \nallow for DNA backlog elimination. Dr. Eric Buel, the Director of the \nVermont Forensic Laboratory, has written to me to endorse these changes \nto the Coverdell Act, which I was proud to cosponsor last year. I \nsupport this title to help bring the necessary forensic technology to \nall states to improve their criminal justice systems.\n  Title VIII contains the Ecstasy Prevention Act, authored by Senator \nGraham, which authorizes several Department of Justice grant programs \nto combat Ecstasy drug abuse. I commend Senator Graham for his \nleadership in fighting Ecstasy use.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Hatch, Congressman \nSensenbrenner and Congressman Conyers and other members of the upcoming \nconference to bring the important business of re-authorizing the \nDepartment back before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees. \nClearly, regular reauthorization of the Department should be part and \nparcel of the Committees' traditional role in overseeing the \nDepartment's activities. Swift passage into law of the 21st Century \nDepartment of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act will be a \nsignificant step toward restoring our oversight role.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleagues today for \nthe passage of the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations \nAuthorization Act. This legislation contains a host of provisions that \nare critical to law enforcement and to our efforts to combat illegal \ndrug use. Let me take a moment to discuss some of them in more detail.\n  This provision establishes operating authority for the Department of \nJustice and expressly authorizes some practices that have developed at \nthe Department of Justice on an ad hoc basis. Pursuant to the \nlegislation, DOJ activities may be carried out through any means in the \nreasonable discretion of the Attorney General, including by sending or \nreceiving details of personnel to or from other branches of the \nGovernment and through contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements \nwith non-Federal parties.\n  The legislation ensures accountability by directing the Attorney \nGeneral to provide annually to the House and Senate Judiciary and \nAppropriations Committees: (1) a report detailing every grant, \ncooperative agreement, or programmatic services contract that was made, \nentered into,\n\n[[Page S14075]]\n\nawarded, or extended in the immediately preceding fiscal year by or on \nbehalf of the Office of Justice Programs; and (2) a report identifying \nand reviewing every grant, agreement, or contract that was closed out \nor otherwise ended in the immediately preceding fiscal year. The bill \nalso enhances oversight over the FBI by requiring the Inspector General \nof DOJ to appoint a Deputy Inspector General for the FBI who shall be \nresponsible for supervising independent oversight of FBI programs and \noperations until September 30, 2004, and submitting to Congress a plan \nfor FBI oversight.\n  The legislation also assists our ongoing war against terrorism. It \nestablishes in the U.S. Treasury a Counterterrorism Fund to reimburse \nDOJ for certain counter-terrorism activities and Federal departments or \nagencies for the cost of detaining accused terrorists in foreign \ncountries.\n  The bill enhances the privacy rights of law-abiding Americans by \ndirecting the Attorney General and the FBI Director to report on their \nuse the DCS 1000, or ``Carnivore'' surveillance system. The report will \ninclude the number of times the system was used for surveillance during \nthe preceding year, the persons who approved its use, the criteria \napplied to requests for its use, and any information gathered or \naccessed that was not authorized by the court to be gathered or \naccessed. Many concerns have been raised about the use of this system, \nand it is my hope that the reporting requirement will provide \npolicymakers with valuable information and encourage Department to use \nthe system responsibly.\n  The bill amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of \n1968 to establish within the Department of Justice a Violence Against \nWomen Office. With this amendment, the Director of the Office \ncurrently--Diane Stuart--will: (1) serve as special counsel to the \nAttorney General on the subject of violence against women; (2) maintain \na liaison with the judicial branches of the Federal and State \ngovernments on related matters; (3) provide information to the Federal, \nState and local governments and the general public on related matters; \n(4) upon request, serve as the DOJ representative on domestic task \nforces, committees, or commissions addressing related policies or \nissues and as the U.S. Government representative on human rights and \neconomic justice matters related to violence against women in \ninternational forums; (5) carry out DOJ functions under the Violence \nAgainst Women Act of 1994 and other DOJ functions on related matters; \nand (6) provide technical assistance, coordination, and support to \nother elements of DOJ and to other Federal, State, and tribal agencies \nin efforts to develop policy and to enforce Federal laws relating to \nviolence against women.\n  The legislation authorizes Department of Justice grants to establish \n4,000 Boys and Girls Clubs across the country before January 1, 2007. \nAs my colleagues know, for years these clubs have steered thousands of \nour young people away from lives of drugs and crime. I am pleased that \nwe are able to expand this excellent program to serve other needy young \npeople.\n  The legislation also contains S. 304, the ``Drug Abuse Education, \nPrevention, and Treatment Act of 2001,'' which I authored with Chairman \nLeahy and a bipartisan group of Senators in an effort to shore up our \nnational commitment to the demand reduction component of our national \ndrug control strategy.\n  Each year, drug abuse exacts an enormous toll on our nation. I am \nincreasingly alarmed that the drug epidemic in America continues to \nworsen, with more of our youth experimenting with and becoming addicted \nto illegal drugs. According to recent national surveys, youth drug use, \nparticularly use of so-called ``club drugs,'' such as Ecstasy and GHB, \ntragically is again on the rise. Over the past two years, use of \necstasy among 12th graders increased dramatically. Hearings I held last \nyear in Utah highlighted the extent the drug problem pervades not just \nour major cities, but our entire country.\n  This dangerous trend is not going to reverse course unless we attack \nthe drug abuse problem from all angles. I agree fully with President \nBush that while we must remain steadfast in our commitment to enforcing \nour criminal laws against drug trafficking and use, the time has come \nto invest in demand reduction programs that have been proven effective. \nOnly through such a balanced approach can we fully remove the scourge \nof drugs from our society.\n  The provisions of this bill provide tools that will make a difference \nin the fight against drug abuse. It has broad, bipartisan support on \nCapitol Hill, as well as the support of numerous distinguished law \nenforcement groups, including the Fraternal Order of Police and the \nNational Sheriff's Association. Several mainstream prevention and \ntreatment organizations have also voiced their support for the bill, \nincluding the Phoenix House, the National Crime Prevention Council, and \nthe Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America.\n  This title is similar to S. 1315, the Judicial Improvement and \nIntegrity Act of 2001, which I introduced with Senator Leahy to protect \nwitnesses who provide information on criminal activity to law \nenforcement officials by increasing maximum sentences and other \nimprovements to the criminal code.\n  The legislation contains provisions from the Professional Standards \nfor Government Attorneys Act of 2001 that will allow Government \nattorneys, for the purpose of conducting terrorism investigations, to \nprovide legal advice, authorization, concurrence, direction, or \nsupervision on conducting covert activities and to participate in such \nactivities, even though such activities may require the use of deceit \nor misrepresentation. The Senators from the State of Oregon, Gordon \nSmith and Ron Wyden, deserve the appreciation of the federal \nprosecutors in their state for insisting that this provision be \nincluded in this legislation.\n  Finally, the bill includes Senator Graham's Ecstasy Prevention Act of \n2001. The Ecstasy Prevention Act requires the Substance Abuse and \nMental Health Services Administration to give priority in the award of \ngrants to communities that have taken measures to combat club drug use, \nincluding passing ordinances restricting ``rave clubs,'' increasing law \nenforcement on ecstasy, and seizing lands under nuisance abatement laws \nto prevent the abuse of ecstasy. It requires the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy to use High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area funds \nto combat trafficking in ecstasy, and ensures that drug prevention \nmedia campaigns include efforts at preventing ecstasy abuse. These \nprovisions are extremely important to address the rising threat of \necstasy use among the young people in our society.\n  Mr. President, not surprisingly, this comprehensive legislation has \nbroad support not only from my colleagues, but also from law \nenforcement, community groups, and treatment organizations. This is \ntruly bipartisan legislation that we all agree will do a great deal of \ngood. I again want to thank my colleagues for passing this legislation \ntoday. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Leahy-Hatch \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, the committee substitute \namendment, as amended, be agreed to, the act, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord; further, that the Senate insist on its amendment and request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, \nand the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2697) was agreed to.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted and Proposed.'')\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 2215), as amended, was passed.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore appointed Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \nHatch conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of H.R. 3447.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n\n[[Page S14076]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3447) to amend title 38, United States Code, \n     to enhance the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     to recruit and retain qualified nurses for the Veterans \n     Health Administration, to provide an additional basis for \n     establishing the inability of veterans to defray expenses of \n     necessary medical care, to enhance certain health care \n     programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I urge prompt Senate passage of H.R. 3447, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Health Care Programs Enhancement Act of \n2001. This bill passed the House on December 11, 2001, and our action \nwill clear the measure for the President's signature. This bill \nreflects a compromise agreement that the Senate and House Committees on \nVeterans' Affairs have reached on a number of health-related bills \nconsidered in the Senate and House during the 107th Congress, \nincluding: a bill to help VA respond to the looming nurse crisis; a \nbill to extend health care for Persian Gulf War veterans; and a bill to \nimprove specialized treatment and rehabilitation for disabled veterans.\n  The centerpiece of this bill are provisions to improve recruitment \nand retention of VA nurses. On June 14, 2001, the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs held a hearing to explore reasons for the imminent \nshortage of professional nurses in the United States and how this \nshortage will affect health care for veterans served by Department of \nVeterans Affairs' health care facilities.\n  Several registered nurses, including Sandra McMeans from my state of \nWest Virginia, testified before the Committee that unpredictable and \ndangerously long working hours lead to nurses' fatigue and \nfrustration--and patient care suffers.\n  Following this hearing, I joined with Senators Specter and Cleland to \nintroduce the Department of Veterans Affairs Nurse Recruitment and \nRetention Enhancement Act of 2001, S. 1188. This bill was included in \nfull in S. 1188 as reported on October 10, 2001, the Department of \nVeterans Affairs Medical Programs Enhancement Act of 2001, and all of \nthe provisions are now included in H.R. 3447.\n  I will highlight a number of the provisions included in the pending \nmeasure and refer my colleagues to the joint explanatory statement on \nthe legislation which I will insert at the end of my remarks, for more \ndetail.\n  The legislation before us includes a requirement that VA produce a \npolicy on staffing standards in VA health care facilities. Such a \npolicy shall be developed in consultation with the VA Under Secretary \nfor Health, the Director of VA's National Center for Patient Safety, \nand VA's Chief Nurse. While it is up to VA to develop the standards, \nthe policy must consider the numbers and skill mix required of staff in \nspecific medical settings, such as critical care and long-term care. I \nthank J. David Cox, R.N. from the American Federation of Government \nEmployees for eloquently demonstrating the need for this critical \nprovision at our June hearing.\n  Because mandatory overtime was frequently cited at the Committee's \nJune hearing as being of serious concern, the legislation also includes \na requirement that the Secretary report to the House and Senate \nCommittees on Veterans' Affairs on the use of overtime by licensed \nnursing staff and nursing assistants in each facility. This is a \ncritical first step in determining what can be done to reduce the \namount of mandatory overtime.\n  In terms of providing sufficient pay, the pending legislation \nmandates that VA provide Saturday premium pay to certain health \nprofessionals. This group of professionals includes licensed practical \nnurses (LPN's), certified or registered respiratory therapists, \nlicensed physical therapists, licensed vocational nurses, pharmacists, \nand occupational therapists. These workers are known as ``hybrids'' as \nthey straddle two different personnel authorities--titles 38 and 5 of \nthe United States Code. Hybrid status allows for direct hiring and a \nmore flexible compensation system.\n  This is an issue of equity, especially for LPN's who work alongside \nother nurses on Saturdays. When LPN's who do not receive Saturday \npremium pay must work together with registered nurses (RN's) who do, \npoor morale inevitably results. Being aware of the looming nurse \nshortage, we should be doing all we can to improve VA's ability to \nrecruit and retain these caregivers.\n  Currently, hospital directors have the discretion to provide Saturday \npremium pay. But of the 17,000 hybrid employees, 8,000 are not \nreceiving the pay premium.\n  I believe this change in law will make pay more consistent and fair \nfor our health care workers. There are other VA health care employees \nwho are employed under the title 5 personnel system who are not \naffected by this change. But since the title 5 system is not under the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee jurisdiction, we were not able to address \nSaturday pay for these workers. However, because of concerns about \nthose workers, I pledge to work with my colleagues on other committees \nto provide other title 5 workers with Saturday premium pay.\n  Programs initiated within VA to improve conditions for nurses and \npatients have focused on issues other than staffing ratios, pay, and \nhours. A highly praised scholarship program that I spearheaded in 1998 \nallows VA nurses to pursue degrees and training in return for their \nservice, thus encouraging professional development and improving the \nquality of health care. Included within the legislation before us are \nmodifications to the existing scholarship and debt reduction programs. \nThese changes are intended to improve the programs by providing \nadditional flexibility to recipients.\n  In the Upper Midwest, the special skills of nurses and nurse \npractitioners are being recognized in clinics that provide supportive \ncare close to the veterans who need it. The legislation before us seeks \nto encourage more nurse-managed clinics and also includes a requirement \nthat VA evaluate these clinics.\n\n  The legislation before us would amend the treatment of part-time \nservice performed by certain title 38 employees prior to April 7, 1986, \nfor purposes of retirement credit. Currently, part-time service \nperformed by title 5 employees prior to April 7, 1986, is treated as \nfull-time service; however, title 38 employees' part-time services \nprior to April 7, 1986, is counted as part-time service and therefore \nresults in lower annuities for these employees. In order to rectify \nthis, the pending measure exempts registered nurses, physician \nassistants, and expanded-function dental auxiliaries from the \nrequirement that part-time service performed prior to April 7, 1986, be \nprorated when calculating retirement annuities.\n  Although the nursing crisis has not yet reached its projected peak, \nthe shortage is already endangering patient safety in the areas of \ncritical and long-term care, where demands on nurses are greatest. We \nmust encourage higher enrollment in nursing schools, improve the work \nenvironment, and offer nurses opportunities to develop as respected \nprofessionals, while taking steps to ensure safe staffing levels in the \nshort-term.\n  In addition to the many important changes for nurses, this bill also \ncontains other significant health care provisions. For example, the \nlegislation would enable the Department of Veterans Affairs to allow \nhearing-impaired veterans and veterans with spinal cord injury or \ndysfunction, in addition to blind veterans, to obtain service dogs to \nassist them with everyday activities.\n  This bill would also establish a VA chiropractic program in each of \nthe VA's health care networks. A chiropractic advisory committee will \nbe established for the purpose of advising the Secretary in the \ndevelopment and implementation of the chiropractic program. The \nSecretary will provide protocols governing referrals, direct access, \nchiropractic scope of practice, and definition of chiropractic \nservices, which will be available to all veterans enrolled in the VA \nhealth care system. I thank our Majority Leader, Senator Daschle, for \nhis leadership in shaping this new landmark chiropractic program within \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Another important provision of this bill would help ``near poor'' \nveterans living in high cost-of-living areas, by significantly reducing \nVA copayments for hospital inpatient care. For those\n\n[[Page S14077]]\n\nveterans whose family incomes fall between the VA's current means test \nlevel and the Department of Housing and Urban Development low income \nindex for the area of their primary residence, the current inpatient \ncopayments would be reduced by 80 percent. This is a significant step \nin reducing the inequities imposed on those veterans in high cost-of-\nliving areas.\n  Another very important provision of this bill authorizes $28.3 \nmillion for a much needed repair project at the Miami VA medical \ncenter. Three years ago there was a devastating fire that destroyed the \nelectrical plant at the medical center, and this project is desperately \nneeded.\n  As has been the case in previous years and is particularly important \nin light of our country's current military actions, this legislation \ntruly represents a bipartisan commitment to our Nation's veterans. I \nparticularly recognize the hard work of Kim Lipsky and Mickey Thursam \nof the Democratic staff of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs; Bill \nCahill of the Republican staff of the Committee; Tamera Jones of \nSenator Cleland's staff, and John Bradley, Kimberly Cowins, and Susan \nEdgerton of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee in seeing this bill \nthrough the legislative process.\n  In conclusion, I believe that this bill represents a real step \nforward for veterans and for the health care system which veterans turn \nto for care. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of \nhealth care legislation for our veterans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the compromise agreement and \na joint explanatory statement on the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Summary--Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Programs \n                        Enhancement Act of 2001\n\n       The bill, H.R. 3447, passed the House on December 11, 2001, \n     and reflects a compromise agreement stemming from S. 1188, \n     the ``Department of Veterans Affairs Nurse Recruitment and \n     Retention Act of 2001'', as originally introduced; S. 1160; \n     S. 1221; and H.R. 2792.\n\n\n                         summary of provisions\n\n       The following is a summary of the provisions in the \n     Proposed ``Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care \n     Programs Enhancement Act of 2001'':\n\n  TITLE I-- ENHANCEMENT OF NURSE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION AUTHORITIES\n\n                  Subtitle A--Recruitment Authorities\n\n       Employee Incentive Scholarship and Education Debt Reduction \n     Programs: Enhances eligibility and benefits for the programs \n     by enabling nurses to pursue advanced degrees while \n     continuing to care for patients, in order to improve \n     recruitment and retention of nurses within the VA health care \n     system.\n\n                   Subtitle B--Retention Authorities\n\n       Saturday Premium Pay: Mandates that VA provide Saturday \n     premium pay to title 5/title 38 hybrids. Such hybrids include \n     licensed practical nurses, pharmacists, certified or \n     registered respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and \n     occupational therapists.\n       Staffing Standards and Mandatory Overtime: Requires VA to \n     develop a nationwide policy on staffing standards to ensure \n     that veterans are provided with safe and high quality care, \n     taking into consideration the numbers and skill mix required \n     of staff in specific medical settings. Requires a report on \n     the use of mandatory overtime by licensed nursing staff and \n     nursing assistants in each facility. The report would include \n     a description of the amount of mandatory overtime used by \n     facilities.\n\n                 Subtitle C--Other Nursing Authorities\n\n       Retirement Annuities for RNs, PAs, and Others: Exempts \n     registered nurses, physician assistants, and expanded-\n     function dental auxiliaries from the requirement that part-\n     time service performed prior to April 7, 1986, be prorated \n     when calculating retirement annuities.\n\n             Subtitle D--National Commission on VA Nursing\n\n       Establishes a 12-member Commission on VA Nursing that would \n     assess legislative and organizational policy changes to \n     enhance the recruitment and retention of nurses by the \n     Department, and the future of the nursing profession within \n     the Department, and recommend legislative and organization \n     policy changes to enhance the recruitment and retention of \n     nurses in the Department.\n\n                        TITLE II--OTHER MATTERS\n\n       Service Dogs: Authorizes VA to provide certain disabled \n     veterans with service dogs to assist them with everyday \n     activities.\n       Means Test: Retains the current-law means test national \n     income threshold and maintains current allocation methodology \n     (known as VERA), but will reduce copayments by 80% for near-\n     poor veterans who require acute VA hospital inpatient care.\n       Chiropractic Care: Establishes a program of chiropractic \n     services in VA healthcare facilities in each of the Veterans \n     Integrated Service Networks and requires VA to provide \n     training and educational materials on chiropractic services \n     to VA health care providers. Also creates an advisory \n     committee to oversee the implementation of this provision.\n       Clinical Research Oversight Funding: Authorizes VA to fund \n     its field Offices of Research Compliance and Assurance from \n     the Medical Care appropriation, rather than from the research \n     budget.\n       Emergency Construction Project for the Miami VA Hospital: \n     Authorizes a $28,300,000 emergency electrical project.\n       Health Care for Persian Gulf War Veterans: Extends VA's \n     authority to provide health care for those who served in the \n     Persian Gulf until December 31, 2002.\n\n\n                      joint explanatory statement\n\n       The ``Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Programs \n     Enhancement Act of 2001'' reflects a compromise agreement \n     that the Senate and House of Representatives Committees on \n     Veterans' Affairs reached on certain provisions of a number \n     of bills considered by the House and Senate during the 107th \n     Congress, including: H.R. 2792, a bill to make service dogs \n     available to disabled veterans and to make various other \n     improvements in health care benefits provided by the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, by \n     the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs on October 16, 2001, \n     and passed by the House on October 23, 2001 [hereinafter, \n     ``House Bill'']; S. 1188, a bill to enhance the authority of \n     the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs to recruit and retain \n     qualified nurses for the Veterans Health Administration, and \n     for other purposes, reported by the Senate Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs on October 10, 2001, as proposed to be \n     amended by a manager's amendment [hereinafter, ``Senate \n     Bill'']; S. 1576, a bill to amend section 1710 of title 38, \n     United States Code, to extend the eligibility for health care \n     of veterans who served in Southwest Asia during the Persian \n     Gulf War; and, S. 1598, a bill to amend section 1706 of title \n     38, United States Code, to enhance the management of the \n     provision by the Department of Veterans Affairs of \n     specialized treatment and rehabilitation for disabled \n     veterans, and for other purposes, introduced on October 21, \n     2001.\n       The House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have \n     prepared the following explanation of the compromise bill, \n     H.R. 3447 (hereinafter referred to as the ``Compromise \n     Agreement''). Differences between the provisions contained in \n     the Compromise Agreement and the related provisions in the \n     bills listed above are noted in this document, except for \n     clerical corrections and conforming changes made necessary by \n     the Compromise Agreement, and minor drafting, technical, and \n     clarifying changes.\n\n  TITLE I--ENHANCEMENT OF NURSE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION AUTHORITIES\n\n               Subtitle A--Nurse Recruitment Authorities\n\n     Current Law\n       Several VA programs under existing law are designed to aid \n     the Department in recruiting qualified health care \n     professionals in fields where scarcity and high demand \n     produce competition with the private sector. The Department \n     is authorized to operate the Employee Incentive Scholarship \n     Program (hereafter EISP) under section 7671 of title 38, \n     United States Code. Under the EISP, VA may award scholarship \n     funds, up to $10,000 per year per participant in full-time \n     study, for up to 3 years. These scholarships require \n     eligible participants to reciprocate with periods of \n     obligated service to the Department. Currently, enrollment \n     in the scholarship program is limited to employees with 2 \n     or more antecedent years of VA employment. Statutory \n     authority for this program terminates December 31, 2001.\n       The Department is authorized to operate the Education Debt \n     Reduction Program (hereafter EDRP) under section 7681 of \n     title 38, United States Code. Under the EDRP, the Department \n     may repay education-related loans incurred by recently hired \n     VA clinical professionals in high demand positions. Statutory \n     authority for this program, a program not yet implemented by \n     the Department, terminates on December 31, 2001. If \n     implemented, the program would authorize VA to repay $6,000, \n     $8,000, and $10,000 per year, respectively, over a 3-year \n     period, in combined principal and interest on educational \n     loans obtained by scarce VA professionals.\n       Under sections 8344 and 8468 of title 5, United States \n     Code, the Department is authorized to request waivers of the \n     pay reduction otherwise required by law for re-employed \n     Federal annuitants who are recruited to the Department in \n     order to meet staffing needs in scarce health care \n     specialties.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 111 would permanently authorize the EISP; reduce \n     the minimum period of employment for eligibility in the \n     program from 2 years to 1 year; remove the award limit for \n     education pursued during a particular school year by a \n     participant, as long as the participant had not exceeded the \n     overall limitation of the equivalent of 3 years of full-time \n     education; and, extend authority to increase the award \n     amounts based on Federal national comparability increases in \n     pay.\n       Section 112 would permanently authorize the EDRP; expand \n     the list of eligible occupations furnishing direct patient \n     care services\n\n[[Page S14078]]\n\n     and services incident to such care to veterans; extend the \n     number of years to 5 that a Departmental employee may \n     participate in the EDRP, and increase the gross award limit \n     to any participant to $44,000, with the award payments for \n     the fourth and fifth years to a participant limited to \n     $10,000 in each; and provide limited authority (until June \n     30, 2002) for the Secretary to waive the eligibility \n     requirement limiting EDRP participation to recently appointed \n     employees on a case-by-case basis for individuals appointed \n     on or after January 1, 1999, through December 30, 2001.\n       Section 113 would require the Department to report to \n     Congress its use of the authority in title 5, United States \n     Code, to request waivers of pay reduction normally required \n     from re-employed Federal annuitants, when such requests \n     are used to meet its nurse staffing requirements.\n     House Bill\n       The House bill has no comparable provisions.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 101, 102, and 103 follow the Senate language.\n\n                Subtitle B--Nurse Retention Authorities\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 7453(c) of title 38, United States Code, guarantees \n     premium pay (at 25 percent over the basic pay rate) to VA \n     registered nurses who work regularly scheduled tours of duty \n     during Saturdays and Sundays. However, licensed vocational \n     nurses and certain health care support personnel, whose \n     employment status is grounded in employment authorities in \n     title 5 and title 38, United States Code, are eligible for \n     premium pay on regularly scheduled tours of duty that include \n     Sundays. Saturday premium pay for these employees is a \n     discretionary decision at individual medical facilities.\n       At retirement, VA registered nurses enrolled in the Civil \n     Service Retirement System receive annuity credit for unused \n     sick leave. This credit is unavailable, however, for \n     registered nurses who retire under the Federal Employee \n     Retirement System.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 121 would mandate that VA provide Saturday premium \n     pay to employees specified in Section 7454(b).\n       Section 122 would extend authority for the Department to \n     provide VA nurses enrolled in the Federal Employee Retirement \n     System the equivalent sick-leave credit in their retirement \n     annuity calculations that is provided to other VA nurses who \n     are enrolled in the Civil Service Retirement System.\n       Section 123 would require the Department to evaluate nurse-\n     managed clinics, including those providing primary and \n     geriatric care to veterans. Several nurse-managed clinics are \n     in operation throughout the VA health care system, with a \n     preponderance of clinics operating in the Upper Midwest \n     Health Care Network. The evaluation would include \n     information on patient satisfaction, provider experiences, \n     cost, access and other matters. The Secretary would be \n     required to report results from this evaluation to the \n     Committees on Veterans' Affairs 18 months after enactment.\n       Section 124 would require the Department to develop a \n     nationwide clinical staffing standards policy to ensure that \n     veterans are provided with safe and high quality care. \n     Section 8110 of title 38, United States Code, sets forth the \n     manner in which medical facilities shall be operated, but \n     does not include reference to staffing levels for such \n     operation.\n       Section 125 would require the Secretary to submit annual \n     reports on exceptions approved by the Secretary to VA's nurse \n     qualification standards. Such reports would include the \n     number of waivers requested and granted to permit promotion \n     of nurses who do not have baccalaureate degrees in nursing, \n     and other pertinent information.\n       Section 126 would require the Department to report \n     facility-specific use of mandatory overtime for professional \n     nursing staff and nursing assistants during 2001. The \n     Department has no nationwide policy on the use of mandatory \n     overtime. This report would be required within 180 days of \n     enactment. The report would include information on the amount \n     of mandatory overtime paid by VA health care facilities, \n     mechanisms employed to monitor overtime use, assessment of \n     any ill effects on patient care, and recommendations on \n     preventing or minimizing its use.\n     House Bill\n       The House bill has no comparable provisions.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Sections 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, and 126 are identical to \n     the provisions in the Senate bill.\n       The Committees are concerned about VA's current national \n     policy requiring VA nurses to achieve baccalaureate degrees \n     as one means of quality assurance. VA has issued directive \n     5012.1, a directive that requires VA's registered nurses to \n     obtain baccalaureate degrees in nursing as a precondition to \n     advancement beyond entry level, and to do so by 2005. This \n     policy is effective immediately for newly employed nurses.\n       At a time of looming crisis in achieving adequacy of basic \n     clinical staffing of VA facilities, the Committees express \n     concern over whether such a policy guiding \n     nurse qualifications may work against VA's interests and \n     responsibilities to protect the safety of its patients by \n     creating unintended shortages of scarce health personnel. \n     The Committees urge the Secretary to consider the \n     implications of continuing such a policy in the face of \n     future shortages of nursing personnel. The American \n     Association of Community Colleges has reported that, each \n     year, more than 60 percent of new US registered nurses are \n     produced in two-year associate degree programs. The \n     Department's current qualification standard for registered \n     nurses may dissuade these fully licensed health care \n     professionals from considering VA employment.\n\n                     Subtitle C--Other Authorities\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 7306(a)(5) of title 38, United States Code, \n     requires that the Office of the Under Secretary for Health \n     include a Director of Nursing Service, responsible to the \n     Under Secretary for Health.\n       Section 7426 of title 38, United States Code, provides \n     retirement rights for, among others, nurses, physician \n     assistants and expanded-function dental auxiliaries with \n     part-time appointments. These employees' retirement annuities \n     are calculated in a way that produces an unfair loss of \n     annuity for them compared to other Federal employees. \n     Congress has made a number of efforts since 1980 to provide \n     equity for this group, many members of whom are now retired. \n     These individuals, appointed to their part-time VA positions \n     prior to April 6, 1986, under the employment authority of \n     title 38, United States Code, have been penalized with lower \n     annuities by subsequent Acts of Congress that addressed \n     retirement annuity calculation rules for other part-time \n     Federal employees appointed under the authority of title 5, \n     United States Code.\n       Section 7251 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes \n     the directors of VA health care facilities to request \n     adjustments to the minimum rates of basic pay for nurses \n     based on local variations in the labor market.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 131 would amend section 7306(a)(5) of title 38, \n     United States Code, to elevate the office of the VA Nurse \n     Executive by requiring that official to report directly to \n     the VA Under Secretary for Health.\n       Section 132 would amend section 7426 of title 38, United \n     States Code, to exempt registered nurses, physician \n     assistants, and expanded-function auxiliaries from the \n     requirement that part-time service performed prior to April \n     7, 1986, be prorated when calculating retirement annuities.\n       Section 133 would modify the nurse locality-pay authorities \n     and reporting requirements. The section would clarify and \n     simplify a VA medical center's use of Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics (BLS) information to facilitate locality-pay \n     decisions for VA nurses. Additionally, section 133 would \n     clarify the Committees' intent on steps VA facilities would \n     take when certain BLS date were unavailable, thus serving as \n     a trigger for the use of third-party survey information, and \n     thereby reducing current restrictions on the use of such \n     surveys.\n     House Bill\n       The House bill contains no comparable provisions.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 131, 132, and 133 follow the Senate bill.\n\n             Subtitle D--National Commission on VA Nursing\n\n     Current Law\n       None.\n     House Bill\n       Section 301 would establish a 12-member National Commission \n     on VA Nursing. The Secretary would appoint eleven members, \n     and the Nurse Executive of the Department would serve as the \n     twelfth, ex officio, member. Members would include three \n     recognized representatives of employees of the Department; \n     three representatives of professional associations of nurses \n     or similar organizations affiliated with the Department's \n     health care practitioners; two representatives of trade \n     associations representing the nursing profession; two would \n     be nurses from nursing schools affiliated with the \n     Department; and one member would represent veterans. The \n     Secretary would designate one member to serve as Chair of the \n     Commission.\n       Section 302 would authorize the Commission to assess \n     legislative and organization policy changes to enhance the \n     recruitment and retention of nurses by the Department and the \n     future of the nursing profession within the Department. This \n     section would also provide for Commission recommendations on \n     legislation and policy changes to enhance recruitment and \n     retention of nurses by the Department.\n       Section 303 would require the Commission to submit to \n     Congress and the Secretary a report on its findings and \n     conclusions. The report would be due not later than 2 years \n     after the date of the first meeting of the Commission. The \n     Secretary would be required to promptly consider the \n     Commission's report and submit to Congress the Department's \n     views on the Commission's findings and conclusions, including \n     actions, if any, that the Department would take to implement \n     the recommendations.\n       Sections 304 and 305 would delineate the powers afforded to \n     the Commission, including powers to conduct hearings and \n     meetings, take testimony and obtain information from external \n     sources, employ staff, authorize rates of pay, detail other \n     Federal employees to the Commission staff, and address other \n     administrative matters.\n       Section 306 would terminate the Commission 90 days after \n     the date of the submission of its report to Congress.\n\n[[Page S14079]]\n\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bill has no comparable provisions.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Sections 141, 142, 143, 144, 145 and 146 follow the House \n     bill, with certain modifications to the membership of the \n     Commission.\n       The Committees expect the National Commission on VA Nursing \n     to concern itself with the full spectrum of occupations \n     involved in nursing care of veterans in the Veterans Health \n     Administration, with specific reference to registered \n     professional and licensed vocational nurses, clinical nurse \n     specialists, nurse practitioners, nurse managers and \n     executives, nursing assistants, and other technical and \n     ancillary personnel of the Department involved in direct \n     health care delivery to the nation's veterans. In addition to \n     statutory requirements, the Committees expect the Secretary \n     to appoint members to the Commission to reflect the wide \n     variety of occupations and disciplines that constitute the \n     nursing profession within the Department.\n\n                        TITLE II--OTHER MATTERS\n\n\n                       provision of service dogs\n\n     Current Law\n       None.\n     House Bill\n       Section 101 would amend section 1714 of title 38, United \n     States Code, to authorize the Department to provide service \n     dogs to veterans suffering from spinal cord injury or \n     dysfunction, other diseases causing physical immobility, or \n     hearing loss (or other types of disabilities susceptible to \n     improvement or enhanced functioning) for which use of service \n     dogs is likely to improve or enhance their ability to perform \n     activities of daily living or other skills of independent \n     living. Under the provision, a veteran would be required to \n     be enrolled in VA care under section 1705 of title 38, United \n     States Code, as a prerequisite to eligibility. Service dogs \n     would be provided in accordance with existing priorities for \n     VA health care enrollment.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 201 would authorize the Secretary to provide \n     service dogs to service-connected veterans with hearing \n     impairments and with spinal cord injuries.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 201 follows the House provision.\n       Any travel expenses of the veteran in adjusting to the \n     service dog would be reimbursable on the same basis as such \n     expenses are reimbursed under Section 111, title 38, United \n     States Code, for blind veterans adjusting to a guide dog.\n\n\n       management of health care for certain low-income veterans\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1722(a) of title 38, United States Code, places \n     veterans whose incomes are below a specified level--in \n     calendar year 2001, $23,688 for an individual without \n     dependents--within the definition of a person who is ``unable \n     to defray'' the cost of health care. The section includes two \n     other such indicators of inability to defray: evidence of \n     eligibility for Medicaid, and receipt of VA nonservice-\n     connected pension. Veterans in these circumstances are \n     adjudged equally unable to defray the costs of health care; \n     as such, they are eligible to receive comprehensive VA health \n     care without agreeing to make co-payments required from \n     veterans whose incomes are higher. Under current law, a \n     single-income threshold (with adjustments only for \n     dependents) is the standard used.\n     House Bill\n       Section 103 would amend section 1722(a) of title 38, United \n     States Code, to establish geographically adjusted income \n     thresholds for determining a non-service-connected veteran's \n     priority for VA care, and therefore, whether the veteran must \n     agree to make co-payments in order to receive VA care. The \n     section's purpose would be to address local variations in \n     cost of care, cost-of-living or other variables that, beyond \n     gross income, impinge on a veteran's relative economic status \n     and ability to defray the cost of care.\n       In section 103, low-income limits administered by the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for its \n     subsidized housing programs would establish an adjusted \n     poverty-income threshold to be used in the ability-to-defray \n     determination. The actual threshold for determining an \n     individual veteran's ability to pay would be the greater of \n     the current-law income threshold in section 1722 of title 38, \n     United States Code, or the local low-income limits set by \n     HUD.\n       Section 103 also would include a 5-year limitation on the \n     effects of adoption of the HUD low-income limits policy on \n     system resource allocation within the Veterans Health \n     Administration. Such allocations would not be increased or \n     decreased during the period by more than 5 percent due to \n     this provision. The provision would take effect on October 1, \n     2002.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 202 would amend section 1722 of title 38, United \n     States Code, to include the HUD income index in determining \n     eligibility for treatment as a low-income family based upon \n     the veteran's permanent residence. The current national \n     threshold would remain in place as the base figure if the HUD \n     formula determines the low-income rate for a particular area \n     is actually less than that amount. The effective date of this \n     change would be January 1, 2002, and would apply to all means \n     tests after December 31, 2001, using data from the HUD index \n     at the time the means test is given.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 202 retains the current-law income threshold, but \n     would significantly reduce co-payments from veterans near the \n     threshold of poverty for acute VA hospital inpatient care. \n     The HUD low-income limits would be used to establish a family \n     income determination within the priority 7 group. Those \n     veterans with family incomes above the HUD income limits \n     for their primary residences would pay the co-payments as \n     otherwise required by law. Veterans whose family incomes \n     fall between the current income threshold level under \n     section 1722, title 38, United States Code, and the HUD \n     income limits level for the standard metropolitan \n     statistical area of their primary residences, would be \n     required to pay co-payments for inpatient care that are \n     reduced by 80 percent from co-payments required of \n     veterans with higher incomes. The effective date for this \n     change would be October 1, 2002.\n\n\n maintenance of capacity for specialized treatment and rehabilitative \n                       needs of disabled veterans\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1706 of title 38, United States Code, requires VA \n     to maintain nationwide capacity to provide for specialized \n     treatment and rehabilitative needs of disabled veterans, \n     including those with amputations, spinal cord injury or \n     dysfunction, traumatic brain injury, and severe, chronic, \n     disabling mental illnesses. To validate VA's compliance with \n     capacity maintenance, section 1706 includes a requirement for \n     an annual report to Congress. The reporting requirement \n     expired on April 1, 2001.\n     House Bill\n       Section 102 would modify the mandate for VA to maintain \n     capacity in specialized medical programs for veterans by \n     requiring the Department of each of its Veterans Integrated \n     Service Networks to maintain capacity in certain specialized \n     health care programs for veterans (those with serious mental \n     illness, substance-use disorders, spinal cord injuries and \n     dysfunction, the brain injured and blinded, and those who \n     need prosthetics and sensory aides); and, would extent the \n     capacity reporting requirement for 3 years.\n     Senate Bill\n       S. 1598 similarly would modify current law with regard to \n     VA's capacity for specialized services, but would require \n     that medical centers maintain capacity, in addition to \n     geographic service areas; require that VA utilize uniform \n     standards in the documentation of patient care workload used \n     to construct reports under the authority; require the \n     Inspector General on an annual basis to audit each geographic \n     service area and each medical center in the Veterans Health \n     Administration to ensure compliance with capacity \n     limitations; and, prohibit VA from substituting health care \n     outcome data to satisfy the requirement for maintenance of \n     capacity.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 203 is derived substantially from the House bill, \n     with addition of provisions from the Senate bill, including a \n     requirement that VA utilize uniform standards in the \n     documentation of workload; a clarification that ``mental \n     illness'' be defined to include post-traumatic stress \n     disorder (PTSD), substance-use disorder, and seriously and \n     chronically mentally ill services; a prohibition from \n     substituting outcome data to satisfy the requirement to \n     maintain capacity; and, a requirement that the IG audit and \n     certify to Congress as to the accuracy of VA's required \n     reports.\n\n\nprogram for the provision of chiropractic care and services to veterans\n\n     Current Law\n       Public Law 106-117 requires the VA to establish a Veterans \n     Health Administration-wide policy regarding chiropractic \n     care. Veterans Health Administration Directive 2000-014, \n     dated May 5, 2000, established such a policy.\n     House Bill\n       Title II would establish a national VA chiropractic \n     services program, implemented over a 5-year period; authorize \n     VA to employ chiropractors as federal employees and obtain \n     chiropractic services through contracts; establish an \n     advisory committee on chiropractic care; authorize \n     chiropractors to function as VA primary care providers; \n     authorize the appointment of a director of chiropractic \n     service reporting to the Secretary with the same authority as \n     other service directors in the VA health care system; and \n     provide for training and materials relating to chiropractic \n     services to Department health care providers.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 204 of the Senate Bill would establish a VA \n     chiropractic services program in VA health care facilities \n     and clinics in not less than 25 states. The chiropractic care \n     and services would be for neuro-musculoskeletal conditions, \n     including subluxation complex. The VA would carry out the \n     program through personal service contracts and appointments \n     of licensed chiropractors. Training and materials would be \n     provided to VA health care providers for the purpose of \n     familiarizing them with the benefits of chiropractic care and \n     services.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 204 would follow the Senate bill but would replace \n     its reference to 25 states\n\n[[Page S14080]]\n\n     with a reference to VA's 22 Veterans Integrated Service \n     Networks (referred to as ``geographic service areas'' in the \n     section). Also, the agreement would include an advisory \n     committee to assist the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in \n     implementation of the chiropractic program. Under the \n     agreement, the advisory committee would expire 3 years from \n     enactment.\n\n\n   funds for field offices of the office of research compliance and \n                            assurance (ORCA)\n\n     Current Law\n       The Under Secretary of Health has provided funding for ORCA \n     field offices from funds appropriated for Medical and \n     Prosthetic Research.\n     Senate Bill\n       Since field offices of ORCA directly protect patient \n     safety, section 205 would authorize VA to fund them from the \n     Medical Care appropriation.\n     House Bill\n       The House bill has no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 205 follows the Senate bill.\n       The Committees are concerned about the need for ORCA to \n     maintain independence from the Office of Research and \n     Development. The Committees have concluded, on the strength \n     of hearings and reports on potential conflicts of interest, \n     that funding for ORCA field offices should be statutorily \n     separated from the Medical and Prosthetic Research \n     Appropriation and associated with the Medical Care \n     Appropriation. ORCA advises the Under Secretary for Health on \n     matters affecting the integrity of research, the safety of \n     human-subjects research and research personnel, and the \n     welfare of laboratory animals used in VA biomedical research \n     and development. ORCA field offices investigate allegations \n     of research impropriety, lack of compliance with rules for \n     protection of research participants and scientific \n     misconduct. The ORCA chief officer reports to the Under \n     Secretary for Health.\n\n\n                  major medical facility construction\n\n     Current Law\n       None.\n     Senate Bill\n       Fiscal Year 2002 appropriations are available for an \n     emergency repair project at the VA Medical Center, Miami, \n     Florida. Section 205 of the Senate Bill authorizes $28.3 \n     million for this project, in accordance with section 8104 of \n     title 38, United States Code.\n     House Bill\n       The House bill has no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 206 follows the Senate Bill.\n\n\n      sense of congress on special telephone services for veterans\n\n     Current Law\n       None.\n     House Bill\n       Section 104 would require the Secretary to assess special \n     telephone services for veterans (such as help lines and \n     ``hotlines'') provided by the Department. The assessment \n     would include the geographic coverage, availability, \n     utilization, effectiveness, management, coordination, \n     staffing, and cost of those services. It would require the \n     assessment to include a survey of veterans to measure \n     satisfaction with current special telephone services, as well \n     as the demand for additional services. The Secretary would be \n     required to submit a report to Congress on the assessment \n     within 1 year of enactment.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 207 contains a Sense of the Congress Resolution on \n     the Department's need to assess and report on special \n     telephone services for veterans.\n\n\n recodification of bereavement counseling authority and certain other \n                       health-related authorities\n\n     Current Law\n       Chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code, contains \n     various legal authorities under which VA provides services to \n     non-veterans. These provisions, that authorize bereavement \n     and mental health counseling, care for research subjects, \n     care for dependents and survivors of permanently the totally \n     disabled veterans, and emergency humanitarian care, are \n     intermingled with authorities for the care of veterans in \n     various sections of chapter 17.\n     House Bill\n       Section 105 of the House bill would in a new subchapter \n     consolidate and reorganize without substantive change all of \n     the legal authorities under which VA provides services to \n     non-veterans. It would reorganize section 1701 of title 38, \n     United States Code, by transferring one provision (pertaining \n     to sensori-neural aids) to section 1707.\n       Section 105 would create a new Subchapter VIII in Chapter \n     17 of title 38, United States Code, to incorporate provisions \n     concerning bereavement-counseling services for family members \n     of certain veterans and active duty personnel. A new section \n     1782 would provide counseling, training, and mental health \n     services for immediate family members.\n       Section 105 would place in the new subchapter the current \n     dependent health care authorities known as ``Civilian Health \n     and Medical Programs--Veterans Affairs'' (CHAMPVA), \n     transferred from current section 1713 to the new section \n     1781. A new provision would specify that a dependent or \n     survivor receiving such VA-sponsored care would be eligible \n     for bereavement and other counseling and training and mental \n     health services otherwise available to family members under \n     the subchapter.\n       The existing authority to provide hospital care or medical \n     services as a humanitarian service in emergency cases would \n     be moved to this new subchapter from its current location in \n     section 1711(b).\n       Section 105 would also make various technical changes to \n     accommodate the subchapter reorganization. These changes \n     would recodify the existing provisions, and consolidate and \n     clarify the existing statutory authority to provide care to \n     non-veterans.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bill has no comparable provisions.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 208 follows the House bill.\n\n\n             extension of expiring collections authorities\n\n     Current Law\n       Sectiion 1710(f)(2)(B) of title 38, United States Code, \n     authorizes VA until September 30, 2002, to collect nursing \n     home, hospital, and outpatient co-payments from certain \n     veterans. Section 1729(a)(2)(E) of title 38, United States \n     Code, authorizes VA until October 1, 2002, to collect third-\n     party payments for the treatment of the nonservice-connected \n     disabilities of veterans with service-connected disabilities.\n     House Bill\n       Section 106 would extend until 2007 VA's authority to \n     collect means test co-payments and to collect third-party \n     payments.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 209 follows the House bill.\n\n\npersonal emergency response system for veterans with service-connected \n                              disabilities\n\n     Current Law\n       None.\n     House Bill\n       Section 107 of the House bill would require the Secretary \n     to carry out an evaluation and study of the feasibility and \n     desirability of providing a specialized personal emergency \n     response system for veterans with service-connected \n     disabilities. It would require a report to Congress on the \n     results of this evaluation.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 210 follows the House bill.\n\n\n               HEALTH CARE FOR PERSIAN GULF WAR VETERANS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1710 of title 38, United States Code, defines \n     eligible veterans for whom the Secretary is required to \n     furnish hospital, nursing home, and domiciliary care. Section \n     1710(e)(1)(C) of title 38 authorizes the Secretary to provide \n     health care services on a priority basis to veterans who \n     served in the Southwest Asia Theater of operations during the \n     Persian Gulf War. Section 1710(e)(3)(B) of title 38 specifies \n     that this eligibility expires on December 31, 2001.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bill would amend section 1710 of title 38, \n     United States Code, to extend health care eligibility for \n     veterans who served in Southwest Asia during the Gulf War, to \n     December 31, 2011.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 211 follows the Senate bill but extends the health \n     care eligibility to December 31, 2002.\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to S. 1888, which was introduced earlier today by Senator \nStevens.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1888) to amend title 18 of the United States \n     Code to correct a technical error in the codification of \n     title 36 of the United States Code.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on August 12th, 1998, the President \nsigned into law H.R. 1085, legislation ``to revise, codify, and enact \nwithout substantive change certain general and permanent laws, related \nto patriotic and national observances, ceremonies, and organizations, \nas title 36, United States Code, `Patriotic and National Observances, \nCeremonies, and Organizations.' '' This was legislation prepared by the \nOffice of Law Revision Counsel in the House of Representatives.\n  One of the organizations affected was the United States Olympic \nCommittee, whose numerical codification citation was changed in that \nre-codification legislation. The re-codification process also \nnecessitated certain conforming changes to other parts of the U.S. Code \nto modify cross-reference citations. One of these, occurring at 18 USCS \nSec. 2320 (e)(1)(B), was intended to cite a portion of the Ted Stevens \nOlympic and Amateur Sports Act dealing with protection of its \ntrademarks.\n  The proper citation should have been ``220506.'' However, because of \na typographical error that section of 18 USCS reads ``220706,'' citing \nlaw that has to do with Submarine Veterans of World War II rather than \nOlympic symbols and terminology.\n  This error went unnoticed until recently when U.S. Customs officials \nbrought it to the attention of Salt Lake Olympic Committee and USOC \nattorneys in a discussion of enforcing trademark protections associated \nwith the upcoming Olympic Winter Games. In this meeting the Customs \nofficials expressed concern that this error could prevent them from \nenforcing the law.\n  The Olympic Rings and other symbols were giving exclusively to the \nUSOC under the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act. They are the \nprime fund raising source for the USOC.\n  This would be a simple correction that would merely change ``220706'' \nto ``220506'' at 18 USCS Sec. 2320 (e)(1)(B).\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1400, and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nclerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1400) to amend the Illegal Immigration Reform \n     and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to extend the \n     deadline for aliens to present a border crossing card that \n     contains a biometric identifier matching the appropriate \n     biometric characteristic of the alien.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will pass an important piece of \nlegislation dealing with America's borders. This bill, S. 1400, has \nbipartisan support for extending the deadline requiring aliens to \npresent a border passing card with a biometric identifier to enter the \nUnited States from Mexico. This deadline expired earlier this year. The \nbill would extend the requirement by one year to allow the State \nDepartment to finish the difficult job of converting the old border \ncrossing cards used by Mexicans entering the United States.\n  This is a major task, and the State Department has already \naccomplished a great deal, issuing millions of new biometric border \ncrossing cards. As our State Department continues to work to finish \nthis task, however, we should not punish lawful Mexican workers who are \nstill waiting for new cards, or the American businesses that depend \nupon them as customers and employees.\n  This bill is one piece of major border security introduced by \nSenators Kennedy and Brownback. I am a proud cosponsor of their bill, \nS. 1749, the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act. We \nshould pass that bill in its entirety, and I hope that we do so before \nthe end of this session. In the meantime, we should pass S. 1400 \nwithout delay. This measure's original sponsors were Senator Kyl of \nArizona and Senator Brownback, the Ranking Republican on the \nImmigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. It is cosponsored \nby Senator Gramm, Senator Kennedy, Senator Bingaman, and Senator \nDomenici. I am glad to be able to accommodate them and urge prompt \naction by the Senate on this measure.\n  Mr. REID.

People around here \nwill be working until the wee hours of the morning. You and I may be \nhere late--the last two to leave the Senate--but they will arrive at \ntheir homes sometime tomorrow morning. The last time we did the Defense \nbill, I talked to one member of the staff who went home at 5 a.m. that \nmorning.\n  I want each of them to know that even though they do not get the \nrecognition that we get, their jobs are just as important as ours. We \nin effect couldn't do without them. Every day they do things that help \nmake us look as if we know what we are doing. Hopefully, we do most of \nthe time, but if we don't, they take care of things, point us in the \nright direction.\n  I am personally indebted to the help that each of these fine public \nservants give to the people of the State of Nevada, the people of West \nVirginia, and this country.\n  I want the record spread with my good wishes for a happy holiday.
