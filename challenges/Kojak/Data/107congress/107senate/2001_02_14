Mr. President, I understand my colleague from Wyoming \nwas talking today about the President's proposal on tax relief. I have \nbeen watching a little bit of the debate on the floor of the Senate. I \nhave to say, this debate is somewhat disturbing.\n  We have been discussing taking some of the money people have worked \nhard to earn and have sent here to Washington--and we have a surplus of \nmoney coming here now; we have a tax surplus for which people have \nworked hard, they have earned it, they have sent it to Washington, and \nwe have enough money to pay for all the bills we have right now--and \nnow we are talking about how can we take some of this money that people \nworked hard to earn and return it to them.\n  In the discussion and debate we hear some saying that people who are \npaying less in taxes are going to get less\n\n[[Page S1364]]\n\nmoney back in real dollars than people who pay a lot more in taxes are \ngoing to get back and that somehow is unfair. For example, if somebody \nwho pays $200 in income taxes is going to get tax relief of $200--in \nother words, many people under the proposal being put forward are going \nto simply have all of their tax liability eliminated. If they are \npaying $200 in taxes and they are going to get $200 in tax relief while \nsomeone who pays $300,000 in taxes is going to get $30,000 in tax \nrelief, somehow or another that is unfair; it is unfair that this one \nperson who is a hard-working person is only going to get $200 under \nthis proposal and some fat cat is going to get $30,000, and that is \nunfair.\n  So we see pictures: Here is what the fat cat is going to get, here is \nwhat the poor working person is going to get, and that is not fair. \nExcept for the fact, if you step back and say, wait a minute, how much \nis this person who is paying a lot of taxes--how much are they paying \nand what is their relief versus what someone who has a lower income is \npaying and what is their relief? If we were going to balance this \naccording to fairness as described by some, then there should be equal \ntax relief, even though there is not equal payment of taxes.\n  When a surplus is created because people have overpaid taxes and we \nwant to relieve the tax burden on those who have overpaid, then I think \nfairness dictates we give tax relief to everybody who has contributed \nto the overpayment somewhat in proportion to what they have overpaid. \nThat, to me, would be fair.\n  What would be unfair is for someone who pays $200 in taxes to get \n$20,000 in tax relief as opposed to someone who pays $300,000 in taxes \nto get $300 in tax relief. Some would suggest that is fair. I suggest \nthat is typical Washington wealth redistribution because we know who \nthe more deserving are here in Washington.\n  What we are putting forward is as fair as we could possibly do it. In \nfact, if you look at the numbers, the top income earners and the top \ntaxpayers in this country are going to end up with an increased burden \nof taxes. If you look at all the people paying taxes and whose share of \nthe tax burden is going to go up after this proposal if it is passed as \nthe President suggested, the tax burden on the higher income people \nwill actually go up relative to everybody else.\n\n  Some would argue that is unfair. Some would argue that we are not \ngiving enough tax relief to those who are higher income to keep the \ndistribution of who pays taxes the same. But we are shifting the \ndistribution to higher income.\n  We are going to hear lots of arguments about fairness. I always use \nthis example--I think it is the best example--between what we are \ntrying to accomplish and what some on the other side would suggest is \nfair.\n  I use the example of people who buy tickets to a baseball game. You \npay and the game gets rained out. It is the last game of the year, so \nthey have to refund your money. There are people who paid different \nprices for different seats in the baseball stadium. Some paid for the \nseats right down in front, maybe $25 a ticket. Then you paid for some \nup here in the loge boxes, maybe $15 a ticket. And then there are some \nfolks up here in the outfield and they paid $5 a ticket. The game got \nrained out. So what do the owners of the baseball team have to do? They \nhave to refund your money. You have overpaid. But you didn't get what \nyou were promised. You overpaid. Get your money back.\n  What I would suggest as fair is, people who pay the $25 get $25 back, \npeople who pay the $15 get $15 back, and people who pay $5 get $5 back. \nThe guy outside who just happened to be driving by and didn't buy a \nticket does not get any.\n  To some on the other side of the aisle, here is what they believe is \nfair. The guy who paid $25 gets $5; because he obviously can afford \n$25, he doesn't need all of the money returned. It is the guy up there \nwho paid $5 who probably needs more money, and not only are we going to \ngive him $5 but we are going to give him $15 back. The guy in the \nmiddle who paid $15, we will give him $15. We feel so bad about the guy \noutside who didn't get a chance to pay and come in that we are going to \ngive him some money, too.\n  Is that fair? No. I do not know of an owner of a baseball team who \ncould get away with something like that. It is patently unfair to do it \nthat way. I think most Americans would agree that is fundamentally \nunfair. That is what we were talking about. For people who have paid a \ntremendous amount of money for which they have worked hard, we are \nsuggesting they get back somewhat in proportion to what they paid as \nwell as everybody else.\n  In fact, we are not suggesting that. We are suggesting they not get \nback quite as much proportionately, but we do in fact shift it. If you \nare going to take the example of the baseball stadium, instead of \ngiving $25 back, they get $20 back. The guy paying $15 maybe gets $17 \nback, and the guy up here, instead of getting $5 back, may get $8 or \n$10 back.\n  There are those who would suggest that is unfair. I would suggest \nthat is more than fair. For the folks who are paying the $25 for the \nticket, some would suggest it is unfair to them. It is more disturbing \nif we look at the underlying motive behind this discussion. It really \nis a discussion that I think is not really worthy of us in Congress; \nthat is, this idea of class warfare; that somehow or another, if you \nhave worked hard and you have been successful starting a business or \ncreating a company, if you have tremendous capital talent as a great \nsinger or a great athlete--whatever the case may be--and you have been \nsuccessful financially, somehow or another that is bad and you should \nbe punished and should be paying exorbitantly more than people who have \nnot been as successful.\n\n  Obviously, there is a small group of people who are very wealthy in \nthis country. It is very small--about 4 percent. It is a lot more \npopular to go out and argue for the folks who are in the middle class, \nthe large majority of Americans. We say: We are for you, and we are \ngoing to give you more money in this tax relief. Under the Bush \nproposal, they get proportionately more money. But somehow they argue \nthey are undeserving: They pay the vast majority of taxes, but they \nneed to pay more, and they don't deserve relief because they have \nmoney. I don't think that is necessarily an enobling argument.\n  I think the argument President Bush puts forth that no one in America \nshould pay more than one dollar out of every three to the Federal \nGovernment in taxes is a statement with which most Americans would \nagree. Right now, higher income individuals pay about 40 percent of \nevery dollar they earn in Federal taxes, not to mention other taxes \nthey have to pay. When we have a surplus and the surplus has been \ngenerated by the fact that a lot of people have overpaid their taxes, \nmy feeling is, what is unfair if you give every taxpayer tax relief?\n  To the extent we can, yes, we should help others. There are going to \nbe proposals you are going to see considered to give people relief who \ndidn't get in the stadium and pay for the ticket. They will get some \nrelief, if you will. Even though they did not pay, they are going to \nget some money out of this. Why? Because we want to create more \nopportunity for people so someday they get inside the stadium.\n  We would like everybody to pay taxes in the sense that everybody \nwould be economically successful, and enough that they would be in a \ntax bracket that would require it. We are about providing \nopportunities. We are also about fairness. I think that dictates that \nwe provide tax relief across the board to those who pay.\n  The other thing we should think about when we put a tax bill together \nis: What are we trying to accomplish? What is the goal? Obviously, as I \nstated before, we have too much money. I would like to get it out of \nWashington before we spend it.\n  There are those of us who come to the floor year after year to say if \nwe don't give tax relief, and if we don't get this money out of \nWashington, rest assuredly it will be spent. Just at the end of last \nyear, we added to the 10-year budget of the United States $600 billion \nin new spending. I did not hear a word from those who now say we don't \nneed tax relief and who have suggested we were spending the surplus \nthat we didn't have. We hear a lot of people say we can't do tax relief \nbecause we don't know that the surplus is going to be\n\n[[Page S1365]]\n\nthere and therefore we shouldn't commit ourselves to this relief. They \ndid not make that complaint when we were talking about spending the \n$600 billion surplus that we didn't have last year.\n\n  I argue that if the money stays in Washington and we don't provide \ntax relief, the money will be spent, as sure as anything I can promise. \nIt will be spent if it sits on the table. We just can't help ourselves. \nI think it is important to get that money back out. Why would we want \nto do that other than just do it so we don't spend it?\n  We have heard lots of reports about what the economy looks like now \nand in the future. We have had an unprecedented string of years of \neconomic growth. But I think it is important, as several other \neconomists said--and Alan Greenspan--that in the future to avoid an \neconomic slowdown we have lower rates of taxation and more money in the \neconomy for investment and job creation.\n  By the way, who is creating the jobs? We have heard many times some \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talking about not \nhaving to provide tax relief for higher income individuals. But who \ncreates the jobs? The employer. They seem to like employees but hate \nemployers. I do not know of too many employees who find jobs if there \nare not employers. Providing tax relief to people who will take that \nincome and go out, as some have suggested, and buy a Lexus--if you are \nearning $2 million or $3 million a year, you already have a Lexus, if \nyou want one. But they will go out and take that money and invest it to \ncreate jobs, and create opportunities so we can take some of those \npeople outside the stadium who didn't have the chance to buy the ticket \nand give them a job so they can become taxpayers.\n  It is important not just to get the money out of Washington, but it \nis also vitally important to help our economy and create economic \nopportunities for people who need economic opportunities down the road.\n  There are some other things we need to do, again in the name of \nfairness. There is a lot of discussion about fairness. The President's \nproposal is that we have marriage penalty relief. It is unconscionable \nthat on Valentine's Day there are people in America who will get \nmarried and, by virtue of the fact that they get married, have to pay \nmore in income taxes. At a time when we want to encourage marriage \nthrough the Tax Code, we penalize it. That is unconscionable and \nunfair. Under the President's proposal, we go a long way to eliminating \nthat marriage penalty.\n  Mr. President, death should not be a taxable event, but it is. What \nwe are suggesting is that over a 10-year period of time we phase out \nestate taxes on people who die. I think most Americans would agree that \nif someone has a piece of property and they die and pass it on to the \nnext generation, when that next generation sells the property, they \nshould be taxed on the capital gains. But if in fact the person dies, \nit should not be a taxable event on the next generation. The greatest \nimpact of that is on the family farm, the small business man or \nbusiness woman when they want to pass that business on to the next \ngeneration after they die. They have to sell the farm or the business \nso they can pay the taxes that are due.\n\n  Whom does that hurt? Obviously, it hurts the businessperson. But how \nabout the people who work for that business, where that business has to \ngo out of business simply to pay taxes or where the business has to be \nsold simply to pay taxes.\n  So, again, it is the old story. Most Americans realize this. When you \nstand up here and say: ``We are going to go after and get the rich, we \nare going to make sure they pay even more and more and more taxes,'' \nultimately who gets hurt is the people at the bottom and the middle \nbecause they do not get the quality jobs or they do not get the kind of \nstrong economy that makes for a better quality of life.\n  So I think what we are talking about here is tax relief for every \ntaxpayer. Some suggest that is not fair. I would suggest that is the \nonly fair way to do it; when you have a tax surplus, you give it back \nin proportion to how much the people paid. That, to me, would be fair.\n  If you think your job is to not be fair but to redistribute wealth--\nthat is the object here, to redistribute the wealth based upon who we \nbelieve, in Washington, are more deserving. Let's be clear about it; \nthat is what we are doing. We are saying some people are more deserving \nthan others, and we are going to choose to take some people who worked \nhard, earned this money, sent it to Washington--we are going to take \ntheir money and give it to other people because we believe that is \nfair. We do a lot of that already. But now we are suggesting, because \nthere is an overpayment, here is an opportunity to do more of that.\n  I argue that is not what we should take advantage of. We should take \nthe opportunity to create an across-the-board, fair tax reduction for \nevery working American, every taxpayer.\n  So that is what the debate is going to be about. I hope we will look \nat the underlying policy of why we are trying to do this, not just here \nis how much X gets and here is how much Y gets but look at the \nunderlying policy: Are we trying to pass tax relief that is going to \naccomplish economic growth? If so, how do we best do that? Let's have a \ndiscussion about that.\n  Are we trying to eliminate provisions in the Tax Code that are \nunfair, such as the marriage penalty and the death tax? I argue that \nthe alternative minimum tax has become unfair on a lot of middle class, \nworking Americans who now have to pay that tax.\n  If we look at it and we take it a step at a time, we will deal with \nthe fairness issue. Let's take care of that issue, and then let's try \nto do something across the board that does something for economic \ngrowth; we must have as part of our agenda not just fairness but growth \nbecause the ultimate equalizer, if you will, the ultimate creator of \nopportunity, is economic growth.\n  I believe that unless we do something to create a tax system that \nenables more economic growth in the future, then a lot of folks to whom \nwe are going to shift a little money--as some suggest, that you take \nfrom higher income and give it to lower income--they are going to find \nthemselves either in lower paying jobs down the road or with no jobs. \nThat is not a good result for anybody.\n  So again, let's keep our eye on the ball. Yes, get the money out of \nWashington; yes, provide some tax fairness; but also, let's make sure \nwe do a tax reduction that is going to result in a growing economy over \nthe long term. That, to me, dictates, as Alan Greenspan said yesterday, \na rate reduction. The best way to assure economic growth is an across-\nthe-board rate reduction.\n\n  So if what we care about is avoiding a deep recession or a recession \naltogether in the next 3 or 4 or 5 years, the best way to accomplish \nthat is a rate reduction for all taxpayers.\n  One other point. Some have mentioned what we are talking about here \nis Federal income taxes: You have a lot of taxpayers who have to pay \nFICA taxes and Medicare taxes, and they are not getting any tax relief.\n  I would make two comments on that. No. 1, FICA taxes or Social \nSecurity taxes, when they are paid, obviously, fund a program, the \nSocial Security program, or the Medicare program in the case of \nMedicare taxes. But they also make you eligible for a benefit. The \nbenefit is so structured today where lower income individuals get a \nmuch higher percentage benefit than higher income individuals. So the \nprogram is already structured, No. 1, that you pay the tax to assure a \nbenefit down the road.\n  So it is not like income taxes, where you just sort of pay the tax \nand it goes to the general welfare. But this actually earns you, if you \nwill, a particular benefit. It is the same with Medicare. So you are \ngetting something directly for you for the dollars you are \ncontributing.\n  Secondly, we are paying too much in Social Security taxes now. We \nhave a surplus. Some of us have argued--and I will continue to argue--\ninstead of bidding up what I consider to be a phony surplus, with just \nbasically IOUs in the Social Security trust fund, which are future \nobligations for taxpayers, and nothing more than that, I would suggest \nwe take this surplus and allow younger workers to invest that money, to \ncreate real opportunities for them so they can have real money, real \nassets that can pay real benefits 20, 30, 40\n\n[[Page S1366]]\n\nyears from now, instead of creating IOUs which are simply a claim on \ntheir children's taxes 30 years from now or 40 years from now. And that \nwould not be a real economic asset; it would simply be a real economic \nobligation of future generations.\n  I argue that the better way to accomplish that, instead of overtaxing \ncurrent workers, which we do with Social Security and Medicare--I am \ngoing to focus on Social Security right now--instead of overtaxing \nSocial Security payers, people who pay Social Security taxes today, \nlet's give them the opportunity of setting that money aside, investing \nit over the long term, accumulating assets, and then using that real \nasset--a real economic asset--to come back 30 years from now to help \npay for those benefits. That would be instead of, in a sense, putting \nthat IOU away.\n  I will use this as an example. I think it is a good example. I went \nto a group of high school students the other day, and I asked: How many \nof you out here work? About half the hands went up. I asked: Where do \nyou work? One kid said: Burger King. I said: Right now you work at \nBurger King, and you have to pay Social Security taxes. And 12.4 \npercent is what the Social Security tax is. You pay 12.4 percent, but \nall that money does not go to pay benefits. That is what it \ntraditionally has done. All the money would go right out to pay \nbenefits. But in this case, you are paying more than you need to.\n  You only need to pay a little over 10 percent to pay for current \nbeneficiaries. Money comes in, goes out to beneficiaries, but we have a \nsurplus, a little over 2 percent. So you pay more than you need to now. \nSo we are taking more money out of your paycheck than we need.\n\n  What do we do with that surplus money in Social Security? Social \nSecurity has cash. Can Social Security hold cash? It would be a smart \nthing for them to do. No. They have to invest that money. Where do you \nthink they invest the money? Treasury bonds. What are Treasury bonds? \nDebt of the Federal Government.\n  So Social Security gives money to the general fund, and the general \nfund puts a note back into Social Security. It is an IOU. It is a \nTreasury bond that pays interest.\n  Now let's talk about that 18-year-old 30 years from now. Thirty years \nfrom now, that 18-year-old is still paying taxes. He is 48 years old. \nThen, instead of having a surplus in Social Security, we have a \ndeficit. So then what we will have to do is raise Federal taxes because \nwe will have to start repaying those bonds. We have to put the money \nback into Social Security.\n  So what are we going to have to do? Thirty years from now, we are \ngoing to go to that person who paid too much in taxes in the first \nplace to create the IOU, and now we are going to have to increase their \ntaxes so they can pay back the IOU they created by paying too much \ntaxes in the first place. So they get to pay twice for this benefit. \nThat is not fair.\n  So I think we do need to create personal retirement accounts. That is \none way we can solve the problem of Social Security taxes.\n  The Senator from Colorado is here, and I am happy to yield the floor \nto him.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about our national \nsecurity and defense. This is the week the President has decided to \nemphasize defense. I will take a moment to review briefly where we are \nas far as the National Missile Defense Program is concerned. Before I \ndo that, I will lay out a few things for the record.\n  First, this week the President has decided to talk about quality of \nlife. He has emphasized the fact that soldiers enlist, but families \nreenlist, trying to address the problems we have with retention in our \nmilitary services. I wholeheartedly agree with him in his efforts. He \nhas made tremendous strides in that direction, when he says he will go \nahead and try to promote the idea that we need to have a military pay \nraise, renovate standard housing, improve military training, and review \noverseas deployments to reduce family separations.\n  The President also has recognized the concept of a citizen soldier. I \ncan relate to that. I like to think of myself as a citizen legislator. \nThese are individuals who have regular jobs but take a spell from those \njobs to serve our country. That is our National Guard and Reserve \ntroops, and States play an important role. The National Government \nplays an important role to make sure these citizen soldiers are readily \navailable in time of national emergency to serve our country and its \ndefense.\n  The third item he has talked about is the transformation of the \nmilitary to a stronger, more agile, modern military, which has both \nstealth and speed.\n  I think we also need to rethink our vulnerabilities and the time to \ndo it is now. We need to rethink our strength, and the time to do it is \nnow, while we are transitioning from one administration to another. \nThere is no doubt in my mind that for the last 8 years our defense \nstructure in this country suffered intolerably. It is time we made very \nsignificant changes. I support the idea that we need to increase \nspending for defense.\n  As we look at our vulnerabilities and strengths, we certainly need to \nbase our thinking on the new technology that we have and what the \nfuture is for the development of that new technology. We need to think \nabout the future threat from potential adversaries. We need to work \ntoward the idea of more peace and more freedom through renewed strength \nand renewed security. Based on all of that, we have to control the high \nground. I think that is as true today as it was two or three centuries \nago. Controlling the high ground is very important in the field of \nbattle.\n  I am a strong proponent of looking at an enhanced role for space. We \nmust think in terms of a space platform. By controlling that high \nground, we would secure all our forces and secure our national defense \nsystem. I believe the technology is very close, where we can move \nforward with some very significant steps in enhancing, in a modern way, \nour defense systems in America.\n  I want to take a little time while I have the floor to review the \nbackground of our National Missile Defense System--a step in that \ndirection--and review a little bit about where I see we are today.\n  First of all, on the National Missile Defense System, I think we \nought to quit referring to it as the ``national'' missile defense \nsystem. I think we need to refer to it as our missile defense system \nand get away from the vagueness of trying to identify a theater missile \ndefense system and a national missile defense system. I think, from a \nforeign relations standpoint, when we use the term ``national,'' it \nimplies it is just for America. We are putting together a missile \ndefense system, hopefully, that will secure world peace. I think we \nneed to keep that in mind when we talk about what we are going to do to \nenhance our missile defense system.\n  In my discussion this morning on defense and the National Missile \nDefense System, I am just going to refer to it as the missile defense \nsystem.\n  Starting back in 1995, the Republican Congress consistently pressured \nthe Clinton administration to make a commitment to deploy a national \nmissile defense system. In 1995, then-President Clinton vetoed the \nDefense Authorization Act over its establishment of a national missile \ndefense deployment policy.\n\n[[Page S1367]]\n\n  Then, in 1998, the Rumsfeld report, now-Secretary of Defense \nRumsfeld, said that a ballistic missile threat to the U.S. was \n``broader, more mature and evolving more rapidly'' than the \nIntelligence Community had been reporting prior to that. The report \nalso stated that:\n\n       The warning times the U.S. can expect of new, threatening \n     ballistic missile deployments are being reduced . . . the \n     U.S. might well have little or no warning before operational \n     deployment.\n\n  That is what our current Secretary of Defense was saying.\n  Then, in 1999, the National Intelligence Council warned that:\n\n       The probability that a WMD armed missile will be used \n     against the U.S. forces or interests is higher today than \n     during most of the Cold War.\n\n  That was made in 1999 by the National Intelligence Council.\n  In 1999, finally, the President signed the National Missile Defense \nAct of 1999--referred to around here as the Cochran bill--which \nrequires deployment of a national missile defense system ``as soon as \ntechnologically possible.'' That is the key--``as soon as \ntechnologically possible.''\n  Even though the administration funded the National Missile Defense \nAcquisition Program, President Clinton never committed the United \nStates to actual deployment. So in September of last year, 2000, \nPresident Clinton decided to defer a deployment decision to the next \nadministration.\n  Having laid out that background, I want to talk about where we are \ntoday. The current missile defense system is preparing to deploy a \nsingle ground-based site in Alaska, with a threshold capacity of 20 \ninterceptor missiles in fiscal years 2005-2006, and 100 interceptors in \nfiscal years 2007-2008. That is the current plan. This is referred to \nas the initial stage. This would be upgraded, and a second ground-based \nsite would be deployed to deal with more complex and numerous threats \nin the fiscal year 2010-2011 timeframe.\n  This stand-alone, ground-based approach is inadequate really to \nsatisfy U.S. global security requirements. Nonetheless, the most \naffordable and most effective path to a global ballistic missile \ndefense system is to augment the current missile defense program rather \nthan replace it.\n  Now, the current ground-based missile defense program has made \nsignificant technical progress and offers the earliest deployment \noptions. Once this system is deployed, it will offer an ``open \narchitecture.'' This is very important. It offers an ``open \narchitecture'' that can be augmented with ground-based, sea-based, and/\nor space-based systems as they mature and are demonstrated. So we leave \nthe door open for technological advances so we can build upon the \nstructure we are initially going to lay out there.\n  I will reemphasize that this is a defense structure, not offensive; \nit is a defense system. Frankly, I don't understand the opposition from \nmany of our allies to a system that is defensive in nature. I think \nthey ultimately will share in that technology because it will assure \nthat we have a safer world.\n  The key to deploying an effective missile defense architecture is a \nlayered system that is deployed in phases. A top priority should be the \nprompt establishment of programs to develop the sea-based and then the \nspace-based elements that can be added to the initial system when they \nare ready.\n  The sea-based missile defense elements should be based on the \nexisting Navy Theater Wide (NTW) Theater Missile Defense Program. The \nNTW Program will need to be augmented, both in terms of funding and \ntechnical capability. The interceptor missiles are not sufficiently \ncapable to perform the missile defense mission. Therefore, the \nDepartment of Defense should consider a phased approach to the NTW, \nwhich involves initial deployment of a system for long-range TMD and \nlimited missile defense applications, and then upgrade to a more \ndedicated sea-based missile defense capability in the future.\n  The development of a strategy for dealing with the ABM Treaty is as \nimportant as the technical/architectural issues mentioned above. The \nUnited States will need to determine whether it wants to pursue \nmodifications to the treaty or seek a completely new arrangement. Any \neffort at incrementally amending the treaty will involve many of the \nsame problems the Clinton Administration experienced with Russia and \nour allies.\n  The current acquisition cost, including prior years, for the initial \nground-based National Missile Defense system (with 100 interceptor \nmissiles) is $20.3 billion. The average annual cost for R and \nProcurement is approximately $2.0-2.5 billion. Ballistic Missile \nDefense Organization is also recommending a significant increase to \nenhance its flight test program and its efforts to deal with counter-\nmeasures, which could increase the overall Missile Defense cost by \nseveral billion dollars. The Navy has estimated that an initial sea-\nbased National Missile Defense capability could be deployed in 5-8 \nyears for $4-6 billion; an intermediate capability could be deployed in \n8-10 years for $7-10 billion; and a far-term capability, involving \ndedicated Missile Defense ships and missiles, could be deployed in 10-\n15 years for $13-16 billion. Note that the Navy estimates assume that \nthe ground-based National Missile Defense infrastructure is in place. \nWithout this infrastructure, the Navy would have to add radars, space-\nbased sensors, battle management, and command and control to their cost \nestimates.\n  There are many issues before Congress and this administration \nconcerning our missile defense system and they are the following:\n  We need to establish a policy for ballistic missile defense \nreflecting the current global security environment.\n  We need to illuminate the path ahead regarding the ABM Treaty.\n  We need to redefine the relationship between ballistic missile \ndefense and strategic forces.\n  We need to establish a global missile defense as a new ballistic \nmissile defense paradigm.\n  We need to deemphasize the distinction between national missile \ndefense and theater missile defense.\n  We need an integrated missile defense architecture and operational \nconcept.\n  We need to have a layered approach to ballistic missile defense \nstarting with land, sea, and space in the future.\n  Our greatest challenge is overcoming 8 years of funding inadequacy. \nIn the fiscal years 1994 through 1999, Secretary Cheney at that time \nenvisioned $7 billion to $8 billion SDI budgets.\n  We have a great opportunity before us. I think most Americans like \nmost of President Bush's major proposals. A Newsweek poll found 56 \npercent approved of his plan for a missile defense system.\n  Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said no President could \nallow a situation in which ``extinction of civilized life is one's only \nstrategy.''\n  The New York Times reports today that Russian President Putin and \nGermany's Foreign Minister Fischer discussed the proposed American \nmissile defense at a Kremlin meeting yesterday, ending 2 days of talks \nthat Mr. Fischer said pointed to new Russian flexibility on the notion \nof a shield against rogue missiles. Mr. Fischer told reporters: ``In \nthe end, I think Russia will accept negotiations.''\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee has met with the British foreign \nminister and discussed this. A nuclear missile defense will benefit the \nworld. Only our aggressors, I believe, need fear our missile defense \ntechnology.\n  Robert L. Bartley says in today's Wall Street Journal: ``The \ndeliberate vulnerability of `mutual assured destruction' carries an \nappropriate acronym, MAD.''\n  In the end, with the cold war over, we should look beyond the cold \nwar rules and to the unpredictable future and weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I reemphasize that I believe we need to rethink our vulnerabilities \nand our strengths based on our new technology and based on the future \nthreat from potential adversaries. Our goal should be more peace and \nmore freedom through renewed strength and a renewed security, and we \naccomplish that by establishing control of the high-ground.\n  Technology is the key, and we need to be sure we are willing to put \nour dollars and our brain power behind the idea that we will move \nforward with a strong defense system which will, in the long run, \nassure continued world peace.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1368]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1368-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1368-S1369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PATIENT PROTECTION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, for too long the law has been on the \nside of HMO's and big insurance companies. It is time we give power \nback to patients and families and doctors. Nearly every one of us has \nhad some sort of bad experience with an HMO or an insurance company, \neither personally or through a family member or a friend. Sometimes the \nproblems are frustrating, sometimes the problem is just red tape and \nbureaucracy, sometimes it is simply impersonal treatment.\n  Sometimes the problems are much more serious than that. Sometimes the \nproblems are dangerous: when an HMO, for example, refuses to authorize \na visit to a specialist or the nearest emergency room, or denies \ntreatment that is desperately needed by a patient, or refuses to be \nheld accountable for any of the decisions it makes. Americans have the \nright to expect that decisions about their health care and their \nfamily's health care will only be made by the patient, in consultation \nwith physicians and family members, and that physicians will be able to \nhelp them make those decisions on the basis of the patient's best \nmedical interests. Those decisions should not be made by HMOs and \ninsurance companies concerned only about the bottom line.\n  That is why we need a Patients' Bill of Rights. That is why last week \nI joined Senator John McCain, along with a bipartisan group of Members \nof the House and the Senate, to introduce a bill that builds on the \nprogress that has already been made in this Congress to pass a \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  The Bipartisan Patient Protection Act provides comprehensive patient \nprotection for all Americans. It will, No. 1, guarantee access to \nspecialists for all people who have private insurance, so that women, \nfor example, can go directly to an OB/GYN or a child can go directly to \na pediatrician for care. No. 2, it strengthens the right to go to an \nemergency room, to the ER, immediately after an emergency arises, \nwithout first having to be concerned about calling some 1-800 number \nand asking permission from an insurance company or an HMO.\n  When a family is involved in a medical emergency, the last thing they \nneed to be worried about is calling the insurance company. They need to \nbe able to do what is best for their family and go immediately to the \nemergency room that is closest to them. Our bill provides for that.\n  We also eliminate the gag rule. What we need to do is give doctors \nthe ability to speak freely with their patients about the treatment \noptions that ought to be considered by the patient. What we have done \nis prohibit clauses between insurance companies and doctors--the so-\ncalled ``gag rule''--that restrict doctors from talking to their \npatients about the various treatment options, and instead only allow \ndoctors to talk about the cheapest treatment options. We prohibit that \npractice and prohibit gag rules.\n\n  Scope. Our bill covers every single American who has private \ninsurance through an HMO or an insurance company. Some of my colleagues \nhave argued, during the course of the debate about a real Patients' \nBill of Rights, for a more limited approach. I do not agree. I believe \nevery single American who has health insurance or receives coverage \nthrough an HMO deserves, and is entitled to, exactly the same rights. \nThe same basic rights and freedoms that we provide for some people \nought to be available for every single American who has HMO or health \ninsurance coverage.\n  Make no mistake, in States like Texas where strong protections \nalready exist under State law, the State's own efforts in this area \nshould be respected. Under our bill, if the State law is comparable or \nmore protective of patients than those we enact here in the Congress, \nState law will remain in effect.\n  In most cases, HMOs and other health care providers respect the \ndecisions that are made by patients and doctors. This is usually not a \nproblem. The people get the treatment they are entitled to, the \ntreatment their doctor recommends, and they get better. But if the \npatient or the doctor believes that the quality of their health care \nmay be at risk because of what the HMO is doing, because of some \nbureaucrats sitting behind a desk somewhere who decides that they know \nbetter what care or treatment the patient should receive, that they \nknow better than the doctor or specialist who is taking care of the \npatient, then we need to provide some way for the patient to appeal \nthat decision.\n  What we have done here is provide an alternative recourse whenever \nthe HMO or insurance company decides that coverage for treatment should \nbe denied. Under existing law, the HMO's decision is final. If the HMO, \nno matter what its reasoning for the decision is, decides that this \ncare, this treatment--for example, that a sick child should not be able \nto go directly to a pediatric oncologist--the patient, the family, the \nchild can do nothing. The HMO holds all the power. The law is \ncompletely on the side of the HMO and the insurance company, and \npatients are left totally defenseless.\n  What we are doing today, through this legislation, is putting \naccountability back into the system so that, like all other Americans, \nHMO's are held accountable for what they do.\n  As a first resort, patients are guaranteed both an internal and an \nexternal appeals process. If they go to an HMO and the HMO says that \nthey won't pay for a particular treatment or a particular doctor, \npatients have a place to go to appeal. All patients will have a right \nto appeal treatment denials to an external review authority with \noutside medical experts, which is critical. The independence of the \nappeals process is crucial. We have provided for extensive protections \nto ensure that the independence is in fact there. Once the appeal is \nmade and the independent board decides that coverage should have been \nprovided, the decision is final and binding on the HMO or the insurance \ncompany.\n  As a matter of last resort--and I emphasize last resort--if the HMO \nhas denied coverage, and the appeals process fails, the patients should \nhave the ability to go to court.\n  I want to emphasize that the ability to go to court is a matter of \nabsolute last resort. For example, in States such as Texas that have \nenacted legislation--about 3 years ago, Texas enacted legislation \nproviding patients the right to go to court--experience has proven that \nactual litigation virtually never happens. It does not happen for a \nvery practical reason: because, first of all, the HMO has to deny \ncoverage; second, there is an internal review and appeal process; and \nthird, there is an external appeal process to an independent body. So \nit is a very rare circumstance where anybody feels the need to go to \ncourt. In States such as Texas that have enacted patient protection \nlegislation, there have been very few lawsuits filed.\n  What the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act does is ensure that \nmedical judgment cases go to State court. The basic reasoning here is \nthat if the HMO or the insurance company is making a medical judgment, \nif they make the decision that they are going to insert their judgment \nin the place of the physician or the health care provider, then \nnormally those are cases that are decided in State court, under State \nlaw, using State standards. Our belief is that the HMO, if they are \ngoing to exercise medical judgment, if they are going to substitute \ntheir own judgment for the judgment of the doctor involved, ought to be \nsubject to the same standards to which doctors are subject. If a case \nwere brought against a doctor for exercising his or her medical \njudgment, that case would go to State court.\n  What we have provided here is simple: when the HMO steps in and \ninserts itself into the process of exercising medical judgment, their \ncase goes to State court just as a medical negligence case would go to \nState court. We should not preempt State law. State law has \ntraditionally controlled these kinds of cases. Under our bill, the law \nthat the Governor at the time--now President Bush--enacted in Texas, \nthe HMO protection law would be respected, as would HMO patient \nprotection laws that exist all over the country. So essentially what we \nare doing\n\n[[Page S1369]]\n\nin our legislation is deferring almost entirely to the oversight of \nmedical judgment that has traditionally been regulated by State law.\n  I point out that the Judicial Conference of the United States has \nspoken on this issue. The Chief Justice of the United States, Chief \nJustice Rehnquist, is the presiding officer of the Judicial Conference \nof the United States.\n  The Judicial Conference, through its executive committee, adopted the \nfollowing position on February 10, 2000:\n\n       The Judicial Conference urges Congress to provide that in \n     any managed care legislation agreed upon--\n\n  This is the legislation we are talking about today--\n\n     that State courts be the primary forum for the resolution of \n     personal injury claims arising from the denial of health care \n     benefits.\n\n  The Judicial Conference of the United States, a nonpartisan, \nnonpolitical body headed by the Chief Justice, decided that cases \ninvolving medical judgment should go to State court. These types of \ncases have been traditionally resolved in State court.\n  Federal courts, of course, are courts of limited jurisdiction. And \nthese are not cases that should go to Federal court. Our bill does \nexactly what the Judicial Conference, headed by our Chief Justice, has \nrecommended. It sends these cases to the place where they have \ntraditionally been decided.\n  Contract cases, based solely on what the terms of the contract are--\nfor example, if there were a provision requiring that insurance \ncoverage be in place for 60 days before payment can be made for any \nparticular treatment--if there were a dispute about whether 60 days had \nactually passed, or whether the coverage or the contract applies, that \nwould be an interpretation of the contract and would go to Federal \ncourt. In those limited cases where there is a dispute about the actual \nlanguage of the contract, those cases go to Federal court.\n  There are limitations contained in our bill about any recovery in \nFederal court. The basic structure here is simple: medical judgment \ncases, where the HMO is inserting its judgment for that of the health \ncare provider, go to State court. Cases that have always traditionally \nbeen decided in State court go to State court, just as our Chief \nJustice in the Judicial Conference is recommending. The only cases that \ngo to Federal court, a court of limited jurisdiction, are cases \ninvolving pure interpretation of the contract--cases that have \nhistorically been decided in Federal court under ERISA. So they \nessentially maintain the same bifurcation that the U.S. Supreme Court \nsuggested.\n  We have included a balanced approach and imposed some limitations. \nUnder our bill, there are no class actions. Appeals have to be \nexhausted, except for the very rare circumstance where the patient can \nshow an immediate and irreparable harm. In all other cases, internal \nand external appeals have to be exhausted before a patient can go to \ncourt.\n  Third, the vast majority of cases go to State court and are therefore \nsubject to whatever State court limitations apply. For example, the \nlimitations that exist under State law in Texas would apply to cases \nthat go to State court in Texas.\n  We are attempting to balance interests and create really meaningful \nand enforceable rights for the patient, giving the patient the ability \nto enforce those rights through an appeals process, and then, as a \nmatter of absolute last resort--and as history has proven, it happens \nvery rarely--giving them the right to take the HMO to state court, \nwhere these kinds of cases are traditionally decided.\n  We have debated this issue over and over on the floor of the Senate. \nMany Members of the Senate have been involved. Congressmen Norwood and \nDingell have led the effort on the House side in the debate. It is time \nfor us to get past simply talking about this issue and debating the \nvarious parties' positions. Senator McCain and I, along with others in \nsupport of this bill, are making an effort to resolve our differences \nand get this legislation enacted. It is time, finally, that we enact \nlegislation that puts law on the side of the patients, on the side of \nfamilies, and on the side of doctors, and not on the side of big HMOs \nand insurance companies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to highlight February as \nAmerican Heart Month, a designation that has stood since 1963 when \nCongress first recognized the need to focus national attention on \ncardiac health. I think it is particularly appropriate since it is \nValentine's Day.\n  The theme of this year's Heart Month is one that resonates deeply \nwith me: ``Be Prepared for Cardiac Emergencies.'' This theme is \nespecially meaningful because on January 20, the day of the \nPresidential Inauguration, the Voinovich family almost lost one of its \nbeloved members to sudden cardiac arrest.\n  Indeed, as the country welcomed the arrival of a new administration, \nI, like many of my colleagues, was looking forward to sharing this \njoyous occasion with family and friends. Tragically, our celebration \nwas suddenly upended when Patricia Voinovich, my brother Vic's wife, \nwas struck by sudden cardiac arrest. As she entered the Ohio Inaugural \nBall, she crumpled to the ground without a pulse or respiration.\n  Sudden cardiac arrest--as the name imples--happens abruptly and \nwithout warning. It occurs when the heart's pumping chambers suddenly \nstop contracting effectively and as a result, the heart cannot pump \nblood.\n  Although it has received much less attention than heart attacks, \nsudden cardiac arrest is a major cause of death in the United States.\n  This usually fatal event causes brain damage or death within minutes \nif treatment is not received immediately, and is estimated to cause \nmore than 220,000 deaths in the United States annually.\n  That is more than three lives every 7 minutes--more than 600 deaths a \nday. These deaths are largely attributed to the lack of preparedness \nand immediate accessible medical attention in the short window between \nthe heart ceasing to pump and death.\n  Just as in most sudden cardiac arrests, with Pat there was no warning \nor indicating that she would be susceptible to such a sudden physical \ntrauma. She was in good health. As a matter of fact, she had just been \nto the doctor and had a check up.\n  Even after the incident, doctors commented that her heart was \nundamaged and healthy. After she became stabilized, my family and I \nlistened to the doctors at the George Washington University Hospital \nwho informed us just how lucky Pat, Vic, and the rest of the family had \nbeen. I was told that when individuals are struck with sudden cardiac \narrest, only a minuscule number, 5 percent, survive.\n  Fortunately, Pat had been blessed to be in a place where there was \nwhat the American Heart Association calls a strong chain of survival in \nplace.\n  As a matter of fact, one of the doctors from George Washington \nUniversity Hospital had been assigned to the convention center for the \nspecific purpose of responding to an incident such as the one that \noccurred to my sister-in-law.\n  It was only 2 or 3 months before the inaugural ball that this \nequipment had been put in place at the convention center in \nanticipation that something like this could happen. I think all \nconvention centers throughout the United States should have that \nequipment on board. I think all of us here in the Senate should feel \nvery fortunate that because of Dr. Frist, that kind of equipment is \navailable to the floor of the Senate and the House and the corridors of \nthe Capitol.\n  The chain of survival, developed by the American Heart Association, \nis a four-step process to saves lives from cardiovascular emergencies. \nThe process includes early access to emergency medical services, early \nCPR, early defibrillation and early access to advanced cardiovascular \ncare. Its goal is to minimize the time from the onset of symptoms to \ntreatment.\n  Although I did not know it at the time, all of these factors were \npresent that night at the Ohio Inaugural Ball.\n\n[[Page S1370]]\n\nIndeed, the American Heart Association estimates that if what they call \na strong chain of survival is in place, the survival rate of sudden \ncardiac arrest would increase to upward of 20 percent, saving as many \nas 40,000 lives per year. Think of that--40,000 lives per year if that \nchain of survival exists.\n  As pat lay there on the floor following her collapse, I can only \nthank God that this chain of survival was present and went into effect. \nSecret Service agents and an on-hand emergency physician came to her \nside almost immediately.\n  These Good Samaritans began administering CPR, as well as utilizing a \nlife-saving machine called an automatic external defibrillator, also \nknown as an AED. If it had not been for the grace of the Holy Spirit, \nthe rapid response of Secret Service agents and the on-hand emergency \nphysician and the presence of an AED, pat almost certainly would not \nhave survived.\n  The American Heart Association has been a longtime leader in \neducating the country in cardiovascular disease and the need for \npreparing for cardiac emergencies.\n  Unfortunately, many Americans do not realize the kind of education \nand training that the Heart Association can provide until after an \nemergency situation occurs. I have certainly become even more aware of \ntheir services in light of my family's situation.\n  Quite simply, being prepared for a cardiac emergency can and does \nsave lives. It is my hope, that by focusing on this year's American \nHeart Month theme--``Be Prepared for Cardiac Emergencies''--we can save \nmany thousands of lives, not only this year, but in years to come.\n  I encourage all Americans to participate in American Heart Month, and \ntake the time to educate themselves so that they will be prepared and \nknow what do when an emergency strikes.\n  For those of you who might be interested in how Pat is doing, she was \nin the hospital for 5 days. They inserted a defibrillator in her chest, \nso if she has another occurrence that defibrillator will respond to it.\n  My brother thanked me profusely for inviting him to the inauguration \nbecause he said Pat had this preexisting condition they did not know \nabout, and if it had occurred somewhere else instead of the Convention \nCenter, she would no longer be with us.\n  So we have a happy ending to what could have been a real tragedy for \nour family which, again, emphasizes that because of some folks out \nthere who became involved in the chain of survival, she is now alive \nand well and able to take care of her family.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to talk about two items today. \nThe first deals with February being American Heart Month. Let me \ndescribe my interest in this issue.\n  Today, of course, is Valentine's Day. Most of us will receive some \nkind of valentine from someone that has a red heart on it and describes \nlove and affection. It is a wonderful day for all of us.\n  The other symbol is the human heart, which is a symbol that relates \nto the American Heart Association, an organization I have worked with a \ngreat deal. And also, as I said, this is American Heart Month.\n  Robert Benchley once said: ``As for me, except for an occasional \nheart attack, I feel as young as I ever did,'' describing, of course, \nthe devastation of the cardiac problems that people who suffer from \nheart disease have.\n  I want to talk, just for a moment, about that because we need to \ncontinue every day in every way to deal with this killer in our \ncountry. Heart disease is this country's number 1 killer. It is the \nleading cause of disability and the leading cause of death in our \ncountry.\n  Forty-one percent of the deaths in our country each year are caused \nby heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases, more than the next \nsix leading causes of death combined. Cardiovascular disease and heart \ndisease kill more women than the next 14 causes of death combined each \nyear. That is 5.5 times more deaths than are caused by breast cancer.\n\n  How can we help fight heart disease? All of us work on a wide range \nof issues. I am very concerned about a wide range of diseases. I have \nheld hearings on breast cancer in North Dakota. I have worked on \ndiabetes especially with respect to Native Americans. But heart disease \nis a special passion for me. I lost a beautiful young daughter to heart \ndisease some years ago, and I have another daughter who has a heart \ndefect. I spend some amount of time visiting with cardiologists and \nvisiting Children's Hospital talking about the human heart.\n  We know there is much more to be learned about heart disease. There \nis breathtaking and exciting research going on at the National \nInstitutes of Health dealing with heart disease. I have been to the NIH \nand visited the researchers. What is happening there is remarkable. \nCongress is dramatically increasing the funding for research dealing \nwith a wide range of diseases and inquiry into diseases at the National \nInstitutes of Health. We have gone from $12 billion now to over $20 \nbillion, and we are on a path to go to $24 billion in research at the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  I am pleased to have been one of those who stimulated that increase \nin the investment and research to uncover the mysteries of disease. To \nfind ways to cure diseases and to prevent diseases--heart disease, \ncancer, so much more--is a remarkable undertaking, an outstanding and \nimportant investment for the country. How can we, however, as a \nCongress provide some focus to this issue of heart disease?\n  We have a Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition that we founded in \n1996. I am a co-chairman of that in the Senate and Senator Frist, who \nis a former heart transplant surgeon, is the other co-chair. We have \ntwo co-chairs in the House of Representatives as well. We are active in \na wide range of areas dealing with the issue of heart disease.\n  More than 600 Americans die every single day from cardiac arrest. \nThat is the equivalent of two large jet airline crashes a day. But it \nis not headlines every day because it happens all the time, day after \nday, every day.\n  There is some good news, and that is that cardiac arrest can be \nreversed in a number of victims if it is treated within minutes by an \nelectric shock. There is now something called an automatic external \ndefibrillator, AED. The AEDs, which we have all seen on television \nprograms where they are applying a shock to someone to restart their \nheart, used to be very large machines. Now they are portable, the size \nof a briefcase, easily usable by almost anyone, even myself. I was in \nFargo, North Dakota, one day with the Fargo-Moorhead ambulance crew, \nand the emergency folks use these defibrillators, the portable \nbriefcase size defibrillator. They showed me how to hook it up and how \nto use it.\n  Without having any experience at all, someone off the street can just \nhook up one of these portable defibrillators and use it without mistake \nor error to save lives. The question is, how can we now make these \nportable defibrillators easily accessible in public buildings all \naround the country, and other areas of public access, so they're \navailable to help save lives when someone has a sudden cardiac arrest? \nThat is what we are working on.\n  We have passed legislation to try to make these available in \nairplanes. We have passed legislation to try to move them around to \nmake them available in public buildings. We should do much more than \nthat. They are affordable, easy to use, and can save lives. We ought to \nhave these new portable defibrillators as common pieces of safety \nequipment in public buildings like fire extinguishers are now. It is \nachievable, and it is something we should do.\n\n  We also need to find ways to do more cholesterol screening. That also \nrelates\n\n[[Page S1371]]\n\nvery much to cardiovascular disease. We know the identification of one \nof the major changeable risk factors for cardiovascular disease--that \nis, high levels of cholesterol--is not covered by Medicare. Clearly, we \nought to cover those kinds of screenings under Medicare.\n  The American Heart Association recommends that all Americans over the \nage of 20 receive cholesterol screening at least once every five years. \nBut when an American turns 65 and enters the Medicare program, their \ncoverage for cholesterol screenings stops. That makes no sense. We have \ntried in recent years to improve the Medicare coverage of preventive \nservices. We now cover screenings for breast, cervical, colorectal and \nprostate cancer, testing for loss of bone mass, diabetes monitoring, \nvaccinations for the flu, pneumonia, and hepatitis B. Now we must \nprovide Medicare coverage for cholesterol screenings as well.\n  I intend to introduce legislation that would add this important \nbenefit to the menu of preventive services already covered by Medicare. \nI have just mentioned also the substantial amount of new research going \non at the National Institutes of Health.\n  I confess that my passion about this issue comes from my family's \nexperience--in the first case, a tragic experience. In the second case, \nwe hope for an experience that will show us the miracles of research \nthat are coming from the National Institutes of Health that provide new \ntreatments and new remedies and new cures for some of these illnesses, \nincluding heart disease. We hope this will offer my family good news in \nthe future; not just my family, every family. Every family is touched \nand is acquainted in some way with this issue of heart disease. As I \nindicated, it is America's number 1 killer.\n  I have been pleased to work with the American Heart Association, a \nwonderful organization of volunteers all across this country that does \nextraordinary work. I will continue to work with them and work with the \nheart and stroke coalition in the Congress to see if we can't continue \nto make progress in battling this dreaded disease that takes so many \nlives in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1371-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1371-S1372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AIRLINE SERVICE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise to speak for a moment about the \nairlines and the airline service in our country. Last weekend, the \nNational Mediation Board released Northwest Airlines and one of its \nunions, called AMFA, from the mediation service that was going on.\n  Now we are under a 30-day march to a potential labor strike and \ntherefore shutdown of airline service. It is not just Northwest \nAirlines. We have a United Airlines dispute in front of the National \nMediation Board. We have a Delta Airlines dispute there, and an \nAmerican Airlines dispute.\n  What has happened in recent years with the airlines, not just with \nrespect to these labor issues, but with respect to the way the airlines \nhave remade themselves since deregulation, is very troubling to me and \nshould be very troubling to most of the traveling public in this \ncountry.\n  I mentioned earlier, today is Valentine's Day. I suggest for a moment \nthat you might want to take a trip on Valentine's Day. If you want to \ngo to Bismarck, ND--and if you say no because it is February, I would \nadmonish you that Bismarck, ND, is a wonderful place and it is not all \nthat cold in the winter--guess what the walk-up cost for a flight to \nBismarck, ND, is--$1,687. But assume your sweetheart is very special \nand you decide, I am not going to go Bismarck. I am going to Paris, \nFrance. Do you know the fare you can find to Paris, France today? It is \nnot $1,687. We have found walk-up fares to Paris, France, for $406; or \nLos Angeles, $510. So fly to Bismarck for $1,687 or Paris, France, for \n$406.\n  Ask yourself, what kind of a nutty scheme is this that these private \ncompanies have developed a pricing scheme that says: If you fly twice \nas far, we will charge you half as much. But if you fly half as far, we \nwill charge you twice as much.\n  Using Bismarck again, if you have a hankering to see the largest cow \non a hill overlooking New Salem, ND--the cow's name is Salem Sue, the \nworld's largest cow--or to go to see Mickey Mouse at Disneyland in Los \nAngeles, you pay twice as much to go half as far to see the largest \ncow, or pay half as much to go twice as far to see Mickey Mouse. What \nkind of a nutty idea is that? Who on earth comes up with these pricing \nschemes? Deregulation comes up with pricing schemes that say, by the \nway, we are not going to regulate the airlines. They can compete \naggressively between the big cities where a lot of people want to \ntravel. That competition will drive down prices, and you have really \nnice prices among the large cities where people are traveling. \nMeanwhile, the rest of the folks get soaked with extraordinarily high \nprices and less service.\n\n  So what happened after deregulation is these major airlines decided \nthey really liked each other a lot and started romancing each other and \nthey merged. What used to be 11 airlines is now 7. They want to merge \nsome more and they want to go from 7 to 3 airlines.\n  What happened through all these mergers? They retreated into the \nregional hubs, such as Minneapolis, Denver, Atlanta--you name it; they \nhave retreated to regional hubs where one airline will control 50 \npercent, 70 percent, 80 percent of the hub traffic. The result is that \na dominant airline controlling the hub traffic sets its own prices, and \nthose prices are outrageous.\n  Now, here is the point: We now have outrageous prices for people in \nsparsely populated areas in the country. We have a system of \nderegulation in which the airlines have become unregulated monopolies \nin regional hubs, and now we have a circumstance where United decided \nit wants to buy USAir, and American wants to buy TWA because TWA is \ngoing to be in bankruptcy, and it has been there twice. Delta is \ntalking about buying Continental, and Northwest will soon be involved \nin the mix. They want to condense this down to three big airline \ncarriers. Now, that is not competition where I come from. That is kind \nof an economic cholesterol that clogs the economic veins of the free \nmarket system in this country. We need to stop that.\n  I am considering legislation that would set up a moratorium on \nairline mergers above a certain size for a couple years so we can take \na breath and understand what this means to the American consumers. The \nanswer of what it means to the American consumers is quite clear to me. \nSome are rewarded with lower fares--if you are in the large markets \nwhere there is competition, while others are paying extraordinary \nprices to fly in small markets where there is less service and higher \nprices.\n  United says it wants to buy USAir. That combination means a bigger \ncompany with more market control. American says TWA is failing and it \nwants to buy TWA. More market control. The TWA thing--if I might just \ndescribe the circumstance--is, in my judgment, byzantine. It was \npurchased by Carl Icahn in a hostile takeover in the 1980s. I said this \nis unhealthy to put an airline company into these hostile takeover \nwars, with junk bonds and everything. Guess what the problem with TWA \nis? At the moment, Mr. Icahn, after having been through two \nbankruptcies with TWA, has an agreement post bankruptcy to sell seats \non TWA at a 45-percent discount from the lowest public fare. This \nIcahn-TWA deal, termed the ``caribou agreement,'' remains in effect \nthrough 2003. Mr. Icahn is vigorously contesting the bankruptcy \nproceeding because if the assets are sold, the company will cease to \nexist.\n  What kind of a deal is that when airlines become pawns in hostile \ntakeovers and then you get sweetheart deals coming out of bankruptcy \nthat impose that kind of burden on the back of TWA?\n\n  It doesn't look to me as though the public interest has been defined \nat all in these machinations. The point is, when airlines have become \nbigger and bigger and have retreated into dominant hubs, if there is a \nstrike or lockout and the airline ceases operating, it is not like it \nwas 30 years ago when, if your airline shut down, you had other \nairlines. In North Dakota, we had five different companies flying jet \nairplanes into our State. Now we have one, and we just got a second \nrecently with a regional jet.\n  The point is, when an airline shuts down now, when you have dominance \nin a certain hub, entire parts of the country will be left with no \nairline service at all. Those airlines and their\n\n[[Page S1372]]\n\nemployees have dramatically changed the circumstances of collective \nbargaining. There is someone else who must be at their table, and that \nis the American traveling public because their interests are at stake. \nA strike or lockout will affect their interests in a very dramatic way.\n  I wanted to make this point for a couple reasons. One, I think these \nproposed mergers fly directly in the face of public interest and ought \nnot to be allowed. That is No. 1. We ought to stop this. We don't need \nto go to three airlines. That is, in my judgment, moving in the wrong \ndirection. That is not in the public interest. We need more \ncompetition, not more concentration.\n  No. 2, and my final point, is when you have the kind of disputes that \nnow exist before the National Mediation Board and the threatened \ndisruptions of airline service, it will be devastating to the public \nand to this country's economy if you have entire regions with no air \nservice at all. We went through a strike with the dominant carrier in \nour region about 2 and a half years ago and it was devastating. We \ncan't let that happen again. There are four carriers with cases in \nfront of the mediation board, one of which was just released. I say to \nthose carriers and to the labor unions, because you have remade \nyourself in a different circumstance, with dominance in hubs all across \nthis country, you have a different responsibility than you used to have \nin collective bargaining. You have a responsibility to the American \npublic that didn't previously exist. This is not business as usual. \nThere is another interest that must be seated at your table, and that \nis the public interest.\n  Understand that those of us in Congress, those who are strong \nsupporters of businesses and strong supporters of unions, understand it \nis most important that we are supporters of the public interest, the \npeople we represent, and supporters of the larger national interests in \nthis country.\n  With what happened to the airline industry, the massive concentration \nand the critical dominance in regional hubs, these labor disputes are \nvery troubling to me and to many others. They must not--I repeat--\nresult in the shutdown of critically needed airline service to parts of \nthis country that can ill afford to have that happen.\n  I say to the airlines and to the unions: Sit at that table and \nbargain. I am a big supporter of collective bargaining. Bargain and \nreach an agreement. Understand that the empty chair next to your \ndiscussion is a chair that represents the public interest, and that \nchair is not filled by someone who is sitting there as part of that \ndiscussion, but they are in that room overlooking those negotiations. \nResolve these issues and keep that service from the company and its \nemployees provided to the American people.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in expressing loudly that having \nthis country go to three major airline carriers is a step backward, not \nforward. It is a step toward concentration, not competition. It plugs \nthe arteries of the free market system in a very unhealthy way for this \ncountry.\n  I will speak at a future time about concentration, and not just in \nthe airline industry. I am concerned about what is happening in a range \nof industries in this country where there is concentration and \nantitrust behavior that ought to be troubling to the American people \nand this Congress.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

Mr. President, I can remember traveling home a day in July \ntwo and a half years ago when I learned on the radio that two Capitol \npolicemen, Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut, had been \nmurdered in the Capitol.\n  When there is a loss of life, it affects us all; but, these men were \nin the line of fire and prevented other people from being killed.\n  I also had a particular affinity toward Detective John Gibson because \nof the assistance he provided at a function when my wife took ill. He, \nin a very heroic fashion, exercised good judgment in helping with the \nmedical problems my wife was experiencing. A short time after he \ngallantly helped my wife, he was murdered.\n  Furthermore, the deaths of Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut were \npainful for me because I was a Capitol policeman. I put myself through \nlaw school working in the Capitol as a police officer.\n  The reason I mention these events is that I was stunned Monday to \nread that the visitors center that we as Members of the Senate and the \nHouse rushed forward to do something about following the murders of \nthese two men was now grinding to, if not a halt, a slowdown. I rise \ntoday to express my serious concern and extreme disappointment with \nrecent reports that construction of the much needed Capitol visitors \ncenter may fall further behind schedule. In fact, the way things have \nbeen going, we must ask ourselves if the project will ever be \ncompleted.\n  On the front page of Monday's edition of Roll Call, the Hill \nnewspaper, the headline read: ``Visitors Center Funds `Lagging,' \nOfficials Say $65 Million Short of Goal With Clock Ticking.''\n  After all that has transpired, after all the statements we have heard \non this floor and the floor of the House, I am ashamed we have found \nourselves in this predicament. Any further delay in construction of the \nmuch needed Capitol visitors center must be prevented. We must take \naction as quickly as possible.\n  Every night I leave my office in the Capitol to go home, I exit \nthrough the memorial door. It is called the memorial door because there \nare two plaques on the wall commemorating Officer Chestnut and \nDetective Gibson. I see their faces each night as I walk out the door.\n  In response to these murders, many Members renewed our call for the \nconstruction of the visitors center which has been talked about for \nyears. I can remember talking about this project when I was the \nchairman of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Committee. When I was \nchairman, we cleared the cars off the east front of the Capitol. There \nare very few automobiles out there now, but we did it, for security and \nthe fact that it was an eyesore. Unfortunately, it's still an eyesore--\nthat blacktop on the East side of the Capitol of the United States. The \nonly superpower left in the world and we have an ugly blacktop out \nhere. More important than the visual aspect, however, are the safety \nconcerns. The reason Chestnut and Gibson were killed, in my opinion, is \nthat they had no protection. A madman with a gun rushed through the \ndoor and shot Chestnut. Gibson valiantly came forward to protect a \nMember and others from being shot, and he was killed. A visitors center \nwould enhance safety for these fine men and women who guard us. Men and \nwomen who guard the the thousands of Americans who come to this \nbuilding every day.\n  In addition to that, we always see people lined up out there on the \neast side of the Capitol waiting to get into the building. We see them \nduring the spring and summer months. We see them during the fall months \nwhen school is out. Even during the winter months, they line up for \nblocks. People from all over America--from Nevada, Montana, Maine--come \nto Washington to visit the Capitol. They are forced--I say ``forced'' \nbecause there is no place else to go--to stand outside in the elements, \nwhether it is raining, snowing, or 100 degrees, without the benefit of \nrestrooms, a place to get something to eat, or a place to get something \nto drink. The Capitol visitors center would allow the Capitol Police to \nbetter protect themselves and all of us\n\n[[Page S1373]]\n\nwho come to this Capitol complex to work or to visit, and would also \nprovide an indoor facility for visitors to stand in line, as well as a \ngift shop, a cafeteria, and a place for them to go to the bathroom.\n  We have authorized $100 million for the construction of this Capitol \nvisitors center. It will cost, however, $265 million. After six \ndifferent congressional committees exercised their jurisdiction, it was \ndecided that we would sell $65 million worth of commemorative coins \nfrom the U.S. Mint, with the additional $100 million raised in the \nprivate sector. I have never thought the money should be raised in the \nprivate sector. If there were ever something that should be paid for by \nthe government, it should be a visitors center to this Capitol.\n  I commend all of the donors who gave their time and money to raise \nthe $35 million that has been raised to date. While I commend these \npeople, however, I believe their noble efforts should never have been \nnecessary in raising this money. The U.S. Capitol Building is the \npeople's house. It is the seat of our government and the enduring \nsymbol of this democracy, the greatest country in the history of the \nworld. The Capitol is the seat of government for the greatest country \nin the history of the world.\n  As Senators and Representatives, we have been blessed with the \nincredible fortune of calling the Capitol the place where we work. I am \ndisappointed that we, as caretakers of this people's house, have \nabrogated our responsibility by begging the private sector for funds to \nhelp build what I believe should remain a public institution. We have \nan obligation to fully fund the construction of the visitors center. We \nshould do it right away--during this Congress.\n  I have conveyed this message to Senators Bennett and Durbin, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Legislative Branch \nAppropriations, as well as to the full committee chairman, Senator \nStevens, and the ranking member, Senator Byrd.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter I have written to these \nSenators be printed in the Record following my remarks. I also ask \nunanimous consent that the article in Monday's edition of the Roll Call \nnewspaper to which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibits 1 and 2.)\n  Mr. REID. I intend to continue my efforts to ensure that we provide \nthe necessary funds as quickly as possible to prevent construction \ndelays in the Capitol visitors center. It is important that we do this. \nIt is important to this country. It is important to this institution. \nIt is important to the people we serve.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2001.\n     Hon.

This would be \n     an unfortunate development that we must prevent as quickly as \n     possible.\n       In July 1998, following the murders of Officer Jacob \n     Chestnut and Detective John Gibson, many Members of the House \n     of Representatives and the Senate, including me, publicly \n     recognized the sacrifices made by these two fine men. Many of \n     us also renewed our call for the construction of a Capitol \n     Visitors Center. The proposed Visitors Center would improve \n     security and provide an indoor facility for visitors to stand \n     in line, and would also include a gift shop, rest rooms and a \n     cafeteria.\n       To date, Congress has authorized and appropriated $100 \n     million for the construction of the Capitol Visitors Center. \n     At a cost of approximately $265 million, however, that amount \n     fell far short of the funds needed. As you know, following a \n     series of delays caused by six different congressional \n     committees exercising their jurisdiction over the project, it \n     was decided that $65 million would be raised by the U.S. Mint \n     through the sale of commemorative coins, with the additional \n     $100 million raised by the Fund for the Capitol Visitors \n     Center through private donations.\n       While I commend those donors and all who have generously \n     contributed their time and money to raise private funds for \n     the construction of the Capitol Visitors Center, I believe \n     that their noble efforts should never have been necessary. \n     The United States Capitol Building is the People's House. It \n     is the seat of our government and the enduring symbol of our \n     democracy. As Senators and Representatives, we have been \n     blessed with the incredible fortune of calling the Capitol \n     our place of employment. I am extremely disappointed that we, \n     as caretakers of the People's House, have abrogated our \n     responsibilities by begging the private sector for funds to \n     help build what I believe is, and should remain, a public \n     institution.\n       We have an obligation to fully fund the construction of the \n     Capitol Visitors Center. As a Member of the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee, I intend to continue my efforts to \n     ensure that we provide the necessary funds, as quickly as \n     possible, to prevent construction from falling even further \n     behind schedule.\n       My best wishes to you,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Harry Reid,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                    [From Roll Call, Feb. 12, 2001]\n\n            Visitors Center Funds ``Lagging,'' Officials Say\n\n\n              $65 million short of goal with clock ticking\n\n                       (By Lauren W. Whittington)\n\n       Amid concern that private fundraising efforts for the \n     Capitol visitors center are ``lagging,'' some top officials \n     associated with the project have begun looking into other \n     funding options in order to keep it from falling behind \n     schedule.\n       The Fund for the Capitol Visitors Center, a non-profit \n     organization established by the Pew Charitable Trusts, has \n     raised $35 million in private gifts thus far. That leaves it \n     $65 million short of the $100 million it needs to raise by \n     the end of the year.\n       ``I think we've been aware now for a while that the \n     fundraising [aspect] is lagging, and we have been thinking \n     about different options,'' said an aide to one member of the \n     Capitol Preservation Commission, the entity charged with \n     overseeing the visitors center.\n       While the aide declined to discuss timeliness and what \n     those specific options might be, the staffer said that using \n     more taxpayers funds--a controversial idea--to supplement the \n     project is ``certainly an option'' that is being discussed.\n       After two Capitol Police officers were shot and killed in \n     the Capitol in July 1998, Congress appropriated $100 million \n     in taxpayer funds for the visitors center with the idea that \n     the funds would be matched by private donations.\n       Construction on the visitors center is set to begin in \n     January 2002, and under federal law all funds used for the \n     project must be collected before the first shovel goes into \n     the ground.\n       Senior Congressional officials involved in the project are \n     privately expressing concern that the money may not come soon \n     enough.\n       ``The Capitol is in desperate need of this visitors center, \n     so we want it to stay on track, and we need to have the money \n     by December 2001 for construction to begin on time,'' one CPC \n     staffer said on the condition of anonymity. ``I think that \n     everybody's dedicated to figuring out a way to keep it moving \n     forward.''\n       After kicking off its campaign in April 2000 with an \n     initial $35 million in pledged donations, including $10 \n     million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the fund \n     has not publicly announced any further donations or \n     fundraising totals.\n       ``I think this really has been a much more difficult task \n     than they thought it would be,'' said the aide to a CPC \n     member. ``I do think they were very optimistic about what \n     they could raise and it wasn't really reality.''\n       The first major addition to the Capitol since 1859, the \n     visitors center is slated to cost $265 million and be \n     completed by January 2005--just in time for the next \n     presidential inauguration.\n       The price tag could increase by as much as $10 million if \n     CPC members approve construction of a proposed tunnel that \n     would connect the center with the Library of Congress.\n       Thus far, fundraising concerns have not affected the \n     project's estimated start date, but that could change if \n     funds are not collected by year's end.\n       ``If we had to wait for the fundraising, potentially, yeah, \n     it would need to be moved back, but I don't think that's in \n     anybody's head right now,'' the CPC member's aide said. ``I \n     think it's too soon to be talking about that.''\n       Former Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Calif.), who sits on the fund's \n     board of directors, said the organization has donations ``in \n     the pipeline,'' even though they are unable to publicly \n     announce them.\n       ``How much people will decide to give, if they decide to \n     give, is something that's still being discussed,'' said \n     Fazio, who championed the project when he was in the House. \n     ``Nobody could have predicted, and we still couldn't tell you \n     for sure how much money could be raised for such a purpose.''\n       Maria Titelman, president of the fund, said the \n     organization is raising money, although she too was unable to \n     release any estimates or talk publicly about possible \n     donations.\n\n[[Page S1374]]\n\n       ``I think that we're very excited about where we're \n     going,'' Titelman said. ``We're raising money as quickly as \n     we can on an accelerated schedule. We'll get to our $100 \n     million as soon as possible.''\n       The bulk of the remaining $65 million will be raised \n     through the sale of commemorative coins. Funds raised from \n     the sale of two bicentennial coins in the late 1980s have now \n     reached $30 million, and the CPC expects to make another $5 \n     million to $10 million from the sale of two coins set to \n     be released by the U.S. Mint this spring.\n       For their part, Members and key staffers on both sides of \n     the aisle remain committed to the project.\n       ``The entire leadership and CPC remain very committed to \n     this and very enthusiastic about it,'' said Ted Van Der Meid, \n     an aide to Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.).\n       Van Der Meid also noted that last week's shooting incident \n     at the White House ``reaffirms one of the main purposes for \n     the visitors center.''\n       To assist with their efforts, the fund has hired outside \n     fundraising consultants Wyatt Stewart & Associates and The \n     Bonner Group. Also advising the fund is Steven Briganti, \n     president and CEO of the foundation that funded the \n     restoration and preservation of the Statue of Liberty and \n     Ellis Island.\n       The fund's board of directors will hold its next meeting \n     March 8, at which time it may have a better idea of monetary \n     commitments from corporations.\n       ``It's premature to make any statement about what we will \n     be able to accomplish because there are a number of things \n     being considered right now by a number of foundations,'' \n     Fazio said. ``Whether or not we can get to the original goal, \n     I think, remains to be seen. It's not going to be an easy \n     task to do that.''\n       If the fund is not able to reach its initial goal, Fazio \n     said, it will rely on more public money.\n       ``I have not objected to the effort to raise private funds, \n     and I've been part of that effort, but I certainly would hope \n     that if we are only so successful at that, that we would then \n     fall back on additional appropriations to make it happen,'' \n     Fazio said. ``The most important thing is it not be something \n     that is delayed or underdone.''\n       Former Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), also a member of the \n     board, said he has always favored Congress appropriating the \n     funds needed to build the center.\n       ``So far as this mixing of private and public money, I \n     never have much liked that,'' Bumpers said in an interview \n     last week. ``I thought if it was a good idea, we ought to \n     fund it with public funds.''\n       Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), co-chairman of the CPC, said \n     in a prepared statement, ``At this time I feel that it would \n     be premature to make any final decisions regarding the \n     appropriation of additional funds for the Capitol visitors \n     center. However, I recognize that because of the importance \n     of this project, it is essential that we keep all of our \n     options open.''\n       Sen. Bob Bennett (R-Utah), chairman of the Appropriations \n     subcommittee on the legislative branch and a member of the \n     CPC, said he would consider appropriating more money for the \n     project if it was needed.\n       ``I haven't given any thought to what happens if [the \n     current fundraising framework] won't work,'' Bennett said. \n     ``But if it becomes clear that it won't work, then I would \n     take a look at an additional appropriation.''\n       However, Rep. John Mica (R-Fla.), a CPC member and one of \n     the most vocal supporters of the visitors center to date, \n     said he is against appropriating more taxpayer money.\n       ``I don't think we need any more public money and \n     particularly at this stage,'' Mica said. ``At some point if \n     we have to beef up the private fundraising efforts or help \n     assist them in any way, there's plenty of muscle power that \n     can raise that money, particularly Members who unabashedly \n     raised hundreds of millions for campaign efforts.''\n       Outside of revisiting the public funding debate, the CPC \n     can also explore other private fundraising options because \n     its agreement with the fund is not exclusive. The CPC could \n     begin to accept private donations directly or it could set up \n     another organization to raise private money for the project.\n       One thing that has been a roadblock for the fund's efforts \n     thus far is the issue of public recognition.\n       From the outset, most Members of Congress have been \n     adamantly opposed to the idea of naming portions of the \n     visitors center after corporate sponsors, and the leadership \n     and the fund have differed on the ways in which corporations \n     can receive public recognition for the donations.\n       ``This is too important a part of our history,'' Bumpers \n     said. ``We're not going to name this the MCI visitors center \n     or any of those things.''\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I want to discuss the case of Earl \nWashington. Mr. Washington was released from custody Monday after more \nthan 17 years in prison. In fact, of the 17 years in prison, 10 years \nof that were on death row. Virginia Governor James Gilmore pardoned \nEarl Washington on October 2, 2000, after some new DNA tests confirmed \nwhat earlier DNA tests had already shown--he was the wrong guy. They \nhad the wrong person in prison on death row.\n  I mention this case as probably the most recent that we have seen in \nthe press, but we have seen a shocking number of cases in the past 2 \nyears in which inmates have been exonerated after long stays in prison, \nincluding more than 90 cases involving people who had been sentenced to \ndeath. Let me repeat that: more than 90 cases where people had been \nsentenced to death and they then found they had the wrong person.\n  Since Earl Washington was pardoned 4 months ago, six more condemned \nprisoners in four different States have had their convictions vacated \nthrough exonerating evidence: William Nieves, sentenced to death in \nPennsylvania in 1994; Michael Graham and Albert Burrell, sentenced to \ndeath in Louisiana in 1987; Peter Limone and Joseph Salvati, sentenced \nto death in Massachusetts in 1968; and Frank Lee Smith, sentenced to \ndeath in Florida in 1986.\n\n[[Page S1375]]\n\n  There have also been other recent exonerations of inmates who were \nnot sentenced to death, but were serving long terms of imprisonment. \nJust last month, the State of Texas released Chris Ochoa from prison at \nthe request of the local prosecutors. The prosecutors themselves asked \nthat he be released. In 1989, Ochoa pled guilty to a rape-murder he did \nnot commit. Somebody may ask: Why would you plead guilty to a rape and \nmurder that you did not commit? Because the authorities said they were \ngoing to make sure he got a death sentence if he did not plead guilty \nto the crime.\n  DNA tests that were not available when he was arrested cleared Ochoa \nand his codefendant and implicated another man, who had previously \nconfessed to the crime on several occasions.\n  Here is how bad this case was. Chris Ochoa was arrested. He knew he \ndid not commit the crime, this rape-murder. But the police basically \ntold him: We are going to have you executed if we go to trial. We are \ngoing to prove it. We will have you executed. Of course, you can plead \nguilty and we will spare you the death penalty. He did. But then, even \nthough they had the man who actually committed this heinous crime, who \nkept confessing to it, they did not pay any attention to him because it \nwas easier to just keep the wrong guy locked up.\n  Of course, when the DNA evidence came out--it was there in front of \neverybody--they said: Look, we have the wrong guy. This other person, \nthe person who had confessed to it, is the right guy after all. Whoops, \nsorry about that. Well, we have only had you locked up for over a \ndecade for a crime you did not commit.\n  We must identify the cracks in the system that allowed these \ninjustices to occur. DNA is a central tool in this pursuit. It has \nalready led to the exoneration of more than 80 people in this country, \nincluding Earl Washington and others who had been sentenced to death.\n  DNA testing has opened a window to give us a disturbing view of the \ndefects of our criminal justice system. When DNA evidence exonerates a \nperson such as Earl Washington, there is a unique opportunity to \nevaluate how the system failed that person, and perhaps even more \nimportantly, to identify broader patterns of error and abuse.\n\n  If a plane falls from the sky and crashes, we investigate the causes. \nWe try to learn from the tragedy so we can avoid similar tragedies in \nthe future. We should do no less when a wrongfully convicted person \nwalks off death row.\n  The justice system did not just fail Earl Washington; it crashed and \nburned. We have a lot to learn from this case. It highlights many of \nthe problems we see over and over again in cases of wrongful \nconviction.\n  These are the basic facts of the Earl Washington case. In June of \n1982, a young woman named Rebecca Williams was raped and murdered in \nCulpeper, VA. Nearly a year later, Earl Washington was arrested on an \nunrelated charge. Earlier that day, Washington had broken into the home \nof an elderly woman named Helen Weeks. But she surprised him. He hit \nher over the head with a chair and fled. At the time he was arrested, \nhe was drunk and running wild through the woods.\n  Earl Washington suffers from mental retardation. He has an IQ of 69, \nwhich puts him in the bottom 2 percent of the population. Like a child, \nhe tends to answer questions in whatever way he thinks will please his \nquestioners. After his arrest, he ``confessed'' to pretty much every \nunsolved crime the police asked him about.\n  A police sergeant named Alan Cubbage later described the scene to the \nWashington Post. He got a call that day from the officers who were \ninterrogating Earl Washington. He told the Post: ``It was almost like a \nbig party. `Come on down,' '' they said, ``This guy is confessing to \neverything.''\n  He was confessing to crimes he could not possibly have committed. But \nwhatever it was, when they asked him if he committed the crime, he \nsaid: ``Yes, sir.''\n  First, he confessed to the crime he had actually committed--breaking \ninto Helen Weeks' home and hitting her over the head with a chair. That \nhe did do. Then he confessed to raping her. Without any reason to \nsuspect that Weeks had been raped, the officers interrogating \nWashington asked if he had raped her, and he gave the standard \nresponse, ``Yes, sir.''\n  On that basis alone, they charged him with rape. Well, then Helen \nWeeks came forward and said, ``Nobody raped me. I never told the police \nI had been raped. Nobody tried to rape me.'' And they kind of tiptoed \ninto court and dropped the rape charge.\n  During that same interrogation session, Earl Washington went on to \nconfess to four other unrelated crimes. Investigators later concluded \nthat he could not have committed three of the crimes in other words, \nthat his confessions were wholly unreliable. Yet with virtually no \nevidence other than the remaining confession, he was charged and \nbrought to trial for the fourth crime the rape and murder of Rebecca \nWilliams.\n  Earl Washington almost immediately retracted his confession to the \nWilliams murder, and there were no fingerprints or blood linking him to \nthe crime scene. But he was convicted, and the jury recommended \nexecution. He was sentenced to death, his appeals were rejected, and he \ncame within a few days of being electrocuted. The whole justice system \nfailed him. But science eventually came to his rescue.\n  Mr. President, everybody who has been in law enforcement knows you \nget some people like Earl Washington, who are ready to confess to \neverything. When I was prosecuting cases, we had a man--he is no longer \nalive--who would read something in the paper, a horrendous crime, and \nhe would immediately confess. Especially if it was cold weather, he \nwould come to a warm police station and he would confess to everything. \nWe could make up cases and he would confess.\n  Obviously, that is one level. But with Earl Washington it was \nentirely different. He had committed a crime. He had broken into a \nwoman's house, and he had hit her with a chair. But he did not rape \nher. Nobody did. She said so herself. He certainly did not murder and \nrape the woman he was charged with murdering and raping. Somebody else \ndid. But with no evidence at all, except for his confession, he was \nfound guilty.\n  When Earl Washington was convicted in 1984, DNA testing was not \navailable. By the early 1990s, DNA testing was available, although the \ntechnology has since improved, and tests done in 1993 and 1993--seven \nyears ago--showed that Earl Washington did not rape Rebecca Williams.\n  Despite these test results, the state officials still thought he \nmight be guilty. Maybe there was somebody else involved. Maybe there \nwere two people--notwithstanding the fact that the woman who was \nmurdered, who had lived for a period of time after she was attacked, \nsaid very clearly that there was only one person.\n  So Earl Washington remained in prison. There was so much doubt--at \nleast they did not execute him--they commuted his sentence to life in \nJanuary of 1994. But he was not pardoned. He was given life in prison, \nbut still for a crime that he did not commit and more and more of the \nauthorities in the State knew he did not commit and DNA tests proved he \ndid not commit.\n  One would think the courts would be interested in scientific \nevidence, especially of a prisoner's innocence. Normally you do not \nhave to prove your innocence, but this was a case where he could prove \nhis innocence. One might ask, couldn't he go to court with the new DNA \nevidence and ask for a new trial? The answer is no; Virginia has the \nshortest deadline in the country for going back to court with new \nevidence. It has to be submitted within 21 days of conviction. After \nthat, the defendant is out of luck.\n  Earl Washington could not submit the evidence within 21 days of \nconviction for a very simple reason: The technology for DNA testing, at \nthe time of his conviction, was not available. And of course by the \ntime it became available a few years later, he was in a catch-22: I've \ngot DNA evidence that proves I'm innocent. Sorry, 21 days went by a \nlong time ago. But they didn't have DNA evidence within 21 days of my \nconviction. I know, it is a crying shame. Stay on death row.\n  Last year, a new and more precise DNA test reconfirmed what the \nearlier tests had shown: Earl Washington did not commit the crime for \nwhich he was sentenced to death. The tests pointed\n\n[[Page S1376]]\n\nto another person who was already in prison for rape. So, 7 years after \nthe initial DNA tests and more than 16 years after he was sentenced to \nbe executed, Earl Washington was granted an absolute pardon for the \nrape and murder of Rebecca Williams, a rape and murder he never \ncommitted. After science had twice proven his innocence, the \nCommonwealth of Virginia finally acknowledged the truth.\n  That is not the end of the story. He then spent another 4 months in \nprison for his attack on Hazel Weeks. That is at least a crime he \ncommitted. He hit her with a chair in 1983. So now, 17 years later, he \nis finishing that sentence. People sentenced for similar crimes in \nVirginia are generally paroled after 7 to 10 years in prison. They made \nEarl Washington serve twice the time that others would serve the \nmaximum possible time in prison. Having unjustly condemned him, the \nCommonwealth of Virginia compounded the injustice by keeping him in \nprison until two days ago, when he became entitled to mandatory parole. \nIt is almost as if they were saying: How dare you be innocent of the \nother crime we convicted you of? How dare you prove us wrong? We will \nmake you pay for it.\n  I had hoped to meet with Earl Washington after his release from \nprison. Congressman Bobby Scott of Virginia wrote to the Virginia \ncorrectional authorities 2 weeks ago and sought permission for Earl \nWashington to travel to Capitol Hill Monday under the care and \nsupervision of his attorneys. We thought it was important for the \nAmerican people to hear firsthand an account of this injustice. A good \njustice system learns from its mistakes.\n  The last 17 years of Earl Washington's life have been one of the \nsystem's worst mistakes. We felt we owed it to Earl Washington and \nfuture Earl Washingtons to listen. The officials of the Commonwealth \ndid not. They had a different view. They did not want Earl Washington \nto come here. They did not want him to come here even for a few hours, \ncome that great distance from Virginia, which is 2 miles away. They \ndidn't want him to come those extra 2 miles and tell the story.\n  This case reveals the dark side of a system that is not known for \nadmitting its mistakes. I am not speaking only of the Commonwealth of \nVirginia. A whole lot of other States have been just as bad at \nadmitting their mistakes.\n  In the Earl Washington case, state officials insisted on pursuing a \ndeath penalty charge despite having wholly unreliable evidence. They \nkept him in prison for years despite knowing he was falsely convicted. \nThey kept him locked up, knowing he was falsely convicted. And then \nthey would not even let him come here to Washington to tell the \nAmerican people what happened.\n  We need to hear from such people like Earl Washington, not hide them \nfrom public view. The American justice system is about the search for \nthe truth: the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. As a \nformer prosecutor, I understand the importance of finality in criminal \ncases, but even more important than that is the commitment to the \ntruth; that has to come first.\n  This case tells us we cannot sit back and assume prosecutors and \ncourts will do the right thing when it comes to DNA evidence. It took \nEarl Washington years to convince prosecutors to do the very simple \ntests that would prove his innocence, and more time still to win his \nfreedom.\n  Some States continue to stonewall on requests for DNA testing. They \ncontinue to hide behind time limits and procedural default rules to \ndeny prisoners the opportunity to present DNA test results in court. \nThey continue to destroy DNA evidence that could set innocent people \nfree.\n  These practices must stop. I have long supported and I continue to \nsupport funding to ensure that law enforcement has access to DNA \ntesting and all the other tools it needs to investigate and prosecute \ncrime in our society. But if we as a society are committed to getting \nit right, and not just to getting a conviction, we need to make sure \nthat DNA testing, and the ability to present DNA evidence to the \ncourts, is also available to the defense. We should not pass up the \npromise of truth and justice for both sides of our adversarial system, \nand that promise is there in DNA evidence.\n  We must also understand this case shows why we should not allow the \nexecution of the mentally retarded. As I noted in a floor statement \nlast December, people with mental retardation are more prone to make \nfalse confessions simply to please their interrogators, and they are \noften unable to assist their lawyers in their own defense. Earl \nWashington confessed to no less than four serious felonies which he did \nnot commit and could not have committed. We should join the \noverwhelming number of nations that do not allow the execution of the \nmentally retarded.\n  There are good things that may come out of this case. I know the \nSupreme Court of Virginia has proposed eliminating the 21-day rule, \nwhich prevented Earl Washington from getting a new trial based on the \ninitial DNA tests in the early 1990s. That would be a good thing if it \nhappens. But it would be just a start.\n  I urge us to go forward and pass the Innocence Protection Act, \nsupported by both Republicans and Democrats in this body and in the \nother body. This legislation addresses several serious problems in the \nadministration of capital punishment. Most urgently, the bill would \nafford greater access to DNA testing for convicted offenders and help \nstates improve the quality of legal representation in their capital \ncases. It also proposes that the United States Congress speak as the \nconscience of the Nation in condemning the execution of the mentally \nretarded.\n  People of good conscience can and will disagree on the morality of \nthe death penalty; but people of good conscience all share the same \ngoal of preventing the execution of the innocent. People of good \nconscience should not disagree that the way the case of Earl Washington \nwas handled over the past 17 years was unjust. It was completely \nunacceptable. We ought to find ways to make sure these kinds of things \ndo not happen again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1376-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1376-S1384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND HIGH TECHNOLOGY TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS ACT OF \n                                  2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). Under the previous order, the \nhour of 2 p.m. having arrived, the Senate will now proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 320, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 320) to make technical corrections in patent, \n     copyright, and trademark laws.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 1 \nhour of debate on the bill equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to discuss S. 320, the \nIntellectual Property and High Technology Technical Amendments Act, \nwhich I have worked on with my distinguished colleague, the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy. We have had a very \nproductive relationship in the Judiciary Committee in the area of high \ntechnology and intellectual property. Our bipartisan cooperation has \nresulted in much good legislation that has helped American consumers \nand businesses and which has encouraged American innovation and \ncreativity, including greater deployment of the Internet.\n  Some recent examples of our work include the following items:\n  The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, which authorized the \ncarriage of local television stations by satellite carriers, has \nbrought local television to thousands across the country who might not \nhave been able to get it before, and has brought competition in \nsubscription television services to many others who before could only \nchoose the local cable company. The passage last year of a loan \nguarantee program will help make the benefits of this law more widely \navailable.\n  The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act helps guard against \nfraudulent or pornographic websites that confuse, offend, or defraud \nunwitting online consumers who go to sites with famous business names \nonly to find that someone else is using that trademarked name in bad \nfaith under false pretenses. This law also helps protect the goodwill \nof American businesses that could be hurt by the bad faith misuse of \ntheir trademarked business name in ways that tarnish their\n\n[[Page S1377]]\n\nname or undermine consumer confidence in their brands.\n  The American Inventor Protection Act is helping to further serve \nAmerican innovators with more streamlined procedures at the United \nStates Patent and Trademark Office, and better organizing the Office so \nthat it will better serve its customers, American inventors. There are \nalso protections for inventors from unscrupulous businesses that prey \non small inventors who are not familiar with the procedures of \nobtaining a patent.\n  The Digital Millennium Copyright Act updated copyright law for the \nInternet, while striking a balance necessary to foster technological \ndevelopment and full deployment of the Internet. This law has set the \ngroundwork for entertainment convergence on a single interactive \nplatform where the consumer is king and can set his or her own schedule \nfor news, information, entertainment, communication, and so on.\n  Well, Madam President, this is just a sampling of what we have \nachieved together. And it is a prelude to what we can do in the future.\n  Today, we are here to discuss S. 320, the Intellectual Property and \nHigh Technology Technical Amendments Act. S. 320 is a technical \ncorrections bill to clean up some scrivener's errors that have crept \ninto the U.S. Code in the patent, trademark, and copyright laws. We, \nthe sponsors, believe it is to the benefit of smooth functioning of the \nlaw to clean up the Code to make it easier to use, and to more \naccurately reflect Congressional intent.\n  Specifically, the bill corrects typographical errors such as \nmisspellings, dropped or erroneous cross-references or punctuation \nerrors. It also makes consistent the titles of the U.S. Patent and \nTrademark Office and its officers. It also clarifies some unclear \ndrafting in the Code on some procedural matters at the USPTO, such as \nmaking it clear that if foreign trademark applicants fail to designate \na U.S. agent, the USPTO Commissioner is deemed to be that agent for \ndelivery of documents regarding that application; and ensuring that no \nprior art effect will be given to foreign patents or patent \napplications unless they are published in English. It makes it easier \nfor small inventors to sit on the USPTO Advisory Committee. These pro-\nAmerican inventor policies are codified now in the law, but not clearly \ndrafted. This bill makes them clearer.\n  All of these changes make the intellectual property laws of our \ncountry easier to use and understand for our constituents who invent, \ncreate, innovate and so serve our other citizens. It also makes the law \nclearer for those who use the inventions and creations of others. I \nbelieve there is no controversy about the provisions of this bill, and \nit clears the way for further Congressional action to foster the growth \nof our most innovative sector, our intellectual property sector.\n\n  With regard to that, Senator Leahy and I are releasing today our \njoint High Technology and Intellectual Property legislative agenda.\n  I would like to mention some of the items on that agenda and discuss \nsome of them briefly.\n  In the Internet Age, many basic questions need to be asked anew about \nthe relationships between the artists and the media companies that \nmarket and distribute their product; about the rights of consumers and \nfans to use works in new ways and the ability of technology companies \nand other mediators to assist them in those uses; and about the \naccessibility of works to scholars, students, or others for legitimate \npurposes. We need to continue to think about how the copyright system \napplies in the Internet world, where some of the assumptions \nunderpinning traditional copyright law may not be relevant, or need to \nbe applied by a proper analogy. Are there ways to clarify the rights \nand responsibilities of artists, owners, consumers, and users of \ncopyrighted works? How can we foster the continued convergence of \ninformation, entertainment, and communication services on a variety of \nplatforms and devices that will make life more enjoyable and \nconvenient? We need to encourage an open and competitive environment in \nthe production and distribution of content on the Internet.\n  As the Internet's new digital medium continues to grow, we must \nensure that consumers are confident that personally identifiable \ninformation which they submit electronically are afforded adequate \nlevels of privacy protection. As consumer confidence in the security of \ntheir personal and financial information is enhanced, Internet users \nwill be more willing to go online, make purchases over the Internet and \ngenerally provide personal information required by businesses and \norganizations over the Internet. At the same time, we must ensure that \nany initiatives have the least regulatory effect on the growth of e-\ncommerce and on commercial free speech rights protected by the \nConstitution. We expect to examine the adequacy of Internet privacy \nprotection and will, where necessary, advance reforms aimed at ensuring \ngreater privacy protection.\n  For example, the Committee expects to examine the following:\n  (1) How are privacy concerns impacting the growth of e-commerce, in \nthe financial services industry, in the insurance industry, in online \nretailing, etc., and the deployment of new technologies that could \nfurther the growth of, and consumer access to, the Internet?\n  (2) Does Congress need to amend criminal or civil rights laws to \naddress consumer electronic privacy concerns?\n  (3) Does U.S. encryption policy negatively affect the growth of e-\ncommerce?\n  (4) What is the impact of the European Union's Internet Privacy \nDirective on U.S. industry and e-commerce?\n  (5) Can Federal law enforcement, particularly civil rights enforcers, \nplay a larger role in safeguarding the privacy concerns of Internet \nusers?\n  (6) To what extent can web-sites and Government agencies track the \nInternet activities of individual users and what should be done to \nensure greater protection of personally identifiable or financially \nsensitive data?\n  We would like to work toward reforms that can more fully deploy the \nInternet to make educational opportunities more widely available to \nstudents in remote locations, to life-long learners, and to enhance the \neducational experience of all students.\n  The Internet can bring new experiences to remote locations. My own \nhome state of Utah has been experimenting with ways to bring the best \npossible educational experience to learners all across our state, some \nof whom live in remote rural areas, using wired technology. We would \nlike to see how we can further support efforts to harness the \ncommunicative power of the wired world on behalf of students across the \ncountry.\n  Science is advancing rapidly and the challenge to the patent system \nof genetics, biotechnology, and business method patents are daunting. \nWhole new subject matter areas are being exploited, from patents on \nbusiness methods from financial services to e-commerce tools on the \nInternet. Both the complexity and the sheer volume of patent \napplications are expanding exponentially. Recent Supreme Court \ndecisions have once again posed the question of state government \nresponsibility to respect and protect intellectual property rights. And \nI believe we need to review the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \nRestoration Act of 1984 to ensure that its balanced goals continue to \nbe met.\n  As many know, that act helped to create the modern generic drug \nindustry. It has been estimated that it has largely saved consumers $10 \nbillion every year since 1984. It is considered one of the most \nimportant consumer protection acts in the history of the country.\n  As the assignment of domain names transitions from a single company \nto a competitive, market-based system, we need to stay vigilant with \nregard to the significant antitrust and intellectual property \nramifications this process holds for American businesses and consumers. \nWe intend to build on our record of strengthening protection for online \nconsumers by protecting the trademarks consumers rely on in cyberspace, \nwhile also encouraging the full range of positive interactions the \nInternet makes possible. I think the Internet can be a place of \ninfinite variety while we continue to allow consumers to rely on brand \nnames they know in the e-commerce context. The world-wide nature of the \nInternet also heightens the need for the United States to join \ninternational efforts to make worldwide intellectual property\n\n[[Page S1378]]\n\nprotection, including that of trademarks, more efficient and effective \nfor Americans. In particular, I hope we can move ahead on the United \nStates accession to the Madrid Protocol.\n\n  I have always maintained that proper and timely enforcement of \nfederal antitrust laws can foster both competition and innovation, \nwhile minimizing the need for government regulation. This is an \nespecially important paradigm for the Internet. We need to carefully \nthink through the antitrust implications of Business-to-Business \nexchanges. We also need to consider carefully what remedies should be \nimposed in cases where antitrust violations do occur, notwithstanding \nthe generally dynamic and competitive nature of Internet-related \nindustries. We will also need to review the increasing legal tension in \nthe high technology industry between intellectual property rights and \nantitrust laws. There has always been a tension here, but in the \nInternet world, we need to be careful that intellectual property or \ncontent power is not leveraged into distribution power, or otherwise \nused in anticompetitive ways. Furthermore, the Internet poses new \nquestions about the competitive need to protect collections of data in \na way that preserves incentives for the creation of databases without \nunduly hampering the free flow of information in anticompetitive ways.\n  Access to new ``broadband'' technologies is increasingly important \nfor full deployment and enjoyment of the Internet. We will need to \nconsider the countervailing rights and duties of local phone companies \nand cable companies, either of which may provide broadband services in \na local area. Specifically, what rights of access to broadband lines \nshould competitors have, and what right to content should competitive \ndistribution services have?\n  The Internet is a radically new medium not just for commerce, but \nalso for speech, broadcasting and advertising. As we analogize from \ntraditional media such as broadcasting, we need to ask afresh what \nregulations make sense in this new medium, if any, and how do we cope \nwith different media competing toward largely the same goal, but with \ndiffering rules?\n  In summary Madam President, this non-controversial technical \ncorrections bill clears the way for an exciting agenda for the 107th \nCongress in the Judiciary Committee. I hope we can pass this bill \ntoday, and I look forward to working with my colleague from Vermont on \nthis most interesting and ambitious agenda.\n  In fact, I enjoy working with him. We have worked together all these \nyears, and I think maybe we can get more done this year than in the \npast. Hopefully, we can move these agendas forward in the best interest \nof all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on S. \n320?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Utah for his \ncomments. He and I have been working closely on an agenda for the \ncoming year for the Judiciary Committee. As always, the agenda will \nreflect not only the needs of the Senate, but the friendship that the \ntwo of us have had for well over 20 years.\n  I congratulate Senator Hatch for his continuing leadership in \nimproving our copyright, trademark, and patent law. Our intellectual \nproperty laws are important engines for our economy, fueling the \ncreative energy responsible for America's global leadership in the \nsoftware, movie, music, and high-tech industries.\n\n  The bill we considered today contains amendments recommended to us by \nthe Copyright Office. I commend the Register of Copyrights, Marybeth \nPeters, for the expertise she brings to her office and the assistance \nshe brings to us. At the end of my statement, I ask that a letter from \nMarybeth Peters in support of this legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Over the past years, Senator Hatch and I, and others on \nthe Judiciary Committee, have worked constructively and productively \ntogether on intellectual property matters. Just in the last Congress, \nwe were able to pass the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, \nthe Patent Fee Integrity and Innovation Protection Act, the Trademarks \nAmendments Act, the Satellite Home Viewers Improvements Act, and the \nAmerican Inventors Protection Act. These significant intellectual \nproperty matters were preceded by our work together forging a consensus \non the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Copyright Term Extension \nAct, the PTO Reauthorization Act, the Trademark Law Treaty \nImplementation Act, and many others. We and the other members of the \ncommittee have worked to ensure that divisive partisanship stays clear \nof this important area.\n  The proof of what we in Congress can accomplish when we put partisan \ndifferences aside, roll up our sleeves, and do the hard work or \ncrafting compromises is demonstrated by our record of legislative \nachievements on intellectual property matters.\n  I hope all Senators will look at what Senator Hatch and I have been \nable to do when we set aside partisan differences and make sure we do \nthings that work.\n  This bill makes technical corrections to and various non-substantive \nchanges in our intellectual property laws. Introduction and passage of \nthis bill is a good start for this Congress, but we must not lose sight \nof the other copyright, patent and trademark issues requiring our \nattention. The Senate Judiciary Committee has a full slate of \nintellectual property matters to consider. I am pleased to work on a \nbipartisan basis with the chairman on an agenda to provide the creators \nand inventors of copyrighted and patented works with the protection \nthey may need in our global economy, while at the same time providing \nlibraries, educational institutions, and other users with the clarity \nthey need as to what constitutes fair use of such work.\n\n  We have to realize things have changed. There has been a lot in the \npress in the past couple days about the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \ndecision in Napster. I suggest that if anyone thinks this is the end of \nthe whole issue, they are mistaken.\n  It is clear that creators and owners of copyrighted property should \nhave their copyrights protected, and they should certainly be \ncompensated for their artistry and their work.\n  Those who distribute or produce copyrighted material, including \nmovies, music, and books, have to realize their own business practices \nmay well have to change and be a lot different. Profit margins may \nchange, depending upon how it is done. Artists are not going to be \nbeholden just to a few mega distributors. With the Internet, they are \ngoing to be able to work out their own way of distributing their \nmaterial. They are going to be able to get themselves known if they \nwant, even if it is by distributing their music, movies, or books for \nfree.\n  It is a different world out there, but it is just one example of the \nkinds of issues we have to look at. Applying copyright principles to \nnew situations should not be done just by court-made law which is \nimprecise, at best, because a court is limited to the factual situation \nbefore it rather than a full panoply of circumstances, but can be done \nhere, recognizing we have a whole new way of doing things.\n  I remember when I was growing up in Montpelier, VT, my parents owned \na small printing business. We used either moveable type or hot lead \ntype. It was a laborious process. One thing I learned was not only to \nproofread in a hurry, but to read upside down and backward, as well as \nright side up and forward, because that is the way the letters work. It \nis a matter of consternation sometimes. People do not realize I am \nreading what is before me.\n  Now I look at the business, and there has been enormous change. It is \nless labor intensive in the setting up--it is not even type anymore, \nnow it is offset. It changes the whole economy, but opens up a whole \nnew world, all using different kinds of copyrighted material.\n  Among the things we should look at is protection from State \ninfringement.\n\n[[Page S1379]]\n\n In response to the Supreme Court's decisions in the Florida Prepaid \nand College Savings Bank cases, I introduced in the last Congress \nlegislation to restore Federal protection for intellectual property to \nguard against infringement by the States.\n  This is a reaction to an activist U.S. Supreme Court which held that \nStates and their institutions cannot be held liable for patent \ninfringement and other violations of the Federal intellectual property \nlaws, even though those same States can and do enjoy the full \nprotection of those laws for themselves.\n  Basically, the Supreme Court--it seemed to me anyway--seems to be \nwilling to rewrite the rule of law with regard to the Constitution, \ncertainly when it comes to telling States what they cannot do. We know \nthey are not hesitant to do that. The legislation I sponsored would \ncondition a State's ability to obtain new intellectual property rights \non its waiver of sovereign immunity in future intellectual property \nsuits.\n  It would also improve the limited remedies available to enforce a \nnonwaiving State's obligations under Federal law and the U.S. \nConstitution. This is a critical area in which the Congress should act.\n  Then we have distance education. The Senate Judiciary Committee held \na hearing in the last Congress on the Copyright Office's thorough and \nbalanced report on copyright and digital distance education, something \nthat can be very important to those of us from rural States where there \nmay be small schools.\n\n  While the distinguished Presiding Officer has metropolitan areas in \nher State, she also has very rural areas. Schools in rural areas may \nnot be able to hire the top math teacher, the top language teacher, or \nthe top science teacher, even though all these may be needed, but three \nor four of them together can do so if they are connected in such a way \nthat they can utilize this.\n  We need to address legislative recommendations outlined in the \nCopyright Office's report to ensure our laws permit the appropriate use \nof copyrighted works in valid distance learning activities. I know \nSenator Hatch shares my goal for the schools in this country, \nparticularly in rural areas. We can use this technology to maximize the \neducational experiences of our children.\n  It is an important area for the Judiciary Committee to examine. Not \neverybody comes from large schools. I had about 30 in my high school \ngraduating class. Interestingly, every 4 years, all 500 of those 30 \nstudents show up at my door saying they were a high school classmate; \ncould they please have a ticket to the Presidential inauguration.\n  We have the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act. I introduced \nlegislation in the last two Congresses to help American businesses, and \nespecially small and medium-sized companies, protect their trademarks \nas they go into international markets. The legislation would do so by \nconforming American trademark application procedures to the terms of \nthe Madrid protocol.\n  The Clinton administration transmitted the protocol to the Senate for \nits advise and consent last year. I regret we did not work on it \npromptly. I hope the new President will urge that action because \nratification by the United States of this treaty would help create a \none-stop international trademark registration process, an enormous \nbenefit for American businesses.\n  Next we have business method patents. The PTO has been subject to \ncriticism for granting patents for obvious routines which implement \nexisting business methods. The patent reform law that Senator Hatch and \nI worked out in the last Congress addressed one aspect of this matter: \nThe prior user defense at least protects those who previously practiced \nthat particular art. We should hold a hearing and engage the PTO in a \ndialog about this important issue to find out what you do with initial \npatents.\n  Frankly, I find patenting electronic business practices not that far \nremoved from the situation where two competing hardware stores in the \nspring put the seeds, the Rototillers, and whatnot out front and in the \nwinter put the snowblowers out front. Should one be allowed to patent \nthat process so in the summer its competitor would have to have its \nsnowblowers out front and could not put out lawn items? I think not. \nThat is what we are looking at, except now in a digital age.\n  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development criticized \nthe PTO for granting overly broad biotechnology patent protections. \nThis area, as well as the international protection of patent rights, \nwarrants examination and careful monitoring.\n  Then we have the issue of rural satellite television and Internet \nservice. It is important to the State of Vermont. It is important to \nevery rural community. It is certainly important to mine. I live in a \nhouse where I cannot get any television. I used to joke that I would \nget one and a quarter. I do not even get the quarter anymore. I cannot \nget anything, but I can if I have satellite television, and I can get \nmy Internet service the same way. Senator Hatch and I worked together \nto address this issue in the major Satellite Home Viewers Law passed \nlast Congress.\n  We authorized a rural loan guarantee program to help facilitate \ndeployment in rural areas. That law included a priority for loans that \noffered financing for high-speed Internet access. That is a great tool \nin eliminating the digital divide between urban and rural America.\n  So we want to make sure that gets done and done right.\n  The job of this Congress is to ensure that the administration gets \nthe job done so that those goals are met and the programs we have \nestablished are fully implemented.\n  The ninth circuit's ruling in the Napster case on Monday highlights \nthe tensions between new online tools and services and protection of \nintellectual property rights. In the long term, where it counts the \nmost, both sides--copyright holders and advocates for advances in new \ntechnology--can find victories in this ruling.\n  Nothing should stop the genius of a Shawn Fanning or those who come \nup with new online technologies like Napster.\n  While Napster customers may not initially see it that way, the \navailability of new music and other creative works--and its \ncontributions to the vibrancy of our culture and in fueling our \neconomy--depends on clearly understood and adequately enforced \ncopyright protection. The Court of Appeals has sent the case back to \nthe district court to ensure that the rights of creators are protected \nand that the online marketplace is just that, and not a free-for-all.\n  The exponential growth of Napster has proven that the Internet works \nwell to distribute music, but this case is a warning that copyrights \nmay not be ignored when new online services are deployed. The Internet \ncan and must serve the needs not only of Internet users and innovators \nof new technologies, but also of artists, songwriters, performers and \ncopyright holders. The Judiciary Committee should examine this issue \nclosely to ensure that our laws are working well to meet all these \nneeds.\n  Last Congress I introduced the Drug Competition Act of 2000, S. 2993, \nto give the Justice Department and the FTC the information they need to \nprevent anticompetitive practices which delay the availability of low-\ncost generic prescription drugs. I intend to re-introduce this bill \nsoon and work with my colleagues to enact it this year to help assure \nthat the availability of lower cost prescription drugs.\n  I noted upon passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998 \nthat there was not enough time before the end of that Congress to give \ndue consideration to the issue of database protection, and that I hoped \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee would hold hearings and consider \ndatabase protection legislation. Despite the passage of time, the \nJudiciary Committee has not yet held hearings on this issue.\n  I support legal protection against commercial misappropriation of \ncollections of information, but am sensitive to the concerns raised by \nthe libraries, certain educational institutions, and the scientific \ncommunity. This is a complex and important matter that I look forward \nto considering in this Congress.\n  Product identification codes provide a means for manufacturers to \ntrack their goods, which can be important to protect consumers in case \nof defective,\n\n[[Page S1380]]\n\ntainted, or harmful products and to implement product recalls. \nDefacing, removing, or tampering with product identification codes can \nthwart these tracking efforts, with potential safety consequences for \nAmerican consumers. We should examine the scope of, and legislative \nsolutions to remedy, this problem.\n  Senator Hatch and I worked together to pass cybersquatting \nlegislation in the last Congress to protect registered trademarks \nonline. This is an issue that has concerned me since the Congress \npassed the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, when I expressed my \nhope that the new law would ``help stem the use of deceptive Internet \naddresses taken by those who are choosing marks that are associated \nwith the products and reputations of others.'' (Congressional Record, \nDecember 29, 1995, page S19312).\n  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (I-CANN) has \nrecently added new top-level domain names and is negotiating contracts \nwith the new registries. Senator Hatch and I followed these \ndevelopments closely and together wrote to then Secretary of Commerce \nNorman Mineta on December 15, 2000, for the Commerce Department's \nassurances that the introduction of the new TLDs be achieved in a \nmanner that minimizes the abuses of trademark rights. The Judiciary \nCommittee has an important oversight role to play in this area.\n  We also will need to pay careful attention to the increasing \nconsolidation in the airline, telecommunications, petroleum, electric, \nagriculture, and other sectors of the economy to ensure that consumers \nare protected from anticompetitive practices. The Judiciary Committee \nhas already held one hearing on airline consolidation in this Congress \nand I stand ready to work with my colleagues on legislation to address \ncompetition problems.\n  I have already joined with the Democratic leader and several of my \ncolleagues on the Securing a Future for Independent Agriculture Act, S. \n20, to address the growing serious problem of consolidation in the \nagriculture processing sector. In addition, we need to carefully \nmonitor international efforts to harmonize competition law to ensure \nthat American companies and consumers are fairly treated and that our \nantitrust policies are not weakened.\n  This bill represents a good start on the work before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to update American intellectual property law to \nensure that it serves to advance and protect American interests both \nhere and abroad. The list of addititional copyright, patent, and \ntrademark issues that require our attention shows that we have a lot \nmore work to do.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                           Register of Copyrights,\n\n\n                                          Library of Congress,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 12, 2001.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I understand that you will be \n     sponsoring legislation in this Congress that will incorporate \n     last year's proposed Copyright Technical Corrections Act of \n     2000, H.R. 5106.\n       The Copyright Office proposed the technical corrections \n     that were included in H.R. 5106 to address some minor \n     drafting errors in the Intellectual Property and \n     Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999 and to correct some \n     other technical discrepancies in Title 17. None of these \n     proposed corrections are substantive.\n       I believe that it is important that the provisions of Title \n     17 be clear, and therefore I thank you for your leadership on \n     this legislation and hope that you will be successful in \n     obtaining its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Marybeth Peters,\n                                           Register of Copyrights.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 15 minutes 18 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I will tell everybody I do not intend to \nuse that whole time. I will use part of it.\n\n\n             The Ninth Circuit Decision in the Napster case\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I would like to take a few moments while \nwe are on the subject of copyright law to address the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals' long-awaited decision in the Napster case. I have \nbeen considering the opinion for the last few days, and it may be some \ntime before all of us grasp its full implications. I believe the \nJudiciary Committee will need to hold hearings on the decision's \npossible implications and to get an update on developments in the \nonline music market. I will consult with my ranking member and other \ninterested parties, and will likely look into the matter in the coming \nweeks.\n  As I have considered the case over the last couple of days, I have \nbeen troubled by the possible practical problems that may arise from \nthis decision. I am troubled as a strong supporter and prime author of \nmuch of our copyright law and intellectual property rights.\n  By ordering the lower court to impose a preliminary injunction--\nbefore a trial on the merits, mind you--on this service that had \ndeveloped a community of over 50 million music fans, it could have the \neffect of shutting down Napster entirely, depriving more than 50 \nmillion consumers access to a music service they have enjoyed. The \nNapster community represents a huge consumer demand for the kind of \nonline music services Napster, rightly or wrongly, has offered and, to \ndate, the major record labels have been unable to satisfy. Now, I \nunderstand that the labels have been working hard to get offerings \nonline, and I have seen some projects beginning recently. I have been \npromised consumer roll-outs this year. But these offerings have been \nslow in coming and have not been broadly deployed as of yet. I hope \ndeployment will be speeded up to meet the unsatisfied demand that may \nbe caused by interruptions in Napster service as the litigation \ncontinues through trial on the merits and appeals.\n  I am longtime advocate of strong intellectual property laws. There is \nsomething in our legal system called copyright, and the principle \nunderlying copyright is a sound one. I believe that artists Must be \ncompensated for their creativity. And I believe that Napster as it \ncurrently operates, threatens this principle. I authored Digital \nMillennium Copyright Act, which has ensured that, as a general matter, \ncopyright law should apply to the Internet. I am proud of my work in \nfurtherance of that Act. I have mentioned Senator Leahy in particular, \nand there others as well.\n  Yet, I also believe that the compensation principle underlying \ncopyright can coexist--and has in fact coexisted--with society's \nevolving technologies for generations. And, in each case this \ncoexistence has benefited both the copyright owner and the consumer, in \nwhat you might call an expansion of the pie, in other words.\n  So let's turn to the present controversy. It might be helpful to \nreview some facts. In the span of about one and a half years, Napster \nhas seen its client software downloaded more than 62 million times. \nOver 8 million people a day log onto the Napster service. At any one \ntime there may be as many as 1.7 million people simultaneously using \nthe service. It is, quite simply, a virtual community of unprecedented \nreach and scale. It is the most popular application in the history of \nthe Internet and, I have to say, in the history of music.\n  It is also free and, unfortunately, according to the court, it is \nprobably facilitating copyright infringement. The major labels, which \naccount for over 80 percent of the CD's sold in this country, is \nrightly shaken by the Napster phenomenon. Although the industry saw its \nsales increase by 4.4 percent in the year 2000, it believes it would \nhave sold more CD's had it not been for Napster. And the district court \nand Court of Appeals agreed with them. The labels have, as is their \nright under the laws--many of which I have authored--pursued legal \nredress through out judicial system. Were I in their shoes, I question \nwhether I would have taken a different course of action.\n  Now the parties have brought their dispute to the point where the \nerosion of the copyright laws might be the frightening outcome.\n  I am particularly troubled because, if the popular Napster service, \nwhich has a relationship with one of the major record companies, \nBertelsmann, is shut down, and no licensed online services exist to \nfill this consumer demand, I fear that this consumer demand will be\n\n[[Page S1381]]\n\nfilled by Napster clones, particularly ones like Gnutella or Freenet, \nwhich have no central server, and no central business office with which \nto negotiate a marketplace licensing arrangement. Such a development \nwould further undermine the position of copyright law online, and the \nposition of artists in the new digital world that the Internet is \ndeveloping.\n\n  Furthermore, if past experience is any indication, I would expect \nthat my colleagues, like me, will be contacted by the over 50 million \nNapster fans who oppose the injunction and fear the demise of Napster. \nThis may prompt a legislative response. I know that people in Congress \nare weighing various legislative solutions, some intriguing, some \ntroubling and counter to the pubic interest.\n  Some of these responses could strike the important intellectual \nproperty rights of artists and copyright owners online entirely, \nundoing the carefully balanced development I have tried to foster over \nthe years, and possibly harming consumers as well as creators in the \nlong run.\n  I guess my feeling about this Ninth Circuit decision is a gnawing \nconcern that this legal victory for the record labels may prove pyrrhic \nor short-sighted from a policy perspective. Some have suggested that \nthe labels merely wished to establish a legal precedent and then would \nbe willing to work on negotiating licenses. Well, it seems to me that \nnow might be a good time to get those deals done, for the good of music \nfans, and for the good of the copyright industries and the artists they \nrepresent.\n  I have long been an advocate for strong intellectual property rights \nprotection and enforcement. I have urged the labels and composers and \npublishers working out synergistic arrangements with online music \ndistributors and Internet technologist that will serve the artists and \ntheir audience. Such synergy is possible. I was pleased when \nBertelsmann took the initiative in harnessing the consumer demand \nevidenced by Napster and decided to work cooperatively together to \ndevelop a service that would benefit both of them and those they seek \nto serve, the artists and music fans. I again urge the other major \nmusic industry players to take significant steps toward this end, and \nagain, I think now is a good time to do it. I have recently discussed \nmy views with some of the interested parties, and I believe there is \nsome interest in working this out for the benefit of all parties, \nincluding consumers and creators. I stand ready, willing and able to \ntry to help them in this matter.\n  Last July, the Committee held its first of two hearings on the \nsubject. At this hearing, I was joined by my colleague and friend, the \ndistinguished ranking member and former chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy. The two of us encouraged a marketplace \nresolution to the Napster, and the other, digital music controversies.\n  I think working together in the marketplace cooperatively will lead \nto the best result for all parties, the record labels, the online music \nservices, the artists and the music fans. I hope the focus will be on \nthe latter two. After all, without artists, there is nothing to convey, \nand without the fans, there is no one to convey it to. I think keeping \nthe focus on the artists and the audience can help the technologists \nand the copyright industries find a way for all to flourish. And I hope \nthis opportunity is taken before it is lost.\n  I hope this opportunity is taken before it is lost. I wanted to make \nthese remarks on the floor, and I hope we can resolve these problems in \na way that benefits artists, consumers, publishers, and others who are \ninterested in this matter. I think if we get together and work this \nout, it will be in the best interests of everybody.\n  I am prepared to yield my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I yield whatever time remains.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield my time as well. We can proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The bill having been read for \nthe third time, the question is, Shall the bill pass?

Mr. President, I take this time to respond to those who \nare suggesting we put off, or even cancel, the deployment of a national \nmissile defense system.\n  One reason the critics of the program are giving for delay is the \nalleged opposition of our allies, particularly those in Europe. Earlier \nthis month at the Munich Conference on International Security, \nSecretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld made a forceful case for \ndeployment of a defense against strategic ballistic missiles. He \nexplained the rationale for our missile defense program, and he also \nmade it clear that this administration intends to deploy such a system \nas soon as possible.\n  He told those attending the conference that deploying a missile \ndefense system was a moral issue because ``no U.S. President can \nresponsibly say his defense policy is calculated and designed to leave \nthe American people undefended against threats that are known to \nexist.''\n  Former Secretary of State Kissinger, who negotiated the 1972 Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty, also spoke at the conference. He said a U.S. \nPresident cannot allow a situation in which ``extinction of civilized \nlife is one's only strategy.''\n  The response from our European allies was very encouraging. For \nmonths, critics have been saying that our allies firmly oppose our \nplans to deploy missile defenses and would never go along with them. \nBut the Secretary General of NATO, George Robertson, said:\n\n\n[[Page S1385]]\n\n\n       Now the Europeans have to accept that the Americans really \n     intend to go ahead. . . . Now that the question of \n     ``whether'' it's going to happen has been settled, I want an \n     engagement inside NATO between the Americans and other allies \n     about the ``how'' and the ``when.''\n\n  With respect to the threat, Secretary General Robertson said:\n\n       The interesting point is that there is now a recognition by \n     leaders--American, European, and even Russian--that there is \n     a new threat from the proliferation of ballistic missiles \n     that has got to be dealt with. The Americans have said how \n     they're going to deal with it. The Europeans are being \n     offered a chance to share in that.\n\n  Robertson also added:\n\n       The concept of mutually assured destruction is obsolete. \n     The old equation no longer works out: Russia and the United \n     States in a balance of terror. Now there are groups and \n     States acquiring missile technology and warheads with great \n     facility. We are living in a dangerous new world.\n\n  Germany's views are also changing. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, \naddressing fellow Social Democratic Party members, said recently, ``We \nshould be under no illusions that that there will be no difference of \nopinion with the new American leadership under President George W. \nBush. First and foremost, it won't be about the planned National \nMissile Defense program but about trade policy issues. Differences over \nNMD are not the decisive factor in the German-American relationship.'' \nGerman Foreign Minister Fischer said that NMD ``above all is a national \ndecision for the United States.'' In Moscow this week, he said, ``in \nthe end, the Russians are going to accept it somehow.''\n  Here in Washington last week, Britain's Foreign Secretary said, ``On \nthe question of what happens if national missile defense proceeds; if \nit means the U.S., feels more secure and therefore feels more able to \nassert itself in international areas of concern to us, we would regard \nthat as a net gain in security.'' And the Prime Minister of Canada, who \njust a few months ago had joined Russian President Putin in calling for \npreservation of the ABM Treaty, said last week after consulting with \nPresident Bush, ``Perhaps we are in a different era.''\n  The Australian Foreign Minister noted last week that until now,\n\n       A lot of the debate has been directed at the United States. \n     I frankly think an awful lot of the debate should instead be \n     directed not only toward those countries that have got or are \n     developing these missile systems but the countries that have \n     been transferring that missile technology to others. . . . If \n     there were no missiles, there would be no need for a missile \n     defense system.\n\n  Dr. Javier Solana of Spain, former Secretary-General of NATO and now \nthe director of foreign policy for the European Union, said ``The \nUnited States has the right to deploy'' an NMD system. Of the ABM \nTreaty, the so-called ``cornerstone of strategic stability,'' Dr. \nSolana said, ``It is not the Bible.''\n  The words we now hear from our European and other important allies \nare signaling changed attitudes. I think they have been influenced by \nthe Bush administration's willingness to confront the NMD issue \nsquarely, to consult fully with our allies, and to make clear a \ndetermination to protect this nation and its allies from long-range \nballistic missile attack. The best ally is a strong one, and the \nactions of the Bush administration are an overdue reassurance that the \nUnited States will indeed be a strong alliance partner.\n  Of course, not every nation welcomes our NMD plans. France still has \nnot embraced the concept, and Russia and China continue their \nopposition. But this shouldn't change our plans to deploy missile \ndefenses. Our action threatens no nation, although it will create an \nobstacle for those who would threaten the U.S. Those who mean us no \nharm have nothing to fear from this purely defensive system; those who \ndo mean us harm will learn that the United States will no longer commit \nitself to continuing vulnerability.\n  Another reason for proceeding as soon as possible to deploy missile \ndefenses to protect the United States was highlighted last week in \ntestimony presented to the Senate by the Director of Central \nIntelligence, George Tenet.\n  He said, ``we cannot underestimate the catalytic role that foreign \nassistance has played in advancing . . . missile and WMD programs, \nshortening the development times, and aiding production.'' He noted \nthat it is increasingly difficult to predict those timelines, saying \n``The missile and WMD proliferation problem continues to change in ways \nthat make it harder to monitor and control, increasing the risks of \nsubstantial surprise.'' Director Tenet went on to say, ``It is that \nforeign assistance piece that you have to have that very precise \nintelligence to understand, and sometimes you get it and sometimes you \ndon't.'' Because of the difficulty monitoring foreign assistance, \nDirector Tenet added that ``these time lines all become illusory.''\n\n  He also noted that it is a mistake to think of nations who aspire to \nobtain missiles as technologically unsophisticated: ``We are not \ntalking about unsophisticated countries. When you talk about Iraq and \nIran, people need to understand these are countries with sophisticated \ncapabilities, sophisticated technology, digital communications.''\n  And the danger does not stop when one of these nations acquires the \ntechnology that is now so freely available. Mr. Tenet warned about what \nhe termed ``secondary proliferation'':\n\n       There is also great potential for secondary proliferation, \n     for maturing state-sponsored programs such as those in \n     Pakistan, Iran and India. Add to this group the private \n     companies, scientists and engineers in Russia, China and \n     India who may be increasing their involvement in these \n     activities taking advantage of weak or unenforceable national \n     export controls and the growing availability of technologies. \n     These trends have continued, and in some cases have \n     accelerated over the past year.\n\n  The Director of Central Intelligence added, ``So you know, the kind \nof technology flows that we see from big states to smaller states and \nthen the inclination of those people who do the secondary proliferation \nI think is what's most worrisome to me.''\n  Some who oppose missile defense deployment point to diplomatic \ninitiatives and political change as evidence that the threat is \ndiminishing. For example, they point to recent efforts by North Korea's \nleader Kim Jong Il to present a more open face to the world. But \naccording to the Director of Central Intelligence, little has actually \nchanged with respect to North Korea's proliferation activities. For \nexample, he testified,\n\n       Pyongyang's bold diplomatic outreach to the international \n     community and engagement with South Korea reflect a \n     significant change in strategy. The strategy is designed to \n     assure the continued survival of Kim Jong Il by ending \n     Pyongyang's political isolation and fixing the North's \n     failing economy by attracting more aid. We do not know how \n     far Kim will go in opening the North, but I can report to you \n     that we have not yet seen a significant diminution of the \n     threat from North to American and South Korean interests.\n       Pyongyang still believes that a strong military, capable of \n     projecting power in the region, is an essential element of \n     national power. Pyongyang's declared military-first policy \n     requires massive investment in the armed forces, even at the \n     expense of other national objectives . . . [T]he North Korean \n     military appears, for now, to have halted its near decade-\n     long slide in military capabilities. In addition to the \n     North's longer-range missile threat to us, Pyongyang is also \n     expanding its short- and medium-range missile inventory, \n     putting our allies at risk.\n\n  Similar claims about diminishing threats have been made about Iran. A \nyear ago, those who oppose missile defense were suggesting that because \nof the election of reform-minded leaders we need no longer worry about \nthat country obtaining more capable missiles. Here is what the Director \nof Central Intelligence had to say about Iran in his testimony last \nweek:\n\n       Iran has one of the largest and most capable ballistic \n     missile programs in the Middle East. It's public statements \n     suggest that it plans to develop longer-range rockets for use \n     in a space-launch program. But Tehran could follow the \n     North Korean pattern and test an ICBM capable of \n     delivering a light payload to the United States in the \n     next few years . . .\n       Events in the past year have been discouraging for positive \n     change in Iran. . . . Prospects for near-term political \n     reform in the near term are fading. Opponents of reform have \n     not only muzzled the open press, they have also arrested \n     prominent activists and blunted the legislature's powers. \n     Over the summer, supreme leader Khamenei ordered the new \n     legislature not to ease press restrictions, a key reformist \n     pursuit, that signaled the narrow borders within which he \n     would allow the legislature to operate.\n\n  I hope that reformers do make gains in Iran, although senior CIA \nofficials have testified that Iranian ``reformers''--such as President \nKhatemi--are enthusiastic about acquiring ballistic missiles. I hope \nIran will one day be a thriving democracy. But that day has not \narrived, and our security policy cannot be based on hope.\n\n[[Page S1386]]\n\n  We need missile defense not just because of the capabilities of \nparticular countries, but because of the larger problem: The \nproliferation of missile technology has created a world in which we can \nno longer afford to leave ourselves vulnerable to an entire class of \nweapons. Remaining vulnerable only guarantees that some nation will \nseize upon this vulnerability and take the United States and our allies \nby surprise.\n  The Bush administration's resolve to deploy missile defenses is an \nessential first step in modernizing our national security assets. \nBecause of the neglect our missile defense program has suffered over \nthe last eight years, we now face a threat against which we will have \nno defense for several years. Because of decisions made by the previous \nadministration, the only long-range missile defense we have in the \nnear-term will be the ground-based system planned for initial \ndeployment in Alaska. Additional resources must be provided so that \nother technologies and basing modes can be developed and tested. But \nnow, we must move forward as fast as we can with the technology we have \ntoday. We must not prolong our vulnerability by waiting for newer and \nbetter technology. Therefore, it is important that the administration \nimmediately begin construction of the NMD radar at Shemya, AK. \nConstruction of the national missile defense radar at Shemya, AK, \nshould begin immediately.\n  Construction of this radar was to have begun this May, but last \nSeptember President Clinton postponed the decision to proceed, citing \ndelays with other elements of the system and a lack of progress in \nconvincing Russia to modernize the ABM Treaty to permit NMB deployment. \nHowever, construction of the Shemya radar is the so-called ``long-\nlead'' item in deployment of the NMD system; it is the step that takes \nthe longest and must begin the soonest. Delaying construction of the \nNMD radar means delaying deployment of the entire system, and we cannot \nafford more unnecessary delays in this program.\n  There is still time to recover from the delays caused by President \nClinton's postponement last fall. The radar design is complete, the \nfunds have been appropriated, and any missile defense system we build \nwill have to begin with an X-band radar at Shemy. So we should get on \nwith it.\n  Beginning construction of the Shemya radar will be a demonstration of \nthe determination of our government to fulfill its first constitutional \nduty, which is to provide for the security of our Nation. It will send \nan unmistakable signal to all--friend or potential foe--that the United \nStates will not remain vulnerable any longer to those who threaten us \nwith ballistic missiles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

COVERDELL\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, many of us in the Senate still greatly miss \nour distinguished and honorable colleague from Georgia, Paul Coverdell. \nThere are not many days that go by that I do not think about him when I \nam working in this Chamber and in my office. We really have been \ngrieving and thinking an awful lot about him over the months since his \nunfortunate early passing away as a result of his problems last year \nwhen he had a cerebral hemorrhage.\n  He was an extraordinary public servant. We all wanted to find a way \nto express our sorrow and to appropriately honor him. In that vein, I \nwanted to make sure we did not just have a rush to judgment of what we \nmight try to do to honor him--doing it in several little ways but never \nan appropriate way.\n  After discussion on both sides of the aisle and getting approval of \nthe Democratic leader, I asked four of our colleagues to serve as an \ninformal task force to come up with an appropriate way to honor Senator \nCoverdell. These four Senators, two from each side of the aisle, were \ngood friends and worked closely with Paul. They had a personal interest \nin it.\n  I thank Senator Gramm of Texas, Senator DeWine of Ohio, Senator Harry \nReid of Nevada, and Senator Zell Miller of Georgia for taking the time \nto think about this, meeting together and coming up with ideas of how \nto appropriately honor Senator Coverdell.\n  That is how this bill came into being. A lot of ideas were \nconsidered. They were discussed with Senator Coverdell's former staff \nmembers, family, particularly his wife, and they came up with the \nsuggestion that is included in this bill.\n  I thank Senator Daschle and Senator Reid for being willing to be \ninvolved in this process. As a result of their efforts, we now have a \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1386-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1386-S1387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--A BILL HONORING PAUL D.

Coverdell by naming the Peace Corps headquarters \nafter our former colleague. I further ask unanimous consent that the \nbill be read the third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves the right to object.\n  Mr REID. As the majority leader has indicated, a significant amount \nof time has been spent on this matter. I remember as if it was \nyesterday Senator Lott coming on the floor and making the announcement. \nIt was a sad day in the history of this Senate, in the history of the \nState of Georgia, and certainly our country.\n  Those of us who knew Senator Coverdell know how closely he was \nassociated with the majority leader and how he loved this institution. \nWhat the leader has said is very true. I worked with Senator Miller, \nSenator Gramm, and Senator DeWine to come up with something that is \nappropriate. We think we have done that.\n  I do, though, have to object for one of the other Members of the \nSenate. It is something which is procedural in nature. I am confident \nwe can work this out. I ask that the leader be understanding and that \nthis matter be brought up after we get back from our next recess. I am \nconfident in that period of time we will take care of the kinks. I \nwould rather we do it that way than pass pieces of it.\n  I talked with Senator Gramm and Senator Miller, and we agreed to do \nit all at once rather than piecemeal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada objects.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, while I feel the objection is certainly \nunfortunate, I know that Senator Reid wants to find a way to work \nthrough the problem that may exist. I will be glad to work with him and \nSenator Miller.\n  Senator Miller has been very generous with his time and very \ncommitted to this process. I talked with him a couple of times--just \nyesterday--to try to work through this. It is my expectation we will be \nable to clear this bill and take it up for consideration. It really is \nnoncontroversial, and I believe it should be passed by unanimous \nconsent.\n  I hope Members who do have a problem, or if there is a procedural \nproblem, will find a way to work through it so we can honor this noble \nand respected Member. I invite Senator Reid and any others to comment \non the process, and if they have any remedy they can suggest, I am \nanxious to hear from them. I know effort is already underway to do \nthat, and I know they will continue.\n  It will be my intent to file cloture on this matter if it is \nnecessary prior to the recess of the Senate this week. I hope and \nexpect we will not have to do that, but because of the requirements of \nS. Res. 8, if I have to file cloture, I will have to wait the requisite \n12 hours now before filing the cloture on an amendable item, so I will \nhave to begin the process.\n  Rather than leave it in that vein, I prefer we talk and we work this \nout and find a way to get it cleared and agreed to tomorrow before we \nleave for the Presidents Day recess.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the leader's comments. I would appreciate very \nmuch the leader not filing cloture. We do not need that or want that on \nthis piece of legislation.\n\n[[Page S1387]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

He has been \ninvolved for a number of years.\n  He serves as head of a bipartisan group of Senators who have been to \nRussia on behalf of the Senate, who have met with representatives from \nthe government, the Duma of Russia, when they have been in the United \nStates.\n  To put this in a positive way and note that President Bush intends to \ngo forward with it when it is ready to be deployed and that we be \nprepared to have a serious discussion about it is fine, but I thank him \nfor the way he has been involved in this issue and express my \nconfidence that as we move forward on this very important defense item \nfor our future, I know he will be involved in that.\n  I feel very good that President Bush and Secretary of Defense \nRumsfeld will approach this matter in an appropriate way, with our \ndefense budget funding but also in the way it is handled with our \nallies. I look forward to working together in the future on this \nimportant issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1387-3", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1387-S1388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join in \ncommemorating African-American History Month and particularly this \nyear's theme, ``Creating and Defining the African-American Community: \nFamily, Church, Politics and Culture.''\n  Since 1926, the month of February has served as a time for our \ncitizens to recognize and applaud the vast contributions made by \nAfrican-Americans to the founding and building of this great Nation. \nThe vision of the noted author and scholar, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, led \nto this important annual celebration. As we note the theme of this \nyear's Black History Month celebration, it is important to recognize \nthe challenges ahead for African-Americans in a new age.\n  From early days, the family has been the backbone of the African-\nAmerican culture in our country. Through a strong and stable family \nstructure, African-Americans found companionship, love, and an \nunderstanding of the suffering endured during oppressive periods in \nhistory. The African-American family has served to strengthen and \nencourage young African-Americans to forge ahead to break barriers and \nrise to new heights within American culture.\n  The unemployment rate for African-Americans has fallen from 14.2 \npercent in 1992 to 8.3 percent in 1999, the lowest annual level on \nrecord. The median household income of African-Americans is up 15.1 \npercent since 1993, from $22,034 in 1993 to $25,351 in 1998. Real wages \nof African-Americans have risen rapidly in the past two years, up about \n5.8 percent for men and 6.2 percent for women since 1996.\n  The African-American poverty rate has dropped from 33.1 percent in \n1993 to 26.1 percent in 1998, the lowest level ever recorded and the \nlargest five-year drop in more than twenty-five years. Since 1993, the \nchild poverty rate among African-Americans has dropped from 46.1 \npercent to 36.7 percent in 1998. While still too large, this represents \nthe largest five-year drop on record. It is critical that we in \nCongress continue to work to enact legislation that will further \nstrengthen African-American families and enable these rates to continue \nto decrease at record levels.\n  Religion, like family, has played a vital role in African-American \nlife in this country, with the Black Church a substantial and enduring \npresence. Throughout the early period of our Nation's development, \nAfrican-Americans established their own religious institutions. \nAlthough these institutions were not always formally recognized, it \nshould be noted that the African Methodist Episcopal Church was founded \nin 1787, followed closely by the African Baptist Church in 1788. \nThroughout our Nation's history, the Black Church has served as both a \nstabilizing influence and as a catalyst for needed change.\n  During slavery, the African-American Church was a place of spiritual \nsanctuary and community. After Blacks were freed, the Church remained a \nline of defense and comfort against racism. The Black Church served as \nan agency of social reorientation and reconstruction, providing \nreinforcement for the values of marriage, family, morality, and \nspirituality in the face of the corrosive effects of discrimination.\n  The Black Church became the center for economic cooperation, pooling \nresources to buy churches, building mutual aid societies which provided \nsocial services, purchasing and helping resettle enslaved Africans, and \nestablishing businesses. From its earliest days as an invisible \nspiritural community, the Black Church supported social change and \nstruggle, providing leaders and leadership at various points in the \nstruggle against racism and discrimination.\n  The civil rights movement of the 1960s provided the catalyst for \nAfrican-Americans to move into the political arena. Three major factors \nencouraged the beginning of this new movement for civil rights. First, \nmany African-Americans served with honor in World War II, as they had \nin many wars since the American revolution. However, in this instance, \nAfrican-American leaders pointed to the records of these veterans to \nshow the injustice of racial discrimination against patriots. Second, \nmore and more African-Americans in the North had made economic gains, \nincreased their education, and registered to vote. Third, the NAACP had \nattracted many new members and received increased financial support \nfrom all citizens.\n  In addition, a young group of energetic lawyers, including Thurgood \nMarshall, of Baltimore, Maryland, used the legal system to bring about \nimportant changes in the lives of African-Americans, while Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr. appealed to the conscience of all citizens. When \nCongress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act \nof 1965, Clarence Mitchell, Jr., of Maryland, played a critical part in \nsteering this legislation through Congress.\n  African-Americans began to assume more influential roles in the \nFederal Government as a result of the civil rights movement, a \ndevelopment which benefitted the entire Nation. In 1966, Dr. Robert C. \nWeaver became the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the first \nBlack Cabinet Member and Edward Brooke became the first African-\nAmerican elected to the Senate since reconstruction. In 1967, Thurgood \nMarshall became the first Black Justice on the Supreme Court. In 1969, \nShirley Chisholm of New York became the first Black woman to serve in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n  Progress continued in the next three decades. In 1976, Patricia \nHarris became the first Black woman Cabinet Member and in 1977 when \nClifford Alexander was confirmed as the first Black Secretary of the \nArmy. In 1989, Douglas Wilder of Virginia became the first elected \nAfrican-American Governor in the Nation. In 1992, Carol Moseley-Braun \nbecame the first African-American female U.S. Senator. In 1993, Ron \nBrown became the first African-American Secretary of Commerce, Jesse \nBrown became the first African-American Secretary of the Veterans \nAdministration, and Hazel O'Leary became the first black Secretary of \nEnergy. In 1997, Rodney Slater became the first African-American \nSecretary of Transportation and Alexis Herman became the first African-\nAmerican Secretary of Labor. In 2001, Roderick Paige became the first \nAfrican-American Secretary of Education and General Colin Powell, in \naddition to being the first African-American Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, became the first U.S. Secretary of State.\n  African-Americans have played significant roles in influencing and \nchanging American life and culture. Through such fields as arts and \nentertainment,\n\n[[Page S1388]]\n\nthe military, politics and civil rights, African-Americans have been \nkey to the progress and prosperity of our Nation. Blacks have \ncontributed to the artistic and literary heritage of America from the \nearly years to the present. They have influenced the field of music as \ncomposers, vocalists, and instrumentalists and played a seminal role in \nthe emergence of blues, jazz, gospel, and rhythm and blues.\n  Although African-Americans owned and published newspapers in the 19th \ncentury, their achievements in the communications industry have been \nmost noted in the 20th century, when they produced and contributed to \nmagazines, newspapers, and television and radio news and talk shows in \nunprecedented numbers. There are now hundreds of Black-owned radio \nstations throughout the country. While integrated into professional \nsports relatively recently, African-American athletes have reached the \nhighest levels of accomplishment. They also comprise some of the finest \nathletes representing the United States in the Olympic Games.\n  As we move into the new Millenium, we look forward to the continued \ngrowth and prosperity of African-American citizens. Our Nation's \nhistory is replete with the contributions of African-Americans. Black \nHistory Month affords all Americans an opportunity to celebrate the \ngreat achievements of African-Americans, to celebrate how far this \nNation has come, and to remind us of how far we have to go.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1388-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DR. BENJAMIN ELIJAH MAYS\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring the country's \nattention to one of its most gifted educators, civil rights leaders and \ntheologians, the late Dr. Benjamin Elijah Mays, and to again encourage \nthe President to award Dr. Mays a Presidential Medal of Freedom. Dr. \nMays lived an extraordinary life that began in a very unextraordinary \nsetting. The son of slaves, Dr. Mays grew up in the rural community of \nEpworth, South Carolina where poverty and racism were everyday \nrealities and the church was sometimes the only solace to be found. \nYet, as the title of Dr. Mays' autobiography, ``Born to Rebel'' \nreveals, he was never satisfied with the status quo and looked to \neducation as the key to his own success, and later the key to sweeping \nsocial change.\n  After working his way through South Carolina College, Bates College \nand a doctoral program at the University of Chicago, Dr. Mays worked as \na teacher, an urban league representative and later dean of the School \nof Religion at Howard University here in Washington. Then, in 1940, he \ntook the reins at Morehouse College and--to borrow a phrase--the rest \nwas history. As President of Morehouse, Dr. Mays took an ailing \ninstitution and transformed it into one of America's most vital \nacademic centers and an epicenter for the growing civil rights \nmovement. He was instrumental in the elimination of segregated public \nfacilities in Atlanta and promoted the cause of nonviolence through \npeaceful student protests in a time often marred by racial violence. \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and other influential 20th century leaders \nconsidered Dr. Mays a mentor and scores of colleges and universities--\nfrom Harvard University to Lander University in South Carolina--have \nacknowledged his impressive achievements by awarding him an honorary \ndegree.\n  After retiring from Morehouse after 27 years, Dr. Mays did not fade \nfrom the spotlight--far from it. He served as president of the Atlanta \nBoard of Education for 12 years, ensuring that new generations of \nchildren received the same quality education he had fought so hard to \nobtain back in turn-of-the-century South Carolina. Dr. Mays said it \nbest in his autobiography: ``Foremost in my life has been my honest \nendeavors to find the truth and proclaim it.'' Now is the time for us \nto proclaim Dr. Benjamin Mays one of our nation's most distinguished \ncitizens by awarding him a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1388-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ASYLUM AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before leaving office, Attorney General \nReno ordered the Board of Immigration Appeals to reconsider its \ndecision to reject the asylum claim of a Guatemalan domestic violence \nvictim. I applaud the former Attorney General for her actions in this \ncase, entitled Matter of R.A., and I encourage the Bush Administration \nto continue with her efforts to provide a safe harbor for victims of \nsevere domestic abuse.\n  The facts of the R.A. case are chilling. Ms. Rodi Alvarado Pena \nsought asylum after suffering from unthinkable abuse at the hands of \nher husband in her native Guatemala, abuse that ended only when she \nescaped to the United States in 1995. She said that her husband raped \nand pistol-whipped her, and beat her unconscious in front of her \nchildren. She said that law enforcement authorities in Guatemala told \nher that they would not protect her from violent crimes committed \nagainst her by her husband. And she believed that her husband would \nkill her if she returned to Guatemala.\n  The INS did not dispute what Ms. Pena said, and in 1996, an \nimmigration judge determined that she was entitled to asylum. But in \n1999, the Board of Immigration Appeals (``BIA'') reversed that decision \non the grounds that even if everything Ms. Pena said were true, she did \nnot qualify for asylum because victims of domestic abuse do not \nconstitute a ``social group'' under existing law. This decision seemed \nto me and a number of other Senators and Representatives to be \ninconsistent with previous decisions extending asylum to victims of \nsexual abuse. I wrote Doris Meissner, then the Commissioner of the INS, \nin August 1999 to express my concerns about the case. I joined a group \nof Senators writing Attorney General Reno about this matter in November \n1999, and raised those concerns again in letters to the Attorney \nGeneral in February and September 2000. Finally, I reiterated my \nconcerns to Ms. Meissner in August 2000.\n  The Justice Department released a proposed rule in December that \nwould make it easier for women to base asylum petitions on gender-based \npersecution. Then-Attorney General Reno's January 19 order stays the \nR.A. case until a final version of that rule is approved, at which time \nthe BIA will reconsider the case in light of that rule. I urge the Bush \nAdministration to approve a final rule that provides strong protections \nfor victims of domestic violence and other forms of gender-based \noppression. And I urge the BIA to apply that rule in a way that \nprovides the maximum protection for such women.\n  The United States should have--and I believe does have--a bipartisan \ncommitment to refugees. I have been joined by Republicans such as \nSenators Brownback and Jeffords in my attempts to draw attention to \nthis case. And I am optimistic that the Bush Administration will share \nour concerns. No one wants to see a victim of domestic violence \nreturned to face further abuse, especially where her government does \nnot have the will or ability to protect her. Working together, and \nbuilding on the foundation laid by Attorney General Reno, we can \nprevent that from happening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1388-3", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1388-S1389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO FORMER SENATOR ALAN CRANSTON\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I join many of my colleagues in \npaying tribute to former Senator Alan Cranston, who died on New Year's \nEve, 2000. Since I came to the Senate in 1985, I have had the honor of \nserving on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and my first 8 years on \nthe committee were under the superb chairmanship of Senator Cranston. \nDuring our years, I came to know and appreciate his unbounded \ndedication to the veterans of this country, and his extraordinary \nrecord of leadership and commitment to our Nation throughout his 24 \nyears of public service in the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Cranston played an integral role in veterans affairs from his \nfirst days in the Senate, serving initially as Chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Subcommittee of the then-Committee on Labor and \nPublic Welfare. When that subcommittee became the full Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs in 1971, he was a charter member of it. He became \nChairman of the full Committee in 1977, was ranking member from 1978-\n1986, and then Chairman again in 1987, until he left the Senate in \n1993.\n\n[[Page S1389]]\n\n  Throughout his tenure, Senator Cranston demonstrated a devoted \ncommitment to the men and women who risk their lives for the safety and \nwelfare of our Nation. Although he opposed the war in Vietnam, he was a \nstrong champion for the rights and benefits of those who served in it.\n  Senator Cranston's vision--to ensure that our country uphold its \nobligation to meet the post-service needs of veterans and their \nfamilies--was the inspiration for the many pieces of legislation passed \nduring his tenure. He showed his concern for disabled veterans and \ntheir families in many ways, including authoring support programs that \nprovided for grants, cost-of- living increases in benefits, adaptive \nequipment, rehabilitation, and other services.\n  Senator Cranston's record on issues related to the employment and \neducation of veterans is unequaled. As early as 1970, he authored the \nVeterans' Education and Training Amendments Act, which displayed his \nheartfelt concern for Vietnam-era veterans, and served as the \nfoundation for other key initiatives over the years.\n  As a strong advocate for health care reform myself, I appreciated \nSenator Cranston's efforts over the years to improve veterans' health \ncare through affirmative legislation. He brought national attention to \nthe many needs of VA health care facilities, which resulted in the \nimprovement of the quality of their staffs, facilities, and services.\n  Senator Cranston's patience in pursuit of his goals is legendary. For \nexample, he introduced legislation in 1971 to establish a VA \nreadjustment counseling program for Vietnam veterans. When it failed \nthat year, he reintroduced it in the next Congress, and the next, and \nthe next, never losing sight of his vision. Four Congresses later, in \n1979, it was finally accepted by the House of Representatives. The VA's \nVet Center Program was established that year and, in the ensuing years, \nthis program helped many Vietnam veterans deal with their adjustment \nproblems after service, including post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  After the program was established, Senator Cranston fought \nsuccessfully to make it permanent, thereby enabling Vet Centers to \nsurvive proposed cuts by the Reagan administration. He also pushed for \nenactment of legislation which extended the eligibility period for \nreadjustment counseling. In 1991, Senator Cranston authored legislation \nwhich allowed veterans of later conflicts, including the Persian Gulf \nWar, Panama, Grenada, and Lebanon, to receive assistance at Vet Centers \nas well.\n  Another example of Senator Cranston's persistence was his effort to \nprovide an opportunity for veterans to seek outside review of VA \ndecisions on claims for benefits. He began working on this issue in the \nmid-70's and stayed with it through final enactment in 1988 of \nlegislation which established a court to review veterans' claims. That \ncourt, now known as the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, \nstands as a legacy to Senator Cranston's commitment to making sure that \nveterans are treated fairly by the government that they served.\n  The list of Senator Cranston's achievements is long--for veterans, \nhis home State of California, our country, and the world. Senator \nCranston's leadership had a broad sweep, way beyond the concerns of \nveterans. From nuclear disarmament to housing policy to education to \ncivil rights, Senator Cranston fought to do the right thing, with \nenergy and passion. For nearly a quarter of a century, he was a true \nchampion for the less fortunate among our society.\n  Senator Cranston's legacy is immense, and I know that his leadership, \nwhich continued after he left this Chamber, will be missed. I consider \nmyself fortunate to have had the opportunity to work side-by-side with \nhim over the years. By continuing his fight for the people we represent \nand the ideals we were elected to uphold, I seek to carry on his \nmission.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article about Senator \nCranston by Thomas Tighe, a former staff member of the Senate Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, be printed in the Record. His thoughts on Senator \nCranston, which appeared in the January 7, 2001, edition of the Santa \nBarbara News-Press, are quite compelling.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Alan Cranston: He Separated the War From the Warrior\n\n  (By Thomas Tighe, President and CEO of Direct Relief International)\n\n       Alan Cranston stood for and accomplished many important \n     things during the course of his life and Senate career, \n     which, as might be expected given his low-key approach, \n     received little comment upon his death. But having worked for \n     Alan--as he insisted all his staff call him--during his last \n     several years in office, I was saddened by both his passing \n     and the absence of public recognition for much of what his \n     life's work accomplished.\n       Elected in 1968 strongly opposing the war in Vietnam, \n     Senator Cranston was assigned the chair of the subcommittee \n     responsible for overseeing the veterans health care system. \n     He was among the very first in our country to separate the \n     war from the warrior, as he sought to have the system do \n     right by the returning soldiers whose wartime experiences, \n     severity of injury, and readjustment seemed somehow different \n     from those of earlier wars.\n       While retaining his aversion to war, Alan Cranston devoted \n     much of his career in the Senate to ensuring that the \n     country's obligation to those who fought in war--however \n     unpopular--was recognized as fundamentally important and \n     honored accordingly. He pushed hard to expand spinal-cord \n     injury, blindness, and traumatic brain injury care, which \n     were lacking and desperately needed. He championed mental \n     health services, authoring legislation to create ``Vet \n     Centers'' where veterans themselves counseled each other and \n     to fund research that ultimately obtained formal recognition \n     and treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder as a \n     ``real'' condition that affected soldiers. Drug and alcohol \n     services, vocational rehabilitation, and comprehensive \n     assistance for homeless veterans all resulted from his \n     insight, his perseverance, and his commitment to those who \n     served our country.\n       The terms ``paramedic'' and ``medevac'' did not exist in \n     civilian society in the late 1960s--they do today because \n     Alan saw how effective the combination of medical personnel, \n     telecommunications, and helicopters had been in treating \n     battlefield injuries in Vietnam, and he authored the first \n     pilot program to apply this model to the civilian sector.\n       Senator Cranston also was the most vigorous, insightful, \n     tough, and effective supporter that the Peace Corps has ever \n     had in the Congress--stemming from his early involvement with \n     Sargent Shriver in the early 1960's before he was elected. I \n     know about these issues, and his remarkable legacy, because I \n     worked on them for Alan as a committee lawyer in the Senate \n     and, after he left office, as the Chief Operating Officer of \n     the Peace Corps.\n       But there were many, many other issues that Senator \n     Cranston not only cared about but worked to effectuate in a \n     painfully thorough, respectful, and principled way. He was an \n     early and stalwart advocate for preservation and judicious \n     stewardship of the environment, an unyielding voice for a \n     woman's right to make reproductive health choices, and of \n     course, a relentless pursuer of world peace and the abolition \n     of nuclear weapons--upon which he continued to work \n     passionately until the day he died.\n       Those efforts have made a tremendous positive difference in \n     the lives of millions of people in this country and around \n     the world.\n       For me, Alan Cranston's standard of adhering to principle \n     while achieving practical success remains a constant source \n     of inspiration and motivation, as I am sure is true for the \n     hundreds of others who worked on his staff over the course of \n     24 years. His was an example that one's strongly held \n     ideological and policy beliefs, whether labeled ``liberal'' \n     or ``conservative,'' should not be confused with or \n     overwhelmed by partisanship if it prevented meaningful \n     progress. And he insisted upon honest and vigorous oversight \n     of publicly funded programs he supported--to avoid defending \n     on principle something indefensible in practice, thereby \n     eroding support for the principle itself.\n       Once, while trying to describe an obstacle on a Peace Corps \n     matter, I made a flip reference to the ``America Right or \n     Wrong'' crowd. He asked if I knew where that expression came \n     from, which I did not. He said it was usually misunderstood \n     and, as in my case, misused, and told me that it was a \n     wonderfully patriotic statement. He stared at me calmly, with \n     a slight smile and with the presence of nearly 80 years of \n     unimaginably rich experiences in life and politics, and said, \n     ``America, right or wrong. When it's right, keep it right. \n     When it's wrong, make it right.''\n       It was a privilege to work for Alan Cranston, and to know \n     that is what he tried to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1389-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1389-S1390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                VA LEADS THE NATION IN END-OF-LIFE CARE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Department of Veterans Affairs \nhas been quick to embrace the idea that more needs to be done to deal \nwith patients' pain, and this has become an integral part of VA's \noverall efforts to\n\n[[Page S1390]]\n\nimprove care at the end of life--for veterans and for all Americans. As \nranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am enormously \nproud of VA's efforts in pain management and end-of-life care. I \nsuspect, however, that many of my colleagues are unaware of VA's good \nwork in this area.\n  We simply must recognize the lack of services and resources for \npeople who are suffering with pain, especially those who need long-term \ninstitutional care and other alternatives, such as hospice or home \nhealth for chronic conditions. The health care and related needs of \nAmericans are very diverse. We must target problems and address them \nwith creativity, with a variety of resources that can help different \ngroups in different ways. Taking a look at the VA's success in this \narea is a good place to start fixing the problem.\n  I therefore ask unanimous consent that a press release on VA's pain \nmanagement initiatives and a Washington Post article on VA's success in \nthis area be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  VA Initiates Pain Management Program\n\n       Pain is one of the most common reasons people consult a \n     physician, according to the American Academy of Pain Medicine \n     and the American Pain Society. In fact, it is the primary \n     symptom in more than 80 percent of all doctor visits and \n     affects more than 50 million people. In January 1999, the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) took the lead in pain \n     management by launching a nationwide effort to reduce pain \n     and suffering for the 3.4 million veterans who use VA health \n     care facilities.\n\n\n                         VA and Pain Management\n\n       VA believes that no patient should suffer preventable pain. \n     Doctors and nurses throughout VA's 1,200 sites of medical \n     care are required to treat pain as a ``fifth vital sign,'' \n     meaning they should assess and record patients' pain just as \n     they note the other four health-care basics--blood pressure, \n     pulse, temperature and breathing rate. They ask patients to \n     rate their pain on a scale of zero to 10, then consult with \n     the patients about ways to deal with it.\n       ``It changed how VA approached pain,'' said Dr. Jane \n     Tollett, national coordinator of VA pain management strategy. \n     ``We're too often obsessed with finding out what's going on \n     at the molecular, cellular and pharmacological levels as \n     opposed to asking: Is the person feeling better?'' Measuring \n     pain as a vital sign was part of the first step in the \n     following comprehensive strategy to make pain management a \n     routine part of veterans' care.\n       Pain Assessment and Treatment: Procedures for early \n     recognition of pain and prompt effective treatment began at \n     all VA medical facilities. Pain management protocols were set \n     up, including ready access to resources such as pain \n     specialist and multidisciplinary pain clinics. VA updated its \n     Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) to document a \n     patient's pain history. Patient and family education about \n     pain management was included in patient treatment plans.\n       Evaluation of Outcomes and Quality of Pain Management: VA \n     began to systematically measure outcomes and quality of pain \n     management, including patient satisfaction measures. Across \n     the nation, VA set up quarterly data collection to evaluate: \n     Was the patient assessed for pain using a 0-10 scale? Was \n     there intervention if pain was reported as 4 or more? Was \n     there a plan for pain care? Was the intervention evaluated \n     for effectiveness?\n       Research: VA expanded research on management of acute and \n     chronic pain, emphasizing conditions that are most prevalent \n     among veterans. Currently, there are nine pain research \n     projects funded by VA. Research funded by the Health Services \n     Research and Development Service focuses on identifying \n     research priorities, providing scientific evidence for pain \n     management protocols throughout VA and evaluating and \n     monitoring the quality of care.\n\n\n                 education of health care professionals\n\n       VA is assuring that clinical staff, such as physicians and \n     nurses, have orientation and education on pain assessment and \n     pain management. In collaboration with the Department of \n     Defense and the community, VA is developing clinical \n     guidelines for pain associated with surgery, cancer and \n     chronic conditions.\n       Additionally, VA initiated an extensive education program \n     for health care providers that includes orientation for new \n     employees and professional trainees, four internet sessions \n     on ``pharmacotherapy of acute and chronic pain,'' satellite \n     broadcasts and interactive sessions with VA health care \n     facilities, guest lectures on topics like pain assessment and \n     treatment of the demented, purchase and distribution of pain \n     management videos, and a Web site ``vaww.mst.lrn.va.gov/\n     nmintranet/pain.''\n       VA also focuses on pain management education for medical \n     students and health care professional trainees through VA's \n     affiliations with academic institutions. Among recent \n     milestones:\n       The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation last year awarded VA a \n     grant of $985,595 to help train physicians in end-of-life \n     care, including pain management.\n       The VA Office of Academic Affiliations recently awarded \n     additional funding to nine VA medical facilities to support \n     graduate education residences in anesthesiology pain \n     management, including VA medical centers in Milwaukee, Wis.; \n     Durnham, N.C.; and Loma Linda, Calif. and the health care \n     systems in North Texas, New Mexico, Puget Sound (Wash.), Palo \n     Alto (Calif.), and North Florida-South Georgia.\n\n\n                   national pain management strategy\n\n       The complexity of chronic pain management is often beyond \n     the expertise of a single practitioner, especially for \n     veterans whose pain problems are complicated by such things \n     as homelessness, post traumatic stress disorder and combat \n     injuries. Additionally, pain management has been made an \n     integral part of palliative and end-of-life care. The \n     effective management of pain for all veterans cared for by VA \n     requires a nationwide coordinated approach. To accomplish \n     this, VA formed a team made up of representatives from an \n     array of disciplines--anesthesiology, nursing, psychiatry, \n     surgery, oncology, pharmacology, gerontology and neurology.\n       Funded by an unrestricted educational grant, VA is \n     producing a Web-based physician education program aimed at \n     end-of-life issues and an online forum for VA pain management \n     in which more than 200 clinicians actively participate.\n       In December 2000, a pain management and end-of-life \n     conference is scheduled to showcase innovation and effective \n     practices within VA, address specialized topics with expert \n     faculty and solve systematic problems that cause barriers to \n     improving pain management care. Additionally, VA will set up \n     programs to support clinicians in settings that are remote \n     from pain experts, centers or clinics.\n       ``Untreated or undertreated pain takes its toll not just in \n     monetary loss but also in the psychosocial and physical cost \n     to patients and their families. Pain can exacerbate feelings \n     of distress, anxiety and depression. . . . When severe pain \n     goes untreated and/or depression is present, some people may \n     consider or attempt suicide. The message is clear: all those \n     in pain have the right to systematic assessment and ongoing \n     management of pain by health care professionals.''--(The \n     Journal of Care Management, November 1999)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1390-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n IN MEMORIAM OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE 14TH QUARTERMASTER DETACHMENT \n             WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN OPERATION DESERT STORM\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I stand before you today to honor \nthe tenth anniversary of a terrible tragedy that faced the men and \nwomen who serve in the United States Armed Forces. I speak about an \nattack carried out by Saddam Hussein that took the lives of brave men \nand women from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania who were proudly \nserving their country as members of our armed services. We are indebted \nto those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country during that \nconflict, and they will remain in our hearts and memories forever.\n  The 14th Quartermaster Detachment of Greensburg, PA, was mobilized \nand ordered to active duty on January 15, 1991 in support of the \nPersian Gulf crisis. On February 25, 1991, only days after the Desert \nStorm conflict began, the 14th Quartermaster Detachment suffered the \ngreatest number of casualties of any allied unit during Operation \nDesert Storm. An Iraqi Scud missile destroyed the building where the \nunit was being housed, killing 28 soldiers and wounding 99. Of those \ncasualties, 13 members of the 14th were killed and 43 were wounded. \nDesert Storm ended only hours after this tragedy.\n  To recognize the supreme sacrifice that these men and women undertook \nfor our great nation, Major General Rodney D. Ruddock, Commander, 99th \nRegional Support Command, will hold an anniversary ceremony on February \n25, 2001 to honor the 14th Quartermaster Detachment of Greensburg, PA. \nDuring this solemn event, we will honor, not only the men and women who \nlost their lives 10 years ago, but all the men and women who serve in \nthe Armed Forces and selflessly put their lives on the line every day \nin order to preserve our nation's freedom. We, as Americans, will \nremain eternally grateful for the sacrifices and true courage that our \nmen and women in uniform display on our behalf in serving this great \nnation.\n  It is at this time that I ask my Senate colleagues to join with me in \nhonoring the members of the 14th Quartermaster Detachment.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1391-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1391]]\n         50TH BIRTHDAY OF THE GIRL SCOUTS OF CONESTOGA COUNCIL\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY.

ARCARI, U.S. AIR FORCE, RETIRED\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nColonel Paul Arcari, United States Air Force, Retired--in recognition \nof his distinguished service to his country.\n  For nearly 46 years, first for 30 years in the Air Force, and later \nfor The Retired Officers Association, Colonel Arcari has worked \ntirelessly for the men and women of the military.\n  Born in Manchester, CT, he entered the Air Force as a second \nlieutenant in 1955 and earned his navigator wings the following year. \nHe amassed 4,400 flying hours with the Military Airlift Command, \nincluding 418 combat missions in Southeast Asia in the late sixties.\n  In 1969 Colonel Arcari was assigned as legislative analyst in the \nOffice of the Secretary of Defense and Headquarters, U.S. Air Force. \nDuring the next 17 years, including 13 years as Chief of the Air Force \nEntitlements Division, Colonel Arcari earned the reputation as the \nDepartment of Defense's preeminent authority on military compensation \nmatters. In addition to helping craft the All-Volunteer Force pay table \nand the military Survivor Benefit Plan, his inputs to the Senate Armed \nServices Committee proved invaluable in crafting the Nunn-Warner \ncompensation enhancements that assisted in turning around the retention \nand readiness crisis of the late 1970's and early 1980's. He retired \nfrom active duty in February 1985.\n  Following retirement, Colonel Arcari joined The Retired Officers \nAssociation and served as Deputy Director and since 1990 as Director of \nGovernment Relations.\n  Under Colonel Arcari's professional stewardship, The Retired Officers \nAssociation has played a vital role as the principal advocate of \nlegislative initiatives to improve readiness and the quality of life \nfor all members of the uniformed service community--active, reserve, \nand retired, as well as their families.\n  Colonel Arcari has worked closely with, and has been a valuable \nresource for, the Senate Armed Services Committee as we enacted a wide \nrange of much-needed improvements for our military personnel. His \nefforts in the areas of military compensation, retirement benefits, \nhealth care and fair cost-of-living adjustments, COLA, for retired \npersonnel and their families has been invaluable in improving long term \nretention of our armed forces. I am particularly gratified that during \nthe past two years in which I have been privileged to serve as Chairman \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee I have been able to enact some \nof the most substantial quality-of-life enhancements for active, \nreserve, and retired service members and their families in decades. \nColonel Arcari played an important role in this effort.\n  Colonel Arcari's long and unique career of leadership and personal \ndedication to fostering readiness by protecting every service member's \nwelfare is an inspiration and a continuing lesson to all who care about \nour men and women of our military. My best wishes go with him. Colonel \nArcari, I salute you on behalf of all the men and women, past and \npresent, who wear the uniform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1391-3", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1391-S1392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COAST GUARD CUTTER ``WOODRUSH''\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the men \nand women who have served aboard the United States Coast Guard Cutter \nWoodrush, WLB 407, homeported in Sitka, in my own state of Alaska.\n  On March 2, 2001, the USCGC Woodrush will be decommissioned, \ndeparting for Baltimore, MD. There, she is to be transferred to the \nnavy of the Republic of Ghana.\n  Although she is the youngest of the 39 seagoing buoy tenders \nconstructed during World War II, the Woodrush has logged nearly 57 \nyears of service to our nation.\n  She was built for less than $1 million in Duluth, Minnesota, and \ncommissioned on September 22, 1944. For thirty-five years she sailed \nfrom Duluth, servicing aids to navigation, conducting search and rescue \nmissions, and icebreaking on the Great Lakes.\n  In 1979, she began a major refit at the Coast Guard shipyard in \nBaltimore. She has been homeported in Sitka since leaving the shipyard \nin 1980.\n  Woodrush's primary mission has been keeping aids to navigation in \ngood condition. Her crew maintained 165 shore lights and 69 buoys \nthroughout the 2,000 square-mile Southeastern Alaska panhandle. The \nwork of the Woodrush has been crucial to the safety of the thousands of \ntugboats, fishing vessels, ferries, pleasure boats and cruise ships \nthat navigate those sometimes treacherous waters each year.\n  USCGC Woodrush also participated in several notable search and rescue \nmissions. She was one of the first ships to arrive on the scene of the \nwreck of the Edmond Fitzgerald in 1975, when the ore freighter went \ndown with all hands in a violent storm on Lake Superior. Her sonar \nlocated two large pieces of wreckage, and she served as a platform for \nthe U.S. Navy's Controlled Underwater Recovery Vehicle, which found the \nsunken hull.\n  In 1980, Woodrush responded to the uncontrolled fire and eventual \nloss of the cruise ship Princendam off Graham Island, British Columbia. \nThe efforts of Woodrush and her crew, as well as other rescue units, \nled to the successful rescue of all passengers and crew, with no loss \nof life.\n  In August 1993, Woodrush assisted the 248-foot cruise ship, M/V \nYorktown Clipper, after it ran aground. Woodrush crewmembers helped \ncontrol the flooding and ensured that all 130 passengers were taken \nsafely off the vessel.\n  Not all of the crew's adventures were at sea. In the summer of 1994, \npersonnel from Woodrush helped extinguish a dangerous fire in the small \ncommunity of Tenakee, Alaska. Their efforts helped keep the fire from \nspreading out of control in the 30-knot winds.\n  Protection of the environment is yet another of the Coast Guard's \nmany missions. Over the years, Woodrush has contributed in many ways, \nincluding service as one of the numerous Coast Guard vessels that \nresponded to the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound. \nEach year, the Woodrush crew has trained to handle future accidents. It \nis reassuring to know that their skills have not been needed to date, \nbut even more so to know they have been, like the Coast Guard's motto, \n``Always Ready.''\n  During her 57 years of service, the Woodrush and her crew earned \nseveral awards, including the Meritorious Unit Commendation, the \nAmerican Campaign Service Ribbon, the World War II Service Ribbon, and \nthe National Defense Medal. Woodrush was a Bronze Winner of the Coast \nGuard Commandant's Quality Award in both 1997 and 1998 and, in 1997, \nshe also won the Coast Guard Foundation's Admiral John B. Hayes Award. \nThe Hayes Award honors the Pacific Area unit that best demonstrates the \ncommitment to excellence and professionalism embodied in the traditions \nof the United States Coast Guard.\n  USCGC Woodrush will service her last aid to navigation on February \n27. To\n\n[[Page S1392]]\n\nall the men and women who have served as her crew, I extend my thanks \nand appreciation. Your faithful attention to duty--guiding mariners to \nsafety, aiding citizens in distress, and defending all the interests of \nthe United States will be remembered.

A bill to limit the acquisition by the United States of land \nlocated in a State in which 25 percent or more of the land in that \nState is owned by the United States; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the no net loss \nof private lands bill. This legislation has to do with acquisition of \nlands by the Federal Government, particularly lands to be acquired by \nthe Federal Government in the West. This is a commonsense proposal, I \nbelieve, to Federal land acquisitions in public land States of the \nWest.\n  The Federal Government continues to acquire large amounts of land \nthroughout the Nation. In many instances, it is justified. There are \nmany reasons why land should be acquired, but there does become a \nquestion of how much land in any given State will belong to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  In almost every State, officials and concerned citizens are saying we \nneed to address this question of public land needs before we continue \nto increase the holdings of the Federal Government. The Federal \nGovernment is not always the best neighbor of the people in the West, \nlargely because so much land in our States--in my State, 50 percent of \nthe State--belongs to the Federal Government. Even though everyone \nwants to protect the lands, and that is an obligation we all have, we \nalso have an opportunity for the most part to use these lands in \nmultiple use. We should be able to have both access for hunting, \nfishing, grazing, for visitation and camping, and use the lands for \nother economic activity in such a way that we can protect the \nenvironment.\n  What we have run into from time to time is the effort to lock up the \npublic lands and restrict access. We find this happening in a number of \nways, including excessive emphasis on roads, where people cannot have \naccess to the lands they occupy.\n  Interestingly enough, we hear from all kinds of people. Often they \nsay it is the oil companies. As a matter of fact, it is often disabled \nveterans. For example, they say they would like to go into the back \ncountry and get into some of the public lands, but if we don't have \nhighway access for doing that, it is impossible.\n\n  This setting aside and this decisionmaking that comes from the top \ndown creates great hardships for many local communities, destroys jobs, \nand depresses the economy in many places around the West. As we provide \nfunds--and there is always a proposition to provide automatic funding \nfor acquisition--it threatens the culture, it threatens the economics \nof many of our States and local governments, and the rights of \nindividual property owners throughout the Nation. Even this proposed \nlanguage would put constraints on mandatory spending and Federal land \nacquisition. If we don't do that, we will see it increasing at a faster \nand faster pace.\n  How does it work? The bill limits the amount of private land the \nFederal Government acquires in States where 25 percent or more now \nbelongs to the Federal Government. When a Federal Government has \nreason, and they will have reasons to purchase 100 acres or more, it \nwill require disposing of an equal value of amount away from Federal \nownership. If there is 40-percent Federal ownership in your State, and \nthere were good reasons to acquire more, there would have to be an \nexchange of lands so the 40-percent factor continues.\n  Fifty percent of Wyoming and much of the West is already owned by the \nFederal Government. Many people throughout the country don't realize \nthat. They know about Yellowstone Park. But much of the State was left \nin Federal ownership when the homestead proposition was completed and \nthese lands were never really set aside for value of the land. They \nwere just there when this homestead stopped. They came under Federal \nownership, not because of any particular reason but because that is the \nway it was at that time.\n\n  I think it is time for the Federal Government to make a move to \nprotect private property owners and use restraint in terms of land \nacquisition. The no net loss of private lands acquisition bill will \nprovide that discipline. As I mentioned, this amendment does not limit \nthe ability to acquire pristine or special areas in the future, areas \nthat have a particular use and that use should be under Federal \nownership. They can continue to acquire more land in many areas. But in \norder to do that, as I mentioned, there would have to be some trading.\n  Regarding the Federal land ownership pattern, I suppose many people \nexpected more, but in Alaska almost 68 percent of the State belongs to \nthe Federal Government. Even in Arizona, as highly populated as it is, \nalmost half, 47 percent, is Federally owned. In Colorado, it is 36 \npercent; in Idaho, 61 percent of the State is in Federal ownership; the \nnumber in Montana is 28 percent, and Nevada is 83 percent federally \nowned. Really, you could make a case that much of this land could be \nbetter managed by local or State governments or if it were in the \nprivate sector. In New Mexico, the percentage of Federal land ownership \nis 33 percent; Oregon, 52; Utah, 64; Washington, 29; and Wyoming, 49 \npercent.\n  So we are talking about providing an opportunity for the Federal \nGovernment to continue to acquire those lands if there is good reason \nto do that, but to recognize the impact that it does have on private \nownership, on the economy, and on the culture of the states. We have \nsome offsets.\n  In our State, we have 23 counties. They are quite different, but in \nsome of those counties--for instance, my home county, ark County, Cody, \nWY, which is right outside of Yellowstone Park--82 percent of that \ncounty belongs to the Federal Government. In Teton County, next to \nYellowstone, It is 96 percent. Four percent of Teton's land is in non-\nFederal ownership.\n  I think this is a reasonable thing to do. It certainly does not \npreclude the acquisition of lands the Federal Government has a good \nreason to acquire. It simply says if you want to acquire some, let's \ntake a look at the other 50 percent that you already own of the State \nand see if we can't dispose of something in equal value.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S. 324. A bill to amend the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, to prohibit the \nsale and purchase of the social security number of an individual by \nfinancial institutions, to include social security numbers in the \ndefinition of nonpublic personal information, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Social \nSecurity Privacy Act of 2001. This legislation would prohibit the sale \nand purchase of an individual's Social Security number by financial \ninstitutions and include Social Security numbers as ``nonpublic \npersonal information'' thereby subjecting the sharing of Social \nSecurity\n\n[[Page S1396]]\n\nnumbers to the privacy protections of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\n  I believe Congress has a duty to stop Social Security numbers from \nbeing bought and sold like some common commodity. While the Social \nSecurity number was created by the federal government to track workers' \nearnings and eligibility for Social Security benefits, we all recognize \nthat it has become something much more than that. The number is now the \nkey to just about all the personal information concerning an \nindividual.\n  There was never any intention or consideration for financial \ninstitutions to use a person's social security number as a universal \naccess number. Such easy access and extreme availability of personal \ninformation leads to adverse consequences including fraud, abuse, \nidentity theft and in the most extreme cases--staking and death.\n  While Congress waits to act, the number of incidents involving \nidentity theft are rapidly increasing. In fact, last year the \nWashington Post, reported that ``ID Theft Becoming Public Fear No. 1.'' \nThe New York Times noted that, ``Law enforcement authorities are \nbecoming increasingly worried about a sudden, sharp rise in the \nincidence of identity theft, the outright pilfering of peoples personal \ninformation for use in obtaining credit cards, loans and other goods.''\n  Not only is identity theft happening more often, recent events \nconfirm that no one is immune from this problem. Just last month, a \nCalifornia man was convicted of using Tiger Woods' Social Security \nnumber to obtain credit cards that he used to run up more than $17,000 \nin charges in Mr. Woods' name.\n  Identity theft can affect anyone. It is extremely serious. It costs \nour economy hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Once it occurs, \nit is very difficult for the victim to restore his or her good name and \ncredit rating. The incidences of identity theft are growing at an ever \nincreasing pace.\n  Now, how does identity theft relate to the average financial \ninstitution? In 1999, a reputable Fortune 500 company, U.S. Bancorp, \nlegally sold account information--including Social Security numbers--of \none million of its customers to MemberWorks, a telemarketer \nof membership programs that offer discounts on such things as travel to \nhealth care services. Now some may believe we stopped such activity by \nincluding a provision, Section 502 (d), in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act \nlimiting the ability of institutions to share account information with \ntelemarketers.\n\n  That provision, however, does not stop a financial institution from \nbuying and selling individual Social Security numbers. Indeed, it is \neven legal to sell individual's birth date, and mother's maiden name. \nIf you have those three things, you have the keys to the kingdom--not \nto mention any and every account that individual has.\n  The evolution of technology is making the collection, aggregation, \nand dissemination of vast amounts of personal information easier and \ncheaper. The longer we wait to act on this very important issue--an \nissue that is supported by a vast majority of Americans--the more the \nAmerican people lose confidence in the U.S. Congress and out ability to \nlead.\n  This legislation would basically prohibit the sale and purchase of an \nindividual's Social Security number. I do not know anyone in this \ncountry that believes financial institutions should be making a profit \nby trafficking individual's Social Security numbers. While financial \ninstitutions have used the Social Security number as an identifier, the \nsale and purchase of these numbers facilitates criminal activity and \ncan result in significant invasions of individual privacy.\n  In addition, my legislation would include Social Security numbers as \n``nonpublic personal information'' for the purpose of the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act, thereby subjecting the sharing of Social Security numbers \nto the privacy protections in that Act. Current regulations say that \nSocial Security numbers are not considered nonpublic personal \ninformation if the number is ``publicly available,'' as in bankruptcy \nfilings, etc.\n  I just cannot find a reason as to why Congress should aid and abet \ncriminals in attaining individual Social Security numbers by having a \nlaw on the books that treats Social Security numbers as ``public \ninformation.'' Indeed, no American would agree the public good is being \nserved by making their personal Social Security number available for \nanyone who wants to see it.\n  For those of you who are concerned that this legislation would hinder \na financial holding company from sharing information among its \naffiliates, fear not. This legislation does not limit a financial \ninstitution's ability to share an individual's Social Security number \namong affiliates in any way.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in protecting the Social Security \nnumbers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Murray, \n        and Mr. Thurmond):\n  S. 325. A bill to establish a congressional commemorative medal for \norgan donors and their families; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Gift of \nLife Congressional Medal Act of 2001. This legislation, which does not \ncost taxpayers a penny, will recognize the thousands of individuals \neach year who share the gift of life through organ donation. Moreover, \nit will encourage potential donors and enhance public awareness of the \nimportance of organ donation to the over 74,000 Americans waiting for a \ntransplant.\n  In 1999, there were almost 22,000 transplants--a large increase over \nthe roughly 13,000 transplants performed ten years ago. However, the \ndemand for transplants has skyrocketed, more than tripling in the past \nten years.\n  As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I saw one in four of my \npatients die because of the lack of available donors, and more and more \npatients waiting for an organ transplant die each year before they can \nreceive an organ. More than 6000 patients died in 1999 before they \ncould receive a transplant. Since 1988, more than 38,000 patients have \ndied because of the lack of organ donors. There are simply not enough \norgan donors; public awareness has not kept up with the rapid advances \nof transplantation. It is our duty to do all we can to raise awareness \nabout the gift of life.\n  Last fall, the Department of Health and Human Services announced an \nincrease of nearly 4 percent in organ donation levels. While I was \npleased to see this news, this is only a small step towards addressing \nour nation's organ shortage. Much more remains to be done.\n  The Gift of Life Congressional Medal Act will make each donor or \ndonor family eligible to receive a commemorative Congressional medal. \nThis creates a tremendous opportunity to honor those sharing life \nthrough donation and increase public awareness of this issue.\n  Recent years have witnessed a tremendous coalescing on both sides of \nthe aisle around the importance of awakening public compassion and \nawareness of those needing organ transplants. I appreciate the growing \nsupport for this issue and look forward to working with my colleagues \nto encourage people to give life to others.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reed, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Levin, Mr. Hutchinson, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Enzi, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. \n        Santorum, Mr. Chafee, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Helms, Mrs. Hutchison, \n        Mr. Specter, Mr. Murkowski, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Warner, Mr. Gregg, \n        Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 326. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \neliminate the 15 percent reduction in payment rates under the \nprospective payment system for home health services and to permanently \nincrease payments for such services that are furnished in rural areas; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Bond, \nReed, Jeffords, Kerry, Roberts, Murray, Hutchinson, Levin, Enzi, \nMikulski, Santorum, Hutchison, Chafee, DeWine, Helms, Specter, \nMurkowski, Warner, Bob Smith, Lugar, Snowe, and others in introducing \nthe Home Care Stability Act of 2001 to eliminate the automatic 15 \npercent reduction in Medicare payments to home health\n\n[[Page S1397]]\n\nagencies that is currently scheduled to go into effect on October 1, \n2002. The legislation we are introducing this morning will also extend \nthe temporary 10 percent add-on payment for home health patients in \nrural areas to ensure that these patients continue to have access to \ncare.\n  Health care has gone full circle. Patients are spending less time in \nthe hospital. More and more procedures are being done on an outpatient \nbasis, and recovery and care for patients with chronic diseases and \nconditions has increasingly been taking place in the home. Moreover, \nthe number of older Americans who are chronically ill or disabled in \nsome way continues to grow each year.\n  Concerns about how to care effectively and compassionately for these \nindividuals will only multiply as our population ages and as it is at \ngreater risk for chronic disease and disability.\n  As a consequence, home health care has become an increasingly \nimportant part of our health care system. The kind of highly skilled \nand often technically complex services that our Nation's home health \nagencies provide have enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable \nsenior citizens to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and to receive the \ncare they need just where they want to be: in the security, privacy, \nand comfort of their own homes.\n  By the late 1990s, home health care was the fastest growing component \nof Medicare spending. The program was growing at an average annual rate \nof 25 percent. For this reason, Congress and the administration, as \npart of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, initiated changes that were \nintended to slow the growth in spending and make the program more cost-\neffective and efficient.\n  These measures, however, have unfortunately produced cuts in home \nhealth care spending that were far, far beyond what Congress ever \nintended. According to preliminary estimates by the CBO, home health \ncare spending dropped to $9.2 billion last year, half the amount that \nwas being spent just 3 years earlier, in 1997.\n  On the horizon is yet an additional 15-percent cut that would put \nmany of our already struggling home health agencies at risk and which \nwould seriously jeopardize access to critical home health services for \nmillions of our Nation's seniors.\n  It is now crystal clear that the savings goals set for home health in \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have not only been met, but far \nexceeded. The most recent CBO projections show that the post-Balanced \nBudget Act reductions in home health will be about $69 billion between \nfiscal years 1998 and 2002. That is more than four times the $16 \nbillion the CBO originally estimated for that time period, and it is a \nclear indication that the Medicare home health cutbacks have been far \ndeeper and far more wide-reaching than Congress ever intended.\n  As a consequence, we have home health agencies across the country \nthat are experiencing acute financial difficulties and cashflow \nproblems. These financial difficulties are inhibiting their ability to \ndeliver much needed care. Approximately 3,300 home health agencies have \neither closed or stopped serving Medicare patients nationwide--3,300, \nMr. President. That is how deep these cuts were.\n  Moreover, the Health Care Financing Administration estimates that \n900,000 fewer home health patients received services in 1999 than in \n1997. This points to the most central and important consequence of \nthese cuts. The fact is that cuts of this magnitude simply cannot be \nsustained without adversely affecting the quality and availability of \npatient care.\n  The effects of these regulations and cuts have been particularly \ndevastating in my home State of Maine. The number of home health \npatients in Maine dropped from almost 49,000 to 37,545. That is a \nchange of 23 percent. This means there are 11,000 senior citizens or \ndisabled citizens in Maine who are no longer receiving home health \nservices.\n  What has happened to those 11,000 individuals? I have talked with \npatients, and I have talked with home health nurses throughout the \nState of Maine, and I found that many of these patients have ended up \ngoing into nursing homes prematurely. Others have been repeatedly \nhospitalized with problems that could have been avoided had they been \ncontinuing to receive their home health benefits. Still others are \ntrying to pay for the care themselves, often on very limited means. And \nyet others are going without care altogether.\n\n  A home health nurse in Saco, ME, told me of a patient who she \nbelieves ultimately died because she lost her home health benefits. She \nlost those nurses coming to check on her condition. The result was that \nshe developed an infection that the home health nurse undoubtedly would \nhave caught. The result was a tragedy in this case.\n  We have seen a 40-percent drop in the number of visits in the State \nof Maine and a 31-percent cut in Medicare reimbursements to home health \nagencies.\n  Keep in mind that Maine's home health agencies have historically been \nvery prudent in their use of resources. They were low cost to begin \nwith. The problem is, when you have cuts of these magnitudes imposed on \nagencies that are already low-cost providers, they simply cannot \nsustain the cuts and continue to deliver the services that our seniors \nneed.\n  The real losers in this situation are our Nation's seniors, \nparticularly those sicker Medicare patients with complex care needs who \nare already experiencing difficulty in getting the home care services \nthey deserve.\n  I am very concerned that additional deep cuts are already on the \nhorizon. As I mentioned, on October 1, 2002, an additional automatic \n15-percent cut is scheduled to go into effect. We need to act.\n  Last year we passed legislation, the Medicare, Medicaid, and S-CHIP \nBenefits Improvement and Protection Act, which did provide a small \nmeasure of relief to our Nation's struggling home health agencies. It \ndid, for example, delay by another year the 15-percent cut I have \ndiscussed this morning, but I do not think that goes far enough. The \nautomatic reduction should be eliminated completely. We do not need it \nto achieve the savings estimated by the Balanced Budget Act. Those have \nalready been far surpassed, and the implications for health care for \nsome of our most frail and ill senior citizens are enormous.\n  The fact is, an additional 15-percent cut in Medicare home health \npayments would ring the death knell for those low-cost agencies which \nare currently struggling to hang on, and it would further reduce our \nseniors' access to critical home care services.\n  This is the fourth year we have fought this battle. To simply keep \ndelaying this cut by yet another year is to leave a sword of Damocles \nhanging over our home health system. It makes it very difficult for our \nhome health agencies to plan how they are going to serve their Medicare \npatients in the future. It encourages them to turn away patients who \nare going to be very expensive to care for, and it forces us to spend \nvaluable time, energy, and resources fighting for repeal every single \nyear--time and resources that would far better be spent ensuring the \nsuccess of the Medicare home health prospective payments system.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would once and for all \neliminate the automatic cut. It would also make permanent the temporary \n10-percent add-on for home health services furnished patients in rural \nareas. That was included in the legislation last year. We would make it \npermanent.\n  As the Presiding Officer well knows, it is sometimes very expensive \nfor home health agencies to deliver services to rural patients. They \nhave to travel long distances, and it takes a long time to reach those \npatients. That all adds to the cost. In fact, surveys show that the \ndelivery of home health services in rural areas can be as much as 12 to \n15 percent more costly because of the extra travel time required, \nhigher transportation expenses, and other factors.\n  This provision will ensure that our seniors living in rural areas \ncontinue to have access to critical high-quality home health services.\n  Mr. President, the Home Health Care Stability Act will provide a \nneeded measure of relief and certainty for cost-efficient home health \nagencies across the country that are experiencing acute financial \nproblems that are inhibiting their ability to deliver much needed care, \nparticularly to chronically ill Medicare patients with complex care \nneeds. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation.\n\n[[Page S1398]]\n\n  Let's get the job done once and for all this year. Let's repeal that \n15-percent cut that otherwise would go into effect. Let's remove that \nuncertainty that is hanging over our home health agencies, and let's \nrecommit ourselves to providing quality home health care benefits to \nour seniors and our disabled citizens.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, to introduce legislation that addresses the \nongoing crisis in home health care. Twenty-two of our colleagues join \nwith us today to offer the Home Health Payment Fairness Act to deal \nwith this crisis and to try to ensure that seniors and disabled \nAmericans have appropriate access to high-quality home health care.\n  Home health care is an important part of Medicare in which seniors \nand the disabled can get basic nursing and therapy care in their home, \nif their health or physical condition makes it almost impossible to \nleave home. Often home health is an alternative to more expensive \nservices that may be provided in a hospital or a skilled nursing \nfacility--and thus is a cost-effective way to provide needed care.\n  It is convenient, but much more importantly, patients love it. They \nlove it because home health care is the key to fulfilling what is \nvirtually a universal desire among seniors and those with \ndisabilities--to remain independent and within the comfort of their own \nhomes despite their health problems.\n  Yet we have a crisis in home health--too many seniors who could and \nshould be receiving home health are not getting it. They may be \nsuffering, in their home, without getting the health care they need. \nOr, they may be getting care, but only because they have been forced \ninto a nursing home rather than being able to stay in the comfort and \nthe dignity of their home. Either way, they are not getting the most \nappropriate care--and this is tragic.\n  As with so many other problems with Medicare in the last few years, \nthe problem comes from two sources--the Balanced Budget Act, and the \nHealth Care Financing Administration.\n  We all know the basic story by now--in an effort to balance the \nbudget, Congress in the BBA tried to cut the growth in Medicare \nspending. Yet the real-world results went much further than we \nintended--partially because of things beyond anyone's control, but \nlargely due to faulty implementation and the excessive regulatory zeal \nof HCFA. As the cuts and regulation went out-of-control, health care \nproviders struggled to survive, but many were forced to close entirely \nor to stop serving Medicare. This harmed patients because they lost \ncare options that had been available previously.\n  This basic storyline applies to patients and providers in all parts \nof Medicare--hospitals, nursing homes, home health care--everyone. But \nthere are two things that distinguish the home health crisis from all \nof the other problems that stem from the Balanced Budget Act.\n  First and most importantly, no other group of Medicare patients and \nproviders have endured as many difficulties. This is a big claim, given \nthe many horror stories we've heard about the Balanced Budget Act. But \nabsolutely nobody has suffered like home health patients and home \nhealth agencies. The numbers don't lie.\n  Two years after the Balanced Budget Act, almost 900,000 fewer seniors \nand disabled Americans were receiving home health care than previously. \nThat's upwards of a million patients--one of every four who had been \nreceiving home health--who simply disappeared from the world of home \ncare. Unfortunately, the explanation is not a miraculous improvement in \nthe health of our nation's seniors that drastically reduced the need \nfor home health care. No, almost one million fewer people were \nreceiving home care because the help just wasn't available.\n  This is partly because more than 3,300 of the nation's 10,000 home \nhealth agencies have either gone out-of-business, or have stopped \nserving Medicare patients. That's one-third of the home health \nproviders--gone. Can you imagine the outrage we would have in this \ncountry if one-third of the hospitals simply disappeared?\n  In some areas, this hasn't been a major problem because there were \nother local home health agencies to pick up the slack. But in many \nparts of America--particularly in rural America--this has led to a \nserious problem of getting access to care.\n  In one sense, what's bad for the patient is good for the budget. \nMedicare home health spending has actually gone down for three straight \nyears--dropping by 46 percent from 1997 and 2000. In Medicare, these \ntypes of cuts in spending are absolutely unprecedented. No other type \nof health care service in Medicare has ever seen drastic cuts like \nthis. Remember, our goal in the Balanced Budget Act was to slow down \nthe growth of the program, not to slash almost half of the spending out \nof vital services like home health care. In 1997, we envisioned $16 \nbillion in savings from home health over five years--but the most \nrecent estimates show that we are on target to get $69 billion in \nsavings, more then four times the target figure. This is not how \nanybody wanted to balance the federal budget.\n\n  No State has been spared this crisis, but the seniors and the \ndisabled in my home state of Missouri have been particularly hard-hit. \n27,000 fewer patients are receiving home care than before--that's a \ndrop of 30 percent. And while Missouri had 300 home health agencies \nwhen the Balanced Budget Act passed, we now have just 161. That's \nalmost 140 health care providers that Missourians need--but that are \nnow gone.\n  All of this points to the fact that the breadth and the depth of the \npost-Balanced Budget Act problems are undeniably worse in home health \ncare than any other part of Medicare. That's the first thing that \ndistinguishes home care from other struggling Medicare providers.\n  The second thing that is unique about home health--the biggest cuts \nmay be yet to come.\n  While hospitals, nursing homes, hospice programs, and other Medicare \nproviders still face some additional Balanced Budget Act cuts, most of \nthe BBA provisions have already either taken effect or been erased by \nthe two ``Medicare giveback'' bills we have passed into law.\n  But home health care patients and providers still have the largest \nBBA cut of all staring them in the fact--the 15-percent across-the-\nboard home health cuts that are now scheduled for October of 2002. \nThat's a 15-percent cut on top of everything else that has happened \nthus far--on top of the loss of 900,000 patients, on top of the loss of \n3,000-plus home health agencies, and on top of the loss of almost half \nof Medicare home health spending.\n  I do not believe this should happen, and I actually don't know of \nanybody who believes the 15-percent home health cuts should go into \neffect. That's why Congress has already delayed the 15-percent cuts \nthree separate times.\n  To impose these cuts, given all that home health care has been \nthrough, would be adding insult to injury. It would risk putting \nthousands more home health agencies out-of-business, perhaps risking \nthe care for a million more patients.\n  Today, Senator Collins and I propose to fix this once and for all--no \nmore mere delays, no more half-measures. The key provision in the Home \nHealth Payment Fairness Act would permanently eliminate these 15-\npercent cuts. This will be expensive--probably more than $10 billion \nover 10 years. I don't think anybody in Congress wants to drop the \nguillotine on home health by imposing these cuts--that's what the three \ndelays have shown. We need to just bite the bullet and get rid of them \nonce and for all.\n  The one additional key provision in our bill would make permanent the \n10-percent bonus payments that we are about to start giving rural home \nhealth agencies. These new rural payments recognize that, historically, \nrural patients have been more expensive due to the added transportation \nand labor costs incurred as home health nurses travel longer distances \nbetween visits. The second Medicare ``giveback'' bill that Congress \njust passed into law in December authorized these bonus payments for \nthe first time--but only for a two-year period. The reasons that rural \npatients cost more are going to last for more than two years--we \nbelieve the added rural payments should as well.\n  This policy change will provide desperately-needed assistance to help \nhome health care in rural America--which, as I mentioned earlier, has \nbeen much harder hit by the home health\n\n[[Page S1399]]\n\ncrisis. These added payments would be similar to the 10-percent \nincentive bonus Medicare currently pays to doctors in rural areas, and \nwould serve the same purpose as the various Medicare mechanisms we have \nto protect rural hospitals. The rural incentives for doctors and \nhospitals are part of permanent law; the rural incentives for home \nhealth should be too.\n  Home health care has been through enough. Our Nation's dedicated home \nhealth providers--and you know they are dedicated if they have struck \nwith it through the difficulties of the last few years--deserve to be \nleft along and given a rest. They deserve to be left alone to recover \nfrom the post-Balanced Budget Act chaos. They deserve to be left alone \nin order to adjust to a brand new home health payment system that \nMedicare put into place a few months ago--a new payment system \nspecifically designed to reduce overuse of service in a much more \nintelligent and appropriate way than arbitrary cuts like those that are \nscheduled. And they deserve to be left alone to focus on providing \nhigh-quality care to Medicare patients. The seniors and disabled \nAmericans who rely on home health for their health care, and for their \nindependence, deserve no less.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Missouri for his leadership on \nhome health care. I agree with him. It does save money for the patient, \nand we want to encourage it as far as health care is concerned.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join the chorus of support \nfor the Home Health Payment Fairness Act. The intent of this important \nlegislation is two-fold--first, eliminate the impending 15 percent \nreduction in home health payments scheduled to take effect in October \n2002, and second, restore a modicum of stability and predictability to \nthe home health funding stream after years of volatility and turmoil. I \nwas pleased to introduce similar language with Senator Collins last \nCongress; I am pleased to do so again.\n  Over the past several years, Congress has worked to address the \nunintended consequences of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, BBA. \nSpecifically, we have sought to alleviate the tremendous financial \nburdens that have been borne by the home health industry and the \npatients who rely on these agencies for care. Since the enactment of \nthe BBA, there has been a remarkable 48 percent decline in Medicare \nhome health expenditures. Moreover, across the nation, home health \nagencies have been forced to cut back on services, and in some cases, \nclose their doors forever. As a result, vulnerable and frail Medicare \nbeneficiaries are being deprived of medically needed health services \nthat enable these populations to receive care while remaining in the \ncomfort of their homes and communities.\n  While we have been able to correct for a number of the problems, one \nissue we have yet to resolve affirmatively is the impending 15 percent \nfor home health services. This reduction, which was originally \nscheduled to take effect in October 2000, has been delayed since 2002. \nWhile this delay is certainly significant, we can and must do more to \nrestore predictability to the home health reimbursement system. We must \nsee to it that the 15 percent cut is eliminated--and I hope we can \nachieve that goal this year.\n  As we have already seen, reductions of this magnitude are all too \noften shouldered by small, nonprofit home health agencies and the \nelderly and disabled beneficiaries they serve. Home health care \nagencies in my home state of Rhode Island have been especially hard hit \nby these changes. We have seen a significant decline in the number of \nbeneficiaries served and access to care for more medically complex \npatients threatened by these cuts. These reductions have clearly had \nnegative impact on patients who heavily rely on home health services.\n  Nationally, between 1997 and 1998, the number of Medicare \nbeneficiaries receiving home health services has fallen 14 percent, \nwhile the total number of home health visits has fallen by 40 percent. \nWe have seen a similar trend in Rhode Island, where over 3,000 fewer \nbeneficiaries are receiving home health care--representing a decline of \n16 percent--and the total number of visits has fallen 38 percent. These \nindividuals are either being forced to turn to more expensive \nalternatives, such as institutional-based nursing homes and skilled \nnursing facilities for their care, or these individuals are simply \ngoing without care, which places an immeasurable burden on the family \nand friends of vulnerable beneficiaries.\n  I truly do not believe this is the path we want to remain on when it \ncomes to home health care. In light of the impending ``senior boom'' \nthat will be hitting our entitlement programs in a few short years, we \nshould be doing all we can to preserve and strengthen the Medicare home \nhealth benefit. We can begin to do so by eliminating the 15 percent \nreduction in home health payments. By taking this step, we will \nalleviate an enormous burden that has been looming over financially \nstrapped home health agencies as well as the frail and vulnerable \nMedicare beneficiaries who rely on these critical services.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this critical \nlegislation, and I look forward to working with Senator Collins and my \nother colleagues on the home health issue this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Wellstone, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Reid, Mr. Sarbanes, \n        and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 327. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to provide up-to-date school library media resources and well-\ntrained, professionally certified school library media specialists for \nelementary schools and secondary schools, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation to support and strengthen America's school libraries.\n  Research shows that well-equipped and well-staffed school libraries \nare essential to promoting literacy, learning, and achievement. Indeed, \nrecent studies in Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Alaska reveal that a \nstrong library media program, consisting of a well-stocked school \nlibrary staffed by a trained, school-library media specialist, helps \nstudents learn more and score higher on standardized tests than their \npeers in library-impoverished schools. These findings echo earlier \nstudies conducted in the 1990s, which found that students in schools \nwith well-equipped libraries and professional library specialists \nperformed better on achievement tests for reading comprehension and \nbasic research skills.\n  Mr. President, with our ever-changing global economy, access to \ninformation and the skills to use it are vital to ensuring that young \nAmericans are competitive and informed citizens of the world. That is \nwhy the school library is so important in supplementing what is learned \nin the classroom; promoting better learning, including reading, \nresearch, library use, and electronic database skills; and providing \nthe foundation for independent learning that allows students to achieve \nthroughout their educational careers and their lives.\n  While the promise of a well-equipped school library to promote \nliteracy, learning, and achievement is boundless, and its importance \ngreater than ever, the condition of libraries today does not live up to \nthat potential. As Linda Wood, a school-library media specialist from \nSouth Kingstown High School in Rhode Island, noted during a Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing two years ago, school \nlibrary collections are outdated and sparse.\n  Many schools across the nation are dependent on books purchased in \nthe mid-1960s with dedicated funding provided under the original \nElementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. Many of the \nbooks still on school library shelves today were purchased with this \nfunding and have not been replaced since 1981, when this dedicated \nfunding was folded into what is now the Title VI block grant. As a \nresult, many books in our school libraries predate the landing of \nmanned spacecraft on the moon, the breakup of the Soviet Union, the end \nof Apartheid, the Internet, and advances in DNA research.\n  Mr. President, over the past several months I have received over one \nhundred books pulled from library shelves\n\n[[Page S1400]]\n\nacross the country which further illustrate the sad state of school \nlibraries today. I would like to cite just a few examples.\n  A book entitled Rockets Into Space, copyright 1959, informs students \nthat ``there is a way to get to the moon and even distant planets, [but \nthe trip must] be made in two stages. The first stage would be from \nearth to a space station. The second stage would be from the space \nstation to the moon. It would cost a lot of money to buy a ticket to \nthe moon.'' This book was checked out of a Los Angeles school library \n13 times since 1995.\n  Further, a book found on a Rhode Island school library shelf, \nentitled Studying the Middle East in Elementary and Secondary Schools, \ncopyright 1968, contains the following information: ``UNDERSTANDING \nSOME CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ARABS--It is difficult to generalize about \nany group of people and yet there are some characteristics which seem \npredominant and helpful in understanding the Arabs.'' Needless to say, \nthe book then proceeds to describe characteristics of Arab people in \nderogatory terms.\n  And finally, a book entitled Colonial Life in America, copyright \n1962, found on a shelf in a Philadelphia school library, informs the \nstudent that life on ``a large plantation in the South was like a \nvillage. Slave families had their own cabins.'' This book describes \nsouthern plantation life as idyllic, without reference to the harshness \nand injustice of life as a slave.\n  As you can see, in a rapidly changing world, our students are placed \nat a major disadvantage if the only scientific, geographical, and \nhistorical materials they have access to are outdated and inaccurate. \nThe reason for this sad state of affairs is the loss of targeted, \nnational funding for school libraries.\n  In sum, school library funding is grossly inadequate to the task of \nimproving and supplementing collections. Library spending per student \ntoday is a small fraction of the cost of a new book. Indeed, while the \naverage school library book costs $16, the average spending per student \nfor books is approximately $6.75 in elementary schools; $7.30 in middle \nschools; and $6.25 in high schools. Consequently, many schools cannot \nremove outdated books from their shelves because there is no money to \nreplace these books.\n  My home state of Rhode Island is working on an innovative effort to \nensure that students gain access to materials not available in their \nown school libraries. RILINK, the Rhode Island Library Information \nNetwork for Kids, gives students and teachers 24-hour Internet access \nto a statewide catalog of school library holdings, complete with \ninformation about the book's status on the shelf. RILINK also allows \nfor on-line request of materials via interlibrary loan, with rapid \ndelivery through a statewide courier system, and provides links from \nbook information records to related Internet research sites, allowing a \nsingle book request to serve as a point of departure for a galaxy of \ninformation sources.\n  Unfortunately, such innovations, which could benefit schoolchildren \nacross the nation, cannot be expanded without adequate library funding. \nIndeed, the only federal funding that is currently available to school \nlibraries is the Title VI block grant, which allows expenditure for \nschool library and instructional materials as one of nine choices for \nlocal uses of funds. Since 1981, states have chosen other needs above \nschool library books and technology. Sadly, districts only spend an \nestimated 17 percent of funds on school library and instructional \nmaterials. This amount is wholly insufficient to replace outdated books \nin both our classrooms and school libraries, and this lack of targeting \nand diffusion of funding is why block grants are so harmful.\n  Mr. President, well-trained school library media specialists are also \nessential to helping students unlock their potential. These individuals \nare at the heart of guiding students in their work, providing research \ntraining, maintaining and developing collections, and ensuring that a \nlibrary fulfills its potential. In addition, they have the skills to \nguide students in the use of the broad variety of advanced \ntechnological education resources now available.\n  Unfortunately, only 68 percent of schools have state-certified \nlibrary media specialists, according to Department of Education \nfigures, and, on average, there is only one specialist for every 591 \nstudents. This shortage means that many school libraries are staffed by \nvolunteers and are open only a few days a week.\n  I am introducing this bipartisan bill today, along with Senators \nCochran, Kennedy, Dodd, Bingaman, Wellstone, Murray, Mikulski, Clinton, \nChafee, Rockefeller, Reid, Sarbanes, and Baucus to restore the funding \nthat is critical to improving school libraries. The Improving Literacy \nThrough School Libraries Act authorizes $500 million to help school \nlibraries with the greatest needs update their collections and would \nensure that students have access to the informational tools they need \nto learn and achieve at the highest levels. This bill allows for \nmaximum flexibility, enabling schools to use the funds to update \nlibrary media resources, such as books and advanced technology, train \nschool-library media specialists, and facilitate resource-sharing among \nschool libraries. The bill also establishes the School Library Access \nProgram to provide students with access to school libraries during non-\nschool hours, including before and after school, weekends, and summers.\n  Providing access to the most up-to-date school library collections is \nan essential part of increasing student achievement, improving literacy \nskills, and helping students become lifelong learners. The bipartisan \nImproving Literacy Through School Libraries Act is strongly supported \nby the American Library Association, and will help accomplish these \nessential goals. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important \nlegislation and work for its inclusion in the upcoming reauthorization \nof the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill and a letter of \nsupport written by the American Library Association be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 327\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jack Reed,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reed: I would like to take this opportunity to \n     thank you and Senator Thad Cochran for your bi-partisan \n     support of school libraries as you introduce the Improving \n     Literacy Through School Libraries Act of 2001. This bill \n     would provide assistance to the nation's school libraries and \n     school library media specialists at a time when they are \n     laboring mightily to cope with the challenges of increasing \n     school enrollment, new technology and the lack of funding for \n     school library resources.\n       As an academic librarian in New York, I know personally how \n     this legislation will contribute to effective learning by our \n     school children. Many of the nation's school\n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\n     libraries have collections that are old, inaccurate and out \n     of date. How can we encourage children to read, continue \n     their education in college and become life-long learners if \n     the material we have available for them is inadequate?\n       Your legislation proposes to upgrade collections, encourage \n     and train school librarians, and effect greater cooperation \n     between school professionals directly involved teaching \n     children--school library media specialists, teachers and \n     administrators. This critical legislation should be included \n     in the reauthorization process now going forward in the \n     Senate. The school children of today deserve the best \n     resources we have to give them.\n       On behalf of the 61,000 school, public, academic and \n     special librarians, library trustees, friends of libraries \n     and library supporters, I thank you for your effort to \n     improve the resources in school libraries. We offer the \n     support of our members in working towards passage of the \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Nancy C. Kranich,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 329. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \ntheme study on the peopling of America, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, America is truly unique in that almost all \nof us are migrants or immigrants to the United States, originating in \ndifferent regions--whether from Asia, from islands in the Pacific \nOcean, Mexico, or valleys and mesas of the Southwest, Europe or other \nregions of the world. The prehistory and the contemporary history of \nthis nation are inextricably linked to the mosaic or migrations, \nimmigrations and existing cultures in the U.S. that has resulted in the \npeopling of America. Americans are all travelers from diverse areas, \nregions, continents and islands.\n  We need a better understanding of this coherent and unifying theme in \nAmerica. With this in mind, I am introducing legislation, along with my \ncolleagues Senator Inouye and Senator Graham, authorizing the National \nPark Service to conduct a theme study on the peopling of America. An \nidentical bill passed the Senate last Congress, and I am optimistic \nthat the Senate will again pass this bill.\n  The purpose of the study is to provide a basis for identifying, \ninterpreting and preserving sites related to the migration, immigration \nand settling of America. The peopling of America is the story of our \nnation's population and how we came to be the diverse set of people \nthat we are today. The peopling of America will acknowledge the \ncontributions and trials of the first peoples who settled the North \nAmerican continent, the Pacific Islands, and the lands that later \nbecame the United States of America. The peopling of America has \ncontinued as Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch, and English laid claim \nto lands and opened the floodgates of European migration and the \ninvoluntary migration of Africans to the Americas.\n  This was just the beginning. America has been growing and changing \never since. It is critical that we document and include the growth and \nchange in the United States as groups of people move across external \nand internal boundaries that make up our nation. By understanding all \nour contributions, the strength within all cultures, and the diffusion \nof cultural ways through the United States, we will be a better nation. \nThe strength of American culture is in our diversity and rests on a \ncomprehensive understanding of the peopling of America.\n  The theme study I am proposing will authorize the Secretary of the \nInterior to identify regions, areas, trails, districts and cultures \nthat illustrate and commemorate key events in the migration, \nimmigration and settlement of the population of the United States, and \nwhich can provide a basis for the preservation and interpretation of \nthe peopling of America. It includes preservation and education \nstrategies to capture elements of our national culture and history such \nas immigration, migration, ethnicity, family, gender, health, \nneighborhood, and community. In addition, the study will make \nrecommendations regarding National Historic Landmark designations and \nNational Register of Historic Places nominations, as appropriate. The \nstudy will also facilitate the development of cooperative programs with \neducation institutions, public history organizations, state and local \ngovernments, and groups knowledgeable about the peopling of America.\n  We are entering a new millennium with hope and opportunity. It is \nincumbent on us to reflect on the extent to which the energy and wealth \nof the United States depends on our population diversity. Looking back, \nwe understand that our history, and our very national character, is \ndefined by the grand, entangled movements of people to America and \nacross the American landscape--through original residency, European \ncolonization, forced migrations, economic migrations, or politically-\nmotivated immigration--that has given rise to the rich interactions \nthat make the American character and experience unique. I would venture \nto say that no other nation has the heterogeneous patchwork of \nmigration and movement around the country that is found and that makes \nus the American Nation.\n\n  We embody the cultures and traditions that our forebears brought from \nother places and shores, as well as the new traditions and cultures \nthat we adopted or created anew upon arrival. Whether we are the \noriginal inhabitants of the rich Pacific Northwest, settled in the \nrangelands and agrarian West, the industrialized Northeast, the small \ntowns of the Midwest, or the genteel cities of the South, our forebears \ninevitably contributed their background and created new relationships \nwith peoples of other backgrounds and cultures. Our rich heritage as \nAmericans is comprehensible only through the stories of our various \nconstituent cultures, carried with us from other lands and transformed \nby encounters with other cultures.\n  All Americans are travelers. All cultures have creation stories and \nhistories that place us here from somewhere. Whether we came to this \nland as native peoples. English colonists, Africans who were brought in \nslavery, Filipinos who came to work in Hawaii's cane fields, Mexican \nranchers, or Chinese merchants, the process by which our nation was \npeopled transformed us from strangers from different shores into \nneighbors unified in our inimitable diversity--Americans all. It is \nessential for us to understand this process, not only to understand who \nand where we are, but also to help us understand who we wish to be and \nwhere we should be headed as a nation. As the caretaker of some of our \nmost important cultural and historical resources, from Ellis Island to \nSan Juan Island, from Chaco Canyon to Kennesaw Mountain, the National \nPark Service is in a unique position to conduct a study that can offer \nguidance on this fundamental subject.\n  Currently we have only one focal point in the national park system \nthat celebrates the peopling of America with significance. Ellis Island \nand the Statue of Liberty National Monument. Ellis Island welcomed over \n12 million immigrants between 1892 and 1954, an overwhelming majority \nof whom crossed the Atlantic from Europe. Ellis Island celebrates these \nimmigrant experiences through their museum, historic buildings, and \nmemorial wall. Immensely popular as it is, Ellis Island is focused on \nAtlantic immigration and thus reflects the experience only of those \ngroups (primarily Eastern and Southern Europeans) who were processed at \nthe island during its active period, 1892-1954.\n  Not all immigrants and their descendants can identify with Ellis \nIsland. Tens of millions of other immigrants traveled to our great \ncountry through other ports of entry and in different periods of our \nNation's history and prehistory. Ellis Island tells only part of the \nAmerican story. There are other chapters, just as compelling, that must \nbe told.\n  On the West Coast, Angel Island Immigration Station, tucked in San \nFrancisco Bay, was open from 1910 to 1940 and processed hundreds of \nthousands of Pacific Rim immigrants through its portals. An estimated \n175,000 Chinese immigrants and more than 20,000 Japanese made the long \nPacific passage to the United States. Their experiences are a West \nCoast mirror of the Ellis Island experience. But the migration story on \nthe West Coast is much longer and broader than Angel Island. Many \nearlier migrants to the West Coast contributed to the rich history of \nCalifornia, including the original resident\n\n[[Page S1403]]\n\nNative Americans, Spanish explorers, Mexican ranchers, Russian \ncolonists, American migrants from the Eastern states who came overland \nor around the Horn, German and Irish military recruits, Chinese \nrailroad laborers, Portuguese and Italian farmers, and many other \ngroups. The diversity and experience of these groups reflects the \ndiversity and experience of all immigrants who entered the United \nStates via the Western states, including Alaska, Washington, Oregon, \nand California.\n  The study we propose is consistent with the agency's latest official \nthematic framework which establishes the subject of human population \nmovement and change--or ``peopling places''--as a primary thematic \ncategory for study and interpretation. The framework, which serves as a \ngeneral guideline for interpretation, was revised in 1996 in response \nto a Congressional mandate--Civil War Sites Study Act of 1990, Public \nLaw 101-628, Sec. 1209--that the full diversity of American history and \nprehistory be expressed in the National Park Service's identification \nand interpretation of historic and prehistoric properties.\n  In conclusion, we believe that this bill will shed light on the \nunique blend of pluralism and unity that characterizes our national \npolity. With its responsibility for cultural and historical parks, the \nPark Service plays a unique role in enhancing our understanding of the \npeopling of America and thus of a fuller comprehension of our \nrelationships with each other--past, present, and future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this initiative. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 329\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand the powers of the Secretary of the Treasury \nto regulate the manufacture, distribution, and\n\n[[Page S1404]]\n\nsale of firearms and ammunition, and to expand the jurisdiction of the \nSecretary to include firearm products and non-powder firearms; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Firearms \nSafety and Consumer Protection Act of 2001. I am sure that this bill \nwill face opposition, but I am equally sure that the need for this bill \nis so clear, and the logic so unquestionable, that we will eventually \nsee gun consumers fighting for the passage of the legislation.\n  Mr. President, I have long fought against the gun injuries that have \nplagued America for years. We succeeded in enacting the Brady bill and \nthe ban on devastating assault weapons. And in the 104th Congress, even \nin the midst of what many consider a hostile Congress, we told domestic \nviolence offenders that they could no longer own a gun. These were each \nmeasures aimed at the criminal misuse of firearms.\n  But there is another subject that the NRA just hates to talk about--\nthe countless injuries that occur to innocent gun owners, recreational \nhunters, and to law enforcement. Every year in this country, countless \npeople die and many more are injured by defective or poorly \nmanufactured firearms. Yet the Consumer Products Safety Commission, \nwhich has the power to regulate every other product sold to the \nAmerican consumer, lacks the ability to regulate the manufacture of \nfirearms.\n  Amazingly, in a nation that regulates everything from the air we \nbreathe, to the cars we drive, to the cribs that hold our children, the \nmost dangerous consumer product sold, firearms, are unregulated. \nStudies show that inexpensive safety technology and the elimination of \nflawed guns could prevent a third of accidental firearms deaths. \nDespite this fact, the Federal government is powerless to stop gun \ncompanies from distributing defective guns or failing to warn consumers \nof dangerous products.\n  This gaping loophole in our consumer protection laws can often be \ndisastrous for gun users. To take just one recent example, even when a \ngun manufacturer discovered that it had sold countless defective guns \nwith a tendency to misfire, no recall was mandated and no action could \nbe taken by the federal government. The guns remained on the street, \nand consumers were defenseless. Time after time, consumers, hunters, \nand gun owners are each left out in the cold, without the knowledge of \ndanger or the assistance necessary to protect themselves from it.\n  For too long now, the gun industry has successfully kept guns exempt \nfrom consumer protection laws, and we must finally bring guns into line \nwith every other consumer product. Logic, common sense, and the many \ninnocent victims of defective firearms all cry out for us to act--and \nact we must.\n  To that end, I am introducing the Firearms Safety and Consumer \nProtection Act, legislation giving the Secretary of the Treasury the \npower to regulate the manufacture, distribution, and sale of firearms \nand ammunition. The time has come to stop dangerous and defective guns \nfrom killing American consumers. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill. I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 330\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I am pleased that Senator Roberts, Senator \nMcConnell, and Senator Burns joined as cosponsors of this bill.\n  A Republican controlled Congress in 1996 produced a sweeping reform \nof farm programs. Farmers were no longer told by the government what \ncrops they had to plant. Farmers were no longer forced by the \ngovernment to idle part of their land in exchange for program payments. \nThat farm bill disentangled farmers from government controls and \nenabled them to make production decisions based on market signals.\n  Freeing farmers from excessive, and often counterproductive, \ngovernment controls is an important step, but we still need to do more \nto give farmers the tools they need to succeed. Specifically, we need \nto work to open foreign markets for our agricultural commodities and \nproducts, ease the tax and regulatory burden, and provide new risk \nmanagement tools for farmers. The Rural America Prosperity Act of 2001, \nwhich we are introducing today, will help us meet these unfulfilled \npromises to rural America.\n  There are three tax provisions in this legislation that I have long \nadvocated as crucial to the financial health of farmers. First is the \nrepeal of the estate tax. A repeal of this tax, which has prevented \nsome farms from being passed from one generation to the next, is \nessential. We are proposing the same 10-year phase-out of the estate \ntax which Congress passed last year but President Clinton vetoed. \nExcluding capital gains from the sale of farmland would put production \nagriculture on the same footing as homeowners who benefit from a \ncapital gains exclusion for their home. The deduction of health care \ninsurance premiums is needed for farmers and others who are self-\nemployed.\n  Last year Congress provided over $8 billion to improve the federal \ncrop insurance program. While crop insurance is an important risk \nmanagement tool, today we offer two other risk management tools for \nfarmers--income averaging and FARRM accounts. Three years ago Congress \nmade income averaging a permanent risk management tool for farmers when \ncalculating taxes. Unfortunately, the interaction between income \naveraging and the alternative minimum tax has prevented many farmers \nfrom receiving the benefit of income averaging. This bill fixes that \nproblem. Under this bill, farmers will be able to contribute up to 20 \npercent of annual farm income into a FARRM account and deduct this \namount from their taxes. This is an important tool for managing \nfinancial volatility associated with farming.\n  We also address regulatory reform in our bill. We are seeking a \nreview of existing and proposed regulations to determine the cost of \ncompliance for farmers, ranchers and foresters. We want to determine if \nthere are more cost-effective ways for farmers, ranchers and foresters \nto achieve the objectives of these regulations.\n  Finally, we must do more to help develop new markets abroad for our \nfarm commodities and agricultural products. Opportunity lies in \ndeveloping countries where growing wealth allows for increased demand \nfor meat and processed commodities. Authorizing fast-track authority \nfor the President to negotiate international trade agreements may be \nthe single most important thing we can do to facilitate exports.\n  We also need to address sanctions. Sanctions that prohibit the export \nof U.S. agricultural products into the sanctioned country are often \nmorally indefensible because they deny necessities to people, not the \noffending government. Such sanctions also deny markets for U.S. \nagricultural products which are then captured by our competitors. This \nlegislation only affects commercial sales (excluding all Government \nsubsidized trade programs) involving United States agricultural \ncommodities, livestock, and value-added products.\n  This legislation represents what I believe is necessary to further \nthe historic reforms initiated in the farm bill almost five years ago. \nI urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill. I will encourage my \ncolleagues and the new Bush administration to work to enact these \nproposals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S1407]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 333\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (G) otherwise ensuring that countries that accede to the \n     World Trade Organization have made meaningful market \n     liberalization commitments in agriculture.\n       (7) Labor, environment, and other matters.--The principal \n     negotiating objective of the United States regarding labor, \n     environment, and other matters is to address the\n\n[[Page S1413]]\n\n     following aspects of foreign government policies and \n     practices regarding labor, environment, and other matters \n     that are directly related to trade:\n       (A) To ensure that foreign labor, environmental, health, or \n     safety policies and practices do not arbitrarily or \n     unjustifiably discriminate or serve as disguised barriers to \n     trade.\n       (B) To ensure that foreign governments do not derogate from \n     or waive existing domestic environmental, health, safety, or \n     labor measures, including measures that deter exploitative \n     child labor, as an encouragement to gain competitive \n     advantage in international trade or investment. Nothing in \n     this subparagraph is intended to address changes to a \n     country's laws that are consistent with sound macroeconomic \n     development.\n       (8) WTO extended negotiations.--The principal negotiating \n     objectives of the United States regarding trade in financial \n     services are those set forth in section 135(a) of the Uruguay \n     Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3555(a)), regarding trade in \n     civil aircraft are those set forth in section 135(c) of that \n     Act, and regarding rules of origin are the conclusion of an \n     agreement described in section 132 of that Act (19 U.S.C. \n     3552).\n       (c) International Economic Policy Objectives.--\n       (1) In general.--The President should take into account the \n     relationship between trade agreements and other important \n     priorities of the United States and seek to ensure that the \n     trade agreements entered into by the United States complement \n     and reinforce other policy goals.

or\n       (B) one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.\n       (5) Other limitations.--A rate of duty reduction that may \n     not be proclaimed by reason of paragraph (2) may take effect \n     only if a provision authorizing such reduction is included \n     within an implementing bill provided for under section 305 \n     and that bill is enacted into law.\n       (6) Other tariff modifications.--Notwithstanding paragraphs \n     (1)(B) and (2) through (5), and subject to the consultation \n     and layover requirements of section 115 of the Uruguay Round \n     Agreements Act, the President may proclaim the modification \n     of any duty or staged rate reduction of any duty set forth in \n     Schedule XX, as defined in section 2(5) of that Act, if the \n     United States agrees to such modification or staged rate \n     reduction in a negotiation for the reciprocal elimination or \n     harmonization of duties under the auspices of the World Trade \n     Organization or as part of an interim agreement leading to \n     the formation of a regional free-trade area.\n       (7) Authority under uruguay round agreements act not \n     affected.--Nothing in this subsection shall limit the \n     authority provided to the President under section 111(b) of \n     the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)).\n       (b) Agreements Regarding Tariff and Nontariff Barriers.--\n       (1) In general.--(A) Whenever the President determines \n     that--\n       (i) one or more existing duties or any other import \n     restriction of any foreign country or the United States or \n     any other barrier to, or other distortion of, international \n     trade unduly burdens or restricts the foreign trade of the \n     United States or adversely affects the United States economy, \n     or\n       (ii) the imposition of any such barrier or distortion is \n     likely to result in such a burden, restriction, or effect,\n\n     and that the purposes, policies, and objectives of this title \n     will be promoted thereby, the President may enter into a \n     trade agreement described in subparagraph (B) during the \n     period described in subparagraph (C).\n       (B) The President may enter into a trade agreement under \n     subparagraph (A) with foreign countries providing for--\n       (i) the reduction or elimination of a duty, restriction, \n     barrier, or other distortion described in subparagraph (A), \n     or\n       (ii) the prohibition of, or limitation on the imposition \n     of, such barrier or other distortion.\n       (C) The President may enter into a trade agreement under \n     this paragraph before--\n       (i) October 1, 2003, or\n       (ii) October 1, 2007, if trade authorities procedures are \n     extended under subsection (c).\n       (2) Conditions.--A trade agreement may be entered into \n     under this subsection only if such agreement makes progress \n     in meeting the applicable objectives described in section 302 \n     and the President satisfies the conditions set forth in \n     section 304.\n       (3) Bills qualifying for trade authorities procedures.--The \n     provisions of section 151 of the Trade Act of 1974 (in this \n     title referred to as ``trade authorities procedures'')\n\n[[Page S1414]]\n\n     apply to a bill of either House of Congress consisting only \n     of--\n       (A) a provision approving a trade agreement entered into \n     under this subsection and approving the statement of \n     administrative action, if any, proposed to implement such \n     trade agreement,\n       (B) provisions directly related to the principal trade \n     negotiating objectives set forth in section 302(b) achieved \n     in such trade agreement, if those provisions are necessary \n     for the operation or implementation of United States rights \n     or obligations under such trade agreement,\n       (C) provisions that define and clarify, or provisions that \n     are related to, the operation or effect of the provisions of \n     the trade agreement,\n       (D) provisions to provide adjustment assistance to workers \n     and firms adversely affected by trade, and\n       (E) provisions necessary for purposes of complying with \n     section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985 in implementing the trade agreement,\n\n     to the same extent as such section 151 applies to \n     implementing bills under that section.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan exclusion from gross income for distributions from qualified State \ntuition programs which are used to pay education expenses, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I am once again honored to \nintroduce a bill which focuses on an important issue facing American \nfamilies today--paying for the education of their children. I have long \nbelieved that we need to make college education more affordable, and my \nlegislation, the Setting Aside for a Valuable Education, or SAVE, Act, \nwill do that by making savings in qualified tuition savings plans \nentirely tax-free. I am pleased to be joined in this endeavor by the \nbill's original co-sponsors, Senators Graham, Bunning, DeWine, Warner, \nand Lugar.\n  I have worked for the past six years to make saving for college \neasier for American families by providing ways to help them keep pace \nwith the rising cost of a college education through tax incentives. In \n1994, I introduced the first bill to make education savings in state \ntuition plans exempt from taxation. Since that time, Congress has made \nsignificant progress toward achieving this important goal.\n  In 1996, I was able to include a provision in the Small Business Job \nProtection Act that clarified the tax treatment of state-sponsored \nsavings plans and the participants' investment. This measure \nestablished that account earnings on the savings plans are to be \nincluded in gross income when distributions to attend school are made. \nThis was an important change because it removed the tax uncertainty \nthat was hindering the plans' effectiveness and helped families who are \ntrying to save for their children's future education needs. Before this \nclarification, it appeared that account earnings may be taxed annually, \nwhich would have deterred saving for education expenses. Also, my \nlanguage shifted the tax burden upon distribution of the funds from the \nparent to the student, who is generally taxed at a lower rate.\n  The following year, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 included several \nimportant legislative initiatives that maximized flexibility to \nfamilies with investments in long-term education savings plans. Through \nthis vehicle, I was pleased to be able to expand the definition of \n``eligible education expenses'' to include room and board costs so that \nthese expenses--often as much as one-half the entire cost of college--\nalso received the deferred tax treatment. Secondly, I was able to \ninclude a provision which expanded the definition of ``eligible \ninstitutions'' to include all schools, including certain proprietary \nschools, which are eligible under the Department of Education's student \naid program. Finally, I was pleased that the Taxpayer Relief Act \nincluded a more detailed definition of the term ``member of family'' to \nallow tax-free transfers of credits or account balances in a qualified \ntuition program to additional family members in the event that the \nnamed beneficiary does not attend college.\n  However, while I am proud of these initial success stories, I will \ncontinue to press to make education savings entirely tax free. While \nthe end is in\n\n[[Page S1418]]\n\nsight, we cannot claim victory until we achieve this goal. In fact, the \nneed for education savings tax relief is more acute then ever as recent \nstudies demonstrate that we must continue to encourage parents to adopt \na long-term savings approach for their children's future education.\n  According to the College Board, during the 2000-2001 academic school \nyear, the average tuition at four-year public colleges rose between 4.4 \nand 5.2 percent. It is important to note that this increase was higher \nthan the 1999 tuition increase of 3.4 percent. In addition, the College \nBoard estimates that room and board charges will increase between 4 and \n5 percent for next year. What is most frustrating is that despite the \nrecent economic boom, the cost of a college education continues to rise \nat a rate faster than many families can afford. According to the \nCollege Board, since 1980 the price of a college education has been \nrising between two and three times the Consumer Price Index. In fact, \ntuition and fees for a four year college education has risen 115 \npercent over inflation since the 1980-81 school year, while median \nhousehold income has risen only 20 percent. Over the past decade, \ntuition has increased between 32 and 49 percent, while family income \nover the same period has increased just 4 percent.\n  As a result, more and more families are forced to rely on financial \naid to meet tuition costs. In fact, a majority of all college students \nutilize some amount of financial assistance. The amount of financial \naid available to students and their families for the 1999-2000 school \nyear topped $68 billion, more than 4% above than the previous year. \nHowever, there has been a marked trend from grant-based assistance \nprograms to loan-based assistance programs, and today many students are \nforced to borrow in order to attend college. This shift toward loans \nincreases the financial burden of attending college because students \nand families must then assume interest costs that can add thousands to \nthe total cost of tuition.\n  We must not forget that compounded interest cuts both ways. For those \nstudents who must borrow, compounded interest is a burden, for those \nstudents and families who save, it is a blessing. By saving, \nparticipants can keep pace, or even ahead of, tuition increases. By \nborrowing, students bear additional interest costs that add thousands \nto the total cost of tuition. Savings have a positive impact by \nreducing the need for students to borrow tens of thousands of dollars \nin student loans. This will help make need-based grants, which target \nlow-income families, better meet the demands of those who are in most \nneed.\n  Mr. President, the need for rewarding long-term saving for college is \nclear. My legislation will recognize and award savings while allowing \nstudents and families that are participating in these state-sponsored \nplans to be exempt from federal income tax when the funds are used for \nqualified educational purposes. This bill will finish what I started in \n1994.\n  Mr. President, as a result of our actions over the last several \nyears, a majority of the states have implemented tuition savings plans \nfor their residents. In the mid-1980s, states first began to recognize \nthe difficulty that families faced in keeping pace with the rising cost \nof education. States like Kentucky, Florida, Ohio, and Michigan were \namong the first to start programs aimed at helping families save for \ntheir children's college education. Other states have since followed \nsuit, and currently 48 states have some form of tuition savings plans.\n  Today, there are nearly one million savers who have contributed over \n$2 billion in education savings. In the Commonwealth of Kentucky alone, \n3,250 beneficiaries have active accounts and have accumulated $13 \nmillion in savings. With average monthly contributions as low as $110, \nand nearly 60% of the participating families earning a household income \nof under $60,000 annually, state-sponsored tuition plans clearly \nbenefit middle-class families--the exact Americans who deserve and need \nsuch relief.\n  In addition to accomplishing my long-sought goal of making savings in \ntuition savings plans entirely tax-free, the SAVE Act, includes several \nother new provisions. It allows private institutions to establish their \nown qualified prepaid tuition programs, and at the same time includes \nimportant consumer protections to ensure that these new plans operate \nin a fiscally responsible manner. The SAVE Act also modifies the cap on \nroom and board expenses to more accurately reflect the cost of \nattending an institution of higher learning. The final important change \nmade in the SAVE Act is a provision allowing for one annual rollover \nbetween Section 529 plans to meet the needs of our increasingly mobile \nsociety.\n  I have worked closely with state plan administrators over the years \nseeking both their advice and support. When I introduce the SAVE Act \nthis afternoon, I will be honored once again to have the endorsement of \nthe National Association of State Treasurers and the College Savings \nPlans Network (CSPN). I ask unanimous consent that CSPN's letter of \nsupport be included in the record. They have worked tirelessly in \nsupport of this legislation because they know it is in the best \ninterests of plan participants--families who care about their \nchildren's education. In addition, state-sponsored tuition savings \nplans have recently been touted as one of the best ways to save for a \ncollege education by such influential magazines as Money, Fortune, and \nBusiness Week.\n  This overwhelming support for these programs underscores my belief \nthat we have a real opportunity to go even further toward making \ncollege affordable for American families. It is in our national \ninterest to maintain a quality and affordable education system for all \nfamilies--not merely those fortunate to have the resources. My \nlegislation rewards parents who are serious about their children's \nfuture and who are committed over the long-term to the education of \ntheir children by providing a significant tax break for all savers \nnationwide. This will reduce the cost of education and will not \nunnecessarily burden future generations with thousands of dollars in \nloans.\n  College is a lifelong investment. We must take steps to ensure that \nhigher education is within the reach of every child so that they are \nprepared to meet the challenges they will face in our increasingly \ncompetitive world. We must make it easier for families to save for \ncollege, and we can do so this year by providing total tax freedom for \neducation savings. My bill will make these tuition savings plans \nentirely tax-free when the money is drawn out to pay for college, and I \nbelieve that my legislation is the best approach to ensuring that our \nchildren can obtain a higher education without mortgaging their \nfutures.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the Senate on \nthis legislation and I look forward to working with the bill's co-\nsponsors and the Bush Administration to enact it into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 335\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Thank you for your continued \n     support of legislation to encourage college savings through \n     state-sponsored college savings programs. Your leadership in \n     helping families plan for their children's college education \n     is truly commendable; your foresight and knowledge have \n     enhanced the ability of all families to save. Section 529 \n     programs now represent over 1.4 million families who have \n     invested more than $8 billion for their children's future \n     higher education. The College Savings Plans Network \n     represents all 50 states that are currently operating or \n     developing Sec. 529 college savings programs.\n       In our continuing efforts to make a college education more \n     accessible and affordable for American families, we are very \n     appreciative of your sponsorship of the ``Setting Aside for a \n     Valuable Education (SAVE) Act,'' which would provide an \n     exclusion from gross income for earnings on Sec. 529 \n     accounts, as well as several technical amendments that would \n     make these college savings programs more user-friendly.\n       The college Savings Plans Network strongly supports an \n     exclusion from gross income for earnings on Sec. 529 \n     accounts. This tax treatment would be less burdensome to \n     administer than current tax provisions, and would result in \n     better compliance and less cost to college savings programs \n     and their participants. More importantly, an exclusion from \n     gross income would provide a powerful additional incentive \n     for families to save early for college expenses. Section 529 \n     of the Internal Revenue Code already contains restrictions \n     and penalties to prevent any potential abuse of these \n     programs.\n\n[[Page S1420]]\n\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me should you need any \n     additional information or have any questions. Thank you again \n     for your continued interest in and support of Sec. 529 \n     programs and the hundreds of thousands of children for whom \n     college is now an affordable reality.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    George Thomas,\n         Chair, College Savings Plans Network and New Hampshire \n           State Treasurer.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator McConnell and \nmy other Senate colleagues in launching an initiative to increase \nAmericans' access to college education. Today, we are introducing the \nSetting Aside for a Valuable Education Act. This bill extends tax-free \ntreatment to all state sponsored prepaid tuition plans and state \nsavings plans. This legislation also gives prepaid tuition plans \nestablished by private colleges and universities tax-exempt status.\n  Prepaid college tuition and savings programs have flourished at the \nstate level in the face of spiraling college costs. According to the \nCollege Board, between 1980 and 2000, the cost of going to a four-year \ncollege has increased 115 percent above the rate of inflation. The \ncause of this dramatic increase in tuition is the subject of \nsignificant debate. But whether these increases are attributable to \nincreased costs to the universities, reductions in state funding for \npublic universities, or the increased value of a college degree, the \nfact remains that financing a college education has become increasingly \ndifficult.\n  In response to higher college costs the states have engineered \ninnovative ways to help its families afford college. Michigan \nimplemented the first prepaid tuition plan in 1986. Florida followed in \n1988. Today 49 states have either implemented or are in the process of \nimplementing prepaid tuition plans or state education savings plans.\n  Prepaid college tuition plans allow parents to pay prospectively for \ntheir children's higher education at participating universities. States \npool these funds and invest them in a manner that will match or exceed \nthe pace of educational inflation. This ``locks in'' current tuition \nand guarantees financial access to a future college education. In 1996, \nCongress acted to ensure that the tax on the earnings in these state-\nsponsored programs is tax-deferred.\n  Senator McConnell and I believe the 107th Congress must move to make \nthese programs completely tax free. Students should be able to enroll \nin college without the fear of incurring a significant tax liability \njust because they went to school. The legislation extends this same tax \ntreatment to private college prepaid programs.\n  We believe that these programs should be tax free for numerous \nreasons. First, prepaid tuition and savings programs help middle income \nfamilies afford a college education. Florida's experience shows that it \nis not higher income families who take most advantage of these plans. \nIt is middle income families who want the discipline of monthly \npayments. They know that they would have a difficult time coming up \nwith funds necessary to pay for college if they waited until their \nchild enrolled. In Florida, more than 70 percent of participants in the \nstate tuition program have family income of less than $50,000. Second, \nCongress should make these programs tax free in order to encourage \nsavings and college attendance. Finally, for most families, these plans \nsimply represent the purchase of a service to be provided in the \nfuture. The accounts are not liquid, and the funds are transferred from \nthe state directly to the college or university. The imposition of a \ntax liability on earnings represents a substantial burden, because the \nstudent is required to find other means of generating the funds to pay \nthe tax.\n  I am pleased to have this opportunity to join my colleagues in \nintroducing this bill which makes a college education easier to obtain.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 336. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nuse of cash accounting method for certain small businesses; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \naddresses an issue of growing concern to small businesses across the \nnation--tax accounting methods. I am pleased to be working with our \ncolleague in the other body, Congressman Wally Herger, who is \nintroducing the companion to this legislation.\n  While this topic may lack the notoriety of some other tax issues \ncurrently in the spotlight like tax-rate reductions, estate-tax repeal, \nor elimination of the alternative minimum tax, it goes to the heart of \na business' daily operations--reflecting its income and expenses. And \nbecause it is such a fundamental issue, one may ask: ``What's the big \ndeal? Hasn't this been settled long ago?'' Regrettably, efforts by the \nTreasury Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over the past \ncouple of years have muddied what many small business owners have long \nseen as a settled issue.\n  To many small business owners, tax accounting simply means that they \nrecord gross receipts when they receive cash and expenses when they \nwrite a check for the various costs associated with operating a \nbusiness. The difference is income, which is subject to taxes. In its \nsimplest form, this is known as the ``cash receipts and disbursements'' \nmethod of accounting--or the ``cash method'' for short. It is easy to \nunderstand, it is simple to undertake in daily business operations, and \nfor the vast majority of small enterprises, it matches their income \nwith the related expenses in a given year. Coincidentally, it's also \nthe method of accounting used by the Federal government to keep track \nof the nearly $2 trillion in tax revenues it collects each year as well \nas all of its expenditures for salaries and expenses, procurement, and \nthe cost of various government programs.\n  Unfortunately, what's good for the Federal government apparently is \nnot good enough for small businesses. In recent years, the IRS has \ntaken a different view with respect to small businesses on the cash \nmethod. In too many cases, the IRS has asserted that a small business \nshould report its income when all events have occurred to establish the \nbusiness' right to receipt and the amount can reasonably be determined. \nSimilar principles are applied to determine when a business may \nrecognize an expense. This method of accounting is known as ``accrual \naccounting.'' The reality of accrual accounting for a small business is \nthat it may be deemed to have income well before the cash is actually \nreceived and an expense long after the cash is actually paid. As a \nresult, accrual accounting can create taxable income for a small \nbusiness that has yet to receive the cash necessary to pay the taxes.\n  While the IRS argues that the accrual method of accounting produces a \nmore accurate reflection of ``economic income,'' it also produces a \nmajor headache for small enterprise. Few entrepreneurs have the time or \nexperience to undertake accrual accounting, which forces them to hire \ncostly accountants and tax preparers. By some estimates, accounting \nfees can increase as much as 50 percent when accrual accounting is \nrequired, excluding the cost of high-tech computerized accounting \nsystems that some businesses must install. For the brave few that try \nto handle the accounting on their own, the accrual method often leads \nto major mistakes, resulting in tax audits and additional costs for \nprofessional help to sort the whole mess out--not to mention the \ninterest and penalties that the IRS may impose as a result of the \nmistake.\n  To make matters even worse, the IRS focused on small service \nproviders who use some merchandise in the performance of their service. \nIn an e-mail sent to practitioners in my State of Missouri and in \nKansas on March 22, 1999, the IRS'' local district office took special \naim at the construction industry asserting that ``[t]axpayers in the \nconstruction industry who are on the cash method of accounting may be \nusing an improper method. The cash method is permissible only if \nmaterials are not an income producing factor.'' For those lucky service \nproviders, the IRS has asserted that the use of merchandise requires \nthe business to undertake an additional and even more onerous form of \nbookkeeping--inventory accounting.\n  Let's be clear about the kind of taxpayer at issue here. It's the \nhome builder who by necessity must purchase wood, nails, dry wall, and \nhost of other items to provide the service of constructing a house. \nSimilarly, it's a painting contractor who will often purchase the paint \nwhen he renders the\n\n[[Page S1421]]\n\nservice of painting the interior of a house. These service providers \ngenerally purchase materials to undertake a specific project and at its \nend, little or no merchandise remains. They may even arrange for the \nproducts to be delivered directly to their client.\n  Mr. President, if we thought that accrual accounting is complicated \nand burdensome, imaging having to keep track of all the boards, nails, \nand paint used in the home builder's and painter's jobs each year. And \nit doesn't always stop at inventory accounting for these service \nproviders. Instead, the IRS has used it as the first step to imposing \noverall accrual accounting--a one-two punch for the small service \nprovider when it comes to compliance burdens.\n  Even more troubling is the cost of an audit for these unsuspecting \nservice providers who have never known they were required to use \ninventories or accrual accounting. According to a survey of \npractitioners by the Padgett Business Services Foundation, audits of \nbusinesses on the issue of merchandise used in the performance of \nservices resulted in tax deficiencies from $2,000 to $14,000, with an \naverage of $7,200. That's a steep price to pay for an accounting method \nerror that the IRS for years has never enforced.\n  The bill I'm introducing today--the Cash Accounting for Small \nBusiness Act of 2001--addresses both of these issues and builds on the \nlegislation that I introduced in the 106th Congress. First, the bill \nestablishes a clear threshold for when small businesses may use the \ncash method of accounting. Simply put, if a business has an average of \n$5 million in annual gross receipts or less during the preceding three \nyears, it may use the cash method. Plain and simple--no complicated \nformula; no guessing if you made the right assumptions and arrived at \nthe right answer. If the business exceeds the threshold, it may still \nseek to establish, as under current law, that the cash method clearly \nreflects its income.\n  Some may argue that this provision is unnecessary because section \n448(b) and (c) of the Internal Revenue Code already provide a $5 \nmillion gross receipts test with respect to accrual accounting. That's \na reasonable position since many in Congress back in 1986 intended \nsection 448 to provide relief for small business taxpayers using the \ncash method. Unfortunately, the IRS has twisted this section to support \nits quest to force as many small businesses as possible into costly \naccrual accounting. The IRS has construed section 448 to be merely a $5 \nmillion ceiling above which a business can never use the cash method. \nMy bill corrects this misinterpretation once and for all--if a business \nhas average gross receipts of $5 million or less, it is free to use \ncash accounting.\n  Additionally, the bill indexes the $5 million threshold for inflation \nso it will keep pace with price increases. As a result, small \nbusinesses will not be forced into the accrual method merely because \ntheir gross receipts increased due to inflation.\n  Second, for small service providers, the Cash Accounting for Small \nBusiness Act exempts these taxpayers from inventory accounting if they \nmeet the general $5 million threshold. These businesses will be able to \ndeduct the expenses for such inventory that are actually consumed and \nused in the operation of the business during that particular taxable \nyear. While the small service provider will still have to keep some \nminimal records as to the merchandise used during the year, it will be \nvastly more simple than having to comply with the onerous inventory \naccounting rules currently in place in the tax code.\n  The $5 million threshold set forth in my bill is a common-sense \nsolution to an increasing burden for small businesses in this country, \nwhich was recently highlighted by the IRS National Taxpayer Advocate. \nIn his 2001 Report to Congress, the Advocate noted that ``Small \nbusiness taxpayers may be burdened by having to maintain an accrual \nmethod of accounting for no other purpose than tax reporting. Because \nthese taxpayers can be relatively unsophisticated about tax and \ninventory accounting issues, they are likely to hire advisors to help \nthem comply with their tax obligations.'' Unfortunately, these higher \ncosts of recordkeeping and tax preparation take valuable capital away \nfrom the business and hinder its ability to grow and produce jobs. The \nCash Accounting for Small Business Act takes a big step toward easing \nthose burdens and allowing small business owners to dedicate their time \nand money to running successful enterprises--instead of filling out \ngovernment paperwork.\n  In addition, it sends a clear signal to the IRS: stop wasting scarce \nresources forcing small businesses to adopt complex and costly \naccounting methods when the benefit to the Treasury is simply a matter \nof timing. Whether a small business uses the cash or accrual method or \ninventory accounting or not, in the end, the government will still \ncollect the same amount of taxes--maybe not all this year, but very \nlikely early in the next year. What small business can go very long \nwithout collecting what it is owed or paying its bills?\n  Last year, the Treasury Department's answer was to propose a $1 \nmillion threshold under which a small business could escape accrual \naccounting and presumably inventories. While it is a step in the right \ndirection, it simply doesn't go far enough. Even ignoring inflation, if \na million dollar threshold were sufficient, why would Congress have \ntried to enact a $5 million threshold 14 years ago? My bill completes \nthe job that the Clinton Treasury Department was unable or unwilling to \ndo.\n  More recently, the IRS issued a notice announcing that the agency has \ntemporarily changed its litigation position concerning the requirement \nthat certain taxpayers must use inventory and accrual accounting. Based \non losses in several court cases, the IRS has decided to back off on \ntaxpayers in construction businesses similar to those addressed by the \ncourts. For those taxpayers, the agency has turned down the fire, and I \napplaud the IRS for its decision. The new litigation position, however, \ndoes not solve the underlying statutory issues that led the IRS to \npursue these taxpayers in the first place, nor is it any assurance that \nthe litigation position will not be changed again once the IRS'' Chief \nCounsel has completed its study of these issues. The Cash Accounting \nfor Small Businesses resolves this matter once and for all small \nbusinesses giving them clear rules and certainty as they struggle to \nkeep their businesses running.\n  The legislation I introduce today is the companion to the bill that \nCongressman Herger is introducing in the other body. Together with \nCongressman Herger and the small business community, I expect to \ncontinue the momentum that we started last year and achieve some much \nneeded relief from unnecessary compliance burdens and costs for \nAmerica's small businesses.\n  The call for tax simplification has been growing increasingly loud in \nrecent years, and this bill provides an excellent opportunity for us to \nadvance the ball well down the field. This is not a partisan issue; \nit's a small business issue. And I urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to join me in this common-sense legislation for the benefit \nof America's small enterprises, which contribute so greatly to this \ncountry's economic engine.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, \nthe text of the bill and a description of its provisions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 336\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

To qualify, the business must have $5 \n     million or less in average annual gross receipts based on the \n     preceding three years. Thus, even if the production, \n     purchase, or sale of merchandise is an income-producing \n     factor in the taxpayer's business, the taxpayer will not be \n     required to use an accrual method of accounting if the \n     taxpayer meets the average annual gross receipts test.\n       In addition, the bill provides that a taxpayer meeting the \n     average annual gross receipts test is not required to account \n     for inventories under section 471. The taxpayer will be \n     required to treat such inventory in the same manner as \n     materials or supplies that are not incidental. Accordingly, \n     the taxpayer may deduct the expenses for such inventory that \n     are actually consumed and used in the operation of the \n     business during that particular taxable year.\n       The bill indexes the $5 million average annual gross \n     receipts threshold for inflation. The cash-accounting safe \n     harbor will be effective for taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            By Mr. DOMENICI:\n\n  S. 337. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education act of \n1965 to assist State and local educational agencies in establishing \nteacher recruitment centers, teacher internship programs, and mobile \nprofessional development teams, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with great pleasure to \nintroduce the Teacher Recruitment, Development, and Retention Act of \n2001.\n  I want to begin with a quotation I recently came across that captures \nthe essence of teaching:\n\n       The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. the \n     superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.\n\n  The point is simple, for our children to succeed we must ensure they \nare taught by well-educated, competent, and qualified teachers.\n  I say this because it is a simple fact that in the future the \nindividuals who will succeed will be those who can read, write, and do \nmath. I firmly believe that a good education will help ensure a ticket \nto the economic security of the middle class because almost no one \ndoubts the link between education and an individual's prospects.\n  However, one of the fundamental keys to providing our children with \nthe tools to succeed is the presence of qualified teachers. Nothing can \nhave a more positive impact on a child's learning than a knowledgeable \nand skillful teacher. Thus, we must ensure there are not only enough \nteachers, but enough teachers that possess the tools required to make \nthat positive impact on our children.\n  Teachers must not only be prepared when they are hired, but they must \nremain armed with the latest technology and teaching tools for the \nduration of their careers. Just think of the constant training and \ntesting doctors, police officers, and lawyers must endure throughout \ntheir careers.\n  Before I touch upon the Teacher Recruitment, Development, and \nRetention Act of 2001 in greater detail I would like to make a few \nbrief comments about K-12 education in New Mexico. New Mexico is a very \nlarge and rural state with almost 20,000 teachers and nearly 330,000 \npublic school students.\n  New Mexico's 89 school districts come in all shapes and sizes, for \ninstance, Albuquerque has over 85,000 students and Corona has only 92 \nstudents. However, each of these districts, large and small must all \nhave qualified teachers.\n  The Teacher Recruitment, Development, and Retention Act of 2001 seeks \nto create several optional programs for states to facilitate teacher \nrecruitment development, and retention through grants awarded by the \nSecretary of Education.\n  The first option would be the creation of Teacher Recruitment \nCenters. These centers would serve as job banks/statewide \nclearinghouses for the recruitment and placement of K-12 teachers. The \ncenters would also be responsible for creating programs to further \nteacher recruitment and retention within the state.\n  The second option would encourage states to implement teacher \ninternships where newly hired teachers would participate in a teacher \ninternship in addition to any state or district student teaching \nrequirement. The internship would last one year and during that time \nthe teacher would be assigned a mentor/senior teacher for guidance and \nsupport.\n  Finally, states would have the option of creating mobile professional \ndevelopment teams. These teams would alleviate the need for teachers \nand administrators that often have to travel great distances to attend \nprofessional development programs by bringing these activities directly \nto the local district or a centrally located regional site through \nmobile professional development teams.\n  I believe the primary beneficiaries of mobile professional \ndevelopment teams would be rural areas and the programs offered would \nfocus on any state or local requirements for licensure of teachers and \nadministrators, including certification and recertification.\n  Under the Teacher Recruitment, Development, and Retention Act of 2001 \neach program would be authorized at $50 million for fiscal year 2002 \nand such sums as may be necessary for each of the four succeeding \nfiscal years.\n  In conclusion, I want to again say how pleased I am to introduce the\n\n[[Page S1423]]\n\nTeacher Recruitment, Development, and Retention Act of 2001 and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues as we reauthorize the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 337\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect amateur athletics and combat illegal sports \ngambling; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I join my colleague from Nevada, \nSenator Ensign, in introducing bipartisan legislation aimed at \ncurtailing illegal gambling in college sports. The bill we are \nintroducing will have a direct and immediate impact on the growing \nnational problem of illegal gambling in college sports.\n  Illegal gambling in college sports is a growing phenomenon. It is a \nproblem not only in our college campuses and dorm rooms but is \nspreading throughout the country. While we have laws on our books \nprohibiting this activity, they seem to be having little impact.\n  Last year there were several legislative efforts aimed at addressing \nthis problem. I was fortunate last year to work on a similar bill which \nhad the support of Senators Torricelli, Baucus, and Lincoln and former \nSenators Bryan and Robb. Some suggested enacting a prohibition on all \nforms of sports wagering--even in States where it is legal and \nregulated. Such a proposal is an affront to States' rights and more \nimportantly, does not address the real problem--illegal gambling.\n  Indeed, it is like shutting down the Bank of America in order to \neliminate loan sharking. I have a pretty good understanding of the many \nissues involving gaming. Prior to my service in the Senate I chaired \nthe Nevada Gaming Commission. The Commission was responsible for \nregulating all forms of Nevada's legal gaming industry. Gaming succeeds \nin Nevada not despite regulation but because of regulation.\n  It is an all-cash industry. Absent regulation, it invites mischief \nand criminal wrongdoing. The National gambling Impact Study Commission \nestimates that as much as $380 billion is wagered illegally every year. \nBy contrast, all sports wagers in Nevada were less than 1 percent of \nillegal wagers, with college wagers only one-third of the State total.\n  While there has been disagreement over the appropriate policy \nresponse to illegal gambling on college sports, there is agreement that \nsomething must be done. The Ensign-Reid bill we are introducing today \ntakes affirmative steps to immediately address illegal gambling on \ncollege sports. It establishes a task force on illegal wagering on \ncollegiate sporting events at the Department of Justice.\n  The task force is directed to enforce Federal laws prohibiting \ngambling related to college sports and to report to Congress annually \non the number of prosecutions and convictions obtained. It doubles the \npenalties for illegal sports gambling. Our bill also addresses the \ngrowing trend of gambling by minors by directing the National Institute \nof Justice to conduct a study on this disturbing trend.\n  It requires the Attorney General to conduct a study of illegal \ncollege sports gambling. Our legislation answers a concern raised by \nthe NCAA regarding illegal gambling on college campuses. The National \nGambling Impact Study Commission's final report found widespread \nillegal gambling by student athletes despite NCAA regulations \nprohibiting such activities. The commission urged the NCAA to do more. \nThe NCAA has failed to take any action so our bill does.\n  Just as schools now report on incidents of drug and alcohol abuse on \ntheir campuses they will now provide similar data on illegal wagering. \nSchools will be required to coordinate their anti-gambling programs and \nsubmit an annual report to the Secretary of Education. In addition to \nreporting on incidents of illegal gambling activity on their campuses, \nschools will be required to provide a statement of policy regarding \nillegal gambling.\n  Finally, our bill includes a section on personal responsibility. \nStudents receiving athletic-related aid shall be deemed ineligible for \nsuch aid if it is\n\n[[Page S1424]]\n\ndetermined that that student engaged in illegal gambling activity. \nWhile this is a taught measure, if the NCAA is serious about addressing \nthis problem, we would hope they could join us in supporting a real \nsolution. Schools will be required to coordinate their efforts to \nreduce illegal gambling on campuses.\n  I believe the problems of illegal gambling on college sporting events \nis very real. I believe it is growing. No one knows the real extent of \nthis problem. No one knows what is being done to combat this at the \nFederal level or by our Nation's institutions of higher learning. The \nNCAA has chosen not to address this problem. To date, their combined \nstrategy of finger pointing, use of red herring and outright denial has \nleft us with little to show in terms of addressing this problem. Our \nnation's students and schools are being ill-served by this beleaguered \nassociation that at times seems more interested in signing billion \ndollar broadcasting contracts than ensuring the integrity of the \nsporting events they sanction.\n  Our bipartisan legislation takes significant and meaningful steps \ntoward cleaning up the state of affairs with collegiate sports. I urge \nmy colleagues join us in committing to address the problem of illegal \ngambling in college sports.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Breaux, \n        Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Bayh):\n  S. 339. A bill to provide for improved educational opportunities in \nrural schools and districts, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if you are one of the millions of rural \nschool children who ride buses 2.9 billion miles every year, if you \nattend school in one of the thousands of rural schools that have no \nschool library or no classroom computers, if one of the buildings at \nyour school is in serious disrepair, or if you are sharing a few 30 \nyear-old textbooks with the other students in your class, then you \nprobably feel like you are going to school in an education sacrifice \nzone.\n  Our country spends less than a quarter of our Nation's education \ndollars to educate approximately half of our nation's students. You \ndon't have to be a math whiz to know that the numbers just don't add \nup. The students who are short-changed often live in rural areas.\n  Thousands of rural and small schools across our nation face the \ndaunting mission of educating almost half of America's children. \nIncreasingly, these schools are underfunded, overwhelmed, and \noverlooked. While half of the nation's students are educated in rural \nand small public schools, they only receive 23 percent of Federal \neducation dollars; 25 percent of State education dollars; and 19 \npercent of local education dollars.\n  We all grew up thinking that the ``three R's'' were Reading, Writing, \nand Arithmetic. Unfortunately for our rural school children, the \n``three R's'' are too often run-down classrooms, insufficient \nresources, and really over-worked teachers.\n  The bill I am introducing with Senators Frist and Sessions, the Rural \nEducation Development Initiative, REDI, would provide funding to 5,400 \nrural school districts that serve 6.5 million students--a short-term \ninfusion of funds that will allow rural schools and their students to \nmake substantial strides forward.\n  Local education agencies would be eligible for REDI funding if they \nare either ``rural'', school locale code of 6, 7, or 8, and have a \nschool-age population, ages 5-17, with 15 percent or more of the kids \nare from families with incomes below the poverty line; or ``small''--\nstudent population of 800 or less and a student population, ages 5-17, \nwith 15 percent or more of the kids are from families with incomes \nbelow the poverty line. In Oregon, among the schools eligible for REDI \nfunding would be Jewell High School in Seaside, Burnt River Elementary \nin Unity, Gaston High School in Gaston, and Mari-Lynn Elementary School \nin Lyons, Oregon.\n  Like the Education Flexibility Act of 1999, Ed-Flex, I authored with \nSenator Frist last Congress, REDI is voluntary--states and school \ndistricts could choose to participate in the program. Both Ed-Flex and \nREDI are designed to provide states and districts with flexibility they \nneed so they can target their local priorities.\n  Rural school districts and schools also find it more difficult to \nattract and retain qualified teachers, especially in Special Education, \nMath, and Science. Consequently, teachers in rural schools are almost \ntwice as likely to provide instruction in two or more subjects than \ntheir urban counterparts. The History teacher may be teaching Math and \nScience without any formal training or experience. Rural teachers also \ntend to be younger, less experienced, and receive less pay than their \nurban and suburban counterparts. Worse yet, rural school teachers are \nless likely to have the high quality professional development \nopportunities that current research strongly suggests all teachers \ndesperately need.\n  Limited resources also mean fewer course offerings for students in \nrural and small schools. Consequently, courses are designed for the \nkids in the middle. So, students at either end of the academic spectrum \nmiss out. Additionally, fewer rural students who dropout ever return to \ncomplete high school, and fewer rural higher school graduates go on to \ncollege.\n  On another note, recent research on brain development clearly shows \nthe critical nature of early childhood education, yet rural schools are \nless likely to offer even kindergarten classes, let alone earlier \neducational opportunities.\n  To make matters worse, many of our rural areas are also plagued by \npersistent poverty, and, as we know, high-poverty schools have a much \ntougher time preparing their students to reach high standards of \nperformance on state and national assessments. Data from the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress consistently show large gaps between \nthe achievement of students in high-poverty schools and students in \nlow-poverty schools.\n  Our legislation will provide rural students with greater learning \nopportunities by putting more computers in classrooms, expanding \ndistance learning opportunities, providing academic help to students \nwho have fallen behind, and making sure that every class is taught by a \nhighly qualified teacher. I've heard it said that this will be the \nEducation Congress, but we have much to do before we earn that title. \nIt's time to show that we when it comes to education, we won't leave \nanyone behind, and REDI will give children from rural and small \ncommunities more of the educational opportunities they deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 339\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Education Development \n     Initiative for the 21st Century Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to provide rural school students \n     in the United States with increased learning opportunities.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) While there are rural education initiatives identified \n     at the State and local level, no Federal education policy \n     focuses on the specific needs of rural school districts and \n     schools, especially those that serve poor students.\n       (2) The National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) \n     reports that while 46 percent of our Nation's public schools \n     serve rural areas, they only receive 22 percent of the \n     nation's education funds annually.\n       (3) A critical problem for rural school districts involves \n     the hiring and retention of qualified administrators and \n     certified teachers (especially in Special Education, Science, \n     and Mathematics). Consequently, teachers in rural schools are \n     almost twice as likely to provide instruction in two or more \n     subjects than teachers in urban schools. Rural schools also \n     face other tough challenges, such as shrinking local tax \n     bases, high transportation costs, aging buildings, limited \n     course offerings, and limited resources.\n       (4) Data from the National Assessment of Educational \n     Progress (NAEP) consistently shows large gaps between the \n     achievement of students in high-poverty schools and those in \n     other schools. High-poverty schools will face special \n     challenges in preparing their students to reach high \n     standards of performance on State and national assessments.\n\n     SEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This resolution may be cited as the ``Building Health \n     Promotion and Disease Prevention into the National Agenda \n     Resolution of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Federal Government \n     should--\n       (1) increase resources to enhance the science base required \n     to further develop the field of health promotion and disease \n     prevention; and\n       (2) explore strategies to integrate life-style improvement \n     programs into national policy, health care, schools, \n     workplaces, families, and communities in order to promote \n     health and prevent disease.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senator Craig and I are \nintroducing the ``Building Health Promotion and Disease Prevention into \nthe National Agenda Resolution of 2001.''\n  This resolution expresses the sense of Congress that the federal \ngovernment should do two things: (1) Support scientific research on \nhealth promotion and (2) explore ways in which the government can \ndevelop a national policy to integrate lifestyle improvement programs \ninto our health care, schools, families and communities.\n  This resolution is supported by a coalition of 47 organizations, \nincluding the Wellness Council of America, the American Journal of \nHealth Promotion, the American Preventive Medical Association, the \nNational Alliance for Hispanic Health, the National Center for Health \nEducation, Partnership for Prevention, and the Society for Prevention \nResearch.\n  According to the American Journal of Health Promotion, health \npromotion\n\n[[Page S1427]]\n\nis ``the science and art of helping people change their lifestyle to \nmove toward a state of optimal health.'' Optimal health is defined as \n``a balance of physical, emotional, social, spiritual and intellectual \nhealth.''\n  In this day and age of scientific breakthroughs and increased \nknowledge of medical science and health, American health care tends to \nemphasize curative treatments, rather than preventive measures and \nhealth promotion.\n  Several compelling statistics make the case for this resolution:\n  ``Fifty percent of premature deaths in the United States are related \nto modifiable lifestyle factors,'' according to the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association.\n  People with good health habits survive longer, and they can postpone \ndisability by five years and compress it into fewer years at the end of \nlife, says the New England Journal of Medicine.\n  While the exact amount spent on preventive health is disputed, \nexperts estimate that only two to five percent of the annual $1.5 \ntrillion spent on national health care is on health promotion and \ndisease prevention. In an April 1999 speech, Dr. David Satcher, the \nU.S. Surgeon General, stated that ``only one percent of that amount \ngoes to population-based prevention.'' According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC, the government spends $1,390 per \nperson per year to treat disease and only $1.21 per person per year to \nprevent disease. This is simply not enough.\n  We must do a better job of supporting health promotion and disease \nprevention, as well as research to find cures for diseases and helping \nthose who suffer from all illnesses. By doing so, we will see an \nincrease in the number of Americans who are living longer and healthier \nlives and this could mean a decrease in overall national health costs. \nSimply put, it is much cheaper to prevent a disease than to treat it.\n  Diseases that are modifiable, if not checked, can become very \nexpensive in treatment and cures. For instance:\n  The direct and indirect costs of smoking is $130 billion per year.\n  Diabetes costs $98 billion per year.\n  Physical inactivity costs $24 billion per year.\n  Cardiovascular diseases cost $327 billion per year.\n  Cancer costs $107 billion per year.\n  Here is another example. Obesity costs our nation $70 billion per \nyear. In a recent report titled ``Promoting Health for Young People \nthrough Physical Activity and Sports,'' the CDC states that it is \nincreasingly important that children from pre-kindergarten to 12th \ngrade receive physical education every day, as well as after-school \nsports programs. According to Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, the director of the \nCDC, ``We are facing a serious public health program . . . we have an \nepidemic of obesity among youth, and we are seeing a troubling rise in \ncardiovascular risk factors, including type 2 diabetes among young \npeople.''\n  With increased physical education, our children will be less likely \nto suffer from obesity, and in turn lower the risk type 2 diabetes.\n  Increased awareness about disease prevention and health promotion \nwill never totally prevent illness, but it can reduce the cost of \ntreating preventable diseases. It can save millions of dollars.\n  For instance, sun-block is proven to prevent some skin cancers. If \nevery person who spent prolonged periods of time outside, protected \nthemselves adequately from the sun's harmful rays, many incidents of \nskin cancer could be prevented. It is that easy.\n  Early detection helps to lower costs of diseases in the long run. If \neveryone had regular physicals and screenings, many diseases could be \ndetected early and treated long before they advance to serious, \nincurable, and terminal stages.\n  Clearly, we must make health promotion a national priority.\n  The sad part is, our government invests very little to help educate \npeople and promote healthier living.\n  As I stated earlier, it is estimated that out of the $1.5 trillion \nspent annually on health care, only two to five percent goes to health \npromotion and disease prevention. Government public health activities \nreceive 3.2 percent of national health expenditures, according to the \nHealth Care Financing Administration.

Mr. President, today Senator Craig and I are \nintroducing the ``Building Health Promotion and Disease Prevention into \nthe National Agenda Resolution of 2001.''\n  This resolution expresses the sense of Congress that the federal \ngovernment should do two things: (1) Support scientific research on \nhealth promotion and (2) explore ways in which the government can \ndevelop a national policy to integrate lifestyle improvement programs \ninto our health care, schools, families and communities.\n  This resolution is supported by a coalition of 47 organizations, \nincluding the Wellness Council of America, the American Journal of \nHealth Promotion, the American Preventive Medical Association, the \nNational Alliance for Hispanic Health, the National Center for Health \nEducation, Partnership for Prevention, and the Society for Prevention \nResearch.\n  According to the American Journal of Health Promotion, health \npromotion\n\n[[Page S1427]]\n\nis ``the science and art of helping people change their lifestyle to \nmove toward a state of optimal health.'' Optimal health is defined as \n``a balance of physical, emotional, social, spiritual and intellectual \nhealth.''\n  In this day and age of scientific breakthroughs and increased \nknowledge of medical science and health, American health care tends to \nemphasize curative treatments, rather than preventive measures and \nhealth promotion.\n  Several compelling statistics make the case for this resolution:\n  ``Fifty percent of premature deaths in the United States are related \nto modifiable lifestyle factors,'' according to the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association.\n  People with good health habits survive longer, and they can postpone \ndisability by five years and compress it into fewer years at the end of \nlife, says the New England Journal of Medicine.\n  While the exact amount spent on preventive health is disputed, \nexperts estimate that only two to five percent of the annual $1.5 \ntrillion spent on national health care is on health promotion and \ndisease prevention. In an April 1999 speech, Dr. David Satcher, the \nU.S. Surgeon General, stated that ``only one percent of that amount \ngoes to population-based prevention.'' According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC, the government spends $1,390 per \nperson per year to treat disease and only $1.21 per person per year to \nprevent disease. This is simply not enough.\n  We must do a better job of supporting health promotion and disease \nprevention, as well as research to find cures for diseases and helping \nthose who suffer from all illnesses. By doing so, we will see an \nincrease in the number of Americans who are living longer and healthier \nlives and this could mean a decrease in overall national health costs. \nSimply put, it is much cheaper to prevent a disease than to treat it.\n  Diseases that are modifiable, if not checked, can become very \nexpensive in treatment and cures. For instance:\n  The direct and indirect costs of smoking is $130 billion per year.\n  Diabetes costs $98 billion per year.\n  Physical inactivity costs $24 billion per year.\n  Cardiovascular diseases cost $327 billion per year.\n  Cancer costs $107 billion per year.\n  Here is another example. Obesity costs our nation $70 billion per \nyear. In a recent report titled ``Promoting Health for Young People \nthrough Physical Activity and Sports,'' the CDC states that it is \nincreasingly important that children from pre-kindergarten to 12th \ngrade receive physical education every day, as well as after-school \nsports programs. According to Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, the director of the \nCDC, ``We are facing a serious public health program . . . we have an \nepidemic of obesity among youth, and we are seeing a troubling rise in \ncardiovascular risk factors, including type 2 diabetes among young \npeople.''\n  With increased physical education, our children will be less likely \nto suffer from obesity, and in turn lower the risk type 2 diabetes.\n  Increased awareness about disease prevention and health promotion \nwill never totally prevent illness, but it can reduce the cost of \ntreating preventable diseases. It can save millions of dollars.\n  For instance, sun-block is proven to prevent some skin cancers. If \nevery person who spent prolonged periods of time outside, protected \nthemselves adequately from the sun's harmful rays, many incidents of \nskin cancer could be prevented. It is that easy.\n  Early detection helps to lower costs of diseases in the long run. If \neveryone had regular physicals and screenings, many diseases could be \ndetected early and treated long before they advance to serious, \nincurable, and terminal stages.\n  Clearly, we must make health promotion a national priority.\n  The sad part is, our government invests very little to help educate \npeople and promote healthier living.\n  As I stated earlier, it is estimated that out of the $1.5 trillion \nspent annually on health care, only two to five percent goes to health \npromotion and disease prevention. Government public health activities \nreceive 3.2 percent of national health expenditures, according to the \nHealth Care Financing Administration. The National Institutes of Health \n(NIH) spent $4.4 billion on prevention research in Fiscal Year 2000.\n  Surgeon General Dr. David Satcher believes that the government should \npursue ``a balanced community health system, a system which balances \nhealth promotion, disease prevention, early detection and universal \naccess to care.''

Mr. President, I rise today to say just a few words \nabout Senator Durbin's measure honoring National Donor Day on February \n10, 2001. I am proud to join Senator Durbin as a cosponsor of this \nmeasure.\n  As Americans, one of the many things that we can be thankful for is \nthe high quality of medical care. American technology, physicians, and \npharmaceutical companies are often leaders in the development of new \nand improved healthcare equipment and techniques. But even the most \ncutting-edge technologies, the best doctors and nurses, and the finest \nfacilities cannot save the life of a person in need of a transplant or \ntransfusion. A grandfather with failing kidneys, a child with cancer, a \nmother who was in a car accident--any of these individuals could be \nsaved by a gift of blood or an organ. Without these vital gifts, all of \nwhich are in great demand, many of our patients would not survive.\n\n[[Page S1428]]\n\n  Let me just take a moment to mention a few very telling facts. Only \nfive percent of people who are able to donate blood do so on a regular \nbasis. And, although donated blood can be stored for up to six weeks, \nis rarely is for more than ten days, because the demand is so great. \nAnd that is just for the donation of blood. There are more than 70,000 \nindividuals awaiting organ transplants at any given time, and ten \npeople die every day because of the shortage of these organs. Ten \npeople a day--over the past year, 3,650 of our citizens have died, \nsimply because there are not enough organs out there to meet the need.\n  On a most personal level, there was a young child from my state--\nCaleb Godso--who was recently admitted to St. Judge Hospital with \nLeukemia. Caleb, who is just over a year old now, was only five months \nold when he was diagnosed. He was given only a ten percent chance of \nsurviving. But thanks to chemotherapy, a new kind of treatment, and a \nbone marrow transplant from his father, Caleb is in remission now, and \ndoing well. He is only one of the thousands of individuals whose lives \nare saved by transplants every year, and the many more who require \nblood transfusions. But there are so many more who do not receive the \nhelp they need.\n  This is why it is so vital that we make people aware of the \nimportance of donating blood, tissue, marrow, or organs. Today, on this \nvery special day, we focus on the impact love can have on a person's \nlife. We shower our loved ones with gifts and flowers to show how much \nwe truly care for them.

Res. 13\n\n       Whereas Vicente Fox Quesada of the Alliance for Change \n     (consisting of the National Action Party and the Mexican \n     Green Party) was sworn in as President of the United Mexican \n     States on December 1, 2000, the first opposition candidate to \n     be elected president in Mexico in seven decades;\n       Whereas the United States, as Mexico's neighbor, ally, and \n     partner in the Hemisphere, has a strong interest in seeing \n     President Fox advance prosperity and democracy during his \n     term of office;\n       Whereas President George W.

Con. Res. 14\n\n       Whereas more than 3,000,000 American children are reported \n     as suspected victims of child abuse and neglect annually;\n       Whereas more than 500,000 American children are unable to \n     live safely with their families and are placed in foster \n     homes and institutions;\n       Whereas it is estimated that more than 1,000 children, 78 \n     percent under the age of 5 and 38 percent under the age of 1, \n     lose their lives as a direct result of abuse and neglect \n     every year in America;\n       Whereas this tragic social problem results in human and \n     economic costs due to its relationship to crime and \n     delinquency, drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence, and \n     welfare dependency; and\n       Whereas Childhelp USA has initiated a ``Day of Hope'' to be \n     observed on the first Wednesday in April, during Child Abuse \n     Prevention Month, to focus public awareness on this social \n     ill: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (A) all Americans should keep these victimized children in \n     their thoughts and prayers;\n       (B) all Americans should seek to break this cycle of abuse \n     and neglect and to give these children hope for the future; \n     and\n       (C) the faith community, nonprofit organizations, and \n     volunteers across America should recommit themselves and \n     mobilize their resources to assist these children; and\n\n[[Page S1429]]\n\n       (2) the Congress--\n       (A) supports the goals and ideas of the ``Day of Hope''; \n     and\n       (B) commends Childhelp USA for its efforts on behalf of \n     abused and neglected children everywhere.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, for far too long, our nation has been \nalmost silent about the needs of some of its most vulnerable families \nand children--those caught in the vicious cycle of child abuse. That is \nwhy, today, I am introducing a Senate concurrent resolution recognizing \nthe first Wednesday of April as a National Day of Hope dedicated to \nremembering the victims of child abuse and neglect and recognizing \nChildhelp USA for initiating such a day. I am pleased to be joined in \nthis effort by my friend and colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, \nwith whom I have worked for many years on issues affecting youth at \nrisk.\n  This resolution expresses the sense of the Congress that we must \nbreak the cycle of child abuse and neglect by mobilizing all our \nresources including the faith community, nonprofit organizations and \nvolunteers. Childhelp USA is one of our oldest national organizations \ndedicated to meeting the needs of abused and neglected children. By \nfocusing its efforts on prevention and research as well as on \ntreatment, this organization has provided help to thousands of children \nsince it was founded in 1959. Childhelp USA and many other non-profits \nor faith-based organizations nationwide are performing a vital service \nto abused and neglected children that they would not have otherwise, \nand they are to be commended.\n  I know first-hand the importance of having help when it is needed. \nThe National Day of Hope Resolution calls on each of us to renew our \nduty and responsibility to the vulnerable children and families caught \nin the cycle of child abuse and neglect.\n  To further observe the National Day of Hope, a cross-country ride has \nbeen organized by a group of Harley-Davidson owners in Northern \nArizona. This ``Cycle of Hope'' will help turn the eyes of our entire \nnation to the suffering of the victims of child abuse. As a motorcycle \nenthusiast myself, I look forward to being a part of that effort.\n  More than 3 million American children are reported as suspected \nvictims of child abuse and neglect each year. That is 3 million \nchildren too many. And, it is estimated that more than 1,000 children, \n78 percent under the age of 5 and 38 percent under one year of age, \nlose their lives as a direct result of abuse and neglect every year. \nThat is not acceptable. We must do something to change these \nstatistics.\n  While I am encouraged by the efforts of many organizations \nnationwide, more needs to be done. That is why I urge my colleagues to \nact quickly on this resolution so we can move one step closer to \nerasing the horror of child abuse from our nation's history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1429-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 20--DESIGNATING MARCH 25, 2001, AS ``GREEK \n INDEPENDENCE DAY: A NATIONAL DAY OF CELEBRATION OF GREEK AND AMERICAN \n                              DEMOCRACY''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Murkowski, \nMr. Cochran, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nHarkin, Mr. Reed, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Lieberman, \nMs. Snowe, Mr. Biden, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Gregg, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Graham, \nMr. Torricelli, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Warner, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nDeWine, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Domenici, \nMr. Thompson, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \nHagel, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. Hutchison, \nand Mr. Reid) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                               S. Res. 20\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in \n     the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States drew \n     heavily on the political experience and philosophy of ancient \n     Greece in forming our representative democracy;\n       Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a \n     founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of \n     the United States in 1821, ``it is in your land that liberty \n     has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we shall \n     imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if we \n     succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas Greece is 1 of only 3 nations in the world, beyond \n     the former British Empire, that has been allied with the \n     United States in every major international conflict in the \n     twentieth century;\n       Whereas Greece played a major role in the World War II \n     struggle to protect freedom and democracy through such \n     bravery as was shown in the historic Battle of Crete and in \n     Greece presenting the Axis land war with its first major \n     setback, which set off a chain of events that significantly \n     affected the outcome of World War II;\n       Whereas former President Clinton, during his visit to \n     Greece on November 20, 1999, referred to modern-day Greece as \n     ``a beacon of democracy, a regional leader for stability, \n     prosperity and freedom'', and President George W.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to submit a resolution \nalong with fifty-one of my colleagues to designate March 25, 2001, as \n``Greek Independence Day: A Celebration of Greek and American \nDemocracy.''\n  One hundred and eighty years ago, the Greeks began the revolution \nthat would free them from the Ottoman Empire and return Greece to its \ndemocratic heritage. It was, of course, the ancient Greeks who \ndeveloped the concept of democracy in which the supreme power to govern \nwas vested in the people. Our Founding Fathers drew heavily upon the \npolitical and philosophical experience of ancient Greece in forming our \nrepresentative democracy. Thomas Jefferson proclaimed that, ``to the \nancient Greeks . . . we are all indebted for the light which led \nourselves out of Gothic darkness.'' It is fitting, then, that we should \nrecognize the anniversary of the beginning of their efforts to return \nto that democratic tradition.\n  The democratic form of government is only one of the most obvious of \nthe many benefits we have gained from the Greek people. The ancient \nGreeks contributed a great deal to the modern world, particularly to \nthe United States of America, in the areas of art, philosophy, science \nand law. Today, Greek-Americans continue to enrich our culture and make \nvaluable contributions to American society, business, and government.\n  It is my hope that strong support for this resolution in the Senate \nwill serve as a clear goodwill gesture to the people of Greece with \nwhom we have enjoyed such a close bond throughout history. Similar \nresolutions have been passed by the Senate since 1984 with overwhelming \nsupport. Accordingly, I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1429-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1429-S1433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 21--DIRECTING THE SERGEANT-AT-ARMS TO PROVIDE \n INTERNET ACCESS TO CERTAIN CONGRESSIONAL DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN \n CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE PUBLICATIONS, SENATE LOBBYING AND GIFT \n        REPORT FILINGS, AND SENATE AND JOINT COMMITTEE DOCUMENTS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lott,  and Mr. Lieberman) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Rules and Administration.\n\n                               S.

This bipartisan legislation is \nsponsored by Senators Leahy, Lott and Lieberman.\n  The Congressional Research Service (CRS) is well known for producing \nhigh-quality reports and issue briefs that are concise, factual, and \nunbiased--a rarity in Washington. Many of us have used these products \nto make decisions on a wide variety of legislative proposals \nconsidering issues as diverse as Amtrak reform, the future of the \nInternet, health care reform, and tax policy. Also, we routinely send \nthese products to our constituents in order to help them understand the \nimportant issues of our time.\n  My colleagues and I believe that it is important that the public \nshould have access to this CRS information. The American public will \npay $73.4 million to fund CRS' operations for the fiscal year 2001. The \nmaterial covered in this resolution is not confidential or classified, \nand the public should be able to see that their money is well spent.\n  The Senate will serve two crucial functions by allowing the public to \naccess this information over the Internet. First, it will help to fight \na growing public cynicism about our government. According to a January \n10-14, 2001, Gallup poll, the American public listed dissatisfaction \nwith the Congress, government leadership, and the government in general \nas one of the ``most important problems facing the country today.'' By \nmaking these unbiased documents available online, the Senate will allow \nthe public to see the factors that influence our decisions and votes. \nThese documents will provide the public a more accurate view of the \nCongressional decision-making, and dispel some of the notions about \nCongress that create this cynicism.\n  In addition, the Senate will serve the important function of \ninforming their constituents by making these CRS products available \nonline. Members of the public will be able to read these\n\n[[Page S1431]]\n\nCRS products and receive a concise, accurate summary of issues that \nconcern them. As their elected representatives, we should strive to \npromote a better informed and educated public. Educated voters are best \nable to make decisions and petition their legislators on how to \naccurately represent them.\n  I would like to point out that these products are already available \non the Internet. ``Black market'' private vendors are charging up to \n$49 for a single report. Other web sites have outdated CRS products on \nthem. It is not fair for the American people to have to pay a third \nparty for out-of-date products for which they have already footed the \nbill.\n  This resolution is different from legislation that I authored last \nCongress. The House of Representatives has started a pilot program to \nmake CRS products electronically available to the public. This \nresolution is drafted to set up a system identical to the House \nprogram. The Senate Sergeant-at-Arms will establish and maintain the \ndatabase of CRS documents through the Senate Computer Center. The \npublic will only be able to access these documents through Senators or \nSenate Committee's web pages. This system will allow Senators and \nCommittee Chairmen to be able to choose which documents are made \navailable to the public through their web page.\n  This change will ensure that only the Senate is directly involved in \nmaking CRS products available to the public. This change to the bill \nwill ensure that the CRS' mission is not altered in any way, and that \nit cannot be open to liability suits. I ask unanimous consent to \ninclude a letter from Mr. Stanley M. Brand, a former General Counsel to \nthe House of Representatives, who states that ``nothing in the \nresolution will alter or modify applicability of the Speech or Debate \nClause protections to CRS products.'' In addition, Senators will be \nable to inform their constituents about how we are helping them here in \nWashington.\n  This resolution also includes other safeguards to ensure that CRS is \nprotected from public interference. Confidential information and \nreports done for confidential research requests will not be made \navailable to the public. The Senate Sergeant-at-Arms may remove the \nnames of CRS employees from these products to prevent the public from \ndistracting CRS employees. In addition, the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms may \nremove copyrighted information from the publicly-available reports. In \nthe past, we have been informed that CRS may not have permission to \nrelease copyrighted information over the Internet. Currently, reports \nwith copyrighted information may be posted over the House system. \nHowever, the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms may remove this information if it \nis necessary in the future.\n  Finally, we are aware that cost concerns have been raised about \nversions of this legislation introduced in earlier Congresses. Our \nunderstanding is that the House system of distribution has been \nachieved at a relatively low cost. This resolution will eliminate the \ncost burden to CRS by shifting the operation and maintenance of the \ndatabase over to the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms. In addition, the Senate \nSergeant-at-Arms is directed to ask the General Accounting Office to \nevaluate the program after one year to examine how to make the \noperations more cost-effective.\n  The resolution also requires the Senate Office of Public Records to \nplace lobbyist disclosure forms and Senate gift disclosure forms on the \nInternet. We have already voted to make this information available to \nthe public. Unfortunately, the public can only get access to this \ninformation through an office in the Hart building. These provisions \nwill allow our constituents throughout the country to access this \ninformation. It is important to recognize the Senate Office of Public \nRecords for setting up a system of online lobbying registration. The \nSenate can aid this office in its groundbreaking work by enacting this \nresolution.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by many groups including AOL Time \nWarner, the Congressional Accountability Project, Intel, the Center for \nDemocracy and Technology, the American Library Association, Real \nNetworks, Inc. and the National Federation of Press Women. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that these letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objective it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. In conclusion, we would like to urge our colleagues to \njoin us in supporting this legislation. The Internet offers us a unique \nopportunity to allow the American people to have everyday access to \nimportant information about their government. We are sure you agree \nthat a well-informed electorate can best govern our great country.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                               Brand & Frulla,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 2001.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \n         Transportation, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am writing to address the provisions \n     of a draft Senate Resolution which I understand you intend to \n     introduce directing the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms to provide \n     Internet access to certain public congressional and \n     Congressional Research Service documents. This resolution is \n     substantially the same as a bill you introduced in 1998 to \n     make certain of the same documents available on the Internet.\n       By letter dated January 27, 1998, I commented extensively \n     on the impact of this substantially identical legislation \n     upon applicability of the Speech or Debate Clause, U.S. \n     Const., art. I Sec. 6, cl. 1, to CRS products.\n       I concluded then, and reaffirm that nothing in the \n     resolution will alter or modify applicability of the Speech \n     or Debate Clause protections to CRS products.\n       There is one sense in which your revised resolution may \n     actually strengthen the protections of the Clause for CRS \n     products. By lodging responsibility in the Sergeant-at-Arms \n     for providing access, you have retained in a legislative \n     officer, as opposed to the CRS, the power to make \n     determinations concerning accessibility. The Sergeant-at-\n     Arms, is a ``[r]anking nonmember'' of the Senate and one of \n     the statutory ``officers of the Congress,'' Buckley v. Valeo, \n     424 U.S. 1, 128 (1975) and 2 U.S.C. Sec. 60-1(b) and there \n     can be, therefore, no doubt about the Senate's intent to \n     repose in one of its officers the power to control its \n     privileges.\n       In doing so, you have, as a practical matter as well, given \n     the Senate more direct control over access to CRS matters. \n     See United States v. Hoffa, 205 F. Supp. 710, 723 (S.D. Fla. \n     1962) (cert. denied sub nom Hoffa v. Lieb, 371 U.S. 892 \n     (invocation of legislative privilege by the United States \n     Senate conclusive upon judicial branch). Given that any \n     putative litigant seeking to obtain privileged CRS documents \n     would have to actually serve process upon the Seregeant-at-\n     Arms to obtain documents under the revised resolution, it is \n     even less likely under the revised resolution that a party \n     could obtain disclosure of such documents.\n           Sincerely,\n     Stanley M. Brand.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              AOL Time Warner,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 5, 2001.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCain and Senator Leahy: On behalf of AOL \n     Time Warner, we write to express our support for your Senate \n     Resolution directing the Sergeant-at-Arms to provide Internet \n     access to certain Congressional documents, including certain \n     Congressional Research Service publications, Senate lobbying \n     and gift report filings, and Senate and Joint Committee \n     documents.\n       The Internet is one of our society's most powerful tools \n     for education and communication, and its tremendous growth \n     continues. We, like you, believe that this medium offers an \n     unprecedented opportunity to connect individuals to the \n     political process--by helping people become more informed \n     citizens, by helping our government be more responsive to \n     them, and by engaging more people in public policy \n     discussions and debate.\n       Your resolution recognizes that the ability of citizens to \n     access public records and to obtain research materials on \n     public policy issues is crucial to a robust and successful \n     democratic system, and that the Internet can serve as a \n     powerful resource for information about our government and \n     our political process. We believe that your legislation will \n     help to further democracy by ensuring online access to \n     Congressional documents and records.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this important issue and \n     your continued leadership on technology-related matters. We \n     look forward to working with you closely in the 107th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jill Lesser,\n       Senior Vice President, Domestic Public Policy.\n     Elizabeth Frazee,\n       Vice President, Domestic Policy & Congressional Relations.\n\n[[Page S1432]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                           The National Federation\n\n\n                                         of Press Women, Inc.,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, February 2, 2001.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \n         Transportation, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The National Federation of Press Women \n     would like to express its support for legislation to \n     establish a centralized, public database for Congressional \n     Research Service reports.\n       NFPW, which represents more than 2,000 journalists, \n     educators and professional communicators in the United \n     States, last year supported S. 393, introduced by Sen. \n     Patrick Leahy and yourself. Our members have sent notes of \n     interest and concern to many senators to explain why this \n     effort is important.\n       CRS reports are an invaluable resource to journalists. They \n     provide the nation's best backgrounders on legislation. They \n     help journalists to illuminate that wonderful sense of \n     ``history on the run,'' as former Washington Post publisher \n     Philip Graham once described the products of our craft.\n       But a CRS report's value to the public through the news \n     media today is only as good as the luck of the reporter. \n     Since the reports are not easily found, nor reliably \n     catalogued in any public forum, a journalist often stumbles \n     upon them in the course of other research, or learns of them \n     only when a source reveals their existence. While the Members \n     of Congress are forthcoming with assistance with these \n     reports when asked, often the rush of deadlines outstrips the \n     mail--and even the fax machine. A report undiscovered, or \n     discovered too late for the story, offers nothing to the \n     reader or viewer.\n       As publisher emeritus of a small daily newspaper in Kansas, \n     I can assure you that this legislation would serve the \n     interests of the public by providing our local reporters with \n     the same access that well-funded Washington news bureaus \n     have. And that will go a long way toward enhancing the \n     credibility of the legislative process. Polls do tend to show \n     that local press are better trusted by the citizenry than the \n     national media. We bring the national news home. Your \n     legislation can help us to do that.\n       New technologies now offer an ideal avenue for improved \n     access. Not only journalists, but authors, historians, \n     researchers, teachers and students will find a mother lode of \n     useful information when CRS reports become electronically \n     accessible. If the reports can be accessed through the \n     websites of the Members, they likely will drive traffic to \n     those sites, and that will further enhance the value of the \n     Members' websites to the public.\n       NFPW urges you to continue to push forward with legislation \n     to bring CRS reports to the Internet and to allow the public \n     and press to share in the full value of this publicly-\n     supported information service.\n           Sincerely,\n     Vivien Sadowski.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Intel Government Affairs,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 2001.\n     Hon.

We hope to see \n     early action on your resolution in this session of the 107th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Douglas B.

Your resolution is a cheap \n     and simple way to improve our democracy.\n       Citizens need access to these congressional documents to \n     discharge their civic duties. CRS reports are some of the \n     best research conducted by the federal government. Your \n     resolution would put about 2700-2800 of these useful reports \n     on the Internet. Placing lobbyist disclosure reports on the \n     Internet would help citizens to track patterns of influence \n     in Congress, and to discover who is paying whom how much to \n     lobby on what issues.\n       Taxpayers will be cheered that you have included a Sense of \n     the Senate resolution that Senate and Joint Committees should \n     ``provide access via the Internet to publicly-available \n     committee information, documents and proceedings, including \n     bills, reports and transcripts of committee meetings that are \n     open to the public.'' We taxpayers pay dearly to produce \n     these documents; we ought to be able to read them, for free, \n     on the Internet.\n       In 1822, James Madison explained why citizens must have \n     government information: ``A popular Government, without \n     popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a \n     Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or perhaps both. Knowledge \n     will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be \n     their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which \n     knowledge gives.''\n       The Congressional Openess Resolution honors the spirit of \n     Madison's words.

We want to endorse your efforts to assure \n     public access to a broad range of government information. The \n     CRS reports are well researched and balanced products \n     addressing a wide variety of current issues.\n       We believe that these unique and valued resources should be \n     available to scholars and researchers as well as the general \n     public through the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). \n     The FDLP already provides a network of libraries throughout \n     the country that serve the public by providing access to \n     Federal government information. Utilizing the FDLP as well as \n     Internet resources provides great public benefit through \n     access to the CRS reports.\n       ALA has long standing policies about these issues of broad \n     access to government information. We have attached a \n     resolution supporting your earlier efforts pressing for \n     access to this publicly supported research. We will also \n     encourage our members to support your proposal.\n       As you know, the American Library Association is a \n     nonprofit educational organization of over 60,000 librarians, \n     library educators, information specialists, library trustees, \n     and friends of libraries representing public, school, \n     academic, state, and specialized libraries. ALA is dedicated \n     to the improvement of library and information services, to \n     the public's right to a free and open information society--\n     intellectual participation--and to the idea of intellectual \n     freedom.\n       ALA's previous resolution encouraged the appropriate \n     Congressional committees to ``take immediate action to assure \n     that the publicly released Congressional Research Service \n     reports and information products are distributed in a timely \n     manner to the general public through Federal Depository \n     libraries and on the Internet.''\n       Attached is a copy of the complete resolution.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with Senator \nMcCain to introduce a Senate resolution to provide Internet Access to \nimportant Congressional documents.\n  Our bipartisan resolution makes certain Congressional Research \nService products, lobbyist disclosure reports and Senate gift \ndisclosure reports available over the Internet to the American people.\n  The Congressional Research Service, CRS, has a well-known reputation \nfor producing high-quality reports and information briefs that are \nunbiased, concise, and accurate. The taxpayers of this country, who pay \n$67 million a year to fund the CRS, deserve speedy access to these \npublic resources and have a right to see that their money is being \nspent well.\n  The goal of our legislation is to allow every citizen the same access \nto the wealth of CRS information as a Member of Congress enjoys today. \nCRS performs invaluable research and produces first-rate reports on \nhundreds of topics. American taxpayers have every right to direct \naccess to these wonderful resources.\n  Online CRS reports will serve an important role in informing the \npublic. Members of the public will be able to read these CRS products \nand receive a concise, accurate summary of the issues before the \nCongress. As elected representatives, we should do what we can to \npromote an informed, educated public. The educated voter is best able \nto make decisions and petition us to do the right things here in \nCongress.\n  Our legislation follows the model online CRS program in the House of \nRepresentatives and ensures that private CRS products will remain \nprotected by giving the CRS Director the authority to hold back any \nproducts that are deemed confidential. Moreover, the Director may \nprotect the identity of CRS researchers and any copyrighted material. \nWe can do both--protect confidential material and empower our citizens \nthrough electronic access to invaluable CRS products.\n  In addition, the bipartisan resolution would provide public online \naccess to lobbyist reports and gift disclosure forms. At present, these \npublic records are available in the Senate Office of Public Records in \nRoom 232 of the Hart Building. As a practical matter, these public \nrecords are accessible only to those inside the Beltway.\n  I applaud the Office of Public Records for recently making \ntechnological history in the Senate by providing for lobbying \nregistrations through the Internet. The next step is to provide the \ncompleted lobbyist disclosure reports on the Internet for all Americans \nto see.\n  The Internet offers us a unique opportunity to allow the American \npeople to have everyday access to this public information. Our \nbipartisan legislation would harness the power of the Information Age \nto allow average citizens to see these public records of the Senate in \ntheir official form, in context and without editorial comment. All \nAmericans should have timely access to the information that we already \nhave voted to give them.\n  And all of these reports are indeed ``public'' for those who can \nafford to hire a lawyer or lobbyist or who can afford to travel to \nWashington to come to the Office of Public Records in the Hart Building \nand read them. That is not very public. That does not do very much for \nthe average voter in Vermont or the rest of this country outside of \neasy reach of Washington. That does not meet the spirit in which we \nvoted to make these materials public, when we voted ``disclosure'' \nlaws.\n  We can do better, and this resolution does better. Any citizen in any \ncorner of this country with access to a computer at home or the office \nor at the public library will be able to get on the Internet and get \nthese important Congressional documents under our resolution. It allows \nindividual citizens to check the facts, to make comparisons, and to \nmake up their own minds.\n  I commend the Senior Senator from Arizona for his leadership on \nopening public access to Congressional documents. I share his desire \nfor the American people to have electronic access to many more \nCongressional resources. I look forward to working with him in the days \nto let the information age open up the halls of Congress to all our \ncitizens.\n  As Thomas Jefferson wrote, ``Information is the currency of \ndemocracy.'' Our democracy is stronger if all citizens have equal \naccess to at least that type of currency, and that is something which \nMembers on both sides of the aisle can celebrate and join in.\n  This bipartisan resolution is an important step in informing and \nempowering American citizens. I urge my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting this legislation to make available useful Congressional \ninformation to the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1433-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1433-S1434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 22--URGING THE APPROPRIATE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE \n   UNITED STATES TO THE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS TO \nINTRODUCE AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE COMMISSION A RESOLUTION CALLING \nUPON THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA TO END ITS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS \n              IN CHINA AND TIBET, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Helms, Mr. \nTorricelli, Ms. Collins, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. \nKyl, Mr. Specter, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Santorum) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n                               S. Res. 22\n\n       Whereas the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission \n     on Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland, provides a forum for \n     discussing human rights and expressing international support \n     for improved human rights performance;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State and \n     international human rights organizations, the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China continues to commit widespread \n     and well-documented human rights abuses in China and Tibet;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China has yet to \n     demonstrate its willingness to abide by internationally \n     accepted norms of freedom of belief, expression, and \n     association by repealing or amending laws and decrees that \n     restrict those freedoms;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to ban and criminalize groups it labels as cults or \n     heretical organizations;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has repressed unregistered religious congregations and \n     spiritual movements, including Falun Gong, and persists in \n     persecuting persons on the basis of unauthorized religious \n     activities using such measures as harassment, prolonged \n     detention, physical abuse, incarceration, and closure or \n     destruction of places of worship;\n       Whereas authorities in the People's Republic of China have \n     continued their efforts to extinguish expressions of protest \n     or criticism, have detained scores of citizens associated \n     with attempts to organize a peaceful opposition, to expose \n     corruption, to preserve their ethnic minority identity, or to \n     use the Internet for the free exchange of ideas, and have \n     sentenced many citizens so detained to harsh prison terms;\n       Whereas Chinese authorities continue to exert control over \n     religious and cultural institutions in Tibet, abusing human \n     rights through instances of torture, arbitrary arrest, and \n     detention of Tibetans without public trial for peacefully \n     expressing their political or religious views;\n       Whereas bilateral human rights dialogues between several \n     nations and the People's Republic of China have yet to \n     produce substantial adherence to international norms; and\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China has signed the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but has \n     yet to take the steps necessary to make the treaty legally \n     binding: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) at the 57th Session of the United Nations Human Rights \n     Commission in Geneva, Switzerland, the appropriate \n     representative\n\n[[Page S1434]]\n\n     of the United States should solicit cosponsorship for a \n     resolution calling upon the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China to end its human rights abuses in China and \n     Tibet, in compliance with its international obligations; and\n       (2) the United States Government should take the lead in \n     organizing multilateral support to obtain passage by the \n     Commission of such resolution.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a \nresolution, along with my colleague Senator Wellstone, calling on the \nAdministration to introduce a resolution at the upcoming meeting of the \nUnited Nations (U.N.) Human Rights Commission highlighting China's \nhuman rights abuses. This Senate resolution makes a simple statement. \nThe U.S.should lead the effort in Geneva to speak for freedom in China, \nboth by introducing a resolution and by garnering the support of key \ncosponsors.\n  Mr. President, in a report issued just two days ago, Amnesty \nInternational documented the extensive use of torture in China. \nAccording to the report, ``Torture is widespread and systemic, \ncommitted in the full range of state institutions, from police stations \nto `re-education through labour' camps, as well as in people's homes, \nworkplaces, and in public . . . Victims can be anyone from criminal \nsuspects, political dissidents, workers and innocent bystanders to \nofficials.'' The common occurrence of torture points to a wider trend--\nChina's human rights record is appalling. The Chinese government \ncontinues to repress any voice it perceives to be a threat to its \npower--religious groups, democracy activists, people trying to expose \ncorruption, people trying to use the Internet for the free exchange of \nideas--anyone who will not bow to the government. I expect that the \nState Department's annual report on human rights, which will be issued \nsoon, will once again confirm this trend.\n  The destruction of places of worship is nothing new in China. But in \nrecent months, scores of churches have been destroyed, in what some \nexperts have described as the most destructive crackdown since the \nCultural Revolution. Beginning in November, in counties around Wenzhou, \nover 700 churches have been destroyed. Over two hundred others have \neither been banned or taken for other purposes. I am disturbed by this \nworsening campaign against religious believers in China. The Chinese \ngovernment has also stepped up its campaign against spiritual movements \nlike the Falun Gong and Zhong Gong, not only imprisoning leaders but \nalso sentencing marginal followers to lengthy terms and penalizing \nfamily members of practitioners.\n  Pro-democracy activists, including Xu Wenli, one of the founders of \nthe China Democracy Party, are still languishing in prison for legally \nand peacefully expressing their views. Huang Qi, a middle class \ncomputer user and an Internet webmaster, is on trial for subverting \nstate power simply because he posted information about topics like the \ndemocracy movement and the Tiannanmen Square Massacre. He could face \nten years in prison. This attempt to control Internet usage should be \nof great concern to the international community, especially those who \nhave touted the Internet as a revolutionizing force in China.\n  Mr. President, all of these human rights abuses point to a much \nneeded response--a resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission. \nThere is no more appropriate place for highlighting these abuses in a \nmultilateral setting, because this multilateral forum was established \njust for this purpose. If we do not use this forum for bringing up \nobvious abuses, then we undercut its very viability. The U.S. has \ntraditionally led the effort on China's human rights abuses. This year \nshould be no different. China is already intensely lobbying other \ncountries to defeat any such resolution. We must begin as soon as \npossible to obtain support for a resolution.\n  I understand that the Administration is in the process of deciding \nwhether to advance a resolution at Geneva. I hope that they will look \nto the Congress and understand that there is broad support for a Geneva \nresolution. This Administration has the opportunity to set a tone for \nits approach to China and all of Asia. If the mistake of the Clinton \nAdministration was bowing to China's demands and centering its efforts \nin Asia around China, then the Bush Administration has the chance to \nstand firm, to be skeptical of the Chinese government's offers and \npromises. I urge the Administration not to look at China's offer of \nratifying the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural \nRights, as anything an empty promise--a distraction that will quickly \nfade away once the Commission meeting is over.\n  Finally, Mr. President, last year when the Senate and Congress as a \nwhole passed PNTR for China, proponents argued that passage of PNTR in \nno way signified a diminished concern for human rights. I believe that \nnow is the time to demonstrate this continuing concern for human \nrights. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1433-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1433-S1434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 22--URGING THE APPROPRIATE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE \n   UNITED STATES TO THE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS TO \nINTRODUCE AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE COMMISSION A RESOLUTION CALLING \nUPON THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA TO END ITS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS \n              IN CHINA AND TIBET, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Helms, Mr. \nTorricelli, Ms. Collins, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. \nKyl, Mr. Specter, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Santorum) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n                               S.

Res. 23\n\n       Whereas Dr. Benjamin Elijah Mays, throughout his \n     distinguished career of more than half a century as an \n     educator, civil and human rights leader, and public \n     theologian, has inspired people of all races throughout the \n     world by his persistent commitment to excellence;\n       Whereas Benjamin Mays persevered, despite the frustrations \n     inherent in segregation, to begin an illustrious career in \n     education;\n       Whereas as dean of the School of Religion of Howard \n     University and later as President of Morehouse College in \n     Atlanta, Georgia, for 27 years, Benjamin Mays overcame \n     seemingly insurmountable obstacles to offer quality education \n     to all Americans, especially African Americans;\n       Whereas at the commencement of World War II, when most \n     colleges suffered from a lack of available students and the \n     demise of Morehouse College appeared imminent, Benjamin Mays \n     prevented the college from permanently closing its doors by \n     vigorously recruiting potential students and thereby aiding \n     in the development of future generations of African American \n     leaders;\n       Whereas Benjamin Mays was instrumental in the elimination \n     of segregated public facilities in Atlanta, Georgia, and \n     promoted the cause of nonviolence through peaceful student \n     protests during a time in this Nation that was often marred \n     by racial violence;\n       Whereas Benjamin Mays received numerous accolades \n     throughout his career, including 56 honorary degrees from \n     universities across the United States and abroad and the \n     naming of 7 schools and academic buildings and a street in \n     his honor; and\n       Whereas the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest \n     civilian honor in the Nation, was established in 1945 to \n     appropriately recognize Americans who have made an especially \n     meritorious contribution to the security or national \n     interests of the United States, world peace, or cultural or \n     other significant public or private endeavors: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should award the Presidential Medal of Freedom \n     posthumously to Dr. Benjamin Elijah Mays in honor of his \n     distinguished career as an educator, civil and human rights \n     leader, and public theologian and his many contributions to \n     the improvement of American society and the world.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would honor Benjamin Elijah Mays for his distinguished career as \nan educator, civil and human rights leader, and public theologian. \nAmong his many accomplishments, Dr. Benjamin E. Mays earned a master's \ndegree and a doctorate of philosophy from the University of Chicago, \nserved as president of Morehouse College and mentored Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., and received numerous awards and honors during his lifetime. \nIn recognition of his many accomplishments and contributions to the \ncitizens of this nation and the world, I believe the President should \naward the Presidential Medal of Freedom to the late Benjamin E. Mays.\n  Dr. Benjamin Elijah Mays' achievements are even more extraordinary \ngiven the circumstances and social climate in the United States at the \nturn of the 20th Century. Dr. Mays, the son of former slaves, \nencountered prejudice and obstacles at every stage of his early \neducation and pursued his dream\n\n[[Page S1435]]\n\nof a college education despite hostile, and sometimes violent, \nopposition. Although he faced the frustrations inherent in segregation, \nDr. Mays finished high school at South Carolina State College in three \nyears and graduated as class valedictorian. Based on his will to learn, \nhis motivation to succeed, and his strong strength of character, Dr. \nMays then went on to graduate from Bates College in Maine and received \nhis graduate degrees from the University of Chicago.\n  As dean of the School of Religion at Howard University and later as \nPresident of Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia for 27 years, \nBenjamin Mays overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles to offer \nquality education to all Americans, especially African-Americans. One \nof Dr. Mays' own inspirations was Mahatma Gandhi, whom he met in \nMysore, India for 90 minutes and who shaped Mays' views on nonviolence \nas a means of political protest. Dr. Mays greatly influenced his \nstudents and, one in particular, Martin Luther King, Jr. sought the \nadvice and counsel of his mentor before and during the civil rights \nmovement. Dr. Mays was instrumental in the elimination of segregated \npublic facilities in Atlanta and promoted the cause of nonviolence \nthrough peaceful student protests during a time in this nation that was \noften marred by racial violence. Another student from Morehouse, Ira \nJoe Johnson, published a book about Dr. Mays' scholarship program for \nAfrican-American medical students in the early 1940s.\n  Dr. Mays once said that ``[e]very man and woman is born into the \nworld to do something unique and something distinctive and if he or she \ndoes not do it, it will never be done.'' This nation owes a great debt \nto the late Dr. Benjamin E. Mays and it is certainly appropriate and \ntimely to honor his achievements and his contributions to the citizens \nof the United States and the world by awarding him a Presidential Medal \nof Freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1435-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 24--HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \nVoinovich, and Mr. Cochran) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, as follows:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 13 that I \nsubmitted earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 13) expressing the \n     sense of Congress with respect to the upcoming trip of \n     President George W. Bush to Mexico to meet with newly elected \n     President Vicente Fox, and with respect to future cooperative \n     efforts between the United States and Mexico.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we are facing a unique time in the history \nof U.S.-Mexico relations. Mexico's election and inauguration last year \nof an opposition candidate as president--Vicente Fox Quesada--has \noverturned 71 years of executive branch domination by the Institutional \nRevolutionary Party, PRI. And now, with the inauguration of our new \npresident--George W. Bush--both nations have the unprecedented \nopportunity to implement positive changes and create lasting progress \nfor our entire Western Hemisphere.\n  Because of Mexico's critical importance to our nation and hemisphere, \nit is not at all surprising that President Bush has chosen to travel to \nMexico for\n\n[[Page S1436]]\n\nhis first official foreign trip as President. It is with that in mind \nthat I am introducing a resolution today, along with Senators Helms, \nLott, Dodd, McCain, Landrieu, Grassley, Breaux, Chafee, Voinovich, and \nLeahy to express our bipartisan interest in America's current \nrelationship with Mexico and to suggest several issues of particular \nimportance that President Bush should raise during his upcoming meeting \nwith President Fox.\n  Our resolution acknowledges the vital nature of our relationship with \nMexico and calls for policies that promote cooperation, enhance the \nsecurity and prosperity of both nations, and enable both countries to \nestablish mutually agreed-upon goals in at least four areas: one, \neconomic development and trade; two, the environment; three, \nimmigration; and, four, law enforcement and counter-drug policy.\n  In each of these areas, both countries should pursue realistic and \npractical steps that will build confidence in our partnership and help \nset the stage for future discussions and future progress.\n  No one can deny the importance of our involvement with Mexico--a \nnation with which we share over 2,000 miles of common borders. \nAdditionally, over 21.4 million Americans living in this country are of \nMexican heritage--that's 67 percent of our total U.S. Latino \npopulation. Indeed, many people and many issues bind our nations \ntogther. And, it is in both nations' interest to make that bond even \nstronger.\n  That is why we want to see President Fox succeed. And, he is off to a \ngood start. For the first time in two decades, economic crisis has not \nmarred Mexico's transition period in between presidencies. Instead, \nPresident Fox's election has been received as a positive step in \nMexico's maturing economy and has fueled new investment in the country, \nraising expectations for better economic opportunities for the Mexican \npeople.\n  President Fox's election also has raised expectations here in \nWashington for better opportunities to improve U.S.-Mexico bilateral \ncooperation on a wide range of issues. An advocate of free trade in the \nAmericas, President Fox currently recognizes that a strong, steady \neconomy in Mexico can be the foundation to help solve many of our \nshared challenges, such as immigration, environmental quality, violent \ncrime, and drug trafficking.\n\n  Furthermore, thanks to the economic cooperation spearheaded by the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), trade between the United \nStates and Mexico amounts to $200 billion annually, making our neighbor \nto the south our second largest trading partner behind Canada. Over the \nlast decade, U.S. exports to Mexico have increased by 207 percent. In \n1999, alone, the United States exported $86.9 billion to Mexico--that \nis more than we exported to France, Germany, and the United Kingdom \ncombined: $84.1 billion!\n  Overall progress in our partnership cannot occur, though, absent \ncontinued progress in Mexico's economy. Although Mexico is in its fifth \nconsecutive year of recovery following the 1994-1995 peso crisis, \nimproved living standards and economic opportunities have not been felt \nnationwide. Lack of jobs and depressed wages are particularly acute in \nthe interior of the country, even in President Fox's home state of \nGuanajuato. As long as enormous disparities in wages and living \nconditions exist between the United States and Mexico, our own nation \nwill not fully realize the potential of Mexico as an export market nor \nwill we be able to deal adequately with the resulting problems of \nillegal immigration, border crime, and drug trafficking.\n  In keeping with the market-oriented approach we began with NAFTA, the \nUnited States can take a number of constructive steps to continue \neconomic progress in Mexico and secure its support for a Free Trade \nAgreement with the Americas:\n  First, we can encourage growth and development by devising, for \nexample, a common strategy to improve the flow of credit and U.S. \ninvestment opportunities in Mexico and by increasing funding for \nentrepreneurial efforts of all sizes, such as microcredit and \nmicroenterprise programs and Overseas Private Investment Corporation \n(OPIC) projects. OPIC--a loan program that assists U.S. small business \ninvestments in foreign countries--is already developing a limited small \nbusiness financing program to support U.S. investments in \nenvironmentally sound projects in Mexico. We should work to expand the \navailability of this kind of investment assistance.\n  Second, we should expand the mandate of the North American \nDevelopment Bank (NADbank) beyond the U.S.-Mexico border region--an \nidea proposed by Congressman David Dreier and M. Delal Baer, an expert \nin Latin American affairs for the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies. The NADbank has been a successful source of \nprivate-public financing of infrastructure projects along our borders. \nExtending its authority inland will not only bring good jobs into the \ninterior of Mexico, but also would develop and further nationalize a \ntransportation and economic infrastructure.\n  Continued investments in NADBank also would facilitate greater \nenvironmental cooperation between the United States and Mexico through \nprojects geared toward advancing the environmental goals and objectives \nset forth in NAFTA and would enhance the overall protection of American \nand Mexican natural resources.\n\n  Third, both nations need to pursue a joint immigration policy that \ntakes into account the realities of the economic conditions of both \ncountries. At a minimum, the Bush Administration should re-evaluate the \ncurrent guest worker program, which has proven burdensome for U.S. \nfarmers and small businesses. Any calls for a liberalization of this \nprogram from President Fox should be linked to concrete programs to \nreduce illegal immigration into the United States.\n  Fourth, in a quick and simple fix, the Bush Administration should \neliminate the annual cap on the number of visas issued to Mexican \nbusiness executives to enter the United States. Currently, the cap \nstands at 5,500 and will be phased out by 2004. The United States does \nnot have such a cap for Canada. Repealing the cap now would send to \nPresident Fox and the people of Mexico a positive signal about their \nnation's value as an economic partner.\n  Fifth and finally, it is important for the United States to be seen \nas a partner and resource when President Fox undertakes his pledge to \nreform Mexico's entire judicial system. With a law enforcement system \nplagued with inherent corruption and institutional and financial \ndeterioration, President Fox will face numerous challenges. It is in \nour interest to help him upon his request, whether it be through \nfinancial or technical assistance. It is in our own interest that he \nsucceed, because our country cannot reverse effectively the flow of \ndrugs across our border without the full cooperation and support of \nMexican law enforcement. Additionally, the Bush Administration should \nexplore possible multilateral anti-drug mechanisms and work with \nPresident Fox to decentralize standard day-to-day border functions of \nthe hardworking and trusted law enforcement officials from both \ncountries.\n  The issues that impact the United States and Mexico are numerous--all \nimportant, each interrelated with the other. Together, they present an \nenormous task for the presidents of both countries. Perhaps most \nimportant, they are evidence of the enormous importance of Mexico to \nthe future prosperity and security of our country, as well as our \nhemisphere. The elections of Vicente Fox and George W. Bush present one \nof the best opportunities not only to redefine U.S.-Mexico relations \nfor the better, but to bring all of Latin America to the top of the \nAdministration's foreign policy agenda.\n  We cannot underestimate, nor can we neglect our neighbors to the \nsouth. President Bush knows this. He understands this. And, in a speech \nlast August in Miami, I think he, himself, best described our \nrelationship with Latin America, when he said:\n\n       Those who ignore Latin America do not fully understand \n     America, itself. . . . Our future cannot be separated from \n     the future of Latin America. . . . We seek, not just good \n     neighbors, but strong partners. We seek, not just progress, \n     but shared prosperity. With persistence and courage, we \n     shaped the last century into an American century. With \n     leadership and commitment, this can be the century of the \n     Americas.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution before the \nSenate be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be\n\n[[Page S1437]]\n\nlaid upon the table, and finally, that any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I further ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the prayer and the pledge, the Journal of proceedings be \napproved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the \ntwo leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate \nthen proceed to a period for morning business until 1 p.m., with \nSenators speaking for up to 10 minutes each, with the following \nexceptions: Senator Durbin, or his designee, in control of the time \nbetween 10 a.m. and 11 a.m., with 10 minutes under the control of \nSenator Clinton, 15 minutes under the control of Senator Dorgan, and 20 \nminutes under the control of Senator Carnahan; Senator Kyl, or his \ndesignee, controlling the time between 11 a.m. and 11:30 a.m.; Senator \nThomas, or his designee, in control of the time between 11:30 a.m. and \n12 noon; Senator Collins, or her designee, in control of 15 minutes; \nSenator Lott, or his designee, in control of 15 minutes; Senator \nDaschle, or his designee, in control of 30 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the closing script be modified to \nprovide that if either leader uses his leader time, morning business \nfor the affected party or parties be extended accordingly. It is not \nusual that the leaders do use their time, but when either one of them \ndoes, if we have morning business set aside, it cuts down the other \nside's ability to have morning business. This is fair. I do not see any \nproblem with it.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, our side certainly has no objection to \nthis. I ask unanimous consent that my unanimous consent request be \nmodified to reflect the request of the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1437-6", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes on a \nbill that I am going to be putting forward shortly and then tie it in \nto this day. It is Valentine's Day. I hope everybody has called their \nspecial person. I hope they have called their mother. I hope they have \ncalled the people to whom they think they ought to reach out. If they \nhave not done so, there is still time. There is special delivery of \nflowers, candy, and others things that can be done. They can still \ncapture the day and the moment for the people to whom they should be \nreaching out.\n\n[[Page S1438]]\n\n  I want to talk about a national day of reconciliation. This is an \neffort by both Houses to identify what needs to be done to reconcile \nthe Nation and past and present problems.\n  We are at the beginning of a new administration and at the beginning \nof a new millennium. This would be a good time to do this.\n  It is a simple proposition, a basic proposition of what we need to do \nto identify--something we should have done--and correct past wrongs. I \nam hoping we can identify and move that forward without difficulty and \ncontroversy. It will be a very healthy exercise.\n  It is also healthy to recognize the basis of some of these days we \ncelebrate. That is why I put forward this notion of reconciliation on \nValentine's Day. It is a lot more than just hearts, cards, and candy.\n  I commend to the Senate an article written by Mark Merrill in the \nWashington Times today. He is president of Family First, an \nindependent, nonprofit research group that strengthens families. He \nsupports the story of Valentine, the true Valentine. I understand there \nare three St. Valentines. All three were martyred. All three were \ntremendously dedicated to other individuals and to helping them.\n  The one he identifies is the first Valentine. It is quite a story. I \nask unanimous consent to print this article in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 14, 2001]\n\n Sacrificial Love--St. Valentine's Contribution to Love and Commitment\n\n                          (By Mark W. Merrill)\n\n       Do you know the real story behind Valentine's Day? It goes \n     way beyond hearts, cards and candy. It is a story of love, \n     sacrifice and commitment.\n       In the third century, the Roman Empire was ruled by \n     Claudius Gothicus. He was nicknamed ``Claudius the Cruel'' \n     because of his harsh leadership and his tendency for getting \n     into wars. In fact, he was in so many wars that he was having \n     a difficult time recruiting soldiers.\n       Claudius believed that recruitment for the army was down \n     because Roman men did not want to leave their loves or \n     families behind, so he canceled all marriages and engagements \n     in Rome. Thousands of couples saw their hopes of matrimony \n     dashed by the single act of a tyrant.\n       But a simple Christian priest named Valentine came forward \n     and stood up for love. He began to secretly marry soldiers \n     before they went off to war, despite the emperor's orders. In \n     269 AD, Emperor Claudius found out about the secret \n     ceremonies. He had Valentine thrown into prison and ordered \n     him put to death.\n       He gave his life to that couples could be bonded together \n     in holy matrimony. They may have killed the man, but not his \n     spirit. Even centuries after his death, the story of \n     Valentine's self-sacrificing commitment to love was legendary \n     in Rome. Eventually, he was granted sainthood and the \n     Catholic church decided to create a feast in his honor. They \n     picked Feb. 14 because of the ancient belief that birds \n     (particularly lovebirds and doves) began to mate on that very \n     day.\n       So what are you doing to keep the love in your marriage? \n     While gifts, candlelight dinners and sweet words are nice, \n     the true spirit of Valentine's Day needs to last year-round.\n       Here are some ways to bring more love into your marriage:\n       Schedule priority time together. Pull out your calendars \n     and set a date night every week or two--just to spend time \n     together and talk. (Note: Movies don't count)\n       Laugh together. When was the last time you shared a funny \n     story and chuckled with each other? Loosen up and laugh \n     freely. Live lightheartedly.\n       Play together. Find a hobby or activity you both enjoy--\n     fishing, bowling, tennis, hiking, biking or crossword \n     puzzles.\n       Be romantic together. Send your spouse a note of \n     encouragement in the mail every once in awhile just to say, \n     ``I love you.''\n       However, you choose to express yourself, do it in the \n     spirit of the selfless Saint Valentine--who not only took a \n     stand for love--he gave his life for it.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I will read portions of the article because it is so \ninstructive about what Valentine's Day is about.\n\n       In the 3rd century, the Roman Empire was ruled by Claudius \n     Gothicus. He was nicknamed ``Claudius the Cruel''--\n\n  That is a pretty auspicious name for an emperor--\n\n     because of his harsh leadership and tendency for getting into \n     wars. In fact, he was in so many wars he was having a \n     difficult time recruiting soldiers.\n       Claudius believed that recruitment for the Army was down \n     because Roman men did not want to leave their loves or their \n     families behind. . . .\n\n  So what do you do if you are emperor and cannot get people to sign \nup? He banned the institution of marriage and said there was not going \nto be marriage allowed anymore.\n\n       Thousands of couples saw their hopes for matrimony dashed \n     by the single act of a tyrant.\n       But a simple Christian priest named Valentine came forward \n     and stood up for love. He began to secretly marry soldiers \n     before they went off to war, despite the emperor's orders. In \n     269 AD, Emperor Claudius found out about the secret \n     ceremonies. He had Valentine thrown into prison and ordered \n     him put to death.\n       He gave his life so couples could be bonded together in \n     holy matrimony. They may have killed the man, but not his \n     spirit. Even centuries after his death, the story of \n     Valentine's self-sacrificing commitment to love was legendary \n     in Rome. Eventually, he was granted sainthood and the \n     Catholic church decided to create a feast in his honor. They \n     picked February 14 because of the ancient belief that birds \n     (particularly lovebirds and doves) began to mate on that very \n     day.\n\n  I think it is interesting to look back into the history of why it is \nwe celebrate certain days and when we celebrate them. There is usually \na beautiful story, this tapestry of something of beauty in our heritage \nthat I always think of in redigging that well and seeing what is there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/14/senate-section/article/S1438-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
