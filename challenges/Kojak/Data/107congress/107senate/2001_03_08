Mr. President, I commend the Senate's guest Chaplain, \nRev. Gerry Creedon, for his eloquent prayer opening today's session of \nthe Senate. Father Creedon has been a friend of long standing to the \nmembers of my family. We first came to know him in 1975 when he became \nthe associate pastor at St. Luke's Catholic Church in McLean, VA.\n  Somehow he managed to learn the names not only of my children, but of \nall my nieces and nephews. This greatly impressed us all, especially \nEthel, who knew then he must be very special, for it is a rare \naccomplishment even to this day. Over the years he has watched the \nchildren grow up and has always been there for them, and for all of us, \nin times of joy and in times of sorrow. It is Father Creedon who has \npresided over many a happy family wedding, and it is he whom we have \nalways asked to celebrate the Mass in memory of my brother at his \ngraveside in Arlington Cemetery.\n  You may have noticed a bit of a lilt in Father Creedon's voice as he \ngave the prayer this morning. You would not be wrong if you thought you \nheard an Irish accent. He was born in County Cork in Ireland.\n  He was educated at the University College Dublin and then came to the \nUnited States where he received his master's degree at Washington \nTheological Union in Maryland. He also studied at Catholic University \nhere in Washington, DC, before being ordained in 1968 at All Hallows \nCollege in Dublin.\n  Fortunately for us, he was sent back to the United States after his \nordination and started his pastoral service at Blessed Sacrament in \nAlexandria, VA. From Alexandria, to McLean, to pastor at Good Shepherd \nin Mt. Vernon, VA, Father Creedon has spent most of his life \nministering to those in the metropolitan area. But in 1991 he was \ntransferred to the Dominican Republic where he was a pastor and \npastoral coordinator in the Diocese of San Juan de la Maguana for five \nyears. He returned with a renewed passion in the Latino community and \nhuman rights issues, and has become an active spiritual advisor for \npeople of Hispanic background in this area.\n  Currently, Father Creedon is the pastor of St. Charles in Arlington, \nVA. He is the Chair of the Virginia Inter-faith Center for Public \nPolicy, and on the Steering Committee of Northern Virginia's Inter-\nfaith Coalition for Justice. He has always taken a special interest in \nthe housing needs of our less fortunate citizens and been active on \nbehalf of disadvantaged children.\n  He was president of Gabriel Homes, Inc. which sponsored group living \nfor developmentally disabled adults from 1982 until 1991, and was the \nFounder of Friends of Children's Services in 1983. His efforts have \nbeen recognized with many awards including the Human\n\n[[Page S2018]]\n\nRights Award from Fairfax County, the Social Worker of the Year Award \nfrom the Virginia Council of Social Workers. He received a nomination \nfor Northern Virginian of the Year in the area of community service. Of \ncourse, being Irish, he has also found time to write poetry. It has \neven been published in Poetry Ireland Review.\n  When Father Creedon is not busy with his pastoral duties, you will \nfind him on the golf course. It is a game he takes very seriously and I \nhear he is much improved. I think we can presume that prayer on the \nputting green works. But most of all we love to be with him when he \npicks up his mandolin and sings us the Irish songs of his beloved \nCounty Cork and Dublin.\n  Whether he is with us for a sail at the Cape, talking about his \nachievements in hurling, celebrating mass, or baptizing the newest \nmember of the Kennedy family, Father Gerry Creedon is a valued friend \nand a welcome spiritual presence in our lives. It is a privilege to \nhave him here with us in the Senate today. We are grateful for his \ninspiring prayer as our guest Chaplain.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2018-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with \nrespect to S. 420 there be debate only until 10:30 a.m.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Alabama, the acting leader, there \nare a number of people who want to speak on the bill, probably not \ngoing past 10:30 a.m. This is a very important piece of legislation. We \nall recognize that. There have only been a few people who have had the \nopportunity to speak about the bill generally. I think it is totally \nappropriate that we talk about the bill until 10:30 a.m. There are \nothers who will come at a later time, not to offer amendments but to \nspeak about the bill.\n  Also, we are trying to work with the other side of the aisle. Senator \nLeahy has indicated to me that he will be cooperative in trying to \nobtain some time late this afternoon a list of amendments. We will be \nworking on that. Maybe we can come up with a list of amendments \nsometime later today which will give us some idea of what we face next \nweek on this important legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. I do believe we need to move \ntoward that eventuality. I thank him for his leadership.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have a pending amendment, and I wonder if the Senator \nfrom Alabama can tell me, it is my understanding someone is preparing \neither a second-degree amendment or a substitute; is the Senator from \nAlabama aware of that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know Senator Gramm is interested in your amendment. \nHe has not arrived yet. We will talk with him as soon as he arrives and \nhe can discuss that question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Alabama. I continue to reserve \nmy right to object. I am going to object to the waiving of the reading \nof any substitute or any second-degree amendment unless a copy is \npresented to me in advance. I will afford the same courtesy on any \namendment which I offer on the floor. Those of us who would like to be \nprepared to debate this want to see the language of the amendment so we \ncan be adequately prepared.\n  Mr. President, I do not object to the unanimous-consent request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a second. \nWe have not received all amendments, I say to Senator Durbin. It would \nbe more appropriate for people to file their amendments so we can study \nthem and be better prepared.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few moments on the \nbill. I will mention the amendment offered by Senator Durbin. I wanted \nto come over yesterday, but I was not able to find the time to do that, \ngiven the debate occurring on the floor.\n  I want to talk on the subject of bankruptcy. I have supported \nbankruptcy reforms in the Congress. I voted for them. I felt the \npendulum on bankruptcy issues had swung a little too far to one side. I \nstill feel that way, and I hope I will be able to support the \nlegislation as it leaves the Senate. I suspect I will. I hope to \nsupport the legislation coming out of conference again this year. It is \nmy hope to continue to support bankruptcy reform.\n  We no longer have debtor prisons in this country. We do not mark \npeople who go into debt and cannot get out of debt with some indelible \nmark. We provide mechanisms by which people can get some relief for \nthemselves and their families in circumstances where, beyond their \ncontrol, they run into some financial trouble. That is as it should be.\n  As I said, the pendulum has swung too far. We have people now using \nthe access of bankruptcy legislation and the laws we put on the books \nin some circumstances for convenience and in other circumstances in \nways that injure others in a significant way.\n  There are clearly people who have been subject to substantial medical \nbills and other unforeseen circumstances well beyond their control who \naccess bankruptcy laws in a way they are intended to be accessed. There \nare others who abuse them. I think all of us agree with that. Some load \nup with credit and find ways to stick others with the debt they incur \nand then rush to bankruptcy to say: Let me shed myself of this burden, \nand I will let others hold the bag. Many of them are small business men \nand women. What happens in those circumstances is unfair.\n  There is another side to this debate that I want to talk about for a \nmoment. While I support bankruptcy reform and believe it is necessary \nand sound for this Congress to proceed in this direction, there is \nalso, with the extension of credit in this country, a fair amount of \ngreed and a substantial amount of unsound business practices.\n  The other day I was on the way to the Capitol in my car and had the \nradio on, and I heard another advertisement from a lending company. The \nadvertisement said the following: Bad credit? No income? No \ndocumentation? Come see us for a loan.\n  I will say that again because it is worth remembering. This is a \ncompany that is advertising on the radio saying if you have bad credit, \nif you do not have any income and you do not have any documentation, \ncome and get a\n\n[[Page S2019]]\n\nloan from us. We have all seen the ads and heard the ads. Bad credit? \nNo problem. Come our direction. We would like to give you a loan.\n  Our kids who begin college now find in their mailbox on the college \ncampus a preapproved credit card from many companies. They just \nwallpaper the college campuses, offering credit cards to kids who have \nno job and no income and then wonder why, when some of them use those \ncredit cards and get in trouble, they cannot pay the bill.\n  Companies that say if you have bad credit, we will give you credit, \nif you have no job, we will give you a credit card, if you have no \nincome, we will give you a credit card--they do it by the millions--and \nthen they get into some difficulty and say to the Congress: Relieve us, \nwill you, of these bad business practices; we have wallpapered America \nwith credit cards and now some of them don't pay, so please help us--I \nhave no sympathy for those companies and do not want to do anything \nthat gives them comfort.\n\n  My 10-year-old son about 3 years ago--he is now 13, going to turn 14 \nnext month--received a preapproved Diners Club card in the mail. I have \nspoken about that on the floor previously in a discussion about \nbankruptcy--a 10-year-old gets a solicitation from Diners Club for a \npreapproved credit card. He is now living in Paris under an assumed \nname. Not really.\n  When he saw that, he said: Dad, what does this mean?\n  I said: It means somebody is really stupid. You do not have a job, \nyou are 10 years old, and they did not mean you ought to have a credit \ncard. It does not matter to them. You are a bunch of letters. They send \nthem to everybody. It does not matter the circumstance.\n  Diners Club, when they heard me speak about this on the floor because \nI read the letter and read the name of the person who signed the \nletter, actually contacted me and said: Oh, this was a mistake. Yes, I \nam sure it was a mistake.\n  There are mistakes all over the country: People getting credit card \napplications, preapproved credit card solicitations without any thought \nto who they are, where they are, how old they are, how much their \nincome is, or even if they have an income. It is evidence of something \ngone wrong. It is unsound business practices.\n  In addition, if I had taken the time--and I did not on that \nparticular preapproved credit card application--to read the terms and \nthe conditions--and, indeed, you need glasses to do so because it is \nalways on the back side--what I would have found, I am sure, in that \ncircumstance with that company, and virtually every other, is they are \nimposing terms and conditions for the cost of credit that are \noutrageous. It should be called loansharking at the interest rates they \ncharge.\n  Incidentally, on the front of most of these envelopes--and I get a \nlot of them, and I suspect most of my colleagues do and most Americans \ndo. You open your mailbox and every day you find a piece of mail that \nsays: We have a preapproved credit card waiting for you, and a big \ncircle on the front of the envelope, 1.9-percent interest rate or 2.9-\npercent interest rate, and you open it up and read the fine print. What \nyou discover is, yes, there is a period of 3 months or 6 months where \nthey are going to charge a 1.9-percent interest rate, and then it goes \nto 18 percent or 22 percent or whatever their percentage is. The small \ntype takes away what the big type gives.\n  My point is this: I am not interested in anybody crying crocodile \ntears for companies that exhibit that kind of unsound business practice \nand for companies that are so greedy for profits that they want to load \neverybody up with debt by sending them plastic cards, even those who \nhave no income and no job. Now people say, but you need to be \nresponsible; it is your fault if you use those cards. Sure, there is \nfault on both sides. My point is we are headed in the wrong direction. \nThose who engage in these practices need no relief, in my judgment, \nfrom this Congress.\n\n  My colleague, Senator Durbin, is offering an amendment that is fairly \nsimple. The credit card companies are resisting this aggressively. His \namendment simply says, on the statement where it states their minimum \npayment, creditors must have a box that says if they make this minimum \npayment, here is how long it will take to pay off the bill. Often, it \nwill be an eye-popping number. Make this minimum payment, they won't \npay this off for 8 or 10 years. My colleague from Illinois is saying it \nmakes sense to provide a little more information, truth in lending. I \nwill support that amendment.\n  There is an amendment that tightens up on the homestead exemption. \nFrankly, we need to plug the loophole that deals with the homestead \nexemptions. We don't want people filing for bankruptcy ending up with \n$1 million or $2 million in a home that cannot be touched. There is an \nold saying: The water ain't going to clear up until you get the hogs \nout of the creek.\n  The hogs in this circumstance are the very companies that are asking \nfor relief because they have ``blizzarded'' this country with credit \ncard applications, and they should have known better.\n  As I indicated when I started, I intend to support bankruptcy \nlegislation. I also intend to support amendments to perfect this \nlegislation. When we send it to conference, as I believe we will, it is \nmy fervent hope the conference will send back a conference report that \nhas some balance, that recommends, I hope, that people not abuse \nbankruptcy legislation, that bankruptcy ought not be convenient or \neasy, that there is a burden with bankruptcy, but recognizes that some \nneed bankruptcy. Some who have suffered unforeseen circumstances, \nperhaps devastating medical bills, through no fault of their own, need \nto have some relief from imposing burdens. I have met people like that \nwith tears in their eyes and their chins quiver as they talk about the \n$150,000 medical bill for a child with whom they are saddled. And every \nmonth, in every way, they are besieged by bill collectors saying they \nmust make good on this debt, a debt that had to do with their child's \ncancer treatment.\n  Should we find a way to help those people? Yes, there should be \nbankruptcy proceedings that allow those people to be able to shed \nthemselves of part of that burden and to start anew.\n  But there are other stories that represent the abuse of bankruptcy \nand that stick Main Street retailers and others with burdens they \nshould not have to bear.\n  As we adjust this pendulum on bankruptcy, we need to do it the right \nway. Today, I wanted to come, as I did a year and a half ago, to say \nthere are those in my judgment who promote financial problems for some \nAmericans by what I think is irresponsible behavior in the development \nof credit instruments that they then ``wallpaper'' America with.\n  Frankly, I don't think they deserve much relief. They don't deserve \nany relief. What they deserve to know is that many of us believe they \nought to change their business practices and start sending credit cards \nto people who can pay the bill, who have income.\n  I know my colleague from New Jersey wants to speak. I hope to work \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see if we can perfect \nthis bill. It is my intention to want to support this going out of the \nSenate and also out of the conference. I hope we can, coming out of \nconference, keep a couple of the key provisions the Senate has already \nexpressed its will on with respect to homestead exemptions and \npredatory practices and more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we talked a good bit about credit cards, \nand the companies have been beaten up. They do make an awful lot of \nmistakes. As the Senator understands, if a credit card is offered to a \nperson who is a minor and they were to even use it and buy goods with \nit, they could not be forced to pay the debt because it would be an \ninvalid debt, but it does indicate some concern that people have about \nreceiving solicitations for credit cards.\n  You could also see they are offering competitive choices in credit \ncards. Actually, for the first time in recent years, it seems to me \ncredit card companies are beginning to compete against one another in \noffering better opportunities. I am not sure we ought to say that is a \nparticularly evil thing that low-income people are offered an \nopportunity to have a credit card that will allow them to replace the \ntire on their car when they may not have the\n\n[[Page S2020]]\n\ncash in their pocket, and then pay for it over the next month. It is \nnot a particularly bad thing.\n  The Banking Committee has jurisdiction over these issues. That is \nultimately where they should be decided. The bankruptcy bill is here to \ncreate a system of bankruptcy courts in America, Federal courts, in how \nthey conduct their business. Those issues are not, in my view, the \nissues that ought to be debated here but in a consideration of banking \nquestions.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for \nyielding.\n  I rise in support of the bankruptcy reform bill. Indeed, for as many \nyears as I have had the honor of serving in this institution, I have \nbeen rising in support of the bankruptcy bill. I am very honored in \nthis cause to have worked with Senator Grassley, who chaired this \nsubcommittee when I was the ranking member on Judiciary. We worked for \ncountless hours to craft a bill that was both balanced and fair. \nIndeed, this bankruptcy reform legislation already contains amendments \nfrom Senators Durbin, Schumer, Reid, and on both sides of the aisle \nMembers who recognize there is a problem with the abuse of the \nbankruptcy system but wanted to make sure that consumers had every \nprotection possible.\n  I am not here to state we have achieved the perfect legislation, nor \nthat it is balanced in every respect. I can only suggest there is one \nthing upon which every Member of the Senate should be able to agree: it \nis that current bankruptcy laws are not working. It is an abuse to \nsmall and large business, creditors, and lenders. The system is broken. \nWe benefit nothing by pretending otherwise.\n  While not perfect legislation, it is fair. And it provides for a \nfunctioning bankruptcy system for businesses and consumers alike. It is \nfor that reason I believe after several attempts to pass this \nlegislation, with the overwhelming support of a majority of Senators, \nMembers of both political parties, and a President who appears now \npositioned to sign this bill, it is time at long last to get this done.\n  There are many Senators to be thanked before I go into the substance \nof the legislation. Having already mentioned Senator Grassley, I also \nmention Senator Biden. This legislation is in some significant measure \nat his inspiration. He has, in my party, been my partner in crafting \nthis bill and moving it to this position. Even before he became a \nMember of the Senate, Senator Carper, then Governor Carper of Delaware, \nwas a major force a year ago in crafting this legislation. He is also \nto be thanked. Of course, all of this happened, as Senator Grassley and \nI fashioned this legislation, under the leadership of Senator Hatch. I \nam grateful to him.\n  Indeed, although Senator Leahy has expressed opposition to some \nprovisions of this bill, to the extent that it has been improved in \nrecent years, that is largely due to Senator Leahy's own involvement.\n  Similarly, although Senator Durbin has expressed reservations about \nmany provisions, before I became the ranking member of the subcommittee \nSenator Durbin was in this position. To the extent there are good \nconsumer protection provisions in the legislation, it is largely at his \ndesign.\n  Those are all the hands that have touched the legislation and brought \nus to this point. Now Senator Sessions and I are here as two advocates \nof the bill to suggest its passage. I don't think either of us would \nargue that we have achieved every objective, simply that we are \nproviding a better system that is more fair. As I think Senator \nSessions has recognized, the reality is that in this country, no matter \nwhat provision you might like to change in the current code or in this \nlegislation, you can broadly accept the principle: We have a problem.\n  In 1998 alone, nearly 1.5 million Americans sought bankruptcy \nprotection. The United States was in the midst of the most significant \nlarge-scale economic expansion in the history of this Nation, or any \nnation, and 1.5 million Americans were availing themselves of \nbankruptcy protection. It is estimated that more than 70 percent of \nthose bankruptcy filings were done in chapter 7, which provides relief \nfor most unsecured debts. Conversely, only 30 percent were filed under \nchapter 13, which requires a repayment plan. For all the discussion and \nall the debate and all the delay, that, my colleagues, is the heart of \nthe matter--the overwhelming majority of 1.5 million Americans seeking \nvirtually complete relief from their financial obligations rather than \nentering into a repayment plan, although they have the means to repay \nsome of their debts.\n  The Department of Justice actually reviewed these filings under \nchapter 7 rather than chapter 13, and came to the conclusion that 13 \npercent of debtors filing in chapter 7, or 182,000 people each year, \nactually had the financial means to repay their debts. That means $4 \nbillion could have been paid back to creditors. It was not paid--it was \nlost, although there was the means to repay it--because the law was \nbeing abused.\n  It has been said on this floor that that was money lost to large \ncredit card companies and huge banks, major financial institutions. No \ndoubt there are large companies, private and public, that would have \nreceived some of this $4 billion back each year. But they do not stand \nalone; they were not the only ones abused. I do not rise today \nprimarily in their interests.\n  How about the small business owner, the retailer on Main Street who \nhas a small profit margin on the clothing he sells or the hardware? \nWhen some declare complete bankruptcy, although they could have repaid \ntheir debt, those small business owners have lost their product. They \nmade a sale that they thought would go to pay their debts, only to have \nsomeone file bankruptcy, and they lose all the revenue. They have no \nreserves. They have no place else to go. How about their family? Their \nbusiness could be lost, and indeed every year those businesses are \nlost, family businesses that are abused by the misuse of the bankruptcy \nsystem.\n  How about the small contractor, the plumber, the carpenter, or the \nelectrician who gives his labor, the sweat of his brow, even the \nproducts he buys and resells, to have someone declare bankruptcy and \nwalk away from all their obligations? Although their labor has been \ntaken and the product they sold is gone, they are left with a debt, but \nthe abuse of the bankruptcy system leaves them and their family faced \nwith bankruptcy.\n\n  It may be true that if this bill is passed, the major banks in New \nYork or the major credit card companies may benefit. Indeed, if the law \nis being abused to their disadvantage and they are losing the resources \nof their stockholders or their employees, I make no apologies that this \nbill helps them deal with an abuse. But they do not stand alone. \nOverwhelmingly, proportionally, the principal benefit will go to other \nsmall businesspeople.\n  I hear Members on this floor almost every day claiming that they \nstand with the small businessperson, the family company, the middle-\nclass family, the working men. Here is your opportunity. How many of \nthose plumbers and electricians and small retailers, mom-and-pop \nstores, will not make it through this year because someone takes their \nlabors or their products falsely, declares bankruptcy, abuses the \nsystem even though they had the resources, as the Department of Justice \nhas demonstrated, to pay their bills? Rather than words of \nencouragement, how about your vote in support of those small \nbusinesses?\n  Then the critics will argue: You may be helping small business, but \nsurely this is a problem for the poor. I have suggested for 4 years, \nand I will say so again today, with all respect to my colleagues who \noppose this bill we have so carefully drafted, that is simply just not \ntrue. What this legislation does is assure that those with the ability \nto repay a portion of their debts do so.\n  No Americans are so poor or undefended or powerless that they are \ndenied access to bankruptcy under this bill. We have done this by \nchanging the legislation through the years. This is not the legislation \nthat began in this process 4 years ago. We accomplish this goal by \nestablishing a flexible yet efficient screen to move debtors with the \nability to repay a portion of their debt into a repayment scheme. If \nyou are poor, if you have no ability to repay, your status will not be \nchanged; your\n\n[[Page S2021]]\n\ndebts will be discharged. The bill provides judicial discretion to \nassure that no one who is genuinely in need of debt relief will be \nprevented from receiving what every American deserves--a fresh start.\n  This is a second-chance society. If you fail through no fault of your \nown--or, indeed, even if it is your fault--and you have no ability to \nrepay, your debts will be discharged and every bankruptcy judge in \nAmerica will have the discretion to ensure that protection remains. No \nmatter how many times a Senator comes to this floor and says to the \ncontrary, it just is not so.\n  Critics have argued the bill also places an unfair burden on women \nand single-parent families. Not by my authorship. It is not true; it is \nnot right; and I would not be standing here today if there were an \nelement of truth to it. It is unfounded.\n  The bill contains an amendment that Senator Hatch and I offered a \nyear ago that not only ensures women and children are not in an adverse \nposition they are now in a superior position. The Hatch-Torricelli \namendment facilitates child support collection by making it easier for \nthe person to whom support is owed to obtain information on the \ndebtor's whereabouts.\n  The ability of a father who walked out on a wife and a child under \ncurrent bankruptcy law and hides will no longer be possible. Under the \nHatch-Torricelli amendment, we will find you. That information is \navailable, and you will be forced to meet your obligation.\n  The bill also provides that the status of women and children under \nthe current law is further enhanced. Under current bankruptcy law, \nwomen and children seeking support are seventh in line after rent, \nstorage, accountant fees, and tax claims. Every one of those stands \nbefore a child today in need of child support from their father. That \nis the current law. If you vote against this bill, that is the law you \nare voting to maintain.\n  Don't suggest that Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, or Senator Biden, \nor I will come to this floor with something that does not enhance the \nwelfare of a wife, a parent, or a child. Indeed, it is the opposite. We \ntake those children from seventh in line in bankruptcy under current \nlaw to first. No landlord is ahead of you, no government, no \naccountant, and no lawyer. You get first claim on whatever revenue \nremains.\n  In addition to these child support protections, the bill includes \nother provisions designed to assure protection for other vulnerable \naspects of American society.\n  One that is the most important to me that I helped put in this \nlegislation is for those in nursing homes. There is a plague of nursing \nhome bankruptcies in America. When a nursing home goes bankrupt, this \nlegislation requires that an ombudsman be appointed to act as an \nadvocate for the patient; that those who are left vulnerable in the \nnursing home have someone representing them in the process. They have \nthe greatest stake in bankruptcy. The patients are the most vulnerable. \nUnder current law, they have no one and they have nothing. If you \noppose this bill, you are voting to maintain that vulnerability. Under \nprovisions that I helped put in this legislation, that now ends.\n  We provide clear and specific rules for disposing of patients' \nrecords so that in bankruptcy the records of those in the nursing home \nwill not become the public property of creditors, but it is protected. \nThese provisions could not be more important under current \ncircumstances with rising bankruptcy and the vulnerability of nursing \nhome patients.\n  One nursing home company alone recently with 300 homes went bankrupt \nleaving 37,000 people without beds, without protection, and without an \nadvocate when it went bankrupt. That will not happen again under this \nlegislation.\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it was always my goal--from \nthe original introduction of this legislation in our debates in the \nJudiciary Committee under Senators Hatch and Leahy to the floor that \nthere be consumer protection in this bankruptcy bill. It was not enough \nto provide fair bankruptcy protection for the industry which was losing \nmoney due to unnecessary bankruptcy. It was not enough to provide \nprotections for the poor, for families, and for children. Real \nbankruptcy reform must contain consumer protection. Indeed, no aspect \nof the bill has been amended more or changed more significantly than \nthe consumer protection provisions of bankruptcy reform. That is as it \nshould be.\n  The credit card industry sends out some 3.5 billion solicitations a \nyear. Senator Dorgan and Senator Durbin have spoken about this, to \ntheir credit, at length. Much of their criticism is well founded. These \nsolicitations by the credit card industry are more than 41 mailings for \nevery American household--14 for every man, woman, and child in the \ncountry. It is an avalanche of solicitations with an invitation for a \nmountain of debt.\n\n  But it is not merely the volume of the solicitation. It is also those \nwho are targeted for this availability of debt. High school student and \ncollege student solicitations are at record levels. What happened to \nSenator Dorgan is not unusual. Children everywhere are being invited to \nparticipate in the American habit of addiction to debt.\n  It is not surprising, therefore, that the poor, along with the young, \nhave sometimes been victimized by these practices. Since the early \nnineties, Americans with incomes below the poverty line have had their \ncredit card usage double. The result is not at all surprising. Twenty-\nseven percent of families earning less than $10,000 have consumer debt \nthat is more than 40 percent of their income. These families have \nvirtually no chance to get out of debt, and the interest payments \nconsume what is required to maintain the lives of their families.\n  What is important is that we deal with these abuses by consumer \ninformation, by full disclosure; that we strike a balance that we are \nnot unfairly denying the young or the poor credit when they need it, \nwant it, and deserve it for business opportunities, for education, and \nto deal with crises in their families. That is the balance we tried to \nstrike in this bill. We achieve nothing by denying the poor or the \nyoung the credit they need for their own means as long as we give them \nthe information so that they understand the situation and for \nprotecting against the abuse.\n  I believe we have struck a balance. It is not as I would have written \nthe bill personally. But in legislation and in an institution where \nboth political parties evenly share power, I believe it is the best we \ncan do. Most importantly, it is far better than the current law.\n  The bill now requires lenders to prominently disclose:\n  One, the effect of making only the minimum payment on the account \neach month. That is not in the current law. If you vote against this \nbill, you are voting that we will continue not to give people \ninformation. We require it in this bill, and it is a significant \nadvantage.\n  Two, when late fees will be imposed so people understand the \nconsequences of not making their payments;\n  Three, the date on which an introduction or teaser rate will expire \nas well as what the permanent rate will be at that time.\n  This is potentially the greatest abuse of the consumer who believes \nthey are getting an interest rate at a very low level only to discover \nthat they expire quickly and they are subjected to a higher rate that \nthey cannot pay or maintain.\n  In addition, the bill prohibits the cancelling of an account because \nthe consumer pays the balance in full each month and avoids incurring \nthe finance charge. We are, indeed, encouraging that kind of payment \nand avoidance of debt and interest charges. That, we believe, makes \nsense for the American consumer.\n  There is not every degree of consumer protection that all of us would \nlike, but no one can credibly argue that current law compared with this \nlegislation is superior. It is much superior.\n  Finally, let me raise the issue that was the focus of great debate in \nthe last Congress--the question of whether debtors seek to discharge \nthe judgment they owe because of their violence against abortion \nclinics.\n  I believe because of the efforts of Senator Schumer and Senator Hatch \nlanguage assuring that those debts cannot be avoided is now in this \nbill, and in my judgment, satisfactory to warrant, for those of us who \nare concerned about abortion clinic violence\n\n[[Page S2022]]\n\nand the protection of women's rights, fair and balanced legislation.\n  So I urge the adoption, at long last, after years of work on a \nbipartisan basis, of this important bankruptcy reform. There are not a \nfew Members but an overwhelming number of Senators who have amendments, \nchanges of laws, and their considerations in this legislation.\n  I am, again, very indebted to Senators Grassley, Hatch, Leahy, and \nBiden for their extraordinary efforts that have brought this bill to \nfruition. And I am very proud to join with Senator Grassley as the \nprincipal coauthor and Democratic sponsor of this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to come over this morning and talk \nabout an amendment offered by Senator Durbin. I am opposed to this \namendment. I believe, if adopted, this amendment would do great harm to \npeople in America who are trying to borrow money but do not have \nperfect credit ratings. And, as a result, this amendment would deny \naccess to the American dream for millions of people who are fulfilling \nthat desire today.\n  In addition, I do not believe that the amendment is well intended in \nthat I sense it is really aimed at disrupting the bankruptcy bill. But, \nbeyond that, the amendment is very dangerous. I hope my colleagues and \ntheir staffs, as we move toward a vote on this amendment, will listen \nto what I have to say because it is very important that we understand \nthis amendment in context and the very real harm it would cause.\n  When a major piece of legislation, such as the bankruptcy bill, is \nbefore the Senate, there is a natural tendency for those opposed to the \nbill to just throw things into it, much as somebody would throw rocks \nat a car or take other action to disrupt things. But the problem is, \nthese kinds of amendments have consequences.\n  No one in the Senate doubts that the bankruptcy bill is going to \nbecome law. So I would urge Senators, whether they are for this \nbankruptcy bill or not, to take a long, hard look at the Durbin \namendment to determine whether they want to risk the possibility of \nsuch a dangerous provision becoming the law of the land.\n  Finally, before I explain this whole issue in some detail, let me say \nthere are few subjects that are less well understood than subprime \nlending. In fact, the title ``subprime'' is counterintuitive--it \ncreates the impression that you are borrowing below prime, when \nsubprime means, in fact, you are paying above prime interest rates \nbecause you do not qualify for prime lending.\n\n  So let me begin by talking about the Durbin amendment and what it \ndoes. I want to explain why it is dangerous, and then I want to call on \nmy colleagues, whether they are for the bankruptcy bill or not, to join \nSenator Hatch and others in tabling this amendment.\n  Let me make clear, this amendment is not going to become the law of \nthe land. This amendment is not going to be ultimately in the law books \nof this country because it will hurt millions of people whom we should \nnot be hurting.\n  First, let me begin by defining subprime lending. Subprime lending is \nbasically lending that is made to people who do not have established \ncredit ratings or who have problem credit ratings.\n  There are people who would like to pass a law, I am sure, to say you \ncannot lend to people above prime lending rates. If such a law were \npassed, the net result would be that tens of millions of people would \nnever be able to borrow money through established channels. They would \nbe forced to go into the sort of black market of lending where you \nborrow from your kin folks when you do not have access to credit. \nSubprime lending has a bad name, but unjustifiably so, in my opinion.\n  When I was a boy, my mama wanted to buy a home. She borrowed the \nmoney from a finance company, and she paid 4.5 percent interest. Gosh, \nthat sounds low today. But in the 1950s, that was 50 percent above \nprime because banks were lending money at 3 percent. So you might say \nmy mama was exploited by a subprime loan because she was forced to pay \n4.5 percent interest whereas other people living in the town where I \ngrew up were able to borrow at 3 percent.\n  But my mama was a single mom. She was a practical nurse who was on \ncall but did not have an established employer. The plain truth is, in \nthat day and time, banks did not lend money to people like my mother.\n  The rest of the story is that by getting this subprime loan, even \nthough she paid 50 percent above prime, my mother became the first \nperson in her family, I guess from Adam and Eve, ever to own the \ndwelling in which she lived. And I think it is interesting that all of \nher children have owned their own homes.\n  Some people look at subprime lending and see evil. I look at subprime \nlending, and I see the American dream in action. My mother lived it as \na result of a finance company making a mortgage loan that a bank would \nnot make.\n  We are getting more people involved in subprime lending in America. \nAs a result, the margin between what people with good credit pay and \nwhat people with troubled credit or no established credit pay is \nbeginning to narrow. The Durbin amendment would discourage people from \ngetting into subprime lending and would make it more difficult and more \nexpensive for people to borrow.\n  If you read the Durbin amendment--well, gosh, it just looks \nwonderful. What it says is, if you are borrowing money at a subprime \nrate and the person making the loan commits a material failure to \ncomply with--and then it lists an alphabet soup of provisions--then the \nloan will be forgiven.\n  Let me explain what these provisions are. I think when you look at \nthem, you see how dangerous this provision would be.\n  One of the provisions of law--if you fail to comply with it, that \nwould mean, in essence, the loan would be free and you would not have \nto pay it back--says that if I am going to give you, over the \ntelephone, information about the loan, I have to file, in writing, in \nadvance, that such a communication is going to take place.\n\n  Do we really want a provision of law that says if I am a lender, and \nI am lending you money to buy a home, and I fail to file in writing \nthat we are going to be going over some of the terms on the telephone, \nthat you should not have to pay back the loan? Does anybody think that \nmakes sense?\n  Another provision has to do with notification in advance. And under \nlaw, you are required to notify people of the terms of the loan 3 days \nin advance of when the actual transaction is going to occur.\n  Does anybody here believe that if you made a mistake in making the \nloan, and you notified people 2 days in advance, they should be \nempowered simply not to pay the loan back? Does anybody think that \nwould be good public policy?\n  And finally, and perhaps most destructively, for the first time, this \namendment would give the borrower an incentive to game the system and \ntry to entice the lender into making a mistake. For example, suppose \nthe lender makes an error in complying with any one of the numerous, \ndifferent provisions of statute--either timing of notification, or \nnotification in writing that telephone communications are going to be \nmade--or the borrower creates, by refusing to send information back or \nby disrupting the normal process, a confrontation between the borrower \nand the lender, should the borrower benefit by having the loan \nforgiven?\n  Does anybody doubt that under these circumstances there would be an \nincentive for some borrowers to help create noncompliance with these \nprovisions--or look for such noncompliance at a later date? At a time \nwhen millions of Americans now have an opportunity to own their first \nhome, buy an automobile, send their children to college, do we really \nwant a provision of law that will pit the borrower and the lender in a \ngamesmanship situation where, if the lender makes a mistake or can be \nenticed to do so, the loan is forgiven? Surely, no one could believe \nthis is good public policy, whether you are for the underlying \nbankruptcy bill or not.\n  Secondly, it is not as if there are not already sufficient penalties \nfor violating all these provisions of law. Let me read the penalties.\n\n[[Page S2023]]\n\n  The penalties for violating these provisions of law that are referred \nto in the Durbin amendment read as follows:\n\n       Impose a civil money penalty ranging from $5,500 to more \n     than $1 million for each day of violation.\n\n  Does $1 million a day sound like a penalty to you? It does to me. One \nmillion dollars a day would have a profound impact on every lender in \nmy hometown in College Station. I don't know about New York, but my \nguess is no one anywhere would like to give up $1 million a day.\n  Termination of a bank's charter; subject a bank to an enforcement \nagreement which could include restriction on the ability of the bank to \nexpand and grow--those are very severe penalties--subject directors and \nofficers to removal. Finally, there is the penalty of a temporary or \npermanent injunction against the illegal activities.\n  It is not as if our truth in lending laws are toothless. The plain \ntruth is, these are some of the more severe monetary penalties that \nexist in the civil laws of this country.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. I ask them to reject \nit for the following reasons: First, it has nothing to do with the \nbankruptcy bill. It is an amendment aimed at derailing the bankruptcy \nbill.\n  I understand being opposed to legislation. From time to time, I have \nbeen called upon by my constituents and my conscience to try to derail \nlegislation I thought was bad. I understand that, and I respect it.\n  But I urge my colleagues, whether they are for the bankruptcy bill or \nnot, not to vote for a provision which will be very destructive of home \nmortgage lending for people who find the greatest difficulty in getting \na mortgage; that is, people who don't have established credit or who \nhave troubled credit.\n  The biggest problem of all I save for last, and that is, we wouldn't \njust drive up the cost of lending with this amendment, where every bank \nor every lending institution has to realize that a technical error--the \nfailure to notify in writing before they talk to somebody on the phone, \nor the failure to give a 3-day notice, any one of these errors--could \nmean the loan is uncollectible. What do you think that is going to \nmean? It is going to mean that thousands of lenders are going to get \nout of the subprime lending area exactly at the moment in history when \nmore and more lenders are getting into it.\n  When they get into it, rates come down; when they get out of it, \nrates go up. Anybody who ever took freshman economics could understand \nthat.\n  Thousands of lending institutions in America are going to look at the \nDurbin amendment and realize that an error--and it is not required that \nthey intended to commit the violation; there is no provision in the \namendment that there be intent, but just an error that is somewhat \nmaterial, such as notifying 2 days ahead of time instead of 3 days \nahead of time what is going to be in a closing, for example--makes the \nloan uncollectible. And when that happens, thousands of lenders who are \nlending today to people with troubled credit, giving them an \nopportunity to own a home, clean up their credit record and become part \nof mainstream America, are going to quit lending. Nobody with good \nsense can argue otherwise.\n  If I were running a little bank in College Station, and I could have \na loan made uncollectible because of an error I made where there was no \nintention to make the error, I would stop making those kinds of loans. \nThere are plenty of prime loans that can be made to people with good \ncredit.\n  The second thing that is going to happen is, even the financial \ninstitutions that can afford to incur these risks are going to charge \nhigher interest rates because the risk has to be incurred.\n  What is the net result of the Durbin amendment, if it were adopted? \nThe net result is fewer institutions will be making subprime loans, \nfewer Americans with no established credit or with troubled credit will \nbe able to get mortgages, and when they do, there will be higher costs \nto get those mortgages. That is what this amendment is about.\n  Finally, let me address the vast majority of Members of the Senate \nwho are for the bankruptcy bill. This amendment is not going to become \nlaw. If this amendment is adopted, we are going to have a conference, \nand we are going to have to go through this long process which could \nend up derailing the bankruptcy bill. I am sure many people who are for \nthis amendment hope that happens. My guess is we can fix it but only \nafter a tremendous amount of work. In addition, we voted on this \nvery amendment when we considered this bill last year, and we rejected \nit.\n\n  We have written many provisions into the bill to try to satisfy those \nwho really blame lenders for bankruptcy instead of borrowers, some of \nwhich are not good public policy. However, in terms of trying to \nsatisfy people, which is necessary to pass a big bill such as this, as \nchairman of the Banking Committee, I have tried to reach an \naccommodation.\n  This amendment, A, is dangerous; B, it would hurt people who want to \nown their own homes; C, it will mean we will have a lot more bad \namendments offered that won't be offered if we reject this amendment.\n  It is my understanding that Senator Hatch or Senator Grassley intends \nto move to table this amendment. I urge my colleagues to look at this \namendment very carefully, look at the points I have made, and reject \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises that the pending business is \nthe Durbin amendment No. 17.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address the bankruptcy bill \nthat is before the Senate, and in particular a provision that is in \nthis overall compromise language that is being brought in front of the \nbody, something I want to point out to a number of my colleagues.\n  Overall, I believe this legislation is a good piece of legislation. \nWe have worked hard on it. We have worked for a number of years on it. \nWe have worked to be able to craft this bill. The conference report \npassed with over 70 votes, which is a substantial vote, and the \nagreement of a number of people.\n  One of the pieces of the compromise was the homestead compromise and \nmatters regarding the homestead provisions.\n  This is when you go into bankruptcy, what amount of property that is \nconsidered your homestead can be protected in bankruptcy, if you do not \nhave a direct loan against it or purchase money loan against your house \nand a contiguous acreage, or in the case of a farm home and 160 \ncontiguous acres. This is a very important compromise in the current \nbill, and I seek to keep this compromise language and not for that to \nbe changed.\n  Kansas, along with other States, has within our State constitution \nthe protection of homesteads. It dates back to the days when we had the \nHomestead Act, when you could go out West and settle, and if you farmed \nit for 5 years, 160 acres, you could keep it. It was yours. The way we \nsettled much of the West was if you tame the 160 acres for 5 years, it \nwas yours. Built within our constitution is the statement that if you \ndon't borrow directly against this land, if you keep it clear and free \nof other loans and you go through bankruptcy, you can keep this.\n  Back in a prior lifetime, I was a practicing lawyer. I examined a \nnumber of abstracts. We would go through farm cycles where prices would \nbe good and they would go down. Then a number of people would borrow \nand they would lose everything they had except their homestead. They \ncould rebuild the farm based on that.\n  You could go through abstracts of land titles and find that here was \na case where a guy borrowed this, this, and this, and he didn't borrow \nagainst the homestead. He lost everything else but not the homestead. \nHe rebuilt from that. It almost followed the farm cycle with farm \nprices.\n  So the homestead provision within the bankruptcy code in allowing \nStates to have their homestead provision, as opposed to a federalized \nhomestead provision, is very important to my State, to me, and to a \nnumber of States that have this type of homestead provision in their \nState law or, more so, in\n\n[[Page S2024]]\n\nmy home State constitution. This has been in Kansas's constitution--or \na provision of this--dating back to 1859, and going back even to \nterritorial days in Kansas. Many farmers have used this law during \neconomic hardship to protect their farms, their homes.\n  We worked hard last year and this year to get a compromise because a \nnumber of people don't like each State having its own homestead. They \nthink there was fraud from some people who were moving to another State \nto take advantage of the homestead laws that might be easier in one \nState or another. We worked to get a compromise to work this out.\n  I want to put this out. Other people want to speak on this, and this \nis a very important point to me and my State. The compromise we put \ninto the bill, some people wanted to change this and others wanted to \nprotect States rights. The current bill provides that within the 2 \nyears prior to bankruptcy, no one may protect more than $100,000 worth \nof new equity obtained in one's homestead. You have 2 years, $100,000. \nThis would prevent debtors from shifting assets into their homes to \navoid creditors.\n  Studies have shown that abuse of State homestead laws is very rare. \nYet we are overturning over 130 years of bankruptcy law by imposing \nFederal standards--this would be the first time we have done Federal \nstandards on homestead in bankruptcy law. In 130 years of bankruptcy \nlaw, this would be the first time we have done it. We should not do \nthat, particularly based on such scant evidence.\n  Seven States have constitutional provisions that are different from \nthe $100,000 homestead cap that may be offered by someone on the floor, \njust across the board. Somebody was saying a $125,000 homestead cap. \nEither one would take and federalize State law, State constitutional \nlaw--constitutional law--if we go with this homestead cap that some \npropose, based upon anecdotal evidence of some abuse of this.\n\n  If there is fraud involved in moving from one State to another one, \nand taking money to put it into a bigger homestead to protect it, that \ncan be set aside now by the bankruptcy court under a fraudulent \npractice, and it frequently is. That is the way that is done.\n  I urge my colleagues not to federalize this area that has been under \nthe control of the States, that is in State constitutional law in my \nState and in seven other States. If this is passed, a number of us will \nsay this is not something we can tolerate or work with at all. This is \nsomething that would cause a number of us to work against the bill. \nSome want to get the bill off and don't want it to pass anyway. Maybe \nthat makes this a better provision to them, but I don't think this is \none that we ought to be doing at all for the first time ever. It is one \nthat I vigorously oppose--if an amendment is proposed to change the \ncompromise that is in the bankruptcy bill currently on the floor.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against any change in this homestead \nprovision away from what is crafted in this carefully balanced \nlegislation we have before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  All Members of the Senate have, by nature, two residences--in our \nhome States, of course, and wherever they reside during the time we are \nin session serving in the Senate.\n  I feel very fortunate to have my residence in Vermont, a beautiful \nState. It is out in the country on a dirt road with a gorgeous view. I \nalso am fortunate that my residence here is in the Commonwealth of \nVirginia. In that regard, I believe I am represented, at least \ntemporarily, by two friends from Virginia, the distinguished senior \nSenator, Mr. Warner, whom I have known for decades and with whom I have \nbeen close personal friends, and the current occupant of the Chair, the \nnewest Senator from Virginia, a former Governor, Mr. Allen. In that \nregard, I wish a happy birthday to the current occupant of the Chair, \nSenator Allen, and wish him many more such birthdays. I realize that he \nis in a difficult position. Under the rule, he cannot respond to this. \nBut I did want to do that and tell him how much my family and I enjoy \nour temporary residence in the beautiful Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I am going to offer, at some appropriate point, two \namendments. I understand that the distinguished chairman and others \nhave adopted this basically no-amendment posture. They can always vote \nthese down. But one of my amendments would clarify when a debtor's \ncurrent monthly income should be measured. The current monthly income \nis a cornerstone of the bill's controversial means test provision. No \nmatter whether one is for or against the means test, the provision \nshould be at least as clearly drafted as possible. My amendment would \navoid unnecessary future litigation by clarifying that current monthly \nincome is measured from the last day of the calendar month immediately \npreceding the bankruptcy filing.\n\n  Under section 102 of the bill, a presumption of abuse--requiring \ndismissal of the bankruptcy case or conversion to chapter 13--arises \nwhen a chapter 7 debtor has a defined level of ``current monthly \nincome'' available, after necessary expenses, to pay general unsecured \ndebt. ``Current monthly income'' is defined in the bill as the debtor's \n``average monthly income . . . derived during the 6-month period \npreceding the date of determination.'' It is ambiguous in defining what \nthat 6-month period is.\n  Since accuracy of the schedule is of vital importance, and subject to \naudit, it is important that we know exactly what it is. My amendment \nwould resolve the ambiguity and deal with full calendar months of \nincome data, and to give a cutoff date prior to the bankruptcy filing.\n  My other amendment would be on the separated spouse and the means \ntest safe harbor. On page 17, line 8, the language should mirror the \nother safe harbor provisions in the bill. The way it is set up in the \nbill, as currently drafted, is provided by the distinguished chairman, \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Delaware, and others. Even though \nparents might legally be separated, if one spouse files for bankruptcy, \nthe income of the other spouse would count to determine whether the \nparent's income exceeds the means test for the purposes of the safe \nharbor, for access to chapter 7.\n  What this means is if a battered spouse flees her home with her \nchildren, she can be denied bankruptcy relief regardless of her \ncircumstances because in the Hatch-Biden, et al, bill, her husband's \nincome would be counted, even though she receives no money from him.\n  I cannot think of anything that is more antiwoman, antichild, or \nantifamily.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my two amendments be filed and be \navailable for consideration at the appropriate time and in the \nappropriate sequence because I do want to correct this antiwoman, \nantichild, and antifamily result, something I do not think is intended \nby the drafters of the bankruptcy law, but it is just one more example \nof some of the things that should be corrected in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to submit those \namendments.\n  The Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 17, as modified\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Vermont in wishing \nthe Presiding Officer a happy birthday and say this great opportunity \nyou have to sit as Presiding Officer of the Senate and listen to these \nwonderful speeches has to be the greatest gift we can offer you. We \nwish you the very best in the years to come.\n  The pending amendment is an amendment to the bankruptcy reform bill \nrelative to the practice of predatory lending. Predators, you may \nrecall from having watched a few movies, are those who prey on other \nthings. In this case, we have people offering credit in a predatory \nfashion.\n  Who are these folks? You have heard about them. They are the people \nwho look for the retirees, the widows who are living by themselves in \nthe home they saved up for their entire lives, who are brought into \nsome mortgage scheme or second mortgage scheme and end up signing \npapers that are, frankly, a very bad deal. They end up paying interest \nrates far above the market rate. They face the possibility of balloon\n\n[[Page S2025]]\n\npayments that are impossible for them to make so they can secure a few \ndollars for perhaps consolidating some other loans or home \nimprovements.\n  Time after time, these predatory lenders look for the elderly. They \nlook for low-income people. They go to poor neighborhoods and seek out \nfolks with limited knowledge of the law or a limited understanding of \nEnglish. They have them sign these papers, and literally they watch \ntheir lives disappear. Everything they have saved up for in a lifetime \nends up disappearing because of these con artists who claim to be \ncreditors offering them money under terms which are not reasonable by \nany standard in America.\n  Is this a rare situation? Unfortunately, it is a growing phenomenon \nin this country. We see these people going forward offering what is \nknown as subprime lending and subprime mortgages.\n  They argue in the industry that these people are not good credit \nrisks, so you cannot give them the ordinary interest rates and terms; \nyou have to make it a little tougher. I understand that. We do not want \nto close out the market for people who are on the edges of credit \navailability. We want to make certain they have access, too.\n  Believe me, the cases that have been documented time and again in the \nSenate and the House of Representatives, in State after State, are not \nthose cases. The creditors are not lending to folks on the edge. These \nare people who are pushing these poor elderly and retired folks over \nthe edge. A lifetime of savings for a home that a widow is living in \nabsolutely vanishes when these con artists get a chance.\n  Where do they finally get their relief? If not through foreclosure in \ncivil courts, in bankruptcy court. When that elderly widow has lost \neverything, cannot make any payments whatsoever, and finally goes to \nbankruptcy court and says, I just cannot do it anymore, guess who is \nstanding first in line to get paid in full? These sharks, these people \nwho time and again have taken advantage of the poor and the elderly \nacross America.\n  A lot of people have come to me since I offered this amendment and \nhave said: We just got contacted by the finance industry. The banks of \nthis country are worried about your amendment. They are opposed to your \namendment. They think you are going to create some real hardship in \ntheir industry.\n  The answer is, yes, I am going to create hardship in their industry \nwith this amendment, hardship for the people who are giving their \nindustry a bad name. If it is a good bank, if it is a good mortgage \nlender, if it is following the law of our country, they need not fear \nthe Durbin amendment. The Durbin amendment is going after the bad \nactors and bad players, and the people who are opposing it in so many \ndifferent ways are trying to shield the people who are violating the \nlaw and making these bad loans.\n\n  The people who are opposing my amendment and want to table it in a \nvote later today are those who want to make certain that the people \ntaking advantage of the poorest and most vulnerable Americans are \nprotected in bankruptcy court.\n  My amendment says explicitly that in order to be stopped from \nrecovering in bankruptcy court, you must have violated the law--a \nmaterial violation of the law, not something technical--a material \nviolation of the law. I happen to believe that before you can walk into \na court, you have to have clean hands, and the clean hands suggest that \nif I am coming into court and I want to recover under my contract, I \nhave obeyed the law and followed it in all of my dealings.\n  It sounds pretty basic to me. It is a threshold question that should \nbe asked of anyone in bankruptcy court, but if you listen to the \nopponents of my amendment, they say: No way. You may have violated \nevery law on the book to get into bankruptcy court, but once you are \nthere, you are under the protective shield of the U.S. Government. You \nare able to use our bankruptcy laws and our bankruptcy courts to reach \nmiserable ends when it comes to the poor people who have been \nexploited.\n  It is amazing to me that at this stage in this prosperity we have \nenjoyed in our economy and all the things that have happened in \nAmerica, we still have Members of the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives who are coming to the rescue of these bottom feeders in \nthe credit industry. They are standing here defending them and giving \nthem a chance to continue to exploit some of the poorest people, some \nof the most vulnerable people, in America.\n  Some say: Durbin, there you go again; you are exaggerating this; it \nis not such a big problem. Let me tell you a few things I have learned \nin the course of preparing this amendment.\n  A group in Chicago--I represent the State of Illinois--I take a look \nat their information from time to time. It is called the National \nTraining and Information Center. In September 1999, they took a look at \nthe mortgage foreclosures in my home State. The Chicagoland home loan \nforeclosures doubled, increasing from 2,074 in 1993 to 3,964 in 1998. \nIn a 5-year period of time, a prosperous time in America, mortgage \nforeclosures doubled in the Chicagoland area. The greatest percentage \nwas in the suburbs, not in the inner city.\n  The increase in foreclosures in my State corresponds to the increase \nin originations by subprime lenders, not home loan originations. Loans \nby subprime lenders, the people about whom I am talking, increased from \n3,137 in 1991 to 50,953 in 1997, a 1,524-percent increase.\n  Subprime lenders and services were responsible for 30 foreclosures in \n1993. This number skyrocketed to 1,417 in 1998, a 4,623-percent \nincrease.\n  Subprime lenders and services were responsible for 1.4 percent of \nforeclosures in 1993 and 35.7 percent in 1998.\n  The people who oppose my amendment say: Let the free market work; let \nthe buyer beware; there are plenty of laws on the books. But these \nstatistics tell the story. The people who are taking advantage of the \nmost vulnerable--the widows, the elderly--are doing quite well, thank \nyou. What do they end up with after they have gone through their \nnefarious scheme? The home a person has worked a lifetime to own, to \nlive in, to retire in, to feel safe in.\n  The people who oppose my amendment say we need to protect these \nsubprime lenders. The opponents of my amendment want to ignore the \nreality of what is happening. Subprime lending increases dramatically, \nmortgage foreclosures increase dramatically, and these subprime lenders \ngo into bankruptcy courts and take homes away from Americans, and the \npeople who oppose my amendment on the Senate floor say: Look the other \nway, this is the market at work, Senator; don't stick your nose into \nit.\n  I think this Senate ought to come to the aid of people who don't have \nthe lobbyists sitting in the lobby of the Senate just outside that \ndoor. We ought to be considering people who can't afford to bring \nlobbyists to the Senate. We ought to consider the people who worked \nhard to make America a great nation, obeyed the laws, paid their taxes, \nhad their small savings account and looked forward to their security \nand retirement in that little home, and then they were preyed upon and \nexploited by these people. These people want to walk into our \nbankruptcy courts and use the laws of the bankruptcy system in order to \nrecover that home and take it away from someone.\n  Watch the vote on the motion to table the Durbin amendment and you \nwill see a long line of Senators who will stand up and say these \nsubprime lenders deserve the protection of the law. The Durbin \namendment says pointblank they will be disqualified from using the \nbankruptcy court if they have materially violated the law in order to \nobtain this mortgage. That is what this debate is all about. This is a \ntest of a number of things about the Senate: How many people care about \nconsumers in this place? How many people are dedicated to business \ninterests, regardless of whether they are unethical and unscrupulous?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Point of order.\n  Is the Senator suggesting that Members of the Senate are not voting \ntheir conscience on this bill? Is the Senator suggesting that there are \nMembers who are voting for special interests instead of what they \nbelieve in? If so, that is a violation of the rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to respond to the Senator from Texas. Those \nwho want to take the side of the financial industry in opposition to \nthis amendment should be held accountable for\n\n[[Page S2026]]\n\nthe fact that they are turning their backs on consumers. I do not \nquestion the motive of any Senator and his vote, but the Senator knows \nas well as I do how this is lined up: Consumers on one side, banks on \nthe other side.\n  Let me state what is at stake here are credit practices that no one \nin the Senate should condone; frankly, no reputable bank or financial \ninstitution should condone. If you are a bank or an institution \nfollowing the law of this Nation, making certain your people issue \nloans that are reasonable and in compliance with the law, you have \nnothing to fear from this amendment. But if you are a fly-by-night \nstorefront operation exploiting poor people and the elderly in this \ncountry, you bet this amendment makes you nervous, and it should. \nBecause it means that ultimately the bankruptcy court will not be there \nas your court of last resort.\n  The subprime mortgage industry offers home mortgage loans to high-\nrisk borrowers--I acknowledge that--loans carrying far greater interest \nrates and fees than conventional and carrying extremely high profit \nmargins. Yesterday I went through some of the cases which you would not \nbelieve, cases where they took people on a modest Social Security \nincome of $500 a month, lured them into signing up for second mortgages \nand mortgages on their home with payments they could never afford to \nmake, with balloon payments down the line of $40,000 and $50,000, \nimpossible for these poor people to make, and then when they get in so \ndeeply they couldn't see daylight, they said, we have a new idea, we \nare going to refinance your original loan. And guess what. They dug a \ndeeper hole for these poor people, and ultimately they lost everything. \nThey went into the bankruptcy court saying, we want you as a judge in \nbankruptcy, to give us a right to take this home away.\n  According to the Mortgage Market Statistical Annual for 2000, \nsubprime loan originations increased from $35 billion in 1994 to $160 \nbillion in 1999. As a percentage of all mortgage originations, the \nsubprime market share increased from less than 5 percent in 1994 to \nalmost 13 percent in 1999. By 1999, outstanding subprime mortgages \namounted to $370 billion. The data also shows a substantial growth in \nsubprime lending. The number of home purchase and refinance loans that \nhave been reported by lenders specializing in subprime lending \nincreased almost tenfold between 1993 and 1998, from 104,000 to \n997,000. The number of subprime refinance loans also increased during \nthat period from 80,000 to 790,000.\n\n  The growth of this type of lending should be of concern to every \nperson in America, not just on the issue but because the victims \ninvolved are our parents, our grandparents, the neighbor down the \nblock, the widow trying to make a meager living. They are being preyed \non by these people.\n  The growth of the subprime lending industry is of concern first, \nbecause of the reprehensible tactics called predatory lending practices \nwhich some of the companies use to conduct their business; and second, \nbecause of the people, the senior citizens and the low income, the \nfinancially vulnerable, who they often target with loans.\n  According to the 1998 data, low-income borrowers accounted for 41 \npercent of subprime refinance mortgages. African-American borrowers \naccounted for 19 percent of all subprime refinance loans.\n  I would like to give some additional information about the situation \nin my home State of Illinois and in the city of Chicago. In an April \n2000 study released by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, \nsubprime loans were over eight times as likely to be in predominantly \nblack neighborhoods in Chicago than in white neighborhoods. In \npredominantly black neighborhoods in Chicago, subprime lending \naccounted for 52 percent of home refinance loans originated during \n1998, compared with 6 percent in predominantly white neighborhoods.\n  Now, subprime somehow sounds as if it is a deal. If it is a subprime \nloan, it is under conditions, interest rates, and terms far worse than \nany people would face in the normal course of business. Homeowners in \nmiddle-income predominantly black neighborhoods in Chicago are six \ntimes as likely as homeowners in middle-income white neighborhoods to \nhave subprime loans. In 1998, only 8 percent of the borrowers in \nmiddle-income white neighborhoods obtained subprime refinance loans; 48 \npercent of borrowers in middle-income black neighborhoods refinanced in \nthe subprime market.\n  We had a hearing recently on Capitol Hill in one of the Senate \nsubcommittees of the Governmental Affairs Committee and brought in \npeople and let them tell the story. Imagine the situation with which we \nwere presented. A young woman came in and said: My mother and I decided \nwe would buy a home--an African-American mother and her daughter. She \nsaid: I had a nice job but it was our first chance in the history of \nour family to own a home. She said to the Senators: You can't imagine \nhow exciting it was, the idea we were finally going to have our little \nhome.\n  I know what it meant to my family when we bought our first home. I \nknow what it means to families across America. This is the American \ndream. This is your chance. Sadly, she got hooked up with one of these \noutfits. She wasn't a business major. She didn't have a lawyer to turn \nto and an accountant to ask questions. She was an average American \ntrying to do the right thing for her mom and herself. She ended up \ngetting into one of these nightmare situations where the home she \nbought was over-appraised, where she ended up with a mortgage she could \nnever possibly pay, with terms and conditions that, frankly, guaranteed \nfailure. And that is what happened. As a result of that second mortgage \non her home, there was a foreclosure that led her to bankruptcy court, \nand the bankruptcy court basically said the company that ripped her off \ncould take her home away. End of the American dream for someone who was \ntrying to do the right thing.\n  In 1998, my colleague, Senator Charles Grassley, Republican from \nIowa, chaired the Special Committee on Aging, on predatory lending \npractices. William Brennan, director of the Home Defense Program of \nAtlanta, GA, Legal Aid Society, put a human face on the issue. He told \nus the story of Genie McNab, a 70-year-old woman living in Decatur, GA.\n  Mrs. McNab is retired and lives alone on Social Security retirement \nbenefits. In November of 1996, with the ``help'' --I use that word \nadvisedly--of a mortgage broker, she obtained a 15-year mortgage loan \nfor $54,300 from a large national finance company. Her annual rate of \ninterest is 12.85 percent. Under the terms of the mortgage, she will \npay $596 a month until the year 2011, when she will be required to make \na final payment of $47,599. By the time she is done, her $54,200 loan \nwill have cost $154,967. When Mrs. McNab turns 83 years old, under the \nterms of this wonderful deal offered to her, she will be saddled with a \nballoon payment which will be impossible for her to make. She will face \nforeclosure. She will be forced to consider bankruptcy. And when she \nwalks into the bankruptcy court, if the Durbin amendment is not \nadopted, the person who fleeced her out of her home and her life \nsavings, with a big grin on his face and a lawyer at his side, is going \nto recover. He is going to take away everything this poor lady has. She \nwill face the loss of her home and her financial security, not to \nmention her dignity and her sense of well-being.\n\n  Ironically, Mrs. McNab paid a mortgage broker $700 to find this \nwonderful arrangement, a mortgage broker who also collected a $1,100 \nfee from the mortgage lender. Sadly, Mrs. McNab is the typical target \nof the high-cost mortgage lender, an elderly person living alone on a \nfixed income. We can have all the hearings we want on Capitol Hill in \nthe Select Committee on Aging, we can talk about the greatest \ngeneration ever that served in World War II, we can talk about our \nrespect for our seniors--and we should. But this amendment will be a \ntest of respect for senior citizens who were the victims of so many of \nthese lenders.\n  This lady, living alone on a fixed income, was just the target these \ncompanies look for. The death of a spouse, the loss of a spouse's \nincome, a large medical bill, an expensive home repair, mounting credit \ncard debt, and many of these people are pushed right over the edge, \nright into bankruptcy court.\n  These are real life circumstances that make Mrs. McNab and others an \nirresistible target for these loan sharks and for members of the \nsubprime mortgage industry.\n\n[[Page S2027]]\n\n  According to a former career employee of the industry who testified \nbefore the Senate Special Committee on Aging, he told the story about \nwhat they are looking for when they go out trying to find people to \nsign up for these loans. Incidentally, the man was so confident that he \nhad to testify anonymously, behind a screen. He was afraid some of the \ncompanies that were involved in some of these practices would figure \nout who he is. So anonymously he testified before the Senate behind a \nscreen so no one would see him, and here is what he said about his \nexperience in the subprime mortgage industry:\n\n       My perfect customer would be an uneducated woman who is \n     living on a fixed income--hopefully from her deceased \n     husband's pension and Social Security--who has her house paid \n     off, is living off of credit cards, but having a difficult \n     time keeping up with payments, and who must make a car \n     payment in addition to her credit card payments.\n\n  That is the perfect target. That is what he is looking for. This \nindustry professional candidly acknowledged that unscrupulous lenders \nspecifically marketed their loans to elderly widows, blue-collar \nworkers, people who have not attended college, people on fixed incomes, \nnon-English-speaking people, and people who have significant equity in \ntheir homes. These are people who have worked a lifetime and made the \nmortgage payments, finally burned the mortgage in a little family \ncelebration, sitting in that home looking forward to comfortable years, \nand in come these sharks swimming around in the waters of their home. \nWhen it is all over, they are devoured in bankruptcy court. We are \ntalking about reforming this court.\n  They targeted another such person in the District of Columbia, \nWashington DC, Helen Ferguson. She came before the Senate Aging \nCommittee, Senator Grassley's committee. She was 76 years old when she \ntestified. She told us as a result of predatory lending practices, she \nwas about to lose her home. In 1991, Mrs. Helen Ferguson had a total \nmonthly income of $504 from Social Security. With the help of her \nfamily, she made a $229 monthly mortgage payment on her house--\ncertainly a modest lifestyle by any measure. However, on her fixed \nincome she could not keep up with needed home repairs. She began \nhearing and seeing these radio and TV ads for low-interest home \nimprovement loans, so she called one. Mrs. Ferguson thought she had \nsigned up for a $25,000 loan. In reality, this lender collected over \n$5,000 in fees and settlement charges from her on a $15,000 loan. The \ninterest rate he charged her? 17 percent. Her mortgage payments went up \nto $400 a month, almost twice what they were before.\n\n  Over the next few years, the lender repeatedly tried to convince Mrs. \nFerguson the answer to her concerns was to take out more loans. He \ncalled her--even called her sister at home and at work, trying to \nencourage them to sign up for more loans--what a nice gesture. He sent \nChristmas cards to the family, and letters expressing real concern \nabout the problems they were facing.\n  In March of 1993, Mrs. Ferguson finally gave in to this lender, \nborrowing money to make home repairs. By March of 1994, she couldn't \nkeep up with the mortgage payments. She signed up for a loan with \nanother lender, unaware that it had a variable interest rate and terms \nthat would cause her payments to rise to $600, eventually $723 a month. \nRemember, this lady started off back in 1991 with a $229 monthly \nmortgage payment. She is now up to $723 a month, thanks to the helping \nhand and assistance of these subprime lenders who are looking at this \ngreat target--Mrs. Ferguson's home. For this loan, this next loan, she \npaid another $5,000 in broker's fees. She is putting an additional \nmortgage on this little home, and $5,000 of the new mortgage is going \nstraight to the broker; it isn't going back to her, more than 14 \npercent in total fees and settlement charges on the front end of this \nsubprime mortgage.\n  The first lender also continued to solicit her. She eventually signed \nup for more loans. She could not get out from under. They kept saying \none more loan and she would be just fine. Each time, the lender \npersuaded her that refinancing would enable her to meet her monthly \npayments. Mrs. Ferguson was the target of a predatory loan practice \nknown as loan flipping. The Durbin amendment specifically cites that \ntype of practice as a violation, a material violation of the law that \nshould make certain they cannot go to bankruptcy court and take Mrs. \nFerguson's home away from her after they have been engaged in this kind \nof conduct for over a decade. She was the target of this practice of \nloan flipping, and in such cases, lenders purposely structure the loans \nwith monthly payments they know the homeowner cannot afford so that at \nthe point of default, it provides the lender with additional points and \nfees. They make money on these every single time, and in the case of \nsome of Mrs. Ferguson's loans, not only did the lender prepare two sets \nof documents and rush the signing, but the lender's representatives \ntook with them all the papers from the mortgage closing and mailed them \nto her only after the 3-day rescission period was expired, and the \ncheck for home repairs was spent.\n  You have heard about that. If you make a bad deal, you have 3 days to \nchange your mind. They took the papers away at the closing and said \nthey would mail them to her. She got them 3 days later. They knew what \nthey were doing.\n  Some opposed say Mrs. Ferguson just needs a good lawyer. A good \nlawyer for a lady making $500 a month on Social Security, who has seen \nher monthly mortgage go from $229 to $723? She has to go find a good \nlawyer to fight these folks?\n  That is what they think is the recourse here, that is the remedy. \nThey are going to argue we do not need the Durbin amendment; Mrs. \nFerguson can get her day in court. Let her come down on K Street in \nWashington, DC, and find a nice law firm to take care of her. We know \nbetter than that. People such as Mrs. Ferguson around America are going \nto be those who don't ever want to have been seen in a courtroom. They \ncome into bankruptcy court ashamed.\n  After a lifetime of saving and sacrifice, they are forced into this \npredicament, and the people opposed to my amendment tell us once they \nget to bankruptcy court let the buyer beware. Let the people take her \nhome if they want.\n  Eventually, Mrs. Ferguson was obligated to make monthly payments of \nmore than $800, although her income was still $504 a month, and the \nlenders knew it. That is another provision in the Durbin amendment. If \nthey knowingly make loans to people who cannot afford to repay them, \nthey have violated the law. It is a material violation of the law to \ndrag these people into debt so deeply they can never get out again and \nto know it walking in the front door.\n  In 5 years, the debt on her home increased from $20,000 to $85,000. \nFor some wealthy people in America that may not sound like much, but \nfor a lady living on $500 a month, it is a mountain she will never be \nable to climb. She felt helpless and overwhelmed. She contacted AARP. \nShe didn't know where to turn. She realized these lenders had violated \nthe Federal law in what they had done.\n  Lump-sum balloon payments on short-term loans, loan flipping, the \nextension of credit with the complete disregard for a borrower's \nability to repay--these are not the only abusive mortgage practices. \nLenders on these second mortgages sometime include harsh repayment \npenalties in the loan terms, rollover fees, charges into the loan, or \nnegatively amortize the loan payments so the principal actually \nincreases over time.\n  You can never catch up with it. It just keeps growing, all of which \nis prohibited by law, although many ordinary homeowners do not know \nwhat the law says.\n  Some of these homeowners will not make it to a lawyer or other source \nof help before financial meltdown occurs. When they realize what has \nhappened, these consumers are often on the brink of foreclosure and \nbankruptcy.\n  There are some protections built into current law. I have no quarrel \nwith this. But you cannot call these protections ``ample'' when they \npermit a gross injustice. There exist out there lenders who illegally \ntrap families into insurmountable debt, force the families into \nbankruptcy, and then actually continue to pursue their greed by staking \ntheir claim in bankruptcy proceedings.\n  The debate on the bankruptcy reform bill before us started I guess \nabout 5\n\n[[Page S2028]]\n\nyears ago. The argument from the people who wanted to change the law is \nthat too many people were coming to bankruptcy court and filing for \nbankruptcy and they really shouldn't, they should pay back their debt. \nThey argued that the people who were filing for bankruptcy had \nforgotten the moral stigma of declaring bankruptcy in America. Yet when \nI look at this situation, where is the moral stigma? Shouldn't the \nmoral stigma be on the conscience of these lenders who have dragged \nthese poor unsuspecting people into a situation where they have no hope \nand nowhere else to turn? When it comes to that moral stigma, it will \nbe interesting on the vote on the Durbin amendment as to whether the \npeople believe, in voting in the Senate, there is any moral culpability \non the part of those who have taken advantage so many times.\n  Yesterday, Senator Hatch said that my amendment ``will adversely \naffect the availability of credit to certain consumers, many of whom \nmay be low-income and minorities whom this amendment purports to \nprotect. Moreover, the secondary market for such mortgages will also be \naffected thereby placing an upward pressure on the pricing of such \nloans.''\n  Well, if Senator Hatch really feels that way, then he should be \njoining me in supporting this amendment. This amendment will not affect \navailable credit for anyone. Nor will it affect the secondary market. \nThe only ones affected by this amendment are the low-life lenders who \nare breaking the law, and ruining people's lives in the process. They \nare the only ones who should be concerned. Because they will no longer \nbe able to profit from their unscrupulous practices.\n  And the finance industry ought to think twice about harboring and \nprotecting these people. It doesn't give their industry a good name or \na good reputation.\n  Senator Hatch also said yesterday that my amendment ``does not \nrequire any finding that such a violation was the cause of the debtor \ngoing into bankruptcy. Now that's just not good law. That's not the way \nwe should be making law. Nor does it require that a violation of the \nHome Ownership and Equity Protection Act had to have been found for \nthis draconian remedy to take place.''\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could the Senator give me some indication when he is \nwilling to go to a vote on this amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am hoping to in just a few moments.\n  Mr. HATCH. When the Senator has concluded, I will move to table.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I only yielded for the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand. I am just wondering if we can have some idea \nwhen we can go to a vote, and then I would be able to give people some \nsort of notice.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think that is reasonable. I would say no more than 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. On your amendment, and then Senator Gramm.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I think I can do it in 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then about 10 until 12; is that all right? I will make a \nmotion to table. Could I ask unanimous consent?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Could we divide the time so the Senator would have his \ntime and I would have mine? I sense that the Senator is somewhat caught \nup in this and would like to speak. And I want to be sure I get the \nopportunity.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Texas is correct, I am caught up in \nthis. I think we have 40 minutes remaining. I will take 15, if the \nSenator from Texas would like to take 15. How is that?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is all right.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could move to table at 10 until 12, and let everybody \nknow, is that OK?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to make sure I understand what the Senator is \nsaying. If we could have the time between now and 11:50 evenly divided, \nthat would be fine.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that be the case, and I will move \nto table at the conclusion of that time.\n  No second degree will be in order.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is right.\n  Mr. HATCH. Before the vote--in other words, we will divide the time \nup until 10 until 12, equally divided with no further amendments before \nthe vote, and I will move to table at that time, and we will have a \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The point made by the staff is well taken. If the motion \ndoes not prevail, the amendment will still be pending and open for \ndebate and amendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  What is interesting from the parliamentary side is, once you have \nmade a motion to table, it is not debatable and it all comes to an end.\n  I will make a few comments in closing, and Senator Gramm will have \nhis opportunity, and the Senate will vote on whether to table the \nDurbin amendment.\n  For those who have not heard the Durbin amendment, it says if you are \ngoing to go to bankruptcy court and claim protection to try to pursue a \nmortgage foreclosure, you have to walk into bankruptcy court with clean \nhands. You cannot be an unscrupulous, illegal lender taking advantage \nand exploiting poor people, elderly, and widows, and walk into \nbankruptcy court and say I want the protection of the law.\n  The people who oppose it will say folks just have to come to \nunderstand the conditions of these mortgages; they have to learn a \nlittle bit about the law; they have to understand this is an industry \nthat is out to make a profit, too.\n  I think there is truth to that. I think people have to come into \nthese transactions with some basic understanding of the law. But think \nabout the people we are talking about here. These are 70- and 80-year-\nold retirees who are losing their homes to these loan sharks who know \nthe law inside and out. These are people with limited understanding of \nthe law, maybe limited education, and maybe limited understanding of \nthe English language. These are the victims. These are the targets. And \nto argue that these are the people who should understand the great law \nof America is to suggest that each one of us knows what the backs of \nour monthly statements from the credit card companies really mean.\n  I am a lawyer. I haven't flipped over to see the faint type and small \nletters on the back side of a page to determine the conditions of my \ncredit card. How many times have you stopped to read it? I haven't. I \nam not sure I could understand it if I did. That is the reality. I am a \nlawyer; these folks are not. These are people who have done the right \nthing in America, and they are the victims.\n  Senator Hatch also said yesterday that my amendment ``does not \nrequire any finding that such a violation was the cause of the debtor \ngoing into bankruptcy. Now that's just not good law. That's not the way \nwe should be making law. Nor does it require that a violation of the \nHome Ownership and Equity Protection Act had to have been found for \nthis draconian remedy to take place.''\n  Now let me get this straight. If a lender breaks the law, if it's \nbeen demonstrated that they clearly violated the Truth-in-Lending Act, \nthe portion dealing with predatory mortgages and burdened a family with \nan outrageous, morally indefensible loan, if they have done all that, \nthen the bankrupted family still has to prove that is why they went \nbankrupt.\n  Think about that. After they have lost their homes to this \nunscrupulous lender, some of the critics of this amendment say the \nburden is still on the borrower: You have to prove I was unscrupulous. \nYou have to prove this lender did illegal things. If they can't, then \nthe lawbreaker can still sit down at the table and take the family's \nassets.\n  I can think of no better example than that of what a bad law really \nlooks like. My amendment addresses it.\n  Yesterday, we learned from Jodie Bernstein, Director of the FTC \nBureau of Consumer Protection that a lending arm of Citigroup ``hid \nessential information from consumers, misrepresented loan terms, \nflipped loans [repeatedly offering to consolidate debt\n\n[[Page S2029]]\n\ninto home loans] and packed optional fees to raise the costs of the \nloans.'' And that the ``primarily victimized'' . . . were the most \nvulnerable, hardworking people who had to borrow to meet emergency \nneeds and often had no other access to capital.\n  The FTC lawsuit comes after almost 3 years of investigation. Well we \nhave an opportunity to help curb these predatory lending practices \ntoday by passing my amendment.\n  Why do we need my amendment to deal with predatory lending practices? \nBecause of: the statistics I mentioned earlier; because of victims of \npredatory lending like Ms. McNab and Ms. Ferguson; and because of suits \nlike that filed by the FTC against a lending arm of Citigroup--\npredatory lending is an epidemic.\n  We can end this epidemic with this amendment. Current law is not \nsufficient to deal with it. If current law were enough, we wouldn't be \nstanding here today; we wouldn't have seen the dramatic increase in \nthese loans nor the dramatic increase in mortgage foreclosures directly \nattributable to these loans.\n  The problem of predatory financial practices in the high-cost \nmortgage industry is relevant to bankruptcy because it is driving \nvulnerable people into bankruptcy.\n  These people are not entering bankruptcy in order to abuse the \nsystem, they are filing bankruptcy because the reprehensible tactics of \nunscrupulous lenders have driven them into insolvency and threatens \ntheir homes, cars, and other necessities.\n  The question is whether my colleagues in the Senate want to vote to \nprotect these victims by voting for the Durbin amendment.\n  My amendment prohibits a high-cost mortgage lender that extended \ncredit in violation of the provisions of the Truth in Lending Act from \ncollecting its claim in bankruptcy.\n  For people, such as Genie McNab, Helen Ferguson, Goldie Johnson, and \nthe Mason family, about whom I talked yesterday, if they go to the \nbankruptcy court seeking last-resort help for the financial distress \nthat an unscrupulous lender has caused them, the claim of the predatory \nhome lender will not be allowed if the Durbin amendment passes. If \nthose who move to table my amendment--if Senator Hatch or Senator Gramm \nprevail--these predatory lenders, guilty of abusive practices, will \nhave the protection of the bankruptcy court. If my amendment passes, \nthey will not.\n  My amendment is narrowly drawn. It simply says that a creditor who \nviolates the law cannot then ask for the law to protect them in \nbankruptcy court. I do not think my colleagues, in their effort to \ncreate a bankruptcy system more favorable to creditors, want to protect \nthese unscrupulous people in the process.\n  Congress has seen fit to pass laws to protect consumers from some of \nthe egregious practices of predatory lenders, including the Home \nOwnership Equity Protection Act and the Truth in Lending Act.\n  And I might say, just briefly, my first exposure to Capitol Hill came \nas a college student in this town. I worked for a Senator from Illinois \nwhose name was Paul Douglas. He served from 1948 to 1966. He was an \nextraordinary man who fought for consumers during his entire career. \nMaybe some of that has rubbed off in the way I view politics.\n  But one of things he pushed for his entire career--and he did not \nserve long enough to see happen--was the passage of the Truth In \nLending Act, which said that instead of ``buyer beware,'' the consumer \nshould be informed. I think that is a good law for America. People who \nare abusing that law, a law that has been the law of America now for 33 \nyears, should not have the protection of bankruptcy law when they go to \ncourt.\n  If this bankruptcy legislation is enacted into law, it will force all \ndebtors, including those who fall below median income, to jump through \nall sorts of new hoops so we can be satisfied the debtor is not abusing \nthe bankruptcy system. Cumbersome and burdensome new requirements are \nbeing placed on all debtors to weed out the abusers of the system.\n  In this case, we are not talking about debtors who are acting \nillegally; we are simply talking about abusive creditors whom I believe \nare acting illegally and should be held accountable.\n  My amendment does address their illegal practices. We don't live in a \nperfect world. We live in a world where predatory lending is all too \ncommon and growing in America. Think about how it has grown. Now put it \nin the context of a slowed-down economy, perhaps a recession--people \nfinding they are losing their jobs; they don't have as much income, but \ntheir debts are growing. People will then, in desperation, turn to \nsecond mortgages for repairs at home or to overcome a family crisis. \nThese will be the new class and the new array of victims of these \npredatory lending practices. Those are the ones about whom I am most \nconcerned. If this Durbin amendment does not pass, you will see these \nnumbers continue to increase.\n  We know many of the victims of predatory lending end up in bankruptcy \ncourt. This Congress should not allow these people to be victimized \ntwice--first by the predatory lenders, and second, in the bankruptcy \ncourt.\n  Close the loophole that now exists. Shut the bankruptcy courthouse \ndoors to creditors who illegally prey on the most vulnerable in our \nsociety, including older Americans, minorities, and low-income \nfamilies. If the lender has failed to follow the law with the \nrequirements of the Truth in Lending Act for high-cost second \nmortgages, the lender should have absolutely no claim against the \nbankruptcy estate. Bankruptcy courts always consider creditors' claims \nand whether they are fraudulent or not. They make this decision before \nthey can go forward and pursue them in the bankruptcy court. All I am \nsaying is, they should also say if they have violated the law in \nillegally offering these mortgages, they cannot use bankruptcy court.\n\n  My amendment is not aimed at all subprime lenders. If they are \nfollowing the law, they have nothing to fear. If they are not following \nthe law, they are going to hate the Durbin amendment. Indeed, it is \naimed at the worst and most predatory of these subprime lenders.\n  My provision is aimed only at practices that are already illegal and, \nas the amendment says, materially illegal. It does not deal with \ntechnical or immaterial violations of the Truth in Lending Act.\n  Disallowing the claims of predatory lenders and bankruptcy cases will \nnot end these predatory practices altogether. Yet it is a valuable step \nto curb creditor abuse in a situation where the lender bears primary \nresponsibility for the deterioration of a consumer's financial \nsituation.\n  I have supported bankruptcy reform laws. I hope I can support this \none. But if we are going to take a no-amendment strategy on the floor \nof the Senate, if we will not hold abusive and unscrupulous creditors \naccountable for their activity, you cannot say this is a balanced bill. \nIt is tipped to make sure the credit industry always wins and the \nconsumer always loses.\n  This Congress, this Senate, represents not only bankers and lenders, \nit represents ordinary American families, retirees, people who vote, \nand people who care. We have to make certain the amendments we \nconsider, the bankruptcy law we pass, remembers those people who cannot \nafford a lobbyist, those people who, frankly, have found themselves at \na tragedy they never envisioned in their lives. They have to be \nremembered on the floor of the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to think twice about \nthis. The last time I offered this amendment, one Republican Senator \nvoted against it who later told me: I wish I would have known what was \nin there. I wish I would have read some of the stories I heard about in \nmy State about predatory lending. That Senator is going to reconsider \nthe vote that is cast today.\n  I hope some of my friends on the Republican side will not take an \nautomatic reaction against every amendment. This is a good-faith \namendment. And when you go home and hear about these practices in your \nhome State, and about families who are exploited, you will be able to \nsay--if you vote for the Durbin amendment--I did what I could to stop \nthese people who are taking advantage and exploiting these poor people \nacross America. But if you vote down this amendment--business as usual, \nwhat a banner day for the subprime loan industry, for the sharks on the \nstreet who will go out looking--\n\n[[Page S2030]]\n\nas this person said here in closed testimony, anonymously--for that \nelderly woman who is on Social Security, who has a home with a value to \nit that you can extend into a loan she can never pay back, so that the \nsubprime lender will realize his version of the American dream--he will \nown the home; it will be the home of the person who saved their entire \nlife, hoping they could retire there in peace and tranquility.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as always, our colleague has done an \nexcellent job. He begins by telling us that only people who ruin \npeople's lives could be opposed to the amendment. He tells us the \namendment has to do with people who won World War II. He tells us the \nsharks on the street are the subprime lenders who are affected. And \nthen he tells us it is a choice between those who respond to special \ninterests and his choice in defending the individual, people who do not \nhave lobbyists.\n  I think we have heard an excellent speech, but it has no relevance to \nthe amendment that is before us.\n  The amendment before us, paradoxically, would hurt the very people \nour colleague appears to champion. I wonder how many Members of the \nSenate are members of families who have received a subprime loan.\n  As I mentioned earlier, when I was a boy, my mama bought a home on \nDogwood Avenue in Columbus, GA, for $9,300. She borrowed the money from \na subprime lender. She paid 4.5 percent interest. The going market rate \nwas 3 percent. She paid a premium of 50 percent. What incredible \nexploitation. The problem is, there is another side to that story.\n  She was a practical nurse. She did not have a full-time job. She \nworked on call. She had three children. Banks did not make loans to \npeople like my mother. As a result of that loan, at a 50-percent \npremium, so far as I am aware, she was the first person in her family, \nfrom Adam and Eve, ever to own her own home. It profoundly affected her \nlife, and it affected my life too. None of her children have ever \nfailed to own their own home.\n  So our colleague would have us believe that because you are paying a \npremium, because you have no established credit, or because you have \ntroubled credit, that somehow this kind of lending is illegitimate, or \nin today's terms, it is predatory.\n  The Senator from Illinois's amendment has nothing to do with \npredatory lending. Is our colleague not aware that Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac are now moving into subprime lending, that the premium that \npeople with no credit ratings or poor credit ratings are paying is \ndeclining because of increased competition? Is our colleague suggesting \nthat because every lender in America opposes this amendment, they are, \nby definition, people who ruin other people's lives?\n\n  Let me explain this amendment. When you cut through all of the \nwonderful rhetoric and every horror story ever recorded, where hundreds \nof laws have been broken and where remedy is available and is being \nundertaken, in every case that was cited by our colleague the lender \nviolated dozens of Federal statutes that have nothing to do with this \namendment.\n  What this amendment says, basically, is the following: If in any \nmaterial way you violate roughly a dozen provisions of the Truth in \nLending Act, the loan is not enforceable and lenders can't collect.\n  Let me give three examples of what constitutes a violation or would \nbe subject to a bankruptcy judge's determination as being a material \nviolation. You are now required under truth in lending to give written \nnotice to a borrower that you are going to give them information over \nthe telephone. If you failed to do that in writing 3 days before you \nactually gave the information and judged to be in violation, you would \nnot be able to collect on the loan.\n  You are required before a transaction is entered into to give 3 days' \nnotice. What if you gave 2 days' notice? You would be subject to not \nbeing able to collect a loan. You are required to provide the notice in \na certain typeset. Under the amendment of the Senator from Illinois, if \nyou were judged by a bankruptcy judge to have typeset that was too \nsmall, then the loan would be uncollectible.\n  Now what do you think is going to happen if these provisions become \nlaw? Thousands of reputable lenders who are making loans to people who \notherwise could not own their own home will get out of the mortgage-\nmaking business. Millions of people who could have the dream of home \nownership would lose it because of this amendment.\n  Our colleague tells us that remedy is needed. It is as if he didn't \nknow we have just undertaken, with every financial regulator, \npromulgation of new regulations related to so-called predatory lending. \nOne of the areas they are rulemaking on is balloon payments, the very \nthing about which he talks.\n  Over and over again, basically what we are being asked to do is \nsomething that will hurt not the lender--there are plenty of prime \nloans to be made but the people who do not have established credit or \nwho have marred credit. The net result is that millions of people will \nnot be able to get loans.\n  There is one other problem. There are very strict penalties for \nviolating the provisions of law referred to in this amendment. You can \nbe fined $1 million a day. You can have your bank charter terminated. \nYou can have the directors and officers removed. You can have an \ninjunction. Those are all penalties imposed on the bank.\n  Imagine if we actually had a provision of law which said that if an \nerror is made--and there is nothing about intent in this amendment--\nthen the loan is forgiven.\n  Can you imagine a situation where we are going to pit the borrower \nand the lender against each other, where the borrower would have an \nincentive not to respond, not to send in information, to try to find a \nway to produce an error so the loan would have to be forgiven? The net \nresult is that while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are now getting into \nsubprime lending, these kinds of provisions would drive them out. These \nprovisions would end up driving people who want to own their own home \ninto the hands of the very unscrupulous lenders about which our \ncolleague talks.\n\n  We have heard a wonderful speech. It talks about horror stories that \nhave existed and do exist. We have legislated over and over to deal \nwith those problems. The idea of saying that because an error was made \nwhich was unintentional in areas related to type size, notification in \nadvance of telephone discussions, notification prior to a transaction, \nthat those kinds of changes could render the loan uncollectible would \nmean thousands of lending institutions that today are making home \nownership possible would get out of that kind of lending. That is why \nevery lender in America is opposed to this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to let the Federal Reserve and our bank \nregulators, who are looking right at this moment at predatory lending, \ncome up with regulations that make sense and will help more than they \nhurt. I am moved, and I know anybody is moved who listened to the \nspeech in advocating this amendment. But I urge my colleagues to get \nbeyond the speech and look at the amendment.\n  Can you imagine putting lenders in a situation where technical \nerrors, unintentionally made, could result in a loan's not being \ncollectible? Banks in cities such as my hometown of College Station \nwould get out of subprime lending under those circumstances in droves. \nAnd the cost of the loans that would be made would go up.\n  The problem our colleague talks about is real. The emotion he \npresents is real and well intended. The remedy he proposes makes all of \nthe problems worse. It drives out not the bad lender but the good \nlender. It drives out not the loan shark but the legitimate lender who \nis getting into this area of lending and driving down interest rates \nand helping people own their own home.\n  I wish we could pass a law that would say that everybody had good \ncredit, that everybody had established patterns of behavior paying back \ndebt, and that somehow that could change behavior. Such a law could not \nbe passed and would not be reasonable. It would violate human nature.\n  To pass a law that basically says you can't collect a loan based on \nan unintentional error is to assault the whole foundation of the credit \nsystem of the\n\n[[Page S2031]]\n\nUnited States of America and greatly undercut the ability of moderate-\nincome people, people who have checkered credit ratings, people who \nhave no credit ratings, from ever getting a loan.\n  I urge my colleagues to support tabling this amendment. I yield the \nremainder of my time to Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that I have 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection \nAct, HOEPA, already gives borrowers numerous protections and built-in \n``super-remedies'' including the consumer's right to rescind the loan, \nactual and statutory damages, class action law suits, attorneys fees \nand costs. This amendment imposes a drastic and unnecessary new penalty \non lenders by taking away their right to get paid in bankruptcy--and \nthus gives the debtor a ``free house''--in the event of a violation of \nHOEPA. This amendment will create litigation within litigation. Also, \nthe amendment as written would make any secured loan, whether or not \nsubject to HOEPA, even if fully compliant with all other banking laws, \nsubject to the draconian remedies of this amendment for a violation of \nthe Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act.\n  This provides a major disincentive, as the distinguished Senator from \nTexas, the chairman of the Banking Committee, has made the case, for \nmaking loans to people on the margin, taking the American dream of home \nownership out of reach for them. I join with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas in making it clear that this amendment does precisely the \nopposite.\n  That is what our very effective colleague, with all of the horror \nstories he mentioned, has been advocating. Frankly, I hope we vote this \namendment down because it will be a disaster in bankruptcy law. I think \nit will be a disaster for those folks who currently benefit from fair \nlending. Where there is unfair lending, I have no doubt the laws will \ntake care of that. This amendment will work exactly to the contrary.\n  Mr. President, I will move to table the amendment following the \nclosing statement of Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Utah has expired. \nThere remains 41 seconds for the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment says that if you have \nmaterially violated the law, if you have exploited the poor victims in \nAmerica who can lose their homes because of predatory lending, you \ncannot have the protection of the bankruptcy court. Senator Grassley \nfrom Iowa, who is on the floor, held hearings on this in State after \nState.\n  This is a scourge on retired people and people on fixed incomes. Will \nwe come to their rescue? Watch the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To make an amendment with respect to the preservation of \n   claims and defenses upon the sale or transfer of a predatory loan)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 204. PRESERVATION OF CLAIMS AND DEFENSES UPON SALE OR \n                   TRANSFER OF PREDATORY LOANS.\n\n       Section 363 of title 11, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(p) Notwithstanding subsection (f), the sale by a trustee \n     or transfer under a plan of reorganization of any interest in \n     a consumer credit transaction that is subject to the Truth In \n     Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), or a consumer credit \n     contract as defined by the Federal Trade Commission \n     Preservation of Claims Trade Regulation, is subject to all \n     claims and defenses which the consumer could assert against \n     the debtor.''.\n       Amend the table of contents accordingly.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask my colleague if he will yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent I be recognized after the Senator \nhas completed his amendment for the purposes of submitting an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. KERRY. I believe it was ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah, I believe you are a \nlittle tardy.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am offering a very limited amendment to \nthe bankruptcy code relating to subprime lenders that engage in \npredatory lending practices and then declare bankruptcy as a way to \navoid liability for their role in destroying the lives of decent, hard-\nworking American families.\n  Let me state, while I supported the amendment of my good friend from \nIllinois, this is a much narrower amendment. In fact, it conforms to \nwhat the Senator from Texas has said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. Let's see if we can \nget order in the Senate Chamber.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will our guests and all others be in order, \nplease. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, my good friend from Texas, Senator Gramm, \nhad mentioned that the previous amendment went way beyond the scope of \nthe bankruptcy bill dealing with RESAP and TILA. This amendment does \nnot. It limits things strictly to the bankruptcy code and it is an \namendment that is needed to ensure that the bankruptcy code is not used \nto exacerbate the effects of illegal predatory lending practices.\n  In the past decade we have had remarkable prosperity. More than half \nof\n\n[[Page S2032]]\n\nall Americans invested in the stock market. Unemployment figures hit \nall-time lows. Despite a recent slowing, more families than ever own \ntheir own homes.\n  While we have made enormous progress towards providing all of our \ncitizens with the opportunity to achieve the American dream of home \nownership, the invidious practice of predatory lending is stripping \nhard-working individuals and families of their savings, and it is \nsinking them into debt and devastating them financially. For many, it \nhas turned the American dream into the American nightmare.\n  Nowhere is the problem more prevalent than in my home State of New \nYork. Now there are some who would argue, despite the evidence to the \ncontrary, that there is no such thing as predatory lending, but I know \nwe all know better. We know the costs that predatory lending has caused \nto people. When borrowers encounter a predatory lender, they are \nmanipulated and deceived through a barrage of aggressive and misleading \ntactics, stripped of the equity in their homes, robbed of their life \nsavings, led into foreclosure, often forced into bankruptcy, and, of \ncourse, the predators as a matter of practice target the most \nvulnerable: unsophisticated first-time home buyers, elderly, minority \ncommunity, low-income neighborhoods.\n  We have a new problem with these predatory lenders. That is what this \namendment seeks to avoid. In recent months, several large subprime \nlenders have obtained orders from bankruptcy courts, providing for the \nsale of their loans or the servicing rights associated with them under \nsection 363 of the bankruptcy code. Consumers who have attempted to \nchallenge these loans or their servicing obligations based on \nviolations of fair lending laws have been told by the purchasers of \nthese loans they were sold free and clear of any consumer claims and \ndefenses. The fact that innocent borrowers can be left in the lurch is \nflatout wrong.\n\n  Here you have the situation where a predatory lender has come in, \ngotten a loan, and then declared bankruptcy, shielding that predatory \nlender from a claim that the innocent homeowner is making. That is \nwrong. All this amendment does, staying within the confines of the \nbankruptcy code, not dealing with banking issues--I am a member of the \nBanking Committee but I agree that is the place where we should deal \nwith those issues--is seek to prevent the bankruptcy code from \nshielding these lenders from the rightful claims of innocent borrowers \nwho have their life savings at stake.\n  It is heartbreaking and maddening to hear how decent, hard-working \npeople have had their lives destroyed because of predatory lenders when \nthey sought little more than to obtain their piece of the rock, the \nAmerican dream--home ownership. It is frustrating when the bankruptcy \ncode is used to help these predatory lenders hide from the law.\n  By adopting this amendment, we can take a very small but important \nstep against predatory lending. We will prevent predatory lenders from \nbeing able to use bankruptcy as a means by which to shield themselves \nfrom liability and cut off consumer claims and defenses.\n  Let me repeat that because that is the nub of this limited but \nimportant amendment which I hope we will accept without controversy. We \nwill prevent predatory lenders from being able to use the bankruptcy \ncode as a means by which to shield themselves from liability and cut \noff consumer claims and defenses. And we will protect consumers from \nthose who seek to purchase predatory loans with the knowledge that the \nconsumer's right has been undermined.\n  In short, we can send a powerful message that we are committed to \nprotecting individuals and their families from those who rob them of \ntheir dreams and then seek to cloak themselves behind the veil of the \nbankruptcy law.\n  I sincerely hope we can accept this amendment. It is fair. It is \nlimited to the bankruptcy code. It was intended to and it makes the \ncode immune from the practices of predatory lenders that the code was \nnever intended to protect from the homeowners they rip off.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment of \nthe Senator from New York?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New York seek the yeas \nand nays?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be happy, before I do, to yield to my colleague \nfrom Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Let me state the situation for the Senator from New \nYork. We can have the yeas and nays, but we cannot have a vote on this \nright away.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is OK. Unless the Senator from Iowa would accept \nthis amendment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We are not prepared to make that decision yet.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be happy to ask for the yeas and nays and delay \nthe vote until a time auspicious to the floor manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I agree to temporarily lay aside the \namendment of the Senator from New York so we can proceed to the \namendment of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator from Iowa will yield, as long as we get \nthe yeas and nays on this amendment in due course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We had the sufficient second.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The point is we can assure the Senator from New York \nthe yeas and nays on his amendment. We can't assure the Senator from \nNew York when we are going to vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 26.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strike certain provisions relating to small businesses, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 187, strike lines 4 and 5.\n       On page 202, strike line 9 and all that follows through \n     page 223, line 12, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 420. STUDY OF OPERATION OF TITLE 11, UNITED STATES CODE, \n                   WITH RESPECT TO SMALL BUSINESSES.\n\n       Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, \n     in consultation with the Attorney General, the Director of \n     the Administrative Office of United States Trustees, and the \n     Director of the Administrative Office of the United States \n     Courts, shall--\n       (1) conduct a study to determine--\n       (A) the internal and external factors that cause small \n     businesses, especially sole proprietorships, to become \n     debtors in cases under title 11, United States Code, and that \n     cause certain small businesses to successfully complete cases \n     under chapter 11 of such title;\n       (B) how Federal laws relating to bankruptcy may be made \n     more effective and efficient in assisting small businesses to \n     remain viable;\n       (C) what factors, if any, would indicate the need for any \n     additional procedures or reporting requirements for small \n     businesses that file petitions for bankruptcy under chapter \n     11 of title 11, United States Code;\n       (D) what length of time is appropriate for small business \n     debtors and entrepreneurs to file and confirm a \n     reorganization plan under title 11, United States Code, \n     including the factors considered to arrive at that \n     conclusion; and\n       (E) how often a small business debtor files separate \n     petitions for bankruptcy protection within a 2-year period; \n     and\n       (2) submit a report summarizing the study required by \n     paragraph (1) to the President pro tempore of the Senate and \n     the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the \n     Committees on Small Business of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with this \namendment\n\n[[Page S2033]]\n\nas the ranking member of the Small Business Committee of the Senate, a \ncommittee which we all know is designed to try to help empower \nAmerica's small businesses to do what they do best, which is to create \njobs.\n  Everyone in the Senate knows that almost all of the job growth of our \ncountry comes from small businesses, and, frankly, I think it is about \n80 percent of the jobs in the Nation that come from small businesses.\n  We have tried to do as much as possible in the Senate in recent years \nto encourage small businesses to be able to act as the incubator of our \neconomy. Together with Senator Bond, chairman of the committee, I think \nthe Small Business Committee has been able to be particularly \nresponsive to the needs of those businesses.\n  We have heard Alan Greenspan talk a lot about the so-called \n``virtuous economic cycle'' that we lived through in the course of the \nlast decade, and I think all of us look with special sensitivity to the \nimpact the bankruptcy bill might have on small businesses.\n  It is with that concern I come to the floor today with deep concern \nabout a particular provision within the bankruptcy bill that, in my \njudgment, runs counter to the policies we have been putting in place in \nthe last years as we tried to have low-documentation loans, lift the \nregulatory burden on small businesses, lift the paperwork burden on \nsmall businesses, and, indeed, expand the capacity for entrepreneurship \nand for growth.\n  There is no evidence at all that small business bankruptcies are a \nproblem which somehow warrant the rather extraordinary increase in \nregulatory oversight this bill seeks to impose on those businesses.\n  I am offering an amendment that would strike the small business \nsubtitle of the Bankruptcy Reform Act and include in its place a study \nof the causes of small business bankruptcy and how Federal law \nregarding small business bankruptcy can be made more effective and more \nefficient.\n  Let me preface my comments about the specifics of this particular \nsection that I seek to strike by saying that I share with all my \ncolleagues who support the bankruptcy bill the notion that a decision \nto file for bankruptcy obviously should not be used as an economic tool \nto avoid responsibility for unsound business decisions, nor should it \nbe an effort to get out from under a reckless act by either an \nindividual or a business.\n  There has been a decline, as we all know, in the stigma of filing for \npersonal bankruptcy, and certainly we would agree that appropriate \nchanges are necessary in order to ensure that bankruptcy not be \nconsidered a lifestyle choice.\n  During the 105th and 106th Congresses, I have supported legislation \nthat would increase personal responsibility in bankruptcy, and I have \noffered amendments that improve the number of small business provisions \nin the bill.\n\n  It has been Congress' long-held belief that regulatory and procedural \nburdens, however, should be lowered to whatever degree we can for small \nbusiness--i.e., when it is possible and when it is rational to do so or \nwhen it doesn't somehow create another set of problems.\n  The Senate previously passed legislation to reduce that regulatory \nburden on small business, including most recently the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness \nAct.\n  Both of them have brought about fundamental changes in the way \nFederal agencies develop regulations.\n  In fiscal year 1999, changes to final regulations throughout the \nFederal Government reduced the compliance costs for small businesses by \nalmost $5.3 billion.\n  I respectfully submit the provisions of this bankruptcy bill will set \nback those very efforts of the Senate, and most importantly they do so \nwithout an adequate showing and without any adequate demonstration that \nthis is, in fact, necessary.\n  I ask my colleagues, What is the evidence on which we are going to \npotentially proceed in the Senate to literally punish entrepreneurship?\n  As we can see in this chart, the degree to which small businesses \nhave been carrying the heavy load of creating jobs during our recent \neconomic expansion for every single year over the last decade, small \nfirms have developed more jobs than large firms. In many years, small \nfirm job creation has exceeded the growth of large firms by 2 or 3 to \n1.\n  In 1992-1993 it was extraordinary the degree to which small firms \neclipsed large firms. But even most recently, from 1994-1995 and 1996-\n1997, we have had the same trend during which small businesses have \nclearly exceeded the extraordinary growth level of all of the economy.\n  It would be insane for us to come in here now without an adequate \nshowing of need and turn around and burden some businesses with \nproceedings that will cost them extraordinary amounts of administrative \ntime, which in a small business is exceedingly difficult to comply \nwith.\n  I ask those who promote this legislation, are we imposing on small \nbusinesses these kinds of requirements because small businesses have \nsomehow been egregious in the bankruptcy process? The answer to that is \nno. There is no showing. In fact, the showing is to the contrary. \nBusiness bankruptcy chapter 11 filings from 1987 to the year 2000 show \na decline in the numbers in thousands of small business bankruptcies. \nIn fact, over the past decade, we have gone from 24,000 in the year \n1991 to just below 10,000 last year, 23.7 million business tax returns \nfiled in 1997, and a record 885,416 new small firms with employees \nopened their doors.\n  The numbers show us that of approximately 23.7 million business tax \nreturns, and 885,000 new small businesses, only 10,000 were forced to \nfile for bankruptcy.\n  Are those that filed for bankruptcy somehow doing such an injury to \nour economy that it measures the kind of response we see in this \nlegislation?\n  A 1999 SBA study found that 79 percent of small businesses that filed \nfor bankruptcy had each incurred less than $500,000 in debt. The study \nalso found that about 45 percent of bankruptcy cases had one or no \nemployees. Less than 5 percent of the bankruptcy cases represented \ncompanies with 50 or more employees.\n  The median assets of small businesses that filed for bankruptcy was \njust $94,000. So, once again, we have to measure the intrusive nature \nof the reporting requirements placed in this legislation versus the \noverall positive impact that small businesses have had versus the \nextraordinarily small impact of those small businesses that have filed \nfor bankruptcy.\n  In November of last year, Wei Fan of the University of Michigan and \nMichelle White of the University of California at San Diego released a \nreport on personal bankruptcy and its effects on entrepreneurial \nactivity. The study concludes that while the bankruptcy reform bill is \nintended to reduce abuse in the bankruptcy system, an unintended \nconsequence of adopting those reforms would be a substantial reduction \nin the level of self-employment by U.S. households.\n  Elizabeth Warren, a professor of Harvard Law School, and a recognized \nleader on the bankruptcy issue, believes the small business provisions \nin the bankruptcy bill would be the first piece of Federal legislation \nthat actively discriminates against small businesses and denies them \nprotection available to large businesses.\n  Ms. Warren believes the additional reporting requirements will be \nextraordinarily difficult and expensive for small businesses to produce \non a monthly basis. She concludes:\n\n       A decision by Congress in 2001 that small businesses should \n     bear greater costs, face shorter deadlines, file more papers \n     and lose any flexibility that a supervising judge might \n     provide is a decision to shut down small businesses simply \n     because they are small.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent her letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Harvard Law School,\n\n                                     Cambridge, MA, March 7, 2001.\n     Senator Kit Bond,\n     Russell Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator John Kerry,\n     Russell Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond and Senator Kerry: As the Senate \n     considers Senate Bill 420, I ask that you pay particular \n     attention to the business provisions. They will have a \n     direct, immediate and adverse impact on businesses in \n     Missouri, Massachusetts and across the country.\n\n[[Page S2034]]\n\n       Unlike the consumer provisions which have received \n     substantial attention, the proposed amendments that would \n     alter the rules of business reorganizations have remained \n     largely unnoticed. According to data released last week by \n     the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, 9,197 \n     businesses filed for Chapter 11 reorganization during 2000. \n     The proposed amendments would dramatically change the rules \n     for every one of these businesses and for the thousands more \n     businesses expected to file this year.\n       The proposed changes make it much more difficult for these \n     businesses to reorganize successfully. The entrepreneurs and \n     shareholders of these businesses will be affected, as will an \n     estimated two million employees who work for businesses \n     filing for bankruptcy and the communities across the country \n     where these businesses buy goods and pay taxes.\n       I am particularly concerned about a group of provisions, \n     sections 431-443, that target small businesses and single \n     them out for reduced access to Chapter 11. This would be the \n     first piece of federal legislation in history that actively \n     discriminates against small businesses and denies them \n     protection available to large businesses.\n       The impact of the small business provisions would be \n     substantial. More than 80% of the chapter 11 cases would fall \n     within the new constraints of ``small business'' in Sec. 420. \n     In many communities, all the businesses would come within its \n     sweep. Businesses that are vital to smaller communities would \n     not have the same opportunities to reorganize as their \n     larger counterparts.\n       The provisions allowing the court to combine the hearing on \n     approval of the disclosure statement are meritorious. The \n     remainder of the provisions that apply to ``small business'' \n     (which the bill defines as any and every business with debts \n     of $3.0 million or less) restrict the discretion of the court \n     to control the plan confirmation process. These provisions \n     force the court to liquidate the business or dismiss the \n     proceedings for failure to comply with technical and \n     burdensome reporting requirements.\n       Secton 434, for example, would impose regular reports on \n     the debtor's profitability. This kind of report has very \n     limited usefulness for the creditors because accounting \n     profits are subject to manipulation, so that judges and \n     creditors do not rely on them in small business cases. \n     Instead, they look at the debtor's cash disbursements and \n     receipts. Nonetheless, these reports may be very difficult \n     and expensive for small businesses to produce on a monthly \n     basis. A debtor that fails to produce it faces dismissal--\n     with the inevitable loss of jobs. The deadlines in the bill \n     impose a similar stranglehold on the business regardless of \n     the progress of the case toward successful reorganization. \n     The 175-day deadline in Sec. 438 and the inconsistent 300-day \n     deadline in Sec. 437 are artificial. They ignore, for \n     example, the delays in plan confirmation that are beyond the \n     debtor's control and have nothing to do with the viability of \n     the business. For example, a state regulatory action that \n     takes places outside of the bankruptcy court may need to run \n     its course before a plan can be formed.\n       In addition, provisions outside sections 431-443 would doom \n     small businesses. The draconian provisions of Sec. 708 and \n     Sec. 321(d) of the bill--introducing the concept of non-\n     dischargeability in corporate reorganizations, large or \n     small--would provide a major setback to the rehabilitation of \n     any corporation. These provisions would fall especially hard \n     on small businesses that could not afford increased \n     litigation costs and would be destroyed by a single \n     recalcitrant creditor. The provisions are particuarly \n     counterproductive because Sec. 708 punishes the wrong people. \n     The appropriate remedy when management has misbehaved is to \n     file the management and to sue them personally, not to saddle \n     the surviving company with litigation that will sink it and \n     repayments that will come out of the pockets of the innocent \n     creditors. By permitting litigation over nondischargeability, \n     the innocent creditors are put to the choice of letting one \n     creditor take all the assets of the business or litigating \n     nondischargeability. Most will choose to fight rather than \n     give up, but if everyone fights, the case is prolonged, \n     assets are dissipated and no one wins except the lawyers. \n     This provision hinders reorganizations without doing anything \n     to hold the right people accountable for the false \n     statements.\n       Before the adoption of the 1978 Code, Congress has \n     implemented a system by which small businesses and large \n     businesses were to be dealt with separately in \n     reorganization. The difference was that Congress had decided \n     that more constraints should be imposed on big businesses \n     than on small ones. Congress understood that small \n     businesses already in financial trouble have the best \n     chance to reorganize and pay their creditors if they are \n     not saddled with an expensive administrative apparatus.\n       This bill stands that laudable, common sense concept on its \n     head. A decision by Congress in 2001 that small businesses \n     should bear greater costs, face shorter deadlines, file more \n     papers and lose any flexibility that a supervising judge \n     might provide is a decision to shut down small businesses \n     simply because they are small.\n       There are no data to suggest that entrepreneurs are abusing \n     the bankruptcy system or that they are somehow less \n     trustworthy than people running bigger businesses. To single \n     out the hardworking men and women who run these businesses \n     for unfavorable treatment solely on the basis of their size \n     is indefensible. I hope you will persuade your colleagues to \n     strike these provisions from the bill.\n           Very Truly Yours,\n                                                 Elizabeth Warren,\n                                    Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the provisions included in the Bankruptcy \nReform Act impose new technical and burdensome reporting requirements \nfor small businesses that file for bankruptcy that are far more \nstringent on small businesses than they are on big businesses. \nFurthermore, the bill would provide creditors with greatly enhanced \npowers to force small businesses to liquidate their assets at a time it \nmay not be advisable, and with reporting requirements that may, in \nfact, force a liquidation that does not have to take place.\n  Specifically, the bill will require small businesses to provide \nperiodic financial and other reports containing information ranging \nfrom cash receipts, cash disbursements, and comparisons of actual cash \nreceipts and disbursements with projections in prior reports.\n  Just in case they missed anything, the bill includes a provision that \nincludes reports on such matters as are in the best interests of the \ndebtor and the creditors. This shifts all of the power in such a way as \nto place an extraordinary burden on mom-and-pop stores and mom-and-pop \noperations and small businesses that simply do not have the capacity to \nbe able to comply.\n  Any big business would have difficulty complying with these \nburdensome requirements. But I think we ought to measure what we are \ndoing here against the necessity that we see in the declining number of \nbankruptcies, the declining level of assets that are at stake, and the \ngreat upside of what these entities provide to the country.\n  So for that reason, I hope my colleagues will join me in specifically \nasking for a study, a short-term study, that will enable us to better \njudge whether these changes in the current system are needed. I believe \nwe ought to do everything possible to ensure the viability of small \nbusinesses and to assist in fostering entrepreneurship in the economy. \nThe Bankruptcy Reform Act, as it is today constructed, does not meet \nthat challenge.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in removing the small business \nprovisions, undertake the study, and then we can revisit it, if we need \nto, based on a sound analysis of precisely how we might proceed in a \nleast intrusive, a least burdensome manner.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I recognize my colleague probably wants to set the time \nfor that vote at some future time. That is fine with me.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am not going to respond to the \nsubstance of the amendment but to give some background on where we have \ncome over the last 5 or 6 years on this legislation for the \nconsideration of people who will want to debate against the amendment \nby the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I suggest to you that when Senator Heflin from Alabama was a Member \nof the Senate, he and I served as either chairman or ranking member of \nthe judiciary subcommittee on courts that has jurisdiction over \nbankruptcy issues for the period of time that he and I served together \nin the Senate, which, I think, was 16 years--1980 to 1996.\n  Just prior to that time, and my coming to the Senate, the Senate had \nadopted the last bankruptcy reform legislation, which I think was in \n1978 or 1979.\n  During the period of time he and I served as either chairman or \nranking member--depending upon which party was in the majority--he and \nI sponsored some technical corrections and some small changes to the \nlast major overhaul of the bankruptcy law. But as time went on, into \nthe early 1990s, Senator Heflin and I came to the conclusion that there \nwere changes in the economy--the globalization of the economy and a lot \nof other reasons--\n\n[[Page S2035]]\n\nand that we ought to give considerable attention to greater changes of \nthe bankruptcy code rather than the very small changes we enacted from \ntime to time during the 1980s.\n\n  He and I also came to the conclusion we would probably not have the \ntime, as the two Senators shouldering the responsibilities on \nbankruptcy legislation, to do it through our subcommittee. So we set up \nthe Bankruptcy Commission of which this legislation we are dealing with \nnow is a product. That commission was not made up of any Members of \nCongress. It was made up of appointees by legislative leaders and by \nthe President of the United States. These people truly are authorities \nin bankruptcy legislation, including Professor Warren from Harvard, who \nwas rapporteur for the commission, and is the person Senator Kerry was \nquoting. And he put a letter in the Record that was from her.\n  The commission studied the issues for over a year, and put a lot of \nwork into recommendations for both consumer bankruptcy and for business \nbankruptcy reform. There was an awful lot within the commission on \nconsumer bankruptcy reform that was very controversial and did not have \neven near-unanimous recommendations. There was a majority report, but \nnot an overwhelming majority report, on consumer bankruptcy.\n  But when it came to the recommendations of the commission on business \nbankruptcy reform, the recommendations of the commission came down to \nthe Congress on an 8-1 vote.\n  So we are being asked by the Senator from Massachusetts to do this \namendment for the sake of small business. I think it is essential that \nall of us take into consideration the needs of small business; so I do \nnot find fault with the interests he is trying to espouse here. But I \nthink we need to take into consideration that his amendment is taking \nthe business bankruptcy provisions of our bill and setting them aside \nand asking us to study what we should do in regard to business \nbankruptcy reform.\n  I don't think enough has changed in the last 4 or 5 years that an 8-1 \nrecommendation of the Bankruptcy Commission for business bankruptcy \nreform should be undone by this amendment of the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  I hope people will take into consideration the work Senator Heflin \nand I--we alone, almost totally for the rest of the Senate--had put \ninto bankruptcy legislation through the 1980s into the 1990s, and \nparticularly our recommendation of going to a commission instead of our \ndoing it, so we would have the most expertise involved with the changes \nand the reforming of business and personal bankruptcy. We set this \ncommission up to do exactly what it did. It came out with an \noverwhelming recommendation that is before the Senate.\n  Beyond that, in the period of time of 1997-1998, when we moved the \ncommission's recommendations through the Senate, through the House, \nthrough conference, through the House a second time, dying on the floor \nof the Senate because it came late in the session, and then starting \nover again with the same commission recommendations in 1999, moving it \nthrough the Senate, moving it through the House, moving it through \nconference, moving it through the House, moving it through the Senate, \nmoving it to the President of the United States where it was subjected \nto a pocket veto--through all of this consideration of the Bankruptcy \nCommission's recommendations, there has been little dispute about the \nbusiness provisions compared to the more controversial aspects of the \nconsumer and personal bankruptcy recommendations of the commission.\n  That is directly related to the fact that the commission's \nrecommendations came out 8-1 and, almost unchanged, have become the \nlegislation that first Senator Durbin and I introduced and then, \nbecause Senator Durbin was not on the Judiciary Committee in the \nCongress of 1999 and 2000, it was Senator Torricelli who joined me in \nintroducing bankruptcy legislation. That was introduced in exactly the \nsame way in the last Congress, as a result of our moving ahead with the \nsame conference report that President Clinton pocket vetoed for the \nunderlying legislation that we have before us, almost unchanged again, \nin legislation introduced as the Grassley-Torricelli-Biden-Hatch-\nSessions legislation that is before us.\n  I don't know why all of a sudden somebody thinks we ought to throw \nthese fairly noncontroversial small business and business bankruptcy \nprovisions out of this bill for further study. Each Member of this body \nis going to have to make up his or her mind on the substance of the \namendment by Senator Kerry. I want them to at least understand that we \nare where we are now not by some flippant decision of a couple Members \nof the Senate that we should be here, rather that these provisions are \nthe recommendations of a study of the bankruptcy commission. So the \nsmall business provisions we have now before us are based on a study of \na commission and recommended by that commission on an 8-1 vote.\n  I yield the floor and ask unanimous consent to set aside the \namendment of the Senator from New York, the Senator from Massachusetts, \nso we can now proceed to the amendment of the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 27\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill, the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa. I call up amendment No. 27.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Jeffords and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered \n     27.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 27) is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To make an amendment with respect to extensions of credit to \n                          underage consumers)\n\n       At the end of Title XIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1311.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment cosponsored by \nSenator Jeffords and Senator Durbin.\n  The amendment would put a $2,500 cap on any credit card issued to a \nminor--that is, an individual under 21--unless the minor submits an \napplication with the signature of his parent or guardian indicating \njoint liability for debt or the minor submits financial information \nindicating an independent means or an ability to repay the debt that \nthe card accrues.\n  The amendment would give parents who cosign for liability on their \nchild's credit card the opportunity to have some say in the credit \nlimit on the card.\n  Why is this amendment needed? Supporters of bankruptcy reform have \njustified this bill on the basis of personal responsibility. I agree \nwith that basic presumption. Responsible debtors should pay back the \ndebts they can afford to repay. The bill, however, must be balanced. If \nCongress really intends to tackle the surging tide of bankruptcy cases, \nour laws must enforce responsibility on the part of creditors as well.\n  One area where I think creditors must show more responsibility is the \nmarketing of credit cards to minors. For those under 18, there are some \nprotections. In each of the 50 States, juveniles under 18 lack the \nauthority to sign contracts with narrow exceptions. Thus, if a credit \ncard company issued a card to a 15-year-old, the company would not be \nable to legally enforce its debt in bankruptcy court.\n  Yet, there is a gaping loophole with respect to college students. It \nis almost impossible for students on campus to avoid credit card \noffers. Applications are stuffed in plastic bags at the campus \nbookstore, solicitations hang from bulletin boards, and credit card \nrepresentatives set up tables at student unions, enticing students with \nfree gifts.\n  Credit cards are increasingly pressed on college students, even those \nwith no income or no credit history. A parent's signature is not \nrequired. With their low monthly payments, these cards are very \nattractive to cash-strapped students and appear to impose little \nfinancial burden.\n  Minors today are getting credit cards at younger and younger ages. In \n1994, 66 percent of college students with at least one card received \ntheir first card before college or during their freshman year. In 1998, \n81 percent had received their first card by the end of their freshman \nyear.\n  The cards are attractive because minimum payments are typically low. \nHowever, if students just make the minimum payments, they get in way \nover their heads.\n  For example, if a student makes just a $25 minimum payment on a \n$1,500 line of credit, at 19.8 percent interest, it will take 282 \nmonths to pay off the debt.\n  Not surprisingly, with credit cards flooding college campuses, \nstudent debts are rising.\n  Nellie Mae, the student loan giant, found that 78 percent of \nundergraduate students who applied for credit-based loans with Nellie \nMae in the year 2000 had credit cards. This is up from 67 percent in \n1998.\n  Of the 78 percent of undergraduates who had credit cards in Nellie \nMae's Year 2000 study, the average student had three cards, with 32 \npercent having four or more credit cards.\n  The average debt of these credit-card owning undergraduates was \n$2,748. This is up from an average of $1,879 in Nellie Mae's 1998 \nstudy. Some 13 percent of these students had balances of $3,000 to \n$7,000 and 9 percent owed amounts exceeding $7,000.\n  Traditionally, American youth under 25 have contributed marginally to \nthe ranks of our nation's bankruptcy filers.\n  However, over the past 10 years, our youth have represented a larger \nand larger slice of those who file for bankruptcy.\n  In 1996, only 1 percent of personal bankruptcies were by those age 25 \nor younger. By 1998, that number had risen to almost 5 percent. In \n1999, a year later, the number rose to 6.8 percent of all bankruptcy \nfilers.\n  In committee, I was asked the question: What does this have to do \nwith bankruptcy? I would like to answer it. A seven times greater \npercentage of minors are filing for bankruptcy today than just 5 years \nago, and the great bulk of this is credit card debt.\n  Credit cards are a major factor in student and youth debt. For \nexample, at the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Denver, \nmore than half of all clients are ages 18 to 35. On average, they have \n30 percent more debt than all other age groups.\n  Let me give you a couple of examples of the runup of credit card debt \nthat has plagued so many unwary youth.\n  A USA Today article on February 13, 2001, describes the case of \nJennifer Massey. As a freshman at the University of Houston, Jennifer \nsigned up for a credit card. She got a free T-shirt. A year later, she \nhad piled on $20,000 in debt on 14 credit cards.\n  Another case: A young Mexican American from Los Angeles declared \nbankruptcy just last July after racking up $20,000 in credit card \nexpenses. Most of it was for clothes, dinners, and drinks with friends.\n  A West Virginia student saddled with student loans filled out \napplications for 10 major credit cards and was approved for every \nsingle one--showing no ability to repay that debt.\n  A youngster at Georgetown University fell into debt totaling over \n$10,000. Unable to make even the minimum payments, she had to turn to \nher parents in order to bail her out.\n  Alex, a college freshman, found himself over $5,000 in credit card \ndebt by the end of his first semester. His parents had to take out a \nloan to pay off his debt to the credit card company. When Alex \ngraduated in 1999, his family was still making payments on the loan to \npay off his debt from his freshman year.\n  Let me give you the case of Sean Moyer. He was a student at the \nUniversity of Oklahoma who ran up more than $10,000 in debt. The \ncrushing debt was one of the factors he cited before committing suicide \non February 7, 1998, at the age of 22.\n  Contrary to what you may hear from the opposition to this amendment, \nthis amendment is not about the right of an 18-year-old to get a credit \ncard. I have no problem with that. The concern is the unlimited credit \nthat the youngster can place on that card.\n  Like any other adult who seeks credit, a minor who has independent \nmeans to repay debts is entitled to credit based on his ability to pay. \nA minor with adequate resources, or with a parental cosigner, can get a \ncredit limit under this amendment of $5,000, $10,000, or $20,000.\n  I just want to say that this amendment places the $2,500 debt limit \non each credit card--not the combination of credit cards, but each \ncredit card. We think it is fair, and we think it is responsible.\n  During a recent ``60 Minutes II'' interview, sources in the credit \ncard industry stated that even if a student's application for credit \nindicates no source of income, the student still gets approved for \ncredit. The credit card company assumes that the student has other \nmeans to pay because they buy books, clothes, CDs, or that a parent is \ngoing to bail them out.\n  So without this amendment, credit card companies can continue to lend \nreckless amounts of money to college students that any reasonable \ninquiry into the student's financial status would indicate the student \ncould not afford. Then, when a student can't pay his or her debt, the \nlender can pressure the parent to assume the liability or use the full \npower of the bankruptcy court to recover the amount it is owed.\n\n[[Page S2037]]\n\n  The bankruptcy court should not be used as a collection agency for \nill-advised extensions of credit to college students by credit card \nlenders.\n\n  I also want to briefly discuss the section of this amendment that \nwould give a parent who cosigns for a credit card some measure of \ncontrol over future expansion of credit limits on the card. Under \ncurrent law, if a parent assumes joint liability for a credit card with \nhis or her minor child, the parent has no control over the debt limit \non the card. A credit card company can raise the debt limit without \nconsulting the parent. The credit card company can even raise the debt \nlimit if the parent expressly objects to any further increase.\n  Let me give you a case written up in the Los Angeles Times. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Times story be printed in the Record at the \nend of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1).\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This is the case of Dr. James Whitemore, a retired \nsurgeon from Carson, CA. When his son Quentin entered Cal-State \nDominguez Hill, Dr. Whitemore cosigned his son's application for credit \nwith the stipulation that the debt limit remain at $500. But without \nDr. Whitemore's knowledge, MBNA, the credit card issuer, raised his \nson's credit limit repeatedly until it finally reached $9,000. After \nseveral years, Quentin's balance reached $9,089 and MBNA determined his \naccount to be delinquent.\n  MBNA, then rediscovered Dr. Whitemore. After failing to contact the \ndoctor as it increased his son's liability, the company then demanded \nthat Dr. Whitemore assume responsibility for the debt as guarantor. I \nthink this is wrong. This amendment would correct that.\n  I also want to respond to those who question the link between credit \ncard debt and bankruptcy. All-purpose credit card debt is the most \nfrequently listed debt in bankruptcy files. Eighty-eight percent of the \ndebtors in bankruptcy have credit card debt of some kind.\n  According to a study by Harvard Professor Elizabeth Warren, the \nmedian debtors in bankruptcy are carrying six times higher credit card \ndebts than other cardholders.\n  Homeowners in the United States spend, on average, about $18 of every \n$100 of take-home pay for principal, interest, taxes, and insurance on \ntheir mortgage payments. A family spending more than $28 is considered \nhouse poor. Median debtors in bankruptcy owe $47 of each $100 of income \nto their credit card.\n  Experts who testified before Congress on this issue have linked the \nshare rise in consumer debt and the corresponding rise in consumer \nbankruptcy to lower credit standards.\n  As I have said, today, a seven times greater percentage of youth go \nthrough bankruptcy than did 5 years ago. So this is clearly a problem \nthat is increasing.\n  I don't believe minors should have their credit histories ruined when \nthey take their first steps as adults; nor should we put parents in the \nposition of having to bail out their kids to protect their kids' future \ncredit rating. A credit card limit, per card, of $2,500, I believe, is \nprudent and wise. If a youngster wants to go beyond that, they have to \nshow that they can pay it back or, secondly, have a parent or guardian \ncosign.\n  I am very pleased to join with Senator Jeffords and Senator Durbin in \npresenting this amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Jan. 17, 1999]\n\n                   Son's Debt Plagues Dad for 7 Years\n\n                           (By Kenneth Reich)\n\n       Guaranteeing a credit card for a child about to go off to \n     college is fairly common, but it seldom generates as much \n     trouble as it did for Dr. James H. Whitmore, a retired \n     surgeon from Carson.\n       He has been through a seven-year drama that is not over \n     yet.\n       When his son, Quentin Whitmore, entered Cal State Dominguez \n     Hills in 1992, he wanted him to have a credit card. This is \n     natural, since even if, as in this case, the child is going \n     to be close to home, the parent knows he will be more on his \n     own and may need emergency financial resources.\n       And so, after some exploring, Whitmore agreed to co-sign \n     his son's application with MBNA of Wilmington, Del. ``This I \n     did with the stipulation that his credit limit be $500,'' he \n     recalls.\n       At first, all went well. Quentin Whitmore was making small \n     payments on the card out of the allowances his dad gave him.\n       But then, without ever notifying his dad, MBNA, which \n     describes itself as ``the largest independent credit card \n     lender in the world with $59.6 billion in loans,'' repeatedly \n     raised young Whitmore's credit limit. It finally hit $9,000.\n       By the end of 1996, the balance on the card, including late \n     charges, reached $9,089, and MBNA declared the account \n     delinquent. It informed Whitmore Sr. that he owed that amount \n     as guarantor.\n       The doctor refused to pay. As MBNA put the sum out for \n     collection and subsequently entered a bad credit report \n     against both father and son, Whitmore insisted he had never \n     authorized raising the limit and therefore was not \n     responsible for the debts on the card above $500. He did send \n     in $500.\n       I asked Whitmore whether he wasn't teed off at his son too.\n       ``I remonstrated with my son and guess what happened?'' he \n     said. ``His grades went from A's to nothing. One entire year \n     was wasted.''\n       Quentin Whitmore, now 24 and still a Dominguez Hills \n     student, explained it this way:\n       ``When I received the credit raises, I assumed [my father] \n     had approved them. I never thought to call him, because at \n     the outset MBNA had agreed not to raise the limits unless he \n     gave his approval.''\n       A Quicken survey last year revealed nearly half of college \n     students bounce checks, 71% of those with cards fail to pay \n     off balances monthly and most estimate that they will have \n     $15,000 in debt before graduation. So young Whitmore's \n     extravagance, or needs, may not be that unusual.\n       I asked MBNA whether it would acknowledge a mistake in \n     raising young Whitmore's limit so high.\n       That was indeed a mistake, said Brian Dalphon, a MBNA \n     senior vice president. He said his credit account was never \n     coded as either a student or a guarantor account, as it \n     should have been.\n       ``When we assign a credit line to a student, it's at a \n     lower limit, initially $500 [as in Whitmore's case],'' he \n     explained. ``And we're very conservative with it. We don't \n     raise the limits very quickly. A typical credit line for a \n     student remains at $500 to $1,000.''\n       When Dr. Whitmore was first billed as the guarantor, \n     however, he was unsuccessful for months in resisting. \n     Finally, the Los Angeles County Consumer Affairs Department \n     agreed to intervene for him.\n       Timothy Bissell, the agency's assistant director, observed, \n     ``As a matter of contract law, MBNA could not hold him \n     responsible for a higher amount than $500 unless they had \n     notified him they were raising the credit limit.''\n\n                                 * * *\n\n       On Oct. 27, 1997, 10 months after trying to bill Dr. \n     Whitmore, MBNA First Vice President Edward Matthews informed \n     the department that the doctor was being absolved of \n     responsibility for the debt above $500 and that a bad \n     reference was being stricken from his credit file.\n       ``I apologize for any inconvenience Dr. Whitmore has been \n     caused by this situation,'' he wrote. ``Due to a keying error \n     when the account was established in 1992, the account \n     received automatic credit line increases until December 1996 \n     as a result of Quentin Whitmore's previous satisfactory \n     payment history.''\n       But, at that time, the nature of the keying error was left \n     obscure. And the ``satisfactory payment history'' was left \n     undetailed.\n       The Whitmores say the delinquency took the better part of a \n     year to develop, after payment requests far outstripped young \n     Whitmore's ability to pay.\n       Quentin Whitmore's account has now been closed, Dalphon \n     said.\n       But, Dr. Whitmore said, his son will keep his bad credit \n     rating for several years, and six months ago, when the senior \n     Whitmore last checked, he said he found his own credit record \n     still impaired.\n       MBNA proposed 18 months ago to forgive 50% of Quentin \n     Whitmore's balance if he agreed to pay monthly installments \n     of $378.\n       But Dr. Whitmore said his son ``has absolutely no income'' \n     as he continues his studies.\n       ``So I called them and told them that if they would remove \n     all the late charges, the excess limit charges and reduce \n     this to the absolute minimum that he originally charged, then \n     I would negotiate a settlement with them under these \n     conditions and pay them off myself, But they refused.''\n       Dalphon declined to say whether MBNA continues to try to \n     collect.\n       Dr. Whitmore remains unhappy.\n       ``I do not feel that MBNA's hands are clean in this \n     matter,'' he said. ``If the limits on this account had not \n     been raised, then my son would not have been able to abuse \n     it. If what the credit card companies are doing to our youth \n     before they can develop a sense of financial responsibility \n     is legal, then new laws are needed.''\n       But, of course, MBNA denies its policy is to raise limits \n     on students. It maintains that what happened was another of \n     these electronic glitches I sometimes write about.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment we are now discussing and \nthat I have offered on behalf of myself and over 30 cosponsors \naddresses an important problem that is being felt this winter all \nacross America. High energy costs have hit low-income and working \nAmericans hard this winter, and this coming summer promises to be just \nas expensive in many parts of our country.\n  The high heating bills this winter are the result of a combination of \ntwo primary factors: First, higher demand resulting from colder than \naverage\n\n[[Page S2039]]\n\nweather across the country, we have just seen another major snowstorm \nin the Northeast, and second, a supply shortfall that stems from lack \nof drilling 2 years ago when the oil and gas prices were so low.\n  The combination of these two factors has resulted in natural gas and \npropane bills that are as much as 200 percent higher this year than \nthey were last year. Heating oil prices have been well above last \nyear's average as well. Natural gas prices and tight generating \ncapacity are driving up electricity prices around the country. Of \ncourse, California is the area of our country that has gotten the most \nattention in this regard, but electricity prices in other parts of the \ncountry have also escalated.\n  We can predict now that many people in southern States will be \nespecially burdened this summer because of the high cost of trying to \nmaintain air-conditioning.\n  Applications for energy assistance have increased dramatically this \nyear. Over 5 million households in the United States may be unable to \npay their energy bills this winter. That is a figure that is up \nsubstantially from last year. The State-by-State increase in caseloads \ncoming from assistance requests is illustrated on this chart that is \nprovided by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.\n  When one looks at some of the figures on this chart, the point I am \nmaking becomes very clear. The chart is titled, ``Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, Increase in Caseloads'' as of the First of \nMarch.\n  As of the first of March, the increase in caseloads in my State this \nyear over last year is 100 percent. We have twice as many people \nrequesting assistance. In Oklahoma, it is 50 percent above last year. \nIn Louisiana, it is 91 percent above last year. In Mississippi, it is \n50 percent above last year. I can go all around this chart and one can \nsee the increases different States have experienced. There are over 20 \nStates reporting increases greater than 26 percent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the survey detailing the \ncritical situation we have in each of our States be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, many consumers who cannot pay their \nenergy bills have been protected so far by the so-called cutoff laws. \nThose are laws which prohibit utility companies from terminating \nservice to customers during the winter. But these prohibitions against \nterminating utility service expire in March or in April, and when they \ndo, the seriousness of the situation for low-income working Americans \nwill become harshly obvious to all of us.\n  According to a recent survey by the National Council of State \nLegislators, 18 States have extended income eligibility limits because \nso many people just above the current thresholds are struggling to pay \ntheir utility bills. Thirty-one States either have already increased or \nhope to increase benefit levels in an effort to keep net costs to those \nin need at the same level as in previous winters. Many States have \nexpressed a serious need for additional funds to extend eligibility and \nbenefit levels.\n\n  The reality is that many States have already depleted their LIHEAP \nand weatherization funding, the funding that we appropriated for these \nprograms in the last year. Without additional funds, assistance to low-\nincome working families for the summer cooling season is going to be \nimpossible.\n  People tend to forget the severe toll the summer heat takes on many \npeople in this country, particularly on our senior citizens. Just last \nyear, the State of Texas was forced to impose a moratorium on utilities \ncutting off service during the summer. Usually there is a moratorium \nagainst cutting off utility service during the winter, but Texas was \nforced to impose it in the summer.\n  According to the Austin American Statesman of August 11, 2000:\n\n       With 54 heat-related deaths across Texas this summer, the \n     state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday stopped \n     electric companies from shutting off service for nonpayment \n     until the end of September. The commission wanted to prevent \n     any more deaths because fans or air conditioners were just \n     not used for fear of high bills.\n\n  The Texas experience last summer was especially heartbreaking in its \nmagnitude--54 deaths. But this was not the first time this circumstance \nhas occurred and it will not be the last.\n\n  The chairman of the Texas commission lamented the fact that the \nprocess had taken so long. A moratorium on disconnections helps with \nthe immediate problem of no service, but it does not address the bill \nthat will eventually have to be paid by each of these families.\n  Many who remember the days of childhood without air-conditioning \nforget the fact that most of us, including myself, did not live in the \nmidst of concrete cities. These cities have been referred to as modern-\nday heat islands. During the summer, not just in the Southern States, \nit is our parents and grandparents who are most vulnerable during heat \nwaves. Unfortunately, many seniors living on fixed incomes often \nconsider air-conditioning a luxury, not a health necessity.\n  This is not a partisan issue. The provisions of this amendment are \nthe same or very similar to those contained in the bill introduced by \nSenator Murkowski, the same bill the majority leader cosponsored last \nweek when he declared his support for LIHEAP on the Senate floor. But, \nhe declared his support for it as part of a broader package that will \nnot be brought to the floor until several months in the future.\n  I hope the vision of a one-shot comprehensive energy bill does not \ncause delay our acting on such an immediate need, especially when human \nlives are at stake. Especially given the administration has been saying \nit will not even have a proposal to us for several more months. It \nseems every time they report on their progress it is to report the 2-\nmonth clock is starting again. Clearly, they are working in good faith \non a comprehensive bill or comprehensive set of proposals for dealing \nwith our long-term energy problems, but that does not relieve us of the \nresponsibility to deal with this immediate problem and to deal with it \nnow.\n  I support taking a comprehensive look at energy. I think it is \nimportant to have a balanced framework in order to evaluate the various \ntradeoffs. In fact, I am working with colleagues in the Senate to put \nsuch a bill together. My experience is the last time the Congress \npassed a major energy bill, the Energy Policy Act of 1992, it took an \nentire Congress and it resulted in a Christmas tree with several strong \nbranches on which to hang many ornaments, a tremendous number of which \nwere never implemented and were never funded by the Congress.\n  That is not the best approach to take in dealing with this immediate \nproblem. Energy issues are complex, they often involve billions of \ndollars of investment, in very long-lived capital equipment. We need to \nfocus on manageable sections in the interest of developing the best \npolicy outcomes based on a common set of principles.\n  I have a chart that shows what I consider to be fundamental \nprinciples for a long-term energy policy. I want to make the point that \nthis amendment I am now talking about, and urging my colleagues to \nconsider, is not an alternative to a long-term bill, but is consistent \nwith such a framework. It is only distinct in that we are dealing with \nan immediate problem.\n  These are some common principles that need to be dealt with for a \nsuccessful long-term energy strategy. Let me briefly mention them.\n  First, we need a new model of Federal-State cooperation to ensure \nreliable and affordable energy supplies. If we had had better \ncoordination in the past, perhaps we would not be needing to consider \nthe amendment I have brought up today. That we don't have them in place \nis not the fault of the federal government or that of any individual \nstate. By their very definition, restructured markets have changed the \nvery framework upon which many of our energy policies and institutions \nwere based.\n\n  Second, fuel and technology diversity need to be increased and \nemphasized. We need to have improved distribution systems for energy.\n  Third, we need to have a balance of supply-and-demand-side options \nwith a commitment to efficiency, environmental quality and climate \nchange mitigation.\n\n[[Page S2040]]\n\n  Fourth, we need targeted tax and economic incentives to address \nmarket failures. We all recognize there are market failures, there are \ninefficiencies in the market.\n  Finally, we have to have comprehensive research and development in \norder to ensure a full complement of technologies and fuels to meet our \nenergy needs.\n  All five of these items are principles for a long term policy. We are \ngoing to propose a set of provisions that incorporate those principles \nin the larger bill I mentioned before. But, we have immediate needs for \nenergy assistance that cannot wait for months while we debate the very \nreal energy issues this country faces.\n  It was well recognized at the time we passed the appropriations bill \nlast year that LIHEAP funding was going to be inadequate to do the job \nin this current year. Individuals, families, and small businesses that \nare suffering today from energy bills they cannot pay cannot just wait \nwhile we debate a long term energy policy. We should not wait. To \nborrow a catch phrase from President Bush, they need an immediate \nhelping hand.\n  The amendment I am offering today takes the first concrete steps in \nproviding that hand, that assistance, the first concrete steps to put \nmeasures in place to address this remainder of this winter's financial \ndistress and to deal with the high cost of electricity that we can all \nsee coming at us this summer.\n  The amendment raises the authorized limits governing the low-income \nhome energy assistance program, raising the limit to alleviate \nfinancial burdens on low- and middle-income families in the near term. \nAt present, it is only authorized in fiscal year 2001 at the $2 billion \nlevel. That is a base level that has been relatively flat since the \nmid-1980s--just to show how long we have gone without any change in \nthis authorization.\n  The amendment raises the base funding requirement to $3.4 billion for \nfiscal year 2001, each of the fiscal years 2001 to 2005. The increase \ncomes close to addressing the erosion in the program due to inflation \nsince President Reagan was in the White House.\n  The amendment also gives States additional flexibility in this fiscal \nyear on income levels for recipients by increasing eligibility from 150 \npercent of poverty to 200 percent of poverty. This change only applies \nfor the remainder of this fiscal year but will give States the \nflexibility to help working families and senior citizens with whatever \nadditional funds we can send to those States. This adjustment is at the \nrequest of many of our States.\n  Third, the amendment raises the authorization levels for this fiscal \nyear and succeeding years for the low-income weatherization program and \nthe State conservation and emergency planning grants. The immediate \nincrease in the authorization for the weatherization program of $310 \nmillion is for the remainder of this fiscal year and the fiscal year \n2002 compared to the current appropriations level of $162 million. The \nweatherization program is a sound and long-term investment in energy \nefficiency. A one-time investment of weatherization yields savings of \n$300 to $470 per household annually thereafter. This program, however, \nrequires trained staff. Erratic and insufficient funding of the \nweatherization program has diminished its effectiveness in recent \nyears.\n  Increased energy efficiency is the least cost solution to meeting our \nenergy needs. The weatherization program was funded at nearly three \ntimes the current level in the 1980s. This amendment will increase the \nweatherization authorization in an attempt to catch up with the 1980s \nlevel in real dollars.\n  The fourth thing this amendment does is increase the authorization \nfor grants to State energy programs up to $75 million. This program \nfunds State conservation and emergency planning. The extremely low \nlevel of funding in recent years has diminished the State's ability to \nimplement State level conservation plans and to plan for emergencies in \ncoordination with the Department of Energy and with neighboring States.\n  I cannot overemphasize how critical it is to have better coordination \nof overall energy planning and emergency response preparedness. The \npower situation in the western states is just the most recent example \nof where better regional planning could have reduced costs and provided \ngreater reliability. Heating oil markets in the northeast and gasoline \nsupply problems in the midwest last summer are just a few examples of \nwhere a little more advanced preparedness could have reduced disruption \nand impact on consumers. I would note that for all the lamenting the \nlack of an energy policy on the part of many members of this body, it \nwas the Republican majority that eliminated coordinated emergency \nplanning from the Department of Energy budget in 1995.\n  I urge the Congress to enact these amendments and to encourage the \nPresident to propose an emergency supplemental bill for these programs. \nLet's stop debating form over substance and get it done now.\n  We all know that even if we adopt the amendment I have sent to the \ndesk, it will only increase the authorization levels for these \nprograms. We still need the funding. I very much hope the President \nwill take the lead in requesting the increased funding from this \nCongress so we can actually send the assistance to the States and it \ncan go to the families who need it.\n  Finally, my amendment contains a package of provisions aimed at \nquickly increasing the energy efficiency of Federal facilities around \nthe country. Many of these facilities are very wasteful in their use of \nenergy and water--two commodities that could be in short supply this \nsummer in many parts of the country. Federal agencies spend $4 billion \nper year to heat, cool, and power their facilities. Too much of that is \nwasted. If federal agencies aggressively reduce their energy waste, \ntheir neighbors will enjoy the benefits of increased supplies of \nelectricity, and taxpayers will benefit by paying less for the power \nthat would have been wasted. Under an existing Executive order, federal \nfacilities are required to increase energy efficiency by 30 percent by \n2005 and 35 percent by 2010 relative to 1985, but there is some \nevidence that this Executive order is not being aggressively \nimplemented.\n  This amendment calls for a concerted effort by facility managers to \nmeet the Executive order targets early, thereby saving taxpayer \ndollars, reducing stress on the power grid and demand for fuels. \nSpecifically, my amendment calls for each Federal agency to complete a \ncomprehensive review this fiscal year of all practicable measures for \nincreasing energy and water conservation and using renewable energy \nsources.\n  The agencies then have 180 days to implement measures to achieve 50 \npercent of the potential savings identified in their reviews. That \ncould result in a measurable reduction in federal energy consumption by \nthis time next year, if we get started now.\n  Federal agencies could also use this authority to investigate siting \nnew generating capacity at their facilities, to further ease stress in \nour power system this summer. We won't be building many new central \nelectricity generating stations before the summer, but we could start \ninstalling a lot of distributed generation at Federal facilities, \nparticularly proven technologies such as ground-source heat pumps, that \ncould dramatically reduce the power requirements for heating and \ncooling Federal buildings.\n  My amendment also makes it easier for federal agencies to use \npartnering tools with the private sector, known as energy savings \nperformance contracts (or ESPCs), to reduce energy costs through \nfacility upgrade and replacement. ESPCs offer perhaps the fastest means \nfor rapidly improving the efficiency of the existing building stock \nowned by Federal agencies.\n  These are targeted measures that will help relieve the immediate \nneeds of our citizens who cannot cope with the high energy bills this \nwinter, and provide incentives for the Federal government to do its \npart to decrease energy consumption now.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n National Energy Assistance Director's Association State-by-State Low-\n  Income Home Energy Assistance Program Survey Responses (February 7, \n                                 2001)\n\n\n                                alabama\n\n       The Alabama LIHEAP program estimates it will award regular \n     benefits to 6.9% more\n\n[[Page S2041]]\n\n     households this year (75,000 vs. 70,146). Although higher \n     benefits are being provided to those households that heat \n     with propane or natural gas, more is needed since the cost of \n     these fuels has already risen 50-65%. Alabama continues to \n     provide weatherization and furnace repair services as part of \n     its crisis program.\n\n\n                               california\n\n       Requests for assistance by phone are running almost 60% \n     higher than last year at this time. California's natural gas \n     prices have risen 40-50% this year, but definitive \n     information is not yet available on electricity rates \n     statewide. The state's LIHEAP program allows the maximum \n     eligibility criteria of 60% of sate median income and plans \n     to increase the benefit levels for this year's eligible \n     households in response to significant increases in natural \n     gas and electricity prices. Supplemental funds are needed to \n     increase both the benefit levels and the number of households \n     served. Additional funding is also needed to increase the \n     furnace repair and replacement programs.\n\n\n                                colorado\n\n       Colorado expects to serve 41% more households this year \n     than last (75,000 vs. 53,182). Program benefit levels have \n     been increased by 125%, while eligibility has been expanded \n     from 150% to 185% of the federal poverty guidelines. Natural \n     gas and propane have doubled in price and the state's largest \n     natural gas provider recently asked the Public Utilities \n     Commission for another increase of about 5%. These increases \n     have placed unreasonable burdens on low-income households, as \n     well as those whose income is slightly over the current \n     eligibility criteria. Colorado needs additional funds to \n     increase eligibility to 200% of the federal poverty level, \n     increase the benefit amount, increase outreach to ensure \n     needy households are aware of the program, and increase \n     funding for weatherization and the summer grants program \n     operated by the Colorado Energy Assistance Foundation.\n\n\n                              connecticut\n\n       Connecticut estimates it will provide LIHEAP benefits to \n     21% more households this year (68,000 vs. 56,340). According \n     to representatives from the natural gas companies, prices are \n     currently 39% higher this year and the State LIHEAP program \n     reports oil prices are running 34.6% higher than last year. \n     This year income limits for LIHEAP eligibility were raised to \n     60% of the State median income for all fuel types, as \n     compared to last year's limit of 150% of the federal poverty \n     income guidelines. All benefit amounts have also been \n     increased. Additionally, $400,000 has been set aside for \n     furnace repairs and/or replacements for households whose \n     heating systems are determined to be unsafe or inoperable. \n     Supplemental funding is needed in order to expand the \n     application period. The program currently pays for fuel \n     beginning November 1st, but would like to change that date to \n     October 15th (the date when landlords are required to begin \n     providing heat) and extend the last date for fuel to April \n     15th (the end of the utility moratorium).\n\n\n                                delaware\n\n       Delaware expects a 12.6% increase in the number of regular \n     benefits awarded (11,500 vs. 10,215) and a 6.9% increase in \n     the number of households receiving crisis assistance (from \n     2,807 to 3,000), although these numbers do not include the \n     summer cooling assistance program. Regular LIHEAP benefits \n     have increased an average of 20% (from $206 to $241). Some \n     households also receive up to $400 from the crisis program, \n     although the average is $200. Eligibility for the regular \n     program has remained at 150% of the federal poverty \n     guidelines, but crisis eligibility guidelines were increased \n     to 200% of poverty. In order to respond to numerous inquiries \n     the state has received requesting assistance with furnace \n     repairs/replacements, additional funding is needed.\n\n\n                                georgia\n\n       The number of households assisted by Georgia's LIHEAP \n     program is expected to double this year (120,000 vs. 60,710). \n     LIHEAP eligibility has been expanded to 150% of the federal \n     poverty guidelines and may be further increased to 60% of the \n     state median income. The amount currently provided to \n     households does not have a significant impact--the maximum \n     $194 benefit cannot fill a propane tank so the household \n     cannot benefit from energy assistance unless they are \n     prepared to supplement the balance. All LIHEAP funds have \n     been utilized for direct financial client benefit services \n     due to the colder than usual temperatures and the rapidly \n     rising fuel prices. Additional funding is needed to serve \n     more households and keep the program open longer, as well as \n     provide supplemental and crisis payments.\n\n\n                                florida\n\n       Florida expects to serve 23% more clients this winter \n     season than last year (42,500 vs. 34,393). In addition, the \n     state is expecting to provide assistance this summer to an \n     additional 31,000 clients for cooling assistance, about the \n     same level as last year. Natural gas prices have increased by \n     about 110%, while electricity prices at one utility have \n     increased by 15.5%. Florida has increased its benefit level \n     from a maximum of $300 to $1,000 per household. In addition, \n     Florida is providing assistance to restore home power, \n     including: paying deposits, late fees and reconnect fees; \n     purchasing and/or repairing of non-portable heating \n     equipment; repairing or replacing unsafe fuel oil or propane \n     tanks; and paying fees required to assure the continuation or \n     resumption of services. At the current rate of demand for \n     services, the state expects to be out of funds by the end of \n     March with little or no funds available for summer cooling. \n     Additional funds would be used to address unmet needs and to \n     continue providing services through the summer which is \n     typically the state's peak demand time.\n\n\n                                 idaho\n\n       The number of households served by Idaho's LIHEAP program \n     is expected to increase by 31% (30,930 vs. 23,529); average \n     benefits are expected to increase by 14%. Fuel prices \n     increased for natural gas by 48%; electricity by 6% and home \n     heating oil by 40%. Although no change has been made to the \n     LIHEAP income eligibility criteria (133% of federal poverty \n     guidelines), this year the program application period will be \n     extended to May 31st (rather than March 31st). Supplemental \n     funding is needed to serve these additional eligible \n     households, as well as to finance weatherization activities.\n\n\n                                illinois\n\n       The number of households served by Illinois' LIHEAP program \n     is expected to increase by 41% (350,000 vs. 247,000). Prices \n     for natural gas, electricity, kerosene and electricity have \n     increased from 2 to 4 times depending on the utility \n     provider. The state has increased benefits increased by 35% \n     and increased eligibility to 150%. If additional funding were \n     available, the state would probably expand the program's \n     eligibility and benefit levels.\n\n\n                                  iowa\n\n       In Iowa approximately 21% more households have been \n     certified and approved than last year at this time (75,000 \n     vs. 62,000). Last year the average residential customer spent \n     $354 on their total gas bill for the period November through \n     March. It is projected the same customer will spend $807 for \n     the same period this year. Although the average LIHEAP \n     benefit has increased from $204 to $306, an additional $351 \n     per household is needed in order for this year's \n     participating households to have the same percentage of their \n     total household income going towards winter gas bills as last \n     year's participating households.\n       Iowa conducted a survey of last year's LIHEAP recipients to \n     determine what these households do when faced with \n     unaffordable bills. Over 20 percent reported going without \n     needed medical care or prescription drugs in order to pay \n     their heating bills and 12 percent reported without food in \n     order to pay those same bills. The report, Iowa's Cold \n     Winters: LIHEAP Recipient Perspective, documents an \n     affordability crisis that existed prior to this year's rising \n     fuel costs.\n       Last winter, LIHEAP recipients experienced winter home \n     heating burdens of 8.2 percent on average--this figure does \n     not include winter non-heat electric burdens. Heating costs \n     represent approximately 40% of a household's total energy \n     bill. Last winter, the LIHEAP program was able to reduce the \n     average heating burden of 8.2% to 3.5% of total household \n     income. For comparison, the typical non-low income \n     household's heating burden is less than 2%. In order for this \n     year's participating households to have the same percentage \n     of their total household income going towards winter gas \n     bills as last year's participating households, the Iowa \n     LIHEAP program needs an additional $20.5 million.\n       To date, approximately 2,000 applications statewide that \n     are not eligible for any benefit because the household was \n     just over our income guidelines. Many of these households are \n     elderly Iowans whose recent Social Security increase put them \n     a few dollars a month over our maximum allowable income. \n     These same households report tremendous out-of-pocket \n     medical/prescription drug costs coupled with home energy \n     bills they simply cannot afford without making extreme \n     sacrifices. Federal rules would allow LIHEAP to increase our \n     income guidelines from 150% of the federal poverty level to \n     185%. Unfortunately, this option cannot be considered at this \n     time. In the absence of additional funding, the state plan's \n     to continue to give, on average, a benefit of $306 to all \n     eligible households that apply, and at some point in the \n     future determine what if any supplemental payment we might be \n     able to make.\n\n\n                                 kansas\n\n       Kansas expects to serve 18% more households this year \n     (31,000 vs. 26,143). LIHEAP benefits have been increased by \n     31% to help offset the burden of higher gas prices--which are \n     now more than double last year's rates. Supplemental funding \n     is needed to provide benefits to additional eligible clients \n     and bring the energy burdens of Kansas households to a \n     manageable range.\n\n\n                                 maine\n\n       The number of households assisted by Maine's LIHEAP program \n     is expecting to increase by 32% from (58,000 vs. 44,000). The \n     state has already received 65,000 applicants this year, \n     however they only have adequate funds to serve 58,000. As a \n     result of the 40% increase in fuel costs this year, LIHEAP \n     eligible households are utilizing the available funds so \n     quickly the state is unable to \n     handle the demand and all resources have \n     been obligated. Unfortunately, the state has \n     been forced to decrease funding for weatherizataion services, \n     furnace repair, and administration. The income guidelines \n     were increased from 125% of the federal poverty guidelines to \n     175% and the average benefit was decreased from $490 to $350 \n     in order to\n\n[[Page S2042]]\n\n     serve the additional households this change would create. \n     Maine desperately needs additional funds to increase fuel \n     assistance benefits, increase emergency funding, and provide \n     for furnace repair or replacement.\n\n\n                             MASSACHUSETTS\n\n       The number of households assisted by Massachusetts' LIHEAP \n     program is expecting to increase by 9% (123,000 vs. 113,408). \n     Last year, LIHEAP eligibility limits were raised to 200% of \n     the federal poverty guidelines and benefits were extended to \n     households with incomes up to 60% of state median income that \n     heat with oil or propane. If the household's consumption \n     exceeds the threshold established for the fuel type, 50% is \n     added to the excess over the threshold or the high energy \n     benefit, whichever is greater, is added to the regular \n     benefit.\n       Oil prices in Massachusetts have risen by 36%, electricity \n     by 42% and natural gas by 39%, with additional rate increases \n     proposed. Massachusetts operates weatherization programs, \n     system repair and replacement programs and conservation \n     programs funded by the utilities through the legislative act \n     on utility restructure. These are operated through a network \n     of programs in the community action agencies throughout the \n     state. Individual agencies distribute blankets but it is not \n     a statewide coordinated effort as is the weatherization \n     program.\n\n\n                                MICHIGAN\n\n       The number of households served in Michigan's LIHEAP \n     program has increased by 24% through December 31. At the \n     current rate of increase, the state is expected to serve \n     almost 362,000 this year vs. 291,831 last year. Energy prices \n     have increased significantly, heating oil by 70% and propane \n     by 100%. However our three largest natural gas vendors have \n     had no increase due to rules by the Public Service \n     Commission. Those rules will be lifted this spring and we \n     expect at least 40% to 60% increase in the cost of natural \n     gas. Benefit caps have been increased twice since the start \n     of the winter heating season.\n\n\n                               MINNESOTA\n\n       Minnesota's LIHEAP caseload is projected to increase by 10% \n     (107,000 vs. 96,924). Eligibility has remained at 50% of the \n     state median income, although benefits have been increased \n     from an average of $415 in FY 2000 to $475 this year. This \n     resulted in an increase to the maximum assistance from $900 \n     to $1,200. Natural gas prices have risen 304%, propane costs \n     are up 73% and oil is 27% higher. Weatherization and furnace \n     repair continue to be offered. The state needs additional \n     funding to increase benefits since the increases previously \n     provided barely make a dent in the bills experienced by \n     Minnesota households this year.\n\n\n                             NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n       New Hampshire LIHEAP program is expected to serve almost \n     20% more households than it did last year (27,500 vs. \n     23,081). Applications for assistance are running 31% higher \n     than last year and the number of requests for requests for \n     emergency assistance have increased by 88%. Funds previously \n     set-aside for weatherization and administration have been \n     redirected to client benefits as a result of the critical \n     need this winter season.\n       Last year the income eligibility criteria was expanded to \n     60% of the state median income, which has also been retained \n     this year. Had this not occurred, approximately 3,000 \n     families who received LIHEAP benefits last year at the higher \n     eligibility level would have suffered. The basic benefit \n     matrix was increased by 65% so that benefits now range from \n     $240 to $1200. Given that the projected need far outweighs \n     available funding, New Hampshire is in serious need of \n     additional LIHEAP funding to ensure the program will be able \n     to serve all eligible households seeking assistance. As of \n     January 12, 2001, 2,967 households had already exhausted \n     their program benefits, so additional funding is also needed \n     increase benefit amounts. Finally, additional funding is \n     needed to restore program components currently suspended, \n     including weatherization.\n\n\n                               new jersey\n\n       New Jersey expects to serve almost 25% more households this \n     year (150,000 vs. 120,000). In addition, 55,182 elderly and/\n     or disabled households with incomes over the LIHEAP \n     eligibility limit, but under the income cap for the state \n     funded supplemental Lifeline utility assistance program, \n     received a one time benefit of either $100 (electric heat) or \n     $215 (gas, oil or propane heat). The state has recently \n     raised its income eligibility limit to 175% of poverty. The \n     state is considering a number of options for the additional \n     emergency funds received, one of which includes higher income \n     eligibility.\n\n\n                               new mexico\n\n       New Mexico expects to serve almost double the number of \n     households this year (80,000 vs. 48,405). Natural gas prices \n     have risen 20% since last year, while kerosene/propane has \n     increased by 200%. Because of the increase in applicants, \n     grant payments were not increased, however, the program did \n     provide an emergency payment for oil and bulk propane in \n     addition to the regular payment in order to purchase the same \n     amount of fuel. Additional funds are needed to serve the \n     increasing number of applicants and provide supplemental or \n     second benefits to offset the tremendous price increases. \n     Although the Native American tribes in New Mexico receive \n     their own LIHEAP allocation, the state is also concerned \n     about helping the tribes serve additional eligible households \n     in their jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                new york\n\n       The percentage of households served by New York State's \n     LIHEAP program is expected to increase by 18% (818,000 vs. \n     691,500). Last February, New York expanded its LIHEAP income \n     eligibility criteria to 60% of the state median income, which \n     has been retained for FY 2001. The regular benefit was \n     increased by $50 and, as of January 2001, a second emergency \n     benefit is now allowed. The program continues to provide \n     weatherization, furnace repair and furnace replacement. \n     Additional funding is needed in order to provide a second \n     regular benefit to offset the rising energy burdens felt by \n     New York residents. 691,500 regular benefits Emergency \n     program? 195,500 emergency benefits were issued.\n\n\n                              north dakota\n\n       North Dakota expects to serve 15% more households in its \n     regular and emergency LIHEAP programs this year. The state \n     has increased the program eligibility criteria from 150% of \n     poverty to 60% of the state's median income and has continued \n     its weatherization and furnace replacement programs. \n     Residents have seen the cost of natural gas rise by 29%, \n     propane by 40% and heating oil by 47%. If prices remain high, \n     the state will need a 40% increase in funds to maintain \n     program benefit levels. So far, state spending for winter \n     home heating benefits is running 92% higher than last year at \n     this time.\n\n\n                                  ohio\n\n       The percentage of households assisted by Ohio's LIHEAP \n     program is expected to increase by about 15% in the regular \n     program (224,700 vs. 195,380) and emergency programs (126,000 \n     vs. 109,656) this year. The benefit levels of both program \n     components have been increased to help offset the increases \n     in home heating costs. Natural gas prices have increased \n     between 35 and 50% this year, as have propane and oil. \n     Additional funding is needed to expand the income guidelines \n     from 150% of the federal poverty guidelines to 60% of the \n     state median income, which would greatly increase the number \n     of potential applicants and enable the state to assist those \n     who are not currently served but whose energy burdens have \n     skyrocketed.\n\n\n                                oklahoma\n\n       Oklahoma is expecting an increase of 50% in the number of \n     households served this year (86,000 vs. 57,300) although \n     income eligibility remains at 110% of the federal poverty \n     guidelines. Oklahoma's LIHEAP program reports natural gas \n     prices have almost doubled and an additional $23 million is \n     needed just to maintain the same out-of-pocket expense to the \n     low and fixed income clients. December 2000 had the coldest \n     average temperature in recorded history in Oklahoma.\n\n\n                                 oregon\n\n       The caseload in Oregon's LIHEAP program is expected to rise \n     by 82% this year (88,547 vs. 48,547). Although there has been \n     no increase in benefits and no changes to the eligibility \n     criteria, an emergency payment was authorized for oil and \n     bulk propane in addition to the regular payment so that \n     households could purchase the same amount of fuel that the \n     benefits would have purchased last year. The contingency \n     funds previously targeted for weatherization have been \n     redirected to client benefits instead. There has been a \n     significant increase in the demand for benefits this year and \n     additional funds are needed to accommodate this, as well as \n     to provide additional crisis benefits to clients who heat \n     with oil or bulk propane.\n\n\n                              pennsylvania\n\n       The percentage of households assisted by Pennsylvania's \n     regular LIHEAP program is expecting to increase by almost 32 \n     percent (280,750 vs. 213,032). Applications for crisis \n     assistance are also expected to increase by a similar \n     percentage (101,500 vs. 76,700). Income eligibility in \n     Pennsylvania's LIHEAP program was increased from 110% to 135% \n     of the federal poverty guidelines and the maximum crisis \n     award is up from $250 to $400. As a result of the contingency \n     funds awarded to Pennsylvania this year, applications will \n     continue to be accepted until April 30th, the maximum crisis \n     benefit will be increased to $700 and the crisis eligibility \n     will be expanded to 150% of the poverty level. Pennsylvania \n     residents have seen the price of deliverable fuels rise by \n     50% and gas by 40%. Additional funding is needed to expand \n     the eligibility criteria for all applicants to 150% of the \n     federal poverty guidelines, increase benefits to offset the \n     higher energy burdens and develop a spring/summer cooling \n     program.\n\n\n                              rhode island\n\n       The percentage of households served by the Rhode Island \n     LIHEAP program is expected to increase by 33% (26,000 vs. \n     19,500). Energy prices have shown significant increases. \n     Prices for natural gas prices have increased by 30-40%, \n     electricity by 40-50% and the home heating oil by 50%. To \n     help offset these increases, the LIHEAP minimum benefit was \n     increased from $200 to $325, which resulted in an increase in \n     the average award from $390 to $550. Emergency oil delivery \n     has also been increased from 100 gallons to 200 gallons. \n     Eligibility criteria remains at the 60% state median income \n     level. Although LIHEAP funds have been set aside for \n     weatherization activities, boiler or furnace replacement, \n     blankets and hats for elderly and shut-in clients and summer \n     crisis programs, additional funding is needed to expand the \n     crisis and emergency assistance programs, as well as to \n     implement bulk fuel purchases.\n\n[[Page S2043]]\n\n                             south carolina\n\n       A 24% overall increase in the number of households served \n     is expected this year and benefits and LIHEAP eligibility \n     criteria have been increased and expanded to assist clients \n     in coping with higher energy prices. Additional funds are \n     needed to provide furnace repair/replacement services, which \n     are currently not available.\n\n\n                              SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n       South Dakota expects a 30% increase in the number of \n     households served (15,000 vs. 11,500) in its regular LIHEAP \n     program. Income eligibility criteria has not changed (140% of \n     poverty), but benefits have been increased by 60% for natural \n     gas, oil and propane users to offset the higher costs of \n     these fuels. Weatherization and furnace repair and \n     replacement programs continue to be offered. Additional funds \n     are needed to further increase the benefit levels, as well as \n     expand the eligibility criteria to enable more households to \n     participate.\n\n\n                                VERMONT\n\n       A 10% increase is expected in the number of households \n     served by Vermont's LIHEAP program this year (23,900 vs. \n     21,637). Home heating prices have risen as follows: oil 50%; \n     propane 45%; and kerosene 45% and although some increases \n     were made to the benefits this year, additional funds are \n     needed to keep up with the fuel price increases, as well as \n     to provide emergency furnace repair/replacement and \n     weatherization services.\n\n\n                               WASHINGTON\n\n       Washington's LIHEAP caseload is expected to increase by 50% \n     this year (75,000 vs. 49,770). Neither benefits nor \n     eligibility criteria have changed this year, but fuel costs \n     have increased significantly. Natural gas prices are up by \n     26%, electricity by 15% and kerosene by 60%. Supplemental \n     funding would enable higher benefits to be awarded to offset \n     the higher energy burden experienced by Washington households \n     this year, as well as enable additional households to be \n     served.\n\n\n                             WEST VIRGINIA\n\n       West Virginia expects to serve almost 55% more households \n     this year (55,000 vs. 38,804). Heating costs have increased \n     on average by about 12%. Benefits levels were increased by \n     raising the minimum payment by $50 and the maximum benefit \n     from $475 to $600. Additional funding would probably be used \n     to assist customers with cooling costs during the summer, and \n     to expand the LIHEAP program to include more customers.\n\n\n                               WISCONSIN\n\n       Wisconsin expects to serve 25% more households in its \n     regular LIHEAP program (110,100 vs. 88,105) and emergency \n     program (25,000 vs. 20,152) this year.

Residents have seen the cost of \n     natural gas rise by 101%, propane by 62% and heating oil by \n     30%. Additional funding is needed to further increase the \n     benefit levels to more adequately mitigate the effects of the \n     price spikes, as well as to expand outreach efforts and \n     assist additional eligible households.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I don't know if it is the will of the \nmanagers of the bill to have a vote at this time. I am certainly ready \nfor a vote whenever time is appropriate.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will renew that request when we have \nmore Senators on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment includes essential short-\nterm responses to the energy difficulties that American families face \nright now. It includes protections for working families who must heat \ntheir homes during the severe winters that we have in the Northeast and \nMidwest, and for families who must cool their homes during times of \nextreme heat in the South and West. Many families cannot afford sudden \nand dramatic increases in their heating costs, yet they must heat their \nhomes to survive. This year 123,000 Massachusetts families needed help \nwith their heating costs under the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, a 10 percent increase in need over last year. In Boston alone, \ncommunity action agencies made over 1,500 emergency heating oil \ndeliveries this winter.\n  The expanded relief afforded working families under this Amendment is \na fitting--and I say crucial--addition to a bankruptcy bill that seeks \nto limit the debt relief available to consumers. I am proud to join my \ncolleagues in proposing to improve this bankruptcy bill with energy \nprotections for middle and low-income families.\n  Over the next year, Congress faces difficult choices in planning the \nNation's energy future, choices that will have profound long-term \nconsequences for every sector of the Nation's economy. Republicans \ninsist on debating controversial proposals like oil drilling in \nwildlife refuges but even if they succeed in forcing the drilling to \nbegin, any oil found there will not have any effect on the domestic \nenergy supply for 5 or even 10 years.\n  While we take the time that is necessary to debate long-term energy \npolicy, a foot of snow remains on the ground in Boston today. The cold \nweather brings immediate needs to families and small businesses, \nincluding many who work in the transportation industry. These needs \ncannot and should not continue be ignored. Unless Congress acts now, \nmany families will suffer in the cold through the remainder of the \nwinter, they will endure the summer's heat without respite, and they \nwill be the first to feel the effects of any destabilization in the \nlarger economy.\n  Especially as Congress acts to weaken the bankruptcy protections \navailable to low-income consumers, it must account for their legitimate \nshort-term energy needs. This amendment accomplishes this work in a \nstraightforward way, by: increasing authorized funding for the Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program, the Weatherization Assistance \nProgram, and State Energy Grants; expanding state options for providing \nenergy assistance to any family earning under 200 percent of poverty; \nand requiring the federal government to lead by example in all manners \nof energy conservation.\n  The fact that we cannot solve all of the Nation's energy problems \novernight does not excuse us from doing what we know works to protect \nfamilies in the near term. The sponsors of this amendment are clear \nthat a strong safety net for low-income working families, conservation, \nand energy efficiency are actions that can and must be taken \nimmediately in response to the energy difficulties that we all know \nconsumers throughout the Nation are facing today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his concern \nabout energy policy in America. I share that. Those of us who worked \nfor 4 years on the bankruptcy bill know that we need to remain focused \non this bill.\n  I hope there is some way we can avoid having an energy debate delay \nour ability to bring to a conclusion the bill that is before us today, \nthe bankruptcy legislation. To date, we have been pretty good about \nthat. People are bringing their amendments down. They have been \nrelevant amendments for the most part. Some have not been very relevant \nbut at least arguably relevant. I think this one is particularly \nnongermane to the matter before us.\n  I want to say with regard to energy policy, it has been obvious to me \nfor some time that this Nation has been operating within a rosy \nscenario. We have blithely gone along, even though we have so much more \nsuperior technology today and are so much more capable of producing \nenergy without any environmental damage, virtually no environmental \ndamage, and at the same time we have been declaring time and time again \nthat we will not allow energy reserves to be produced.\n  One of the reasons is there is a group in this country that favors \nhigh energy prices. This is a no-growth group that is not in the \nmainstream. But every time there is an opportunity to bring on a new \nsupply of energy, they object. It is their joy when prices go up \nbecause they think somehow that will cause people to burn less fuel and \nemit less pollutants. They are not concerned the average family in \nAlabama 2\\1/2\\ years ago maybe spending $100 a month for their gasoline \nbill for their automobile and now spending $150 is because we \nallowed ourselves to become increasingly dependent on foreign oil.\n\n  Those OPEC nations got together and politically jacked up the price \nby withholding supplies. They are not concerned we can't bring nuclear \npower on line. That has been blocked in any number of different ways \nleaving us now totally dependent for new electricity generation on \nnatural gas which places electric generation in competition with \nhomeowners. And we are seeing huge increases in natural gas prices in \nmy State.\n  I see the Senator from Maryland. Is he prepared to speak on the \nbankruptcy bill?\n\n[[Page S2044]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to speak with respect to an amendment that was \noffered a short while ago and is still pending before the body.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be delighted to yield to him, Mr. President, \nbecause he will be speaking on a pending bankruptcy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 25\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \namendment offered just a short while ago by my very able colleague from \nNew York, Senator Schumer, which I cosponsored. I thank Senator Schumer \nfor his leadership on this amendment which seeks to ensure--there is \nsome ambiguity--that the claims and defenses that would have existed \nwith respect to a predatory loan will survive at sale or loan and \npassage through a bankruptcy proceeding.\n  Last year, just to illustrate the dimensions of this problem, the New \nYork Times and ABC News broke a story about a company called First \nAlliance Corporation. First Alliance was a predator mortgage lender \nwhich engaged in deceptive and fraudulent practices.\n  Like many predatory lenders, First Alliance targeted elderly \nhomeowners, many of whom were ill, for the hard sell. In fact, First \nAlliance developed a script for its lending staff called ``The Track,'' \nwhich detailed a set of tricks that could be used to distract and \ndeceive trusting homeowners. Indeed, according to press accounts, a \nCalifornia appeals court found that First Alliance ``trained its \nemployees to use various methods, including deception, to sell its \nservices.''\n  This guidebook to deception is only part of the story. Loan officers \ndid not disclose, as required by the Truth in Lending Act, the true \ncosts of the loan. Even where the documents told the true story, the \nloan officers would lie to the customer about the meaning of the \ndocuments.\n  This is not an idle or empty accusation. This is not speculation. One \ncustomer of First Alliance taped her conversation with a loan officer \nto play for her husband later on because she had become so confused by \nthe transaction. So we know these violations occur.\n  Over time, a number of State attorneys general started investigating \nFirst Alliance, and a growing number of victims of these practices \nbrought suit.\n  Under the Truth in Lending Act and State fraud and other statutes, \nthe victims have the right to seek redress that makes them whole and in \nsome cases to collect damages. Under threat from many such lawsuits, \nFirst Alliance declared bankruptcy. In other words, the company that \nhad engaged in these practices, which was now being called to account \nfor those practices by the State attorneys general and by those people \nvictimized--utilizing the Truth in Lending Act, and State fraud and \nother statutes--that company declared bankruptcy. Other subprime \npredatory lenders engaging in similar practices have sought the \nprotection of bankruptcy courts as the suits have piled up. A number of \nthese firms have sold their loan portfolios, or the servicing rights to \ntheir loans, in their bankruptcy proceedings.\n  What this amendment would do is it would ensure that the claims that \nrest against these deceptive and fraudulent loans would survive the \nbankruptcy process. It is arguable that that is what existing law \nprovides, but it is not altogether clear. This seeks to make that \ncrystal clear.\n  The amendment is necessary because some are now advancing the \nargument that going through bankruptcy is essentially equivalent to \nlaundering the loan; in other words, what was dirty going into the \nbankruptcy proceeding comes out clean. But of course what that means is \nthat innocent homeowners who sought a loan, homeowners who were tricked \nand lied to, homeowners who have legitimate claims to relief under \nexisting law, might end up without a remedy and might end up losing \ntheir homes.\n  Indeed, one could argue that the current ambiguity encourages these \nlenders to go into bankruptcy. If bankruptcy results in these loans \nbeing laundered--cleaned up--then those loans, those assets, become \nmore valuable after bankruptcy than they were before. If you can pass \nthem through that process and, in effect, block out the victims from \nseeking the remedies to which existing law entitles them, then the \nasset is more valuable if it passes through the bankruptcy proceeding.\n  Obviously, anyone stopping to think about this, even for a moment, \nwould conclude that this is wrong. If a consumer has a legitimate claim \nbecause a loan was made without complying with the law, that consumer \nshould be able to pursue the claim regardless of whether the company \nthat made the loan went through bankruptcy or not.\n\n  Indeed, one of the arguments that was used earlier today in the \ndebate, in opposing the amendment that was offered by Senator Durbin, \nwas that remedies against predatory, fraudulent, and unfair loans \nalready exist in the law today. That argument was used to say that the \nDurbin amendment was not necessary. The fact of the matter is, if we \nwant to ensure that such protections do in fact exist and that they are \nnot wiped out by the bankruptcy proceeding, we need to adopt this \namendment.\n  Let me make one final point. This amendment does not create any new \ncauses of action or create liability where none currently exists. All \nit does is, it simply maintains the same claim against the loan on both \nsides of the bankruptcy process. So it precludes using the bankruptcy \nprocess to wipe out these claims and remedies that are available to the \nconsumer because the lender has engaged in predatory and fraudulent \npractices.\n  I am very frank to say to you I think it is a small but significant \nstep to providing victims of predatory lending the opportunity to \nobtain a measure of relief with respect to the exploitation that has \nbeen practiced upon them.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment which Senator Schumer offered \njust a short while ago and which is pending at the desk along with, as \nI understand it, a number of other amendments which will be voted upon \nlater in our proceedings.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know the Senator is a distinguished member of the \nBanking Committee and understands these matters far better than I. But \nthis deals with a situation in which a lending institution violated the \nlaw in making certain loans and was subject to lawsuit; is that right?\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right. First of all, let me make very clear, \nthe number of institutions engaged in these kinds of practices is \nlimited. They are the worst of the bunch. The responsible people in the \nindustry do not want these people engaged in these kinds of practices.\n  But, unfortunately, there are people who are really engaged in \nessentially what is a ripoff. And there are some existing protections \nagainst some practices that are provided in the law, in the Truth in \nLending Act at the Federal level and in State fraud statutes, so that \nthe victims can bring suit and obtain a remedy with respect to the way \nthey have been exploited by a loan.\n  All this amendment says if those kinds of business enterprises which \nhave engaged in this practice declare bankruptcy, they then cannot use \nthe bankruptcy proceeding to, in effect, erase those claims--in other \nwords, take what is a dirty asset, or a dirty loan, into bankruptcy and \nbring it out on the other side as a clean loan where you then say to \nthe consumer: It's too bad, you just can't get any recourse because \nthis loan has gone through the bankruptcy process.\n  So this would maintain the consumer's rights that he had going into \nthe bankruptcy on the other side. It does not add to those rights. \nThose rights are defined by existing law--Federal and State--so it \nwould not substantively expand the recourse, but procedurally it would \nmaintain the existing remedies.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think I understand the goal. And I am sympathetic to \nthat. I guess we are wrestling with the question, Would it simply come \ndown to the fact that you are telling the borrowers who have been \nabused that if they are not able to make their claim, before or while \nthe case is in bankruptcy, against that bankrupt estate,\n\n[[Page S2045]]\n\nunder current law it is lost, but under your law they could make their \nclaim against whoever bought or purchased the loan?\n  We can talk about it later. We don't want to make assets unsalable.\n  Mr. SARBANES. They declare bankruptcy and then they sell these loan \nportfolios or the servicing rights to the loans, often in the course of \nthe bankruptcy proceedings. If you allow that to happen, then you have \nan incentive for these companies to use the bankruptcy proceeding as a \nway of cleaning up their loans. So they go into bankruptcy, they use \nthe bankruptcy proceeding to sell them off to somebody, but the victim \nhas no recourse. We are saying if it goes in as a predatory fraudulent \nloan, the person who has been victimized ought not to lose his remedy \nbecause they can wash it through the bankruptcy proceeding.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Does the amendment make any difference between a \nreorganization and a liquidation circumstance?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I don't think it does. I would have to doublecheck and \nlet the Senator know.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Is the Senator aware of how this could affect Fannie \nMae or any of those type loans?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Any purchaser of such loans would have to be on guard \nbecause they would not be able to take them free and clear because the \nclaims would stay with the loan.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. They would be less valuable as an asset to sell.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Potentially.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think I am beginning to comprehend it. I know there \nare very delicate issues involved in these matters. It may well be the \nSenator has an amendment that would benefit us. I will be glad to look \nat it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, is there an amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Bingaman amendment No. 28 is now pending.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 20\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that be set \naside and I be allowed to call up amendment No. 20 introduced earlier \nthis morning on current monthly income.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 20.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 20) is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To resolve an ambiguity relating to the definition of current \n                            monthly income)\n\n       On page 18, beginning on line 9, strike ``preceding the \n     date of determination'' and insert ``ending on the last day \n     of the calendar month immediately preceding the date of the \n     bankruptcy filing''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this amendment clarifies when a debtor's \ncurrent monthly income should be measured. The debtor's current monthly \nincome is the cornerstone of the bill's means test provision which has \nbecome quite controversial. Whether one supports or opposes the means \ntest, I think everybody should agree, for or against it, that it ought \nto be as clearly drafted as possible.\n  Assuming that passed as it is now, my amendment would avoid what I \nthink would be unnecessary future litigation or would clarify that \ncurrently monthly income is measured from the last day of the calendar \nmonth immediately preceding the bankruptcy filing.\n  Allow me tell you what this means. Under the bill's current language, \ncurrently monthly income could be the 6-month period ending on the date \nthe debtor's schedules were prepared, which could be a substantial time \nbefore the case was filed, or it could be the filing date, or it could \nbe some later date, such as the time of a hearing on a motion to \nconvert or dismiss the case based on the debtor's ability to pay. So it \nbecomes a moving target.\n  Since accuracy of the schedules is of vital importance and subject to \naudit, it is important that debtors and their counsel be given clear \ndirection as to the time on which income must be averaged. My amendment \nwould resolve the ambiguity so as to deal with full calendar months of \nincome data and to give a cutoff date prior to the bankruptcy filing. \nAs amended, this definition would apply to average monthly income \nderived during the 6-month period ending on the last day of the \ncalendar month immediately preceding the bankruptcy filing. Everybody \nwould know where we are.\n  That is a relatively simple amendment. I think actually if one looks \nback on this, it would seem to be a drafting error. That is why I \nbrought it up earlier this morning: more to improve the bill so we are \nnot stuck with a bill that, if it does pass, we find ourselves \nlitigating for the next year or two on issues none of us intended, \nwhether for or against the bill.\n  That is what it is. I hope Senators will take a look at it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 29 to Amendment No. 20\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment in the \nsecond degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for allowing me to go \nforward. I apologize. We have several markups going on today, and I was \nunable to be here to discuss the small business bankruptcy provision.\n  My colleague and friend, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, offered an \namendment which would delete the small business changes in chapter 11 \nand replace them with a study of the factors that cause small \nbusinesses to enter into bankruptcy and any changes to chapter 11 that \nmight be appropriate.\n  At first blush, the amendment would not appear to be a problem. \nSenator Kerry and I have worked together in the Small Business \nCommittee on many things over the years. We take a great deal of pride \nin the fact that assisting small business has generally received \noverwhelming bipartisan support in this body.\n  I find some problems with the amendment and with the proposal \nrequested by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts because the \nreport that he seeks actually has already occurred. Approximately 4 \nyears ago, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission conducted a wide-\nranging study of how well the bankruptcy code was working. There was a \nsmall business working group on the commission that looked particularly \nat chapter 11 and made an assessment of how well the chapter was \nserving small business debtors and creditors.\n  The small business provisions in this bill are a result of that \nstudy, that work, and the recommendations of the working group of that \ncommission.\n  Let's remember that under chapter 11, the debtor is still managing a \nbusiness during the bankruptcy proceeding. The small business working \ngroup found that in too many small business cases, there are no strong \ncreditors committees to oversee how the debtors are managing the \ncompany, and the courts are not doing an adequate job of overseeing the \ndebtors.\n\n  As a result, the working group noted that chapter 11 debtors often \nlived under the protection of the bankruptcy code literally for years, \noften without providing any meaningful return to unsecured creditors \nand diminishing their assets in the process. Accordingly, the \ncommission recommended chapter 11 be amended in two principal ways.\n  First, there should be standard reports filed with the courts on a \nregular basis so that courts can follow how a debtor is progressing in \nbankruptcy.\n  Second, there should be presumptive plan filing and plan confirmation \ndeadlines specifically tailored to fit the needs of small business \ncases. If these deadlines cannot be met, the commission recommended \nthat the bankruptcy court hold a factfinding hearing. In that hearing, \nthe court can look at all the evidence and determine whether a small \nbusiness is likely to be able to confirm a plan of reorganization \nwithin a reasonable period of time.\n  The intent of the provisions is not to eliminate a small business' \nability to reorganize or to place restrictive requirements on it. It is \nmerely a procedure that would permit courts to review on a regular \nbasis the progress of a small business attempting to reorganize so that \nthe court can step in if it appears that the small business does not \nhave a realistic ability to reorganize.\n  The establishment of such a process is important for small business. \nFirst, the small business provisions establish standard disclosure \nstatements and\n\n[[Page S2047]]\n\ndebtor reporting requirements that will assist small businesses \nentering chapter 11. These provisions have been widely supported as \ndramatically improving the chapter 11 process with small business \ndebtors. Standard requirements will get rid of what is now a costly \nburden on small business debtors to draft from scratch a reorganizing \nplan and a prospectus-type disclosure statement.\n  In other words, what is in the bill, what would be stricken by this \namendment, actually does simplify the process significantly for the \nsmall business.\n  One must remember that small businesses are on both sides of \nbankruptcies in this country; they are both creditors and debtors. \nSmall business creditors are significantly harmed if their fellow small \nbusiness debtors, who do not have a realistic opportunity to \nreorganize, languish in bankruptcy while their assets deteriorate. \nThese small business creditors will receive significantly less on their \nclaims and are substantially harmed.\n  One of the most important points I can make on this is, if there is \nno protection for small business creditors, then there is likely to be \nno credit for small businesses. Let us go back and think about that a \nminute.\n  If a small business that gets into trouble cannot go into bankruptcy, \nand if there is no means for the creditor to realize something from the \nassets of the debtor or get some reasonable plan of accommodation, then \nthe creditor, the lender, is at risk of losing perhaps the entire loan \nto the small business. That is why I say if you do not have a \nreasonable bankruptcy procedure, then you are going to curtail the \navailability of credit.\n  We have seen in other countries where they do not have good \nbankruptcy provisions that treat fairly the debtors, the creditors, and \nall other interested parties, and they have a very difficult time \ngetting credit for the businesses.\n  The committee has worked hard, following the commission to study \nbankruptcy and the work of the small business working group, to come up \nwith provisions that are reasonable. These provisions in this bill are \ndesigned to facilitate the proceeding without imposing undue burdens. \nThat is why I am advised that the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, the National Association of Credit Managers, and the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce oppose this amendment.\n  They recognize if you inhibit the ability of small business creditors \nto get relief, you will make it much less likely that creditors supply \nthe credit for small business needs.\n  Lastly, I point out that Congress has approved these provisions \nseveral times. These provisions have been in the bankruptcy bill in one \nform or another since the 105th Congress and have been amended during \nthat time. My colleague from Massachusetts amended the provisions last \nCongress significantly to increase the amount of time a small business \nhas to file a reorganization plan under chapter 11.\n  I hope we can all agree we need an approach that is balanced between \nsmall business debtors and creditors. We should permit every small \nbusiness that gets into credit trouble to have the ability to \nreorganize. That is what these provisions are intended to do. That is \nwhy I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard. The clerk will \ncontinue to call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 29 be modified to be considered a first-degree amendment and laid \naside.\n  I further ask consent that it now be in order for Senator Sessions to \noffer an amendment relating to lockbox, and that following the \nreporting by the clerk, Senator Conrad be recognized, and following his \nremarks, Senator Domenici, or his designee be recognized. I further ask \nconsent that no amendments be in order to either amendment, and that \nfollowing Monday's debate the amendments be laid aside until the hour \nof 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, and there be 30 minutes for closing remarks on \nthe issue to be equally divided in the usual form on Tuesday.\n  I further ask consent that the Senate proceed to a vote in relation \nto amendment No. 29, to be followed by a vote in relation to the second \nlockbox amendment, beginning at 2:45 p.m. Tuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I say to the \nacting leader, the manager of the bill--I have a couple points of \nclarification. We are concerned about being in session Friday. I \nunderstand the leader is not available. We hope that we can work that \nout prior to when we close tonight because Senator Conrad wants to be \nable to talk on this amendment tomorrow, in addition to Monday.\n  It is my understanding there will be a separate agreement later today \nto stack some votes Tuesday morning on the amendments that are now \npending; is that right?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If we can get an overall agreement, which we have been \nseeking, an agreed-upon list of amendments, which has not yet been \nforthcoming, which is critical to final disposition of this bill.\n  Mr. REID. I am quite confident by the end of the vote we will be able \nto have a finite list of amendments to give to you and the leader. The \nlast thing: Is this going to be the last vote of the day? We have had a \nnumber of inquiries in the Cloakroom.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think it hinges on the same problem. If we don't have \non overall agreement, there might be more votes.\n  Mr. REID. That sounds pretty weak. On behalf of Senator Leahy, we are \ndoing our best to move this legislation along. We appreciate the \ncooperation of the majority in allowing this matter to go forward on \nthis basis. We feel with the time we have spent doing this, we could \nhave gone forward with the amendment and be at the same place we are. \nHaving said that, we have no objection to the unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Amendment No. 29, as modified, is as follows:\n\n\n                     AMENDMENT NO. 29, AS MODIFIED\n\n   (Purpose: To establish an off-budget lockbox to strengthen Social \n                         Security and Medicare)\n\n       At the end of the bill insert the following:\n\n TITLE XX--SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE OFF-BUDGET LOCKBOX ACT OF 2001\n\n     SEC. __01.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and strong economic \n     growth have ended decades of deficit spending;\n       (2) the Government is able to meet its current obligations \n     without using the social security and medicare surpluses;\n       (3) fiscal pressures will mount as an aging population \n     increases the Government's obligations to provide retirement \n     income and health services;\n       (4) social security and medicare hospital insurance \n     surpluses should be used to reduce the debt held by the \n     public until legislation is enacted that reforms Social \n     Security and Medicare;\n       (5) preserving the social security and medicare hospital \n     insurance surpluses would restore confidence in the long-term \n     financial integrity of social security and medicare; and\n       (6) strengthening the Government's fiscal position through \n     debt reduction would increase national savings, promote \n     economic growth, and reduce its interest payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) prevent the surpluses of the social security and \n     medicare hospital insurance trust funds from being used for \n     any purpose other than providing retirement and health \n     security; and\n       (2) use such surpluses to pay down the national debt until \n     such time as medicare and social security legislation is \n     enacted.\n\n     SEC. 3.

PRESIDENT'S BUDGET.\n\n       (a) Protection of Social Security and Medicare Surpluses.--\n     If the budget of the United States Government submitted by \n     the President under section 1105(a) of title 31, United \n     States Code, recommends an on-budget surplus for any fiscal \n     year that is less than the surplus of the Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund for that fiscal year, then it shall \n     include a detailed proposal for social security reform \n     legislation or medicare reform legislation.\n       (b) Effective Date.--Subsection (a) shall cease to have any \n     force or effect upon the enactment of social security reform \n     legislation and medicare reform legislation as defined by \n     section 316(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 29, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, the Senator from North Dakota \nis recognized next.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the amendment I have sent to the desk is \nan amendment to provide protection to both the Social Security trust \nfund surplus and the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund surplus. \nMr. President, this is legislation I offered last year that passed the \nSenate on a bipartisan basis with 60 votes.\n  I hope that again this year we can send a very strong signal in this \nbody that we fully intend to protect the Social Security and Medicare \ntrust funds; that we intend to establish a lockbox to wall off those \ntrust funds from being used for any other purpose; that we would assure \nthe American people that the Social Security trust fund and the \nMedicare Trust Fund will not be raided, will not be used for other \nspending, will not be used for any other purpose, will not be used for \na tax cut; that we will assure those who are the beneficiaries of \nSocial Security and Medicare--those who make payments to those \nprograms--that the money they have paid in will be used for the \npurposes intended.\n  This amendment, very simply, takes the Medicare Hospital Insurance \ntrust fund completely off budget the same way we have protected the \nSocial Security fund. It would add points of order to ensure that \nneither Social Security nor Medicare surpluses could be used for any \nother purpose.\n  As you know, Social Security is already off budget. This amendment \nwould treat the Medicare Trust Fund the same way as we already treat \nthe Social Security trust funds. It would also create points of order \nagainst any legislation that would reduce the Medicare Hospital \nInsurance trust fund surpluses. Similar points of order already apply \nto Social Security.\n  In addition, the amendment strengthens existing rules that protect \nSocial Security. For example, we establish a point of order protecting \nSocial Security's off-budget status. Our amendment also includes a \npoint of order protecting Social Security surpluses in every year \ncovered by a budget resolution, which is a strengthening over current \nlaw. Again, this is largely, almost entirely, the amendment that passed \nthe Senate Chamber last year with 60 votes, and it was a strong \nbipartisan vote.\n  Many of us believe we should not raid the Social Security and \nMedicare trust funds, period. Ninety-eight Senators voted last year in \nfavor of this principle; 60 voted for my proposal; I believe over 50 \nvoted for Senator Ashcroft's proposal. But when you looked at the vote, \n98 Senators voted for one or the other. I ask my colleagues to again \nendorse that principle.\n  Again, if we look at the specifics, it protects Social Security \nsurpluses in each and every year. It takes the Medicare Hospital \nInsurance trust fund off budget. It gives Medicare the same protections \nas Social Security, and it contains strong enforcement. That is \nprecisely what we offered last year. That is precisely what passed last \nyear. I hope we don't take a step backward this year and water down \nthese protections.\n  Now, some have said if we save both the Social Security and Medicare \ntrust fund surpluses that we will get into excess cash buildup between \nnow and the end of this 10-year budget forecast period. Let me just \nindicate, as this chart shows, we can save all of the Social Security \nsurplus, and all of the Medicare\n\n[[Page S2050]]\n\nHospital Insurance surplus, and not have any cash buildup problem until \nout in the year 2010. So we don't have a problem for 9 years of any \ncash buildup, no problem at all until the year 2010. So we have plenty \nof time to respond to that, if, indeed, it ever develops.\n  As we all know, this is based on a 10-year forecast. It is a forecast \nthat may come true, and may not come true.\n  We are all working off a CBO projection that is a 10-year projection, \nwhich the forecasting agency itself tells us only has a 10-percent \nchance of coming through--10 percent. When we use this figure, $5.6 \ntrillion surplus over the next 10 years, the forecasting agency has \ntold us that only has a 10-percent chance of coming true. There is a \n45-percent chance it will be more; there is a 45-percent chance it will \nbe less. The only prudent thing to do in those circumstances is to bet \nthat it may well be less because if, in fact, we overestimate, that has \nvery serious implications of putting us back into deficit.\n  Speaker Hastert said this about the House lockbox bill:\n\n       We are going to wall off Social Security trust funds and \n     Medicare trust funds and consequently, we pay down the public \n     debt when we do that. . . . So we are going to continue to do \n     that. That's in the parameters of our budget, and we are not \n     going to dip into that at all.\n\n  Unfortunately, the version that passed the House has an enormous \ntrapdoor in it. They say they are walling off Social Security, they say \nthey are walling off Medicare, but then when you read the fine print, \nyou find out they do not really intend to do that at all. They are \nfully prepared to dip into those trust funds for other purposes. Our \namendment prevents that.\n  If we do not protect the Medicare surplus, we will reduce the \nsolvency of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, reversing years \nof steady progress in shoring up this program.\n  Let's have a brief history lesson and remind ourselves that in 1992 \nthe Medicare trust fund was projected to become insolvent in the year \n2002. That is just 9 years ago. The actuaries studied the program and \nsaid we are headed for insolvency in the Medicare program in the year \n2002, but by last year, that date was estimated to be 2025, an \nimprovement of 23 years. That is because of actions that were taken in \nthe Congress of the United States to extend the solvency of the \nMedicare program.\n  Those efforts have worked, but if we now start to spend from the \ntrust fund, and if we take the $500 billion Medicare Part A trust fund \nsurplus projected for the next 10 years and use it for other purposes, \nwe will make Medicare insolvent by the year 2009, 16 years earlier than \nis now projected.\n  Some have argued that since beneficiary premiums only cover 25 \npercent of Medicare Part B costs, there is a deficit in that part of \nMedicare. Part B is funded by premiums and by the general fund.\n  The question before this body is, Do we protect the Hospital \nInsurance Trust Fund that exists for Medicare in the same way that we \nprotect the trust fund that exists for Social Security?\n  Last year, overwhelmingly our colleagues said yes: we should provide \nthe same protection to the Medicare trust fund that we provide the \nSocial Security trust fund. I hope we will provide that same protection \nagain this year.\n  Some say because Part B only has 25 percent of its costs covered by a \npremium, therefore it is in deficit. That is not what the law says or \nwhat the actuaries report, but that is the rhetoric being used by some \nwho want to justify a raid on the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for \nMedicare.\n  They are saying, yes, there is a trust fund for Part A of Medicare \nand, yes, it is in surplus by $500 billion, but they say Part B only \ngets 25 percent of its costs covered by premiums; therefore, it is in \ndeficit; therefore, there is no surplus anywhere in Medicare. That is \nsimply false. We know that there is a Hospital Insurance Trust Fund \ndesignated in law, and it has $500 billion, according to the \nAdministration.\n\n  For those who say because Medicare overall is challenged fiscally, \ntherefore there is no reason to protect the Hospital Insurance Trust \nFund, let's just take that money and jackpot it and make it available \nfor other expenditure, make it available for defense, make it available \nfor agriculture, make it available for education, make it available for \nwhatever other worthy purpose somebody might conjure up, make it \navailable for a tax cut. The problem with that is, if you take the \ntrust fund surplus that is in existence today in Medicare and you raid \nit and you use it for other purposes, you shorten the period of \nsolvency of Medicare and you bankrupt the program. It is that simple. \nIt is robbing Peter to pay Paul. It is digging the ditch deeper before \nstarting to fill it in.\n  We should not tolerate raiding either the Social Security trust fund \nor the Medicare trust fund. In the private sector, if anybody tried to \nraid the retirement funds of a company, if anybody tried to raid the \nhealth plans of a company, they would be in violation of Federal law. \nThey would be on their way to a Federal institution. It would not be \nthe Congress of the United States, and it would not be the White House. \nThey would be incarcerated because they would have violated Federal \nlaw.\n  This is a critically important decision that we will make. This is a \nfundamental decision. Do we protect the Social Security trust fund? Do \nwe protect the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund or don't we? Do \nwe open the door to a raid on both those funds? I very much hope that \nthe answer in this Chamber, as it was last year, is a resounding no; \nthat we make very clear to any who would raid these trust funds that \nthey are off limits, that they will not be touched, that we are not \ngoing to accept using these funds for other purposes. That is what the \nAmerican people want us to do. That is what we will have an opportunity \nto do when we vote on this amendment, and we should not take other \nplans that use the same words but have a trapdoor to them that opens \nthe door to a raid on these trust funds. That would be, I believe, a \nserious mistake.\n  One other thing I want to point out about the President's budget that \nis carefully hidden in the numbers: Although the President claims there \nis enough in his so-called contingency fund to protect Medicare, in \nfact that is not the case. In the year 2005, the contingency fund \ntotals $36 billion, but the Medicare trust fund surplus is $47 billion. \nThat means if you protect Medicare under the President's budget, you \nwill be raiding the Social Security trust fund to the tune of $11 \nbillion in that year or you will be in deficit by $11 billion.\n  I think that is another demonstration that the tax cut offered by the \nPresident is so large that it threatens to put us back into deficit, \nbecause that is exactly what it does in the year 2005 if you protect \nSocial Security and Medicare. Under the President's budget, we will be \nback in deficit in the year 2005 if, in fact, we protect the trust \nfunds of Social Security and Medicare.\n  I believe Senator Kerry is to be recognized for final debate on his \namendment. I look forward to talking more about this amendment \ntomorrow, on Monday and again on Tuesday.\n  I conclude by saying once more that last year we had a strong \nbipartisan vote. We had nearly 20 Republican Senators join a group of \nSenators on this side. We had over 60 votes to protect Social Security \nand Medicare trust funds. I hope we have a vote that is even stronger \nthis year.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 26\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the pending \namendment is laid aside and there are now 10 minutes equally divided on \nthe Kerry amendment No. 26.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me address quickly the elements of my \namendment which seek to strike the small business provision within this \nbankruptcy bill. I emphasize to my colleagues, we don't strike it and \nnot do anything; we strike it and ask for a study by the Small Business \nAdministration for the most efficient and effective way of dealing with \nsmall business bankruptcies. The reason for that is as follows:\n  My colleague, Senator Grassley, a little while ago--and I respect \nenormously the efforts he is making on this bill, and I respect the \nefforts generally in the Senate to try to reform the bankruptcy code--\nbut Senator Grassley talked about how the Bankruptcy Review Commission \nvoted out the small business provisions. He talked about an 8-1 vote. \nLet me emphasize to\n\n[[Page S2051]]\n\nall my colleagues, the vote of the Bankruptcy Review Commission was 8-1 \non the entire report. But indeed on the particular provision with \nrespect to small business, the commission was very divided. It was an \nextraordinarily close vote, 5-4. That 5-4 vote reflected the tension \nthat existed over this question of how to treat small business. There \nwas not a generalized acceptance of their approach.\n  Second, we in the Senate are just beginning to focus on what the \npotential impact to small business might be as a consequence of this \nbill. I emphasize to my colleagues there are two reviews of this \nbankruptcy effort. One is the commission. But the National Bankruptcy \nConference, which is a conference made up of experts, also has weighed \nin on this bill. The National Bankruptcy Conference has endorsed my \napproach to this issue of striking the small business sections. In \nother words, the National Bankruptcy Conference and many of the small \nbusiness entities of the country believe that what the Senate is about \nto do is undo some of the things we attempted in the last few years \nwith the small business regulatory reform and all of the efforts we \nhave undertaken to lift from small business in this country undue \namounts of paper burden, regulatory burden, government-mandated \nintrusion.\n\n  What we will be doing in this bankruptcy bill is putting back on to \nsmall businesses the very kind of burden we have tried to lift. I \nemphasize the National Bankruptcy Conference endorses my approach, \nwhich is to strike this section and ask for a Small Business \nAdministration analysis of what will happen. I remind my colleagues, \nthe number of chapter 11 filings with respect to small business has \ndramatically decreased over the last decade from 24,000 in 1991 to \nbelow 10,000 last year.\n  The fact is there is no showing whatever on the record that small \nbusinesses represent the kind of problem that invites the kind of \nonerous, intrusive documentation and recordation that is in this \nlegislation.\n  If small business fails to comply with the new reporting requirements \nthat are in this legislation, then creditors are given entirely new \npowers, and those powers could force bankruptcy court judges to \nliquidate small businesses or to completely dismiss their proceedings. \nThis could force many small businesses to expend a huge amount of \nresources to fend off challenges by any creditor simply for not \ncomplying with one of the new burdensome reporting requirements that \nare put into this legislation.\n  These requirements place a burden on small mom-and-pop operations \nthat are the lifeblood of the growth of this country. Sixty to eighty \npercent of the jobs in this country are created by small business, \nmaintained by small business, and almost all the growth in the country. \nThere is no showing that small businesses present the kind of problem \nwith respect to the bankruptcy process that merits this kind of \napproach.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the effect of the amendment is to strike \nsection 431 to 445, all of subtitle B of title IV of the bill, the \nprovisions which reform bankruptcies for companies that are ``small \nbusinesses''. A ``small business'' is a company that, together with its \naffiliates, has debts under $3,000,000 and is not primarily a real \nestate owning and operating company, but only if an unsecured \ncreditor's committee has not been appointed. Also propose a Small \nBusiness Administration study of bankruptcy and small businesses.\n  Our present law: Although the Bankruptcy Code now contains provisions \non small business bankruptcies, they are optional and rarely used. \nPresent chapter 11 is complicated and expensive for debtors. It is a \nlawyer's paradise because their services are very necessary. Chapter \n11s also tend to be long drawn out affairs, seemingly managed by the \nprofessionals to extract the largest possible fees. Small business \ncreditors often complain about the delays and expense of trying to \ncollect debts owed them.\n  On bill provisions, the bill provides the following reforms:\n  It creates streamlined, standardized forms so small business \nbankruptcies can be more cheaply managed by small business debtors. \nUnder present law, a chapter 11 reorganization is made expensive by the \nneed to tailor a plan and disclosure statement, a job done by a highly \npaid lawyer.\n  The bill creates nationwide uniform reporting requirements so that \nchapter 11 cases involving a small business can be standardized, \nsimplifying the procedures debtors must comply with.\n  The bill standardizes the information a small business must provide \nto the trustee, like tax returns, schedules, financials and the like.\n  Debtors must meet plan filing and confirmation time deadline \nstandards, specially developed for small business cases.\n  The duties of the United States trustee with respect to a small \nbusiness case are spelled out.\n  The bill also contains controls on abusive use of chapter 11, like \nmultiple filing of cases and unreasonable delay in resolving the case.\n  It contains a study of small business bankruptcy by the Small \nBusiness Administration.\n  Requires in single asset real estate company cases that interest be \npaid to creditors at a certain point in the case.\n  Provides administrative expense priority to any amount the debtor \nowes arising from certain real estate lease defaults.\n  In response, Congress created in 1994 a National Bankruptcy Review \nCommission to study the bankruptcy laws and suggest reforms, which \nclosely studied small business bankruptcy and recommended reforms. The \nprovisions the Kerry amendment would cut out are the result of those \nrecommendations.\n  The NBRC found that small business bankruptcies needed reforms in \norder to benefit both small business debtors and to benefit small \nbusinesses when they were creditors. The bill provides the protections \nand benefits the NBRC recommended.\n  The amendments streamline bankruptcy for small businesses. It allows \nthem to save lawyer fees. It allows them to promptly reorganize, to \ntheir benefit and that of their creditors.\n  Additional study is unnecessary. This matter has already been studied \nfor 4 years by a blue ribbon panel of bankruptcy experts, who \nunanimously recommended the reforms. But even if more study is \nnecessary, the bill provides for the same study Senator Kerry is now \nproposing.\n  Oppose the Kerry amendment. Senator Kerry last year sponsored an \namendment that seriously impaired the reforms in this part of the bill. \nHe now seeks to gut them completely. It is clear that he opposes all \nreform. Yet reform is needed.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I wish to respond to Senator Kerry's comments about my \nrepresentation of the Bankruptcy Review Commission.\n  The commissioners themselves said the vote was 8 to 1 on the small \nbusiness provisions. So it is not accurate that there are major \ntensions with respect to these provisions.\n  I have a letter that I will put in the Record that shows a former \ncommissioner of the Bankruptcy Commission saying the vote was 8 to 1 on \nthe small business provisions.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                       Bankruptcy Tax Consultant\n\n     To: Senator Charles E. Grassley\n     From: James I. Shepard\n       Senator Grassley: The National Bankruptcy Review Commission \n     adopted the Small Business Provisions in its report with \n     solid support, the vote was 8 to 1 in favor. There was little \n     dissension, the vote was NOT 5 to 4 as has been stated, the \n     Commission was not bitterly divided but, in fact, was \n     strongly in favor of the provisions.\n           Thank You,\n                                                 James I.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Massachusetts \nwishes to speak for a few moments about an unrelated issue, perhaps. \nBefore he does that, I want to notify all Senators that we are trying \nto work to get an agreement on how to proceed for the balance of today, \nFriday, and next week.\n  I had hoped we could get a list of amendments that would be offered, \na realistic list, and in return we would agree that there would be no \nfurther votes this afternoon, or tomorrow, even though we will continue \ntrying to work and also have work completed on Monday.\n  I say to both sides of the aisle that I am getting disturbed that the \nleadership continues to bend over backward to try to accommodate \neverybody's schedule. We are not getting a lot of response in kind. \nSenators don't particularly want to vote on Tuesday afternoons. \nSenators don't wish to be here on Friday or on Monday. Senators come up \nwith--we have probably close to a hundred amendments on the bankruptcy \nbill on the two sides. We must finish this bill next week, by Thursday \nnight. I don't want to file cloture, but when I look at the list with \nwhich we have just been presented, and considering the fact there is no \ndesire to work on Friday, it is not practical that we can finish this \nup by next Thursday, unless we find some way to cut down the amendments \nconsiderably, move faster, or file cloture.\n  After that, we have to go to campaign finance reform, on Monday, the \n19th. We are going to have to do the budget resolution in a relatively \nshort period of time, in the next month or so. We have to do the \neducation bill. Good work is being done in that committee. Basically, \nbankruptcy is going to have to be done next week. I don't want to cut \nanybody off.\n  We have bent over backward in many ways to get this bill done. We are \ngoing to try to get an agreement as to how this bill will be completed \nby next Thursday night. Senator Daschle may want to comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I add my voice to the majority leader's \nadmonition to all of those who have amendments. He and I have worked on \nthis from the very beginning of the year and have used the regular \norder to accommodate all Senators, first in committee, and now on the \nfloor.\n  I don't have any qualms about the interests on the part of so many \nSenators to express themselves. That is what the legislative process is \nall about. But let me say this will not be the only bill we take up \nthis year. There will be other legislation. It is fair to say that if \ncloture is filed--and I hope that will be unnecessary--it will probably \nbe invoked.\n  Senator Lott came to me a few minutes ago to express an interest in \nfiling--even today. I urged him to hold off filing today in order to \naccommodate Senators who may have amendments that are not relevant. In \norder for that to happen, we have to see, give and take on both sides. \nWe are going to have to have a unanimous consent agreement that if he \nholds off on filing cloture, we can have that vote, perhaps Wednesday, \nso we can finish on Friday. Like he has noted, we have campaign finance \nreform that is already part of a unanimous consent agreement scheduled \nfor the week after. So there is no question that we are going to have \nto finish this bill next week. There are over a hundred amendments. I \nthink it is going to require some real cooperation on the part of all \nSenators, if we are going to address this matter in a meaningful way, \norderly way, and in a way that is fair.\n\n  Anybody can object to the unanimous consent request we are going to \nmake. If I were the majority leader, I guess if that were the case, I \nwould probably file cloture and move on. I hope that won't be \nnecessary. I hope we can accommodate those Senators who have amendments \nthat are not necessarily germane, but I hope we can finish the bill.\n  I hope those who have a litany of amendments--some Senators have \nexpressed an interest in offering 8 to 10 amendments. I am not very \nsympathetic to that. There are a lot of other issues out there that can \nbe addressed on other bills down the road. So let's show a little \ncooperation, a little effort to be accommodating. Let's recognize that \nwe have a lot of work to do. The only way we will get it done is if \neverybody plays fairly and does what they can to accommodate the needs \nof scheduling.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the two leaders, I have spoken to Senator Conrad \nand he has a very important amendment pending. He said he would be \nwilling to speak tomorrow for a reasonable period of time, and Monday \nthere would be ample opportunity to offer lots of amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say that I appreciate that. I \nunderstand Senator Bingaman has an amendment that he can offer now, and \nwe could continue to make progress. His amendment has been cleared. So \nwe will continue to work. It may be necessary to be in session \ntomorrow. We are working on another issue to get completed tonight or \nfirst thing in the morning--in spite of the fact that I had hoped we \ncould get a limited list of amendments--a reasonable one--in return for \nnot having further votes tonight or tomorrow, but we didn't get \nthat. We did not get that, but I did want to say there will be no \nfurther votes today. Members are encouraged to continue to offer \namendments. We will work tonight, perhaps tomorrow. There will be votes \non next Tuesday morning as previously ordered and on Tuesday at 2:45 \np.m.\n\n  Again, it is previously ordered. I want Senators to understand we \nwill have a vote Tuesday morning. So Senators need to be here on Monday \nin order to be here for the recorded vote Tuesday morning.\n  In that connection, again I urge Senators to continue to work \ntonight, come to the floor and work with the managers to offer \namendments tomorrow and/or Monday.\n  I believe we are ready to propound a unanimous consent request.\n  After consultation with Senator Daschle, I ask unanimous consent that \nany votes ordered for today be postponed and stacked to occur beginning \nat 11 a.m. on Tuesday, March 13, with the concurrence of both managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2053]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 5 \nminutes equally divided for explanation of each amendment beginning at \n10 a.m. on Tuesday, to be debated in the order they were offered. In \nother words, even if debate occurs later today or Monday--just so \nSenators understand--before the vote there will be 5 minutes equally \ndivided on each amendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that when the votes occur at 11 a.m. \non Tuesday, the first vote be limited to 15 minutes in length, with all \nsucceeding votes 10 minutes in length.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that all first-degree amendments in \norder to the pending S. 420 be limited to the following list which I \nnow send to the desk, and any second-degree amendments must be relevant \nto the first-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, by way of explanation, am I correct in \nassuming that this does not preclude us from offering an amendment that \ncan be adopted by voice vote?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it would have to be on the list.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. It is the one I called up earlier.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the Senator from New Mexico has two listed. I \nbelieve his amendment is one of these two that are listed.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. We can vote that this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. In light of the agreement, Mr. President, there will be no \nfurther votes tonight. The Senate will be considering the bill over the \nnext couple of days, hopefully tomorrow as well as Monday, so that \namendments can be offered and debated. The next votes will occur \nbeginning at 11 a.m. on Tuesday.\n  In addition, the lockbox votes are scheduled to occur at 2:45 p.m. on \nTuesday. I urge Senators who have amendments to schedule floor time \nwith the managers. Again, I hope there is no desire to try to drag this \nout through the week and not complete it. I do not think that would be \nfair to anybody. We have other work to do. Senator Daschle has assured \nme, as he just said, that he understands and wants to join in getting \nthis done by next Thursday night or Friday morning.\n  As we assess the situation, if it becomes necessary, I will be \nprepared to file cloture on Monday or Tuesday so we can finish this not \nlater than Thursday night or Friday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, there is an amendment that I sent to the \ndesk and explained earlier on energy assistance. I ask unanimous \nconsent that my colleague, Senator Domenici, be added as a cosponsor of \nthat amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that after \nthe vote on this amendment, which I expect in the next 3 or 4 minutes \nafter I speak and Senator Murkowski speaks, Senator Kerry from \nMassachusetts be allowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 28, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send a modification of my amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, reads as follows:\n\n[[Page S2054]]\n\n   (Purpose: To increase the authorization of appropriations for low-\n income energy assistance, weatherization, and State energy emergency \n      planning programs, to increase Federal energy efficiency by \n facilitating the use of private-sector partnerships to prevent energy \n                and water waste, and for other purposes)\n\n       Strike all and insert the following:\n\n      TITLE--EMERGENCY ENERGY ASSISTANCE AND CONSERVATION MEASURES\n\n     SEC.  01.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title and the amendments made by this title shall take \n     effect upon the date of enactment of this title.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, for clarification, this modification \nmerely changes the effective date of the amendment. The amendment I \noffered will raise the amount authorized to be appropriated by this \nCongress for weatherization programs and for low-income home energy \nassistance programs. Those are programs that help individuals and \nfamilies around this country who are faced with rising and enormously \nincreased natural gas bills and electricity bills and those who will be \nfaced with substantial increases in those utility bills this summer for \nair-conditioning purposes.\n  It is important that we increase this authorization level and that we \ndo so right away. It is also important that we appropriate money \nquickly. I am hoping we will see progress on that front, working with \nthe administration in the next few weeks. I am certainly going to be \nurging the President and those in the Department of Energy to strongly \nsupport an appropriation in this area.\n  This is an important thing to do. This is not a substitute for a \ncomprehensive energy bill by any means. Senator Murkowski has \nintroduced a comprehensive bill. I am working on developing a bill that \nis also much more broad in its reach and deals with the long-term \nenergy needs of the country. This merely tries to deal with the \nimmediate crisis.\n  It is very important we do this. I am very pleased all Senators have \nindicated support for this measure.\n  I yield the floor. I know Senator Murkowski wishes to speak on this \nsame subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  I join Senator Bingaman in urging support of the Bingaman amendment. \nIt is cleared, as he indicated, on our side. I remind my colleagues \nthat energy affects America's families and businesses. We are seeing \nhigher energy costs, lost jobs, and reduced prosperity. We know, as \nSenator Bingaman indicated, that the amendment cannot replace the need \nfor a comprehensive energy policy.\n  We have a crisis in this country. We are addressing the symptoms and \nnot the causes. That is easier said than done. We are going to have to \nget into those causes. We certainly agree we need to provide additional \nfunds for the weatherization assistance and the LIHEAP program.\n  As you might know, Mr. President, these programs are in title VI of \nthe\n\n[[Page S2055]]\n\nMurkowski-Breaux National Energy Security Act of 2001. Let me explain \nbriefly the difference because we are very close.\n  As Senator Bingaman knows, we are going to be holding hearings on \nthese matters beginning next week. We will hold a hearing each week.\n  On LIHEAP, we have proposed an increased base from $2 billion to $3 \nbillion and an increase in emergency funds from $600 million to $1 \nbillion. The Bingaman amendment increases the base from $2 billion to \n$3.4 billion, so there is an increase. However, there are no emergency \nfunds.\n  In weatherization, Senator Bingaman's proposal and our proposal in \ntitle VI increases to $500 million by the year 2005. In weatherization \nState energy programs, we propose an increase of $125 million by 2005, \nand it is my understanding the Bingaman amendment proposes $75 million \nby 2005. We have set State energy efficiency goals to reduce energy use \nby 25 percent by 2010, compared to 1990 levels, and we encourage State \nand regional energy planning to go ahead.\n  I remind everyone, while we need immediate relief until we get an \nenergy plan passed in its entirety that addresses supply and \nconservation, we are not going to have the immediate relief we would \nlike. We only increase authorizations by this in a sense. It is better \nto address these programs, along with the other energy needs, through \nthe comprehensive approach which I think is an obligation of the Energy \nCommittee which we collectively work toward. A piecemeal approach to \nenergy policy hasn't gotten us anywhere and that is part of the problem \nof where we are today.\n\n  My point is, for example, what are we going to do this summer when \ngasoline supplies run short, as they are expected to do, and the \nconsumers pay up to $2 per gallon? Will we take the opportunity now to \naddress the need for refining capacity in a comprehensive bill while we \nhave the opportunity? Or will we avoid the tough political expensive \ndecisions and instead come back here at a later time and increase \nLIHEAP yet again?\n  I think the time has come to make those tough decisions. I look \nforward to working with my colleague. We want to find a solution to add \nfuel to the tank of our economic engine now that it is running almost \non empty. We will have to enact this year a comprehensive national \nenergy policy. Otherwise, we will be forever chasing high energy prices \nwith yet more temporary funds and placing the economic health and the \nnational security of the country at risk.\n  Just as we can and need to get our way out of this energy crisis, we \ncannot buy our way out. The energy crisis, as we know, will not go away \nuntil we make the tough decisions that are needed to increase the \nsupply of conventional fuels and improve our energy efficiency and \nconservation and expand the use of alternative fuel and renewables.\n  I congratulate Senator Bingaman and would like to be added as a \ncosponsor to his legislation.\n  I again reemphasize the reality that the American people expect us to \naddress this crisis that impacts every American family. This amendment \ndoes not solve the underlying problem we face. We should and must \naddress the illness, not the symptoms.\n  We must develop a comprehensive national energy strategy; again, one \nthat ensures clean, secure, and affordable energy supply into the next \ndecade.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague and others to develop \nthis comprehensive energy strategy.\n  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my understanding there is no further \ndebate, this is accepted, and we can vote now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is further debate on the amendment, \nthe question is on agreeing to the amendment, No. 28, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 28), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2055-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2055-S2056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NORTH KOREA\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I was briefly downstairs in a meeting with \nPresident Kim Dae Jung of South Korea. I will take a few moments to \nshare with my colleagues some thoughts about our policy with respect to \nNorth Korea, which obviously has profound implications for the region, \nas well as for the United States.\n  Mr. President, one of the major questions facing the United States \nand its South Korean and Japanese allies is how to deal with the \nballistic missile threat posed by North Korea. Pyongyang has already \ndemonstrated its capacity to launch a 500 kilogram warhead to a range \nof at least 1000 kilometers. The failed test of the Taepo Dong-2 \nmissile in August 1999 clearly shows North Korea's interest in \ndeveloping a longer range missile capability. North Korea's \nproliferation of missiles, missile components, technology and training \nto states such as Pakistan and Iran further magnifies the need to get \nPyongyang to end its missile program.\n  The Clinton administration left a framework on the table which could, \nif pursued aggressively by the Bush administration, go a long way \ntoward reducing the threat posed by North Korean missiles and missile \nexports. Our South Korean allies clearly want us to continue the \ndiscussions that the Clinton administration began with North Korea on \nthe missile question. Two days ago Secretary of State Colin Powell \nstated that the Bush administration would ``pick up'' where the Clinton \nadministration left off. Apparently not. Yesterday, President Bush told \nvisiting South Korean President Kim Dae Jung that the administration \nwould not resume missile talks with North Korea any time soon. I \nbelieve this is a serious mistake in judgment. I will suggest why.\n  Our South Korean allies are on the front line; they are under no \nillusions about the regime in North Korea or its leader Kim Jong II. \nPresident Kim firmly believes that Washington and Seoul must continue \ntheir efforts to open up North Korea, and that the United States should \nmove quickly to resume the missile talks. We should listen to him \ncarefully. I and others raised this issue with Secretary Powell earlier \ntoday, when he testified before the Foreign Relations Committee. The \nSecretary indicated that some of the things put on the table by the \nClinton administration are ``promising'' but that monitoring and \nverification ``are not there.'' He said that the Bush administration \nintended to do a comprehensive policy review and then would decide when \nand how to engage North Korea.\n  I don't think any of us in the Senate would second-guess the right or \neven the good sense of a new administration conducting a thorough \nreview of a particular area of the world or a particular policy. That \nmakes sense. However, I am deeply concerned that by sending the message \nwe will not even engage in a continuation of talks where the Clinton \nadministration left off, that we wind up potentially offering an \nopportunity to see a window closed or for people to misinterpret the \nlong-term intentions of the United States and perhaps make it more \ndifficult to pick up where the Clinton administration left off when and \nif the administration resumes.\n  We need to reflect on the fact that North Korea took some remarkable \nsteps, heretofore unimaginable steps, and under the 1994 agreed \nframework, North Korea set about to freeze its existing nuclear energy \nprogram under the IAEA supervision to permit special inspections to \ndetermine the past operating history of its reactor program just prior \nto the delivery of key components of light-water reactors.\n  A few years ago when the United States was concerned that North Korea \nwas violating the agreed framework by possibly building a new reactor \nin an underground site at Kumchangi-ri, North Korea ultimately allowed \na team of Americans to inspect the site, first in May of 1999 and each \nyear thereafter.\n  This showed, clearly, that monitoring and verification agreements can\n\n[[Page S2056]]\n\nbe negotiated with North Korea. By the 11th hour of the Clinton \nadministration, the United States and North Korea were discussing \nfurther proposals that would, indeed, prevent North Korea from \ndeveloping missiles capable of striking the United States and bring a \nhalt to North Korea's lucrative missile exports.\n  In my view, at this moment, now, we should still be encouraging \nprogress in those particular areas. We should be particularly \nencouraging Pyongyang to continue down that path, not sending them a \nmessage that may, in fact, make it months later and far more difficult \nbefore we can do so. Delaying missile talks will not enhance the \nsecurity of the United States or of the region about which we care. In \nfact, delay, coupled at this morning's hearing with Secretary Powell's \nsomewhat lukewarm endorsement of the agreed framework could send a very \nnegative signal about the nature and direction of United States policy \ntoward North Korea.\n  The Clinton administration, in many people's judgment, may well have \nmoved faster than some believed was prudent. But the reality is that \nnegotiations have begun and proposals are on the table for discussion. \nNothing has been agreed upon yet. There is no reason this \nadministration could not pick up where the Clinton administration left \noff, even as it makes the decision to review and discuss alternative \nproposals. Nothing will preclude them from ensuring adequate monitoring \nand verification.\n  The issue of North Korea's missile capability is fundamental not only \nto security on the Korean peninsula but also to our own long-term \nsecurity and also to the debate on national missile defense. The North \nKorean missile threat has been offered by the Bush administration and \nothers as a major reason why the United States needs to move more \nrapidly with the National Missile Defense System. Given that, I am \nsomewhat confused by the administration's go-slow approach on the \nmissile talks with Pyongyang. If we can reduce or eliminate the threat \nposed by North Korea's missile program, not only to us but to others, \nwe are going to be on a very different playing field. We will have \ngreater security, on the one hand, and we will be able to look at other \nnational missile defense options that may be less costly and less \ndamaging to the arms control regime established by the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile treaty. With all of this in the balance, it seems to me that \nthere is little to lose--and potentially much to gain--by getting back \nto the table with Pyongyang and seeing where the negotiations go.\n\n  It is my hope that this administration will rapidly move to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2056-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2056-S2057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE LOCKBOX\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to strongly \nsupport the Conrad amendment that is before us which would create a \nlockbox for Social Security and for Medicare.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I have watched and listened to \nthe proposals of the administration as they relate not only to the tax \ncut before us but the spending priorities. I listened on the evening of \nthe State of the Union to a variety of proposals, all of which sounded \nvery good. In fact, in some cases sitting there knowing our fiscal \nconstraints, it sounded too good to be true.\n  I find as a member of the Budget Committee looking at the details now \nthat, in fact, it was too good to be true, and the budget that has been \nproposed proposes to use all of the Medicare trust fund and a portion \nof the Social Security trust fund in order to balance this budget. \nThere is still a question about whether or not it adds up.\n  If we proceed as this body and the House of Representatives voted \nlast year to protect Social Security and Medicare to keep it out of the \nrevenue stream for spending proposals, if we support the lockbox \nnotion, which I hope we will--again, it passed this body by 60 votes \nlast year, and I am hopeful it will do the same this year--if we pull \nthose dollars out and protect them as the people of the country expect \nus to do, not only the seniors but the baby boomers who will be \nretiring in large numbers beginning in about 11 years, and also my son \nand daughter who are young people, can look forward to the future \nexpecting us to protect those funds. We find that the President's \nproposal for his tax cut takes up literally the entire discretionary \ndollars available to us except for Social Security and Medicare of over \nthe next 10 years. That is assuming we believe the projections, and we \ncertainly hope they are true for the dollars that have been projected \nin surplus.\n\n  But we all know, as Chairman Greenspan indicated, that these are \neducated guesses.\n  Given the fact that if you protect Social Security and Medicare, the \nPresident's tax proposal takes every dollar of discretionary income \nleft, rather than the next 10 years and being able to balance that with \nsome dollars for investments in education, infrastructure, prescription \ndrug coverage for Medicare, and balancing that with an important tax \ncut for middle-class families, it doesn't add up. The administration \nhas chosen to dip into Medicare and Social Security in order to be able \nto provide dollars for important investments in the American people's \npriorities in terms of education and other areas.\n  If you protect Social Security and Medicare, the dollars are not \nthere for education.\n  The President has said we are going to say the Medicare trust fund \ndoesn't exist anymore. We heard in front of the Budget Committee from \nour new Treasury Secretary, as well as the Director of Management and \nBudget, that they believe there really isn't a trust fund; that, in \nfact, there isn't a surplus in Medicare, even though every year we get \nreports regarding the solvency of the trust fund and the date at which \nit will become insolvent, and the fact that the date has been growing \nfurther into the future because of the good economy.\n  Now we fear there is, in fact, no trust fund. Those reports, I guess, \nmeant nothing before.\n  In reality, there is a Medicare trust fund. We know that Part A has \nbeen an important part of the solvency of Medicare, and this trust fund \nis critical in maintaining and protecting the health care benefits for \nthe seniors and future generations in our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to send a very strong message to the White House \nand to the American people that we intend to keep the promises of \nMedicare and Social Security, and to lock away the Medicare trust fund \nalong with every penny of Social Security so that we will keep those as \na separate promise and protect them for our seniors, for our families, \nand for future generations.\n  Without this lockbox, we will find ourselves in the situation of \nseeing the budget continue down the road with the full intention of \nusing the entire Medicare trust fund in order to balance the books, and \na portion of Social Security in order to balance the books.\n  That is not in the best interest of the American people. We can do \nbetter than that. We can design a budget that protects Social Security \nand Medicare and strengthens it for the future, provide a real tax cut \nfor middle-class families, small businesses, and family farmers in this \ncountry, and also pay down the debt so the interest rates our citizens \nand businesses are paying for will continue to go down, and at the same \ntime invest in the priority that President Bush has articulated well--\nand I agree with--which is the question of education and investing in \nthe future for our children.\n  This budget is about more than numbers. It is about our values as \nAmerican people. In times when we have choices that we can make because \nof projected surpluses, the real task for each of us is what will be \nour priority? What will the choices be when we can make choices?\n  I strongly hope one of the choices made by this Congress and \nadministration is not to use the entire Medicare trust fund to fund \nother purposes in the budget; that we will join together on a \nbipartisan basis, as has been done in the past when Republicans and \nDemocrats joined together to support locking away the Social Security \ntrust fund and the Medicare trust fund so that they are outside the \nbudget stream and are protected for now and the future.\n\n[[Page S2057]]\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes now while we \nwait on other Senators who may want to comment on what I am about to \nsay. But I want to thank the chairmen and the ranking members of the \ncommittees who have worked together over the past 6 weeks to get an \nagreement on the committee rules and the funding and staffing and space \narrangements for the Senate committees this year.\n  Senator Daschle and I worked through a very difficult process to get \nthe organization resolution passed back in January. But in some \nrespects that was the easy part, even though that was not easy. It was \neasier than what the chairmen and ranking members had to go through. \nEach committee had to deal with how they were going to proceed with the \n50-50 division of Members. They had to work on different rules of \ndifferent committees, different personalities, and different \nresponsibilities.\n  Most of the committees went through it at a pretty quick pace. Some \nof them were more difficult and were more complex.\n  When the time came the beginning of March for us to pass the funding \nresolution, not all had been done. There were, I guess, two or three \ncommittees that still had some serious reservations or disagreements. \nBut for those committees we extended the time without a lot of \ndifficulty. And those committees have continued to work together, and \nthey have reached agreement, one by one.\n  Then we were down to just one final committee, and they have reached \nan agreement--Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy. I know it was not easy \nfor either one of them, but I want to thank all who have been involved \nfor the effort that has been put into this. I think it still bodes well \nthat we can work together through difficult issues in a bipartisan way.\n  Having said that, we are ready to go now, and we are ready to \ndischarge the Rules Committee and adopt this resolution. I understand \nthere has been an objection to it being done through the discharge \nmechanism, that they want the Judiciary Committee to act, and then they \nwant the Rules Committee to meet.\n  I note that it is 10 minutes until 5 on Thursday. Members were told \nthere would not be any further votes. So, once again, I am saying all \nthis and pointing out that, while I am trying very hard, it is still \nvery difficult to get things done without them being complicated. There \nis no reason why we should not discharge the committee and get this \ndone after all of the good work that is being done. I am going to say, \nflat out, I suspect there is staff involved in this. It is uncalled \nfor, and it is being, in my opinion, petty to have to track down \nMembers to try to get them to come running over to try to get some sort \nof running quorum, and to have a vote. And then, by the way, what if we \ndon't get them? What are we going to do, after all this work?\n  So, Mr. President, I ask Senator Reid, can we move this forward? \nAfter all that Senator Daschle and I have done, and all that has been \ndone by all the Members, on both sides--including the chairman and \nranking member on Judiciary--can't we move this through now?\n  Mr. REID. The Judiciary Committee has completed their work. That part \nis out of the way. Would the leader allow me to suggest the absence of \na quorum for a brief moment?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2057-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMITTEE EXPENDITURES\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The presiding \n     member of the meeting or hearing may for good cause \n     terminate, in whole or in part, the use of such mechanical \n     devices or take such other action as the circumstances and \n     the orderly conduct of the meeting or hearing may warrant.\n\n\n                              VI. GENERAL\n\n       All applicable requirements of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate shall govern the Committee.\n\n\n                     VII.

The Committee form shall be in two parts--\n\n       (A) information concerning employment, education, and \n     background of the nominee which generally relates to the \n     position to which the individual is nominated, and which is \n     to be made public; and\n       (B) information concerning the financial and other \n     background of the nominee, to be made public when the \n     Committee determines that such information bears directly on \n     the nominee's qualifications to hold the position to which \n     the individual is nominated.\n       Committee action on a nomination, including hearings or a \n     meeting to consider a motion to recommend confirmation, shall \n     not be initiated until at least five days after the nominee \n     submits the form required by this rule unless the Chairman, \n     with the concurrence of the Ranking Minority Member, waives \n     this waiting period.\n       (b) At any hearing to confirm a Presidential nomination, \n     the testimony of the nominee and, at the request of any \n     Member, any other witness shall be under oath.\n\n\n       VIII. NAMING OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FACILITIES\n\n       It is the policy of the Committee that no Department of \n     Veterans Affairs facility shall be named after any individual \n     unless--\n       (A) such individual is deceased and was--\n       (1) a veteran who (i) was instrumental in the construction \n     or the operation of the facility to be named, or (ii) was a \n     recipient of the Medal of Honor or, as determined by the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, otherwise performed \n     military service of an extraordinarily distinguished \n     character;\n       (2) a member of the United States House of Representatives \n     or Senate who had a direct association with such facility;\n       (3) an Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, a Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs, a Secretary of Defense or of a service \n     branch, or a military or other Federal civilian official of \n     comparable or higher rank; or\n       (4) an individual who, as determined by the Chairman and \n     Ranking Minority Member, performed outstanding service for \n     veterans;\n       (B) each member of the Congressional delegation \n     representing the State in which the designated facility is \n     located has indicated in writing such member's support of the \n     proposal to name such facility after such individual; and\n       (C) the pertinent State department or chapter of each \n     Congressionally chartered veterans' organization having a \n     national membership of at least 500,000 has indicated in \n     writing its support of such proposal.\n\n\n                      IX.

Mr. President, Senate Standing Rule XXVI requires each \ncommittee to adopt rules to govern the procedures of the Committee and \nto publish those rules in the Congressional Record not later than March \n1 of the first year of each Congress.

In \naddition, a majority of members of the Committee's Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations adopted subcommittee rules of procedure \non March 2, 2001.\n  Consistent with Standing Rules XXVI, today I am submitting for \nprinting in the Congressional Record a copy of the rules of the Senate \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs and its Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Rules of Procedure for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on \n        Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs\n\n       1.

In all cases, notification to \n     all Members of the intent to hold hearings must be given at \n     least 7 days in advance to the date of the hearing. The \n     Ranking Minority Member should be kept fully apprised of \n     preliminary inquiries, investigations, and hearings. \n     Preliminary inquiries may be initiated by the Subcommittee \n     majority staff upon the approval of the Chairman and notice \n     of such approval to the Ranking Minority Member or the \n     minority counsel. Preliminary inquiries may be undertaken by \n     the minority staff upon the approval of the Ranking Minority \n     Member and notice of such approval to the Chairman or Chief \n     Counsel. Investigations may be undertaken upon the approval \n     of the Chairman of the Subcommittee and the Ranking Minority \n     Member with notice of such approval to all members.\n       No public hearing shall be held if the minority Members \n     unanimously object, unless the full Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs by a majority vote approves of such public hearing.\n       Senate Rules will govern all closed sessions convened by \n     the Subcommittee (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate).\n       2. Subpoenas for witnesses, as well as documents and \n     records, may be authorized and issued by the Chairman, or any \n     other Member of the Subcommittee designated by him, with \n     notice to the Ranking Minority Member. A written notice of \n     intent to issue a subpoena shall be provided to the Chairman \n     and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, or staff \n     officers designated by them, by the Subcommittee Chairman or \n     a staff officer designated by him, immediately upon such \n     authorization, and no subpoena shall issue for at least 48 \n     hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, from delivery to the \n     appropriate offices, unless the Chairman and Ranking Minority \n     Member waive the 48 hour waiting period or unless the \n     Subcommittee Chairman certifies in writing to the Chairman \n     and Ranking Minority Member that, in his opinion, it is \n     necessary to issue a subpoena immediately.\n       3. The Chairman shall have the authority to call meetings \n     of the Subcommittee. This authority may be delegated by the \n     Chairman to any other Member of the Subcommittee when \n     necessary.\n       4. If at least three Members of the Subcommittee desire the \n     Chairman to call a special meeting, they may file in the \n     office of the Subcommittee, a written request therefor, \n     addressed to the Chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk \n     of the Subcommittee shall notify the Chairman of such \n     request. If, within 3 calendar days after the filing of such \n     request, the Chairman fails to call the requested special \n     meeting, which is to be held within 7 calendar days after the \n     filing of such request, a majority of the Subcommittee \n     Members may file in the office of the Subcommittee their \n     written notice that a special Subcommittee meeting will be \n     held, specifying the date and hour thereof, and the \n     Subcommittee shall meet on that date and hour. Immediately \n     upon the filing of such notice, the Subcommittee clerk \n     shall notify all Subcommittee Members that such special \n     meeting will be held and inform them of its dates and \n     hour. If the Chairman is not present at any regular, \n     additional or special meeting, the ranking majority Member \n     present shall preside.\n       5. For public or executive sessions, one Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall constitute a quorum for the administering \n     of oaths and the taking of testimony in any given case or \n     subject matter.\n       Five (5) Members of the Subcommittee shall constitute a \n     quorum for the transaction of Subcommittee business other \n     than the administering of oaths and the taking of testimony.\n       6. All witnesses at public or executive hearings who \n     testify to matters of fact shall be sworn.\n       7. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, his \n     counsel, or any spectator conducts himself in such a manner \n     as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with \n     the orderly administration of such hearing, the Chairman or \n     presiding Member of the Subcommittee present during such \n     hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, his \n     representative or any law enforcement official to eject said \n     person from the hearing room.\n       8. Counsel retained by any witness and accompanying such \n     witness shall be permitted to be present during the testimony \n     of such witness at any public or executive hearing, and to \n     advise such witness while he is testifying, of his legal \n     rights, Provided, however, that in the case of any witness \n     who is an officer or employee of the government, or of a \n     corporation or association, the Subcommittee Chairman may \n     rule that representation by counsel from the government, \n     corporation, or association, or by counsel representing other \n     witnesses, creates a conflict of interest, and that the \n     witness may only be represented during interrogation by staff \n     or during testimony before the Subcommittee by personal \n     counsel not from the government, corporation, or association, \n     or by personal counsel not representing other witnesses. This \n     rule shall not be construed to excuse a witness from \n     testifying in the event his counsel is ejected for conducting \n     himself in such a manner so as to prevent, impede, disrupt, \n     obstruct, or interfere with the orderly administration of the \n     hearings; nor shall this rule be construed as authorizing\n\n[[Page S2060]]\n\n     counsel to coach the witness or answer for the witness. The \n     failure of any witness to secure counsel shall not excuse \n     such witness from complying with a subpoena or deposition \n     notice.\n       9. Depositions.\n       9.1 Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Subcommittee shall be \n     authorized and issued by the Chairman. The Chairman of the \n     full Committee and the Ranking Minority Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall be kept fully apprised of the \n     authorization for the taking of depositions. Such notices \n     shall specify a time and place of examination, and the name \n     of the Subcommittee Member or Members or staff officer or \n     officers who will take the deposition. The deposition \n     shall be in private. The Subcommittee shall not initiate \n     procedures leading to criminal or civil enforcement \n     proceedings for a witness' failure to appear unless the \n     deposition notice was accompanied by a Subcommittee \n     subpoena.\n       9.2 Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition \n     by counsel to advise them of their legal rights, subject to \n     the provisions of Rule 8.\n       9.3 Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Subcommittee Members or staff. Objections by the witness as \n     to the form of questions shall be noted for the record. If a \n     witness objects to a question and refuses to testify on the \n     basis of relevance or privilege, the Subcommittee Members or \n     staff may proceed with the deposition, or may, at that time \n     or at a subsequent time, seek a ruling by telephone or \n     otherwise on the objection from the Chairman or such \n     Subcommittee Member as designated by him. If the Chairman or \n     designated Member overrules the objection, he may refer the \n     matter to the Subcommittee or he may order and direct the \n     witness to answer the question, but the Subcommittee shall \n     not initiate procedures leading to civil or criminal \n     enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify after he \n     has been ordered and directed to answer by a Member of the \n     Subcommittee.\n       9.4 Filing. The Subcommittee staff shall see that the \n     testimony is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12. The individual \n     administering the oath shall certify on the transcript that \n     the witness was duly sworn in his presence, the transcriber \n     shall certify that the transcript is a true record of the \n     testimony, and the transcript shall then be filed with the \n     Subcommittee clerk. Subcommittee staff may stipulate with the \n     witness to changes in this procedure; deviations from this \n     procedure which do not substantially impair the reliability \n     of the record shall not relieve the witness from his \n     obligation to testify truthfully.\n       10. Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Chief Counsel or Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee 48 hours in advance of the hearings at which the \n     statement is to be presented unless the Chairman and the \n     Ranking Minority Member waive this requirement. The \n     Subcommittee shall determine whether such statement may be \n     read or placed in the record of the hearing.\n       11. A witness may request, on grounds of distraction, \n     harassment, personal safety, or physical discomfort, that \n     during the testimony, television, motion picture, and other \n     cameras and lights shall not be directed at him. Such \n     requests shall be ruled on by the Subcommittee Members \n     present at the hearing.\n       12. An accurate stenographic record shall be kept of the \n     testimony of all witnesses in executive and public hearings. \n     The record of his own testimony whether in public or \n     executive session shall be made available for inspection by \n     witness or his counsel under Subcommittee supervision; a copy \n     of any testimony given in public session or that part of \n     the testimony given by the witness in executive session \n     and subsequently quoted or made part of the record in a \n     public session shall be made available to any witness at \n     his expense if he so requests.\n       13. Interrogation of witnesses at Subcommittee hearings \n     shall be conducted on behalf of the Subcommittee by Members \n     and authorized Subcommittee staff personnel only.\n       14. Any person who is the subject of an investigation in \n     public hearings may submit to the Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee questions in writing for the cross-examination \n     of other witnesses called by the Subcommittee. With the \n     consent of a majority of the Members of the Subcommittee \n     present and voting, these questions, or paraphrased versions \n     of them, shall be put to the witness by the Chairman, by a \n     Member of the Subcommittee or by counsel of the Subcommittee.\n       15. Any person whose name is mentioned or who is \n     specifically identified, and who believes that testimony or \n     other evidence presented at a public hearing, or comment made \n     by a Subcommittee Member or counsel, tends to defame him or \n     otherwise adversely affect his reputation, may (a) request to \n     appear personally before the Subcommittee to testify in his \n     own behalf, or, in the alternative, (b) file a sworn \n     statement of facts relevant to the testimony or other \n     evidence or comment complained of. Such request and such \n     statement shall be submitted to the Subcommittee for its \n     consideration and action.\n       If a person requests to appear personally before the \n     Subcommittee pursuant to alternative (a) referred to herein, \n     said request shall be considered untimely if it is not \n     received by the Chairman of the Subcommittee or its counsel \n     in writing on or before thirty (30) days subsequent to the \n     day on which said person's name was mentioned or otherwise \n     specifically identified during a public hearing held before \n     the Subcommittee, unless the Chairman and the Ranking \n     Minority Member waive this requirement.\n       If a person requests the filing of his sworn statement \n     pursuant to alternative (b) referred to herein, the \n     Subcommittee may condition the filing of said sworn statement \n     upon said person agreeing to appear personally before the \n     Subcommittee and to testify concerning the matters contained \n     in his sworn statement, as well as any other matters related \n     to the subject of the investigation before the Subcommittee.\n       16. All testimony taken in executive session shall be kept \n     secret and will not be released for public information \n     without the approval of a majority of the Subcommittee.\n       17. No Subcommittee report shall be released to the public \n     unless approved by a majority of the Subcommittee and after \n     no less than 10 days' notice and opportunity for comment by \n     the Members of the Subcommittee unless the need for such \n     notice and opportunity to comment has been waived in writing \n     by a majority of the minority Members.\n       18. The Ranking Minority Member may select for appointment \n     to the Subcommittee staff a Chief Counsel for the minority \n     and such other professional staff members and clerical \n     assistants as he deems advisable. The total compensation \n     allocated to such minority staff members shall be not less \n     than one-third the total amount allocated for all \n     Subcommittee staff salaries during any given year. The \n     minority staff members shall work under the direction and \n     supervision of the Ranking Minority Member. The Chief Counsel \n     for the minority shall be kept fully informed as to \n     preliminary inquiries, investigations, and hearings, and \n     shall have access to all material in the files of the \n     Subcommittee.\n       19. When it is determined by the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Member, or by a majority of the Subcommittee, that \n     there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of law \n     may have occurred, the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member \n     by letter, or the Subcommittee by resolution, are authorized \n     to report such violation to the proper State, local and/or \n     Federal authorities. Such letter or report may recite the \n     basis for the determination of reasonable cause. This rule is \n     not authority for release of documents or testimony.\n\nRules of Procedure of the Committee on Governmental Affairs Pursuant to \n            Rule XXVI, Sec. 2, Standing Rules of the senate\n\n\n      RULE 1.

Calling special Committee meetings. If at least three \n     members of the Committee desire the chairman to call a \n     special meeting, they may file in the offices of the \n     Committee a written request therefor, addressed to the \n     chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk of the committee \n     shall notify the chairman of such request. If, within 3 \n     calendar days after the filing of such request, the chairman \n     fails to call the requested special meeting, which is to be \n     held within 7 calendar days after the filing of such request, \n     a majority of the committee members may file in the offices \n     of the committee their written notice that a special \n     Committee meeting will be held, specifying the date and hour \n     thereof, and the Committee shall meet on that date and hour. \n     Immediately upon the filing of such notice, the Committee \n     clerk shall notify all Committee members that such special \n     meeting will be held and inform them of its date and hour. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C.

Each hearing conducted by the Committee, \n     or any Subcommittee thereof, shall be open to the public, \n     except that a hearing or series of hearings on the same \n     subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days may be \n     closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into \n     closed session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated \n     in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the hearing to \n     be\n\n[[Page S2062]]\n\n     closed, followed immediately by a record vote in open session \n     by a majority of the Committee or Subcommittee members when \n     it is determined that the matters to be discussed or the \n     testimony to be taken at such hearing or hearings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or \n     Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or \n     procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the duty of the chairman to enforce \n     order on his own initiative and without any point of order \n     being made by a member of the Committee or Subcommittee; \n     provided, further, that when the chairman finds it necessary \n     to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear the room, \n     and the Committee or Subcommittee may act in closed session \n     for so long as there is doubt of the assurance of order. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(d), Standing rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Full Committee subpoenas. The chairman, with the \n     approval of the ranking minority member of the Committee, is \n     authorized to subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other \n     materials at a hearing or deposition, provided that the \n     chairman may subpoena attendance or production without the \n     approval of the ranking minority member where the chairman or \n     a staff officer designated by him has not received \n     notification from the ranking minority member or a staff \n     officer designated by him of disapproval of the subpoena \n     within 72 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being \n     notified of the subpoena. If a subpoena is dis- approved by \n     the ranking minority member as provided in this \n     subsection, the subpoena may be authorized by vote of the \n     members of the Committee. When the Committee or chairman \n     authorizes subpoenas, subpoenas may be issued upon the \n     signature of the chairman or any other member of the \n     Committee designated by the chairman.\n       D. Witness counsel. Counsel retained by any witness and \n     accompanying such witness shall be permitted to be present \n     during the testimony of such witness at any public or \n     executive hearing or deposition to advise such witness while \n     he or she is testifying, of his or her legal rights, \n     provided, however, that in the case of any witness who is an \n     officer or employee of the government, or of a corporation or \n     association, the Committee chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the government, corporation, \n     or association or by counsel representing, other witnesses, \n     creates a conflict of interest, and that the witness may only \n     be represented during interrogation by staff or during \n     testimony before the Committee by personal counsel not from \n     the government, corporation, or association or by personal \n     counsel not representing other witnesses. This subsection \n     shall not be construed to excuse a witness from testifying in \n     the event his counsel is ejected for conducting himself in \n     such manner so as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct or \n     interfere with the orderly administration of the hearings; \n     nor shall this subsection be construed as authorizing counsel \n     to coach the witness or answer for the witness. The failure \n     of any witness to secure counsel shall not excuse such \n     witness from complying with a subpoena or deposition notice.\n       E. Witness transcripts. An accurate electronic or \n     stenographic record shall be kept of the testimony of all \n     witnesses in executive and public hearings. The record of his \n     or her testimony whether in public or executive session shall \n     be made available for inspection by the witness or his or her \n     counsel under Committee supervision; a copy of any testimony \n     given in public session or that part of the testimony given \n     by the witness in executive session and subsequently quoted \n     or made part of the record in a public session shall be \n     provided to any witness at his or her expense if he or she so \n     requests. Upon inspecting his or her transcript, within a \n     time limit set by the chief clerk of the Committee, a witness \n     may request changes in the transcript to correct errors of \n     transcription and grammatical errors; the chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him shall rule on such requests.\n       F. Impugned persons. Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     is specifically identified, and who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a member of the Committee or \n     staff officer, at a public hearing or at a closed hearing \n     concerning which there have been public reports, tends to \n     impugn his or her character or adversely affect his or her \n     reputation may:\n       (a) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which statement shall be considered for \n     placement in the hearing record by the Committee;\n       (b) Request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his or her own behalf, which request \n     shall be considered by the Committee; and\n       (c) Submit questions in writing which he or she requests be \n     used for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by \n     the Committee, which questions shall be considered for use by \n     the Committee.\n       G. Radio, television, and photography. The Committee, or \n     any Subcommittee thereof, may permit the proceedings of \n     hearings which are open to the public to be photographed and \n     broadcast by radio, television or both, subject to such \n     conditions as the Committee, or Subcommittee, may impose. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       H. Advance statements of witnesses. A witness appearing \n     before the Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, shall \n     provide 100 copies of a written statement and an executive \n     summary or synopsis of his proposed testimony at least 48 \n     hours prior to his appearance. This requirement may be waived \n     by the chairman and the ranking minority member following \n     their determination that there is good cause for failure of \n     compliance. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(b), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       I. Minority witnesses. In any hearings conducted by the \n     Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, the minority members \n     of the Committee or Subcommittee shall be entitled, upon \n     request to the chairman by a majority of the minority \n     members, to call witnesses of their selection during at least \n     1 day of such hearings. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(d), Standing Rules \n     of the Senate.)\n       J. Full Committee depositions. Depositions may be taken \n     prior to or after a hearing as provided in this subsection.\n       (1) Notices for the taking of depositions shall be \n     authorized and issued by the chairman, with the approval of \n     the ranking minority member of the Committee, provided that \n     the chairman may initiate depositions without the approval of \n     the ranking minority member where the chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him has not received notification from \n     the ranking minority member or a staff officer designated by \n     him of disapproval of the deposition within 72 hours, \n     excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified of the \n     deposition notice. If a deposition notice is disapproved by \n     the ranking minority members as provided in this subsection, \n     the deposition notice may be authorized by a vote of the \n     members of the Committee. Committee deposition notices shall \n     specify a time and place for exmaination, and the name of the \n     Committee member or members or staff officer or officers who \n     will take the deposition. Unless otherwise--specified, the \n     deposition shall be in private. The Committee shall not \n     initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil \n     enforcement proceedings for a witness' failure to appear \n     or produce unless the deposition notice was accompanied by \n     a Committee subpoena.\n       (2) Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by counsel \n     to advise them of their legal rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule 5D.\n       (3) Oaths at depositions may be administered by an \n     individual authorized by local law to administer oaths. \n     Questions shall be propounded orally by Committee member or \n     members or staff. If a witness objects to a question and \n     refuses to testify, the objection shall be noted for the \n     record and the Committee member or members or staff may \n     proceed with the remainder of the deposition.\n       (4) The Committee shall see that the testimony is \n     transcribed or electronically recorded (which may include \n     audio or audio/video recordings). If it is transcribed, the \n     transcript shall be made available for inspection by the \n     witness or his or her counsel under Committee supervision. \n     The witness shall sign a copy of the transcript and may \n     request changes to it, which shall be handled in accordance \n     with the procedure set forth in subsection (E). If the \n     witness fails to sign a copy, the staff shall note that fact \n     on the transcript. The individual administering the oath \n     shall certify on the transcript that the witness was duly \n     sworn in his presence, the transcriber shall certify that the \n     transcript is a true record of the testimony, and the \n     transcript shall then be filed with the chief clerk of the \n     Committee. The chairman or a staff officer designated by him \n     may stipulate with the witness to changes in the procedure, \n     deviations from this procedure which do not substantially \n     impair the reliability of the record shall not relieve the \n     witness from his or her obligation to testify truthfully.\n\n\n                 RULE 6. COMMITTEE REPORTING PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Timely filing. When the Committee has ordered a measure \n     or matter reported following final action the report thereon \n     shall\n\n[[Page S2063]]\n\n     be filed in the Senate at the earliest practicable time. \n     (Rule XXVI Sec. 20(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       B.

Mr. President, today I'd like to commemorate \nInternational Women's Day. This day is an occasion to honor the many \nand diverse achievements and contributions of women worldwide, and the \nprogress that they have made toward equal rights. It is also an \nimportant time to reflect upon the hardships and injustices that \nmillions of women still face, and to reaffirm our commitment to take \nactions to overcome them and to further women's progress.\n  For nearly a century, women in communities across the globe have been \nuniting on March 8th to celebrate their achievements and to bring \nattention to their fight for equality, justice and peace. In that time \nwomen have made great strides toward equal participation in all spheres \nof life, and at all levels of decision-making.\n  Here in the United States, more women are earning college degrees, \nentering the workforce and starting their own businesses than ever \nbefore. Economic opportunities for women are expanding and home \nownership is up. Women are playing a greater role in shaping local, \nstate and federal policies that affect their families and them, as they \nare more active in the political process at all levels. The recent 2000 \nelections resulted once again in a record number of women serving in \nthe U.S. Senate, House of Representatives and as Governors of States. \nWe continue to see more women in top positions of federal agencies and \nin President's Cabinets. For the first time in American History, we \nhave a woman, Condoleezza Rice, serving as our National Security \nAdvisor to the President.\n  Despite these impressive strides, much work still needs to be done. \nWomen are still vastly under-represented at all levels of government. \nAlthough the gender wage-gap has narrowed since 1963, when Congress \nmandated equal pay for equal work, unfair wage disparities continue to \nbe a problem. Wage discrimination is costing families thousands of \ndollars each year. These financial losses, coupled with a lack of \naffordable quality child care, forces many women to still have to make \ndifficult choices about their children and their career.\n  Just this week, women lost an important battle when the U.S. Senate \nvoted to overturn the Occupational Health and Safety Administration's \nfinal ergonomics standard. This standard would have helped protect the \n1.8 million Americans workers who suffer workplace injuries caused by \nrepetitive motions. These injuries are particularly prevalent among \nwomen because many of the jobs held predominately by women require \nrepetitive motions or repetitive heavy lifting. So we must recognize \nthat there is still much work to be done in the area of equal rights \nfor women.\n  Today we must also consider the achievements and challenges of women \nabroad. As Ranking Member of the African Affairs Subcommittee of the \nSenate Committee on Foreign Relations, I have had the opportunity to \nlearn more about the status of women on that continent. Last month, as \nI traveled to the West African countries of Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and \nSenegal, I was reminded of the tremendously important role that women \nplay in the political, economic, and social fabric of that region and \nso many others. I met Nigerian women who have been prodding officials \nto face the HIV/AIDS crisis head-on; women working to build peace in \nSierra Leone, and women devoted to improving girls' education in \nSenegal. I am pleased to celebrate their achievements and contributions \ntoday.\n\n  However, millions of women in Africa and throughout the world face a \ngreat uphill battle before they will achieve full equality. Women are \nstill more likely than men to be poor, malnourished and illiterate, and \nhave less access to health care, financial credit, property ownership, \njob training and employment. In some places women are still denied the \nvery basic right to vote, to let their voices be heard.\n  Many girls and women around the world face tragic human rights abuses \ndaily, as victims of domestic violence, and exploitive practices such \nas illegal trafficking for slavery or prostitution. In some countries, \ndeplorable ``honor killings'' are still prevalent, where women are \nmurdered by their male relatives for actions--perceived or real--that \nare thought to bring dishonor on their families. In regions of \nconflict, rape and assaults on women are used as weapons of war, and \nperpetrators are rarely prosecuted.\n  For years, mass rape and sexual crimes have been considered normal \noccurrences of war, and only recently have these heinous crimes started \nto get the international attention that they deserve. An important \nvictory for girls and women occurred last month when the United Nations \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague, \nconvicted three men for rape, torture and enslavement during the war in \nBosnia. The international court set an important precedent by defining \nrape as a crime against humanity.\n  There are many important ways that we can further protect women's \nhuman rights and improve the status of women and their families both \ndomestically and internationally. One of the ways that the United \nStates Senate can work towards that end is by acting upon the United \nNations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination \nAgainst Women, CEDAW. Two decades have passed since the U.S. signed \nthis important treaty, and yet it remains pending before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. I once again call upon the committee to \nhold hearings on CEDAW so that the Senate can offer its advice and \nconsent on this treaty.\n  The U.S. can also support efforts to ensure that it is devoting \nsignificant resources to battling HIV/AIDS which is killing millions of \nwomen and their families, in Africa and other regions of the world. \nCongress can pass legislation such as the Paycheck Fairness Act to \nprovide more effective remedies to victims of salary discrimination on \nthe basis of gender. These are only a few of many initiatives that will \nimpact women's lives.\n  So, in closing as we mark International Women's Day, today and in the \nfuture, it is important for us to remember both the accomplishments of \nwomen and the many injustices that remain, and for the United States \nand the international community to reaffirm their commitment to \npromoting gender equity and human rights across the globe.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today is an important day for women\n\n[[Page S2065]]\n\nand girls around the world. Today, we stand firmly on the side of basic \nhuman rights. Today, we rededicate ourselves to a better tomorrow. \nToday, we state loud and clear to those who seek to do women harm, ``No \nmore.'' Today is March 8, 2001, International Women's Day.\n  Having spent many years trying to raise awareness about the need for \nequality for women and girls in the United States and around the world, \nI am encouraged by the advancements we have made since the United \nNations first designated March 8th as International Women's Day in \n1975. Nevertheless, we still have a long ways to go and I would like to \ntake this time to discuss several critical issues that I believe are \nvital to the lives of women and girls and require U.S. leadership: \ninternational family planning, the Convention on the Elimination of All \nForms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, sex trafficking, rape as \nan instrument of war, and the plight of women in Afghanistan.\n  Every Senator, I believe, is well aware of the issue of United States \nassistance to international family planning organizations. There have \nbeen few issues in recent years that have been more debated, with \npeople of good intentions on both sides of the issue. Consequently, I \nwas dismayed when President Bush opted to start his administration by \nreinstating the ``global gag rule'' restricting United States \nassistance to international family planning organizations.\n  Do we not understand the importance of family planning assistance? \nThere are now more than 6 billion people on this Earth. The United \nNations estimates this figure could be 12 billion by the year 2050. \nAlmost all of this growth will occur in the places least able to bear \nup under the pressures of massive population increases. The brunt will \nbe in developing countries lacking the resources needed to provide \nbasic health or education services.\n  Only if women have access to such educational and medical resources \nneeded to control their reproductive destinies and their health will \nthey be able to better their own lives and the lives of their families\n  No one should doubt that international family planning programs \nreduce poverty, improve health, and raise living standards around the \nworld; they enhance the ability of couples and individuals to determine \nthe number and spacing of their children.\n  Nevertheless, in recent years these programs have come under \nincreasing partisan attack by the anti-choice wing of the Republican \nparty, despite the fact that no U.S. international family planning \nfunds are spent on international abortion.\n  All American women, as they consider their own reproductive rights, \nshould consider the aim and intent of a policy in which the \nreproductive rights of American women are approached one way, and those \nof women in the developing world another.\n  Since President Bush is unlikely to change his mind, I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Global Democracy Act of 2001, introduced by \nmy friend and colleague from California, Senator Boxer. This important \npiece of legislation will allow foreign Non-Governmental Organizations \nthat receive U.S. family planning assistance to use non-U.S. funds to \nprovide legal abortion services, including counseling and referrals, \nand will lift the restrictions on lobbying and advocacy.\n  The United States must reclaim its leadership role on international \nfamily planning and reproductive issues. The United States must renew \nits commitment to help those around the world who need and want our \nhelp and assistance. On International Women's Day, I urge my colleagues \nto support the Global Democracy Act of 2001.\n\n  Last year, I was proud to join a bi-partisan group of women Senators \nin co-sponsoring Senate Resolution 237, a resolution expressing the \nsense of the Senate that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee should \nhold hearings on the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of \nDiscrimination Against Women and the full Senate should act on the \nConvention by March 9, 2000.\n  That day came and went and here we are a year later, still waiting \nfor the Senate to act.\n  In fact, women have been waiting for over 20 years for the Senate to \nratify the convention on discrimination against women. The United \nStates actively participated in drafting the convention and President \nCarter signed it on July 17th, 1980.\n  In 1994, the Foreign Relations Committee recommended by bipartisan \nvote that the convention be approved with qualifications, but acted too \nlate in the session for the Convention to be considered by the full \nSenate.\n  Given the length of the delay and the level of scrutiny, one might \nexpect the convention on discrimination against women to be a \ntechnically demanding international agreement. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth.\n  In fact, the convention is simple. It requires states to take all \nappropriate steps to eliminate discrimination against women in \npolitical and public life, law, education, employment, health care, \ncommercial transactions, and domestic relations.\n  One hundred and sixty-one countries have ratified the convention. Of \nthe world's democracies, only the United States has yet to ratify this \nfundamental document. Indeed, even countries we regularly censure for \nhuman rights abuses China--the People's Republic of Laos, Iraq--have \neither signed or agreed in principle.\n  In our failure to ratify the convention on discrimination against \nwomen, we now keep company with a select few: Iran, North Korea, Sudan, \nand Afghanistan among them. Remember, as the old saying goes, we are \njudged by the company we keep. Is this how we want to be known when it \ncomes to defending the human rights of those unable to defend \nthemselves?\n  In failing to ratify this convention on discrimination against women, \nwe risk losing our moral right to lead in the human rights revolution. \nBy ratifying the convention, we will demonstrate our commitment to \npromoting equality and to protecting women's rights throughout the \nworld. By ratifying the convention, we will send a strong message to \nthe international community that the U.S. understands the problems \nposed by discrimination against women, and we will not abide by it. By \nratifying the convention, we reestablish our credentials as a leader on \nhuman rights and women's rights.\n  Today, as we commemorate International Women's Day, I call on my \ncolleagues in the Senate to move forward and ratify Convention on \ndiscrimination against women.\n  The coerced trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation is \nan ugly, disturbing, and, unfortunately, growing practice that demands \nour attention.\n  Over 1 million people are trafficked each year around the world, with \n50,000 going to the United States. Trafficking generates billions of \ndollars a year and now constitutes the third largest source of profits \nfor organized crime, behind only drugs and guns.\n\n  These criminal groups prey upon women from poor countries who suffer \nfrom poverty, war, and hopelessness and desperately want a chance at a \nbetter life. They are enticed by promises of good paying jobs in richer \ncountries as models, au pairs, dancers, and domestic workers.\n  Once the women fall victim to the these gangs they are forced into \nlabor, have their passports seized, and are subjected to beatings, \nrapes, starvation, forced drug use, and confinement.\n  These victims have little or no legal protection. They travel on \nfalsified documents or enter by means of inappropriate visas provided \nby traffickers. When and if discovered by the police, these women are \nusually treated as illegal aliens and deported. Even worse, laws \nagainst traffickers who engage in forced prostitution, rape, kidnaping, \nand assault and battery are rarely enforced. The women will not testify \nagainst traffickers out of fear of retribution, the threat of \ndeportation, and humiliation for their actions.\n  I am shocked and appalled that this horrible and degrading practice \ncontinues. The United States must act as a leader to rally the \ninternational community to put a stop to the trafficking of women and \ngirls. I am proud that the 106th Congress passed, and President Clinton \nsigned into law, the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act \nof 2000. Among other things, the bill: directs the Secretary of State \nto provide an annual report to Congress listing countries that do and \ndo not comply with minimum standards for the elimination of \ntrafficking; establishes an Interagency Task Force\n\n[[Page S2066]]\n\nto Monitor and Combat Trafficking; provides assistance to foreign \ncountries for programs and activities to meet the minimum international \nstandards for the elimination of trafficking; withholds U.S. non-\nhumanitarian assistance to countries that do not meet minimum standards \nagainst trafficking and are not making efforts to meet minimum \nstandards, unless continued assistance is deemed to be in the U.S. \nnational interest; and increases penalties for those engaged in sex \ntrafficking.\n  In addition, the fiscal year 2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations \nAct earmarked at least $1.35 million for the Protection Project to \nstudy international trafficking, prostitution, slavery, debt bondage, \nand other abuses of women and children.\n  These are significant steps, but much work needs to be done. We must \nenforce the laws we have passed and we must consider new laws to \nprotect victims and bring traffickers to justice. On International \nWomen's Day, I urge my colleagues to continue the fight against the \nsexual trafficking of women and girls.\n  Rape as an instrument of war is an issue which, in recent years, has \nbeen of increasing concern to me.\n  Rape is no longer an isolated by-product of war; it is increasingly a \ntool to advance war aims. In recent years in Bosnia, Rwanda, and East \nTimor soldiers and militiamen used rape on a organized, systematic, and \nsustained basis to further their goal of ethnic cleansing. In some \ncases, women were kidnaped, interned in camps and houses, forced to do \nlabor, and subjected frequent rape and sexual assault.\n  I was pleased that the United Nations, in setting up the war crime \ntribunals for the Balkans and Rwanda, recognized rape as a war crime \nand a crime against humanity.\n  Nevertheless, I was very disappointed by the repeated failure of the \ninternational community, especially in the former Yugoslavia, to see \nthat those who were indicted for perpetrating these crimes were brought \nto justice. It appeared that the major step forward taken by the \ncreation of the tribunals would be nullified by inaction.\n  Finally, on February 22, 2001, the international tribunal in The \nHague sentenced three Bosnian Serbs to prison for rape during the \nBosnian war. I was very pleased the court took this step. Clearly, \nthere is still much work to be done. Estimates are that up to 20,000 \nwomen in Yugoslavia were systematically raped as part of a policy of \nethnic cleansing and genocide. Many perpetrators still remain at large.\n  Nevertheless, the court has stated loud and clear that those who use \nrape as an instrument of war will no longer be able to escape justice. \nThey will be arrested, tried, and convicted. As Judge Florence Mumba of \nZambia stated, ``Lawless opportunists should expect no mercy, no matter \nhow low their position in the chain of command may be.''\n  I commend the victims who courageously came forward to confront their \nattackers and offer testimony that helped lead to the convictions. The \ninternational community, and women in particular, owe them a debt of \ngratitude.\n  On International Women's Day, I urge the Administration and the \ninternational community to join me in continuing the fight to end the \npractice of rape as an instrument of war, and to pursue justice for its \nvictims.\n  Perhaps nowhere in the world today is there a clearer test of our \ncommitment of the cause of women's rights than Afghanistan.\n  To put it simply, I am shocked and dismayed at the treatment of women \nin Afghanistan by the Taliban. Afghan women have been banned from work \nand school and are largely confined in their homes behind darkened \nwindows. They are required to wear full-length veils, or burka, when in \npublic and must be accompanied by a male member of the family. In \naddition, access to medical services has been dramatically reduced. \nWidows are not allowed to work and must beg to subsist.\n  The women of Afghanistan, who have seen their families destroyed by \nwar, are now having their economic life and their fundamental human \nrights stripped away, and the violations of Afghan women's basic human \nrights have pushed an already war-torn and war-weary Afghanistan to the \nbrink of disaster.\n  The suffering of Afghan women and girls must not be ignored by the \nUnited States and the international community. I am working on \nlegislation with Senator Boxer to address their plight and put pressure \non the Taliban to respect basic human rights.\n  On International Women's Day, the United States, with our history of \ncommitment to women's rights and equality, must redouble its efforts to \nplace respect for women's rights at the top of the international \ncommunity's agenda regarding Afghanistan.\n  We must debate and ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All \nForms of Discrimination Against Women. We must rededicate ourselves and \nour resources to international family planning programs. We must \nenforce tough anti-trafficking legislation. We must not ignore the \ngross violations of the human rights of Afghan women.\n  We cannot afford to remain silent. We cannot afford to place women's \nrights on a second tier of concern of U.S. foreign policy. On \nInternational Women's Day, the United States and the international \ncommunity must take a strong stand and issue a clear warning to those \nwho attempt to rob women of basic rights that the world's governments \nwill no longer ignore these abuses, or allow them to continue without \nrepercussion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2066-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PRAYER AT THE HOUSE THE SENATE BUILT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this morning, Members of the U.S. \nSenate came together to kick off the House the Senate Built Program \nwith Habitat for Humanity International. Today's event partnered \nMembers of the Senate with HUD Secretary Mel Martinez, Habitat founder \nMillard Fuller, and a host of building partners to begin work with the \nSpencer and Williams families on their new homes in Capitol Heights, \nMD.\n  Before the event began, Ms. Helena Spencer, mother of one of the two \nfamilies who will be moving into the homes upon completion, shared with \nus her frustrations of living in substandard housing and her plea to \nGod to help her find a new home for her family. Her message to us was \nthat Habitat for Humanity was an answer to prayer. I want to share her \nprayer with you today, because I feel it reflects well on the work of \nHabitat for Humanity.\n  Ms. Spencer prayed:\n\n       Lord, my future looks so uncertain. It seems as if \n     everything dear to me has been shaken or removed. He answered \n     me, and said in His word, I will remove what can be shaken so \n     that those things which ``cannot be shaken may remain'' \n     (Hebrews 12:27). My life has to be built upon an unshakeable \n     foundation. He says I'm removing from you all insecure \n     foundation to force you to rest on the foundation of me \n     alone. A spiritual house, in order to stand, must not be \n     built on a flimsy foundation. Your false resting place is \n     being shaken so that you will rely wholly on me.\n\n  With these words, Helena Spencer spoke volumes about how great a \nblessing Habitat for Humanity is to so many people in need. These words \ninspired us this morning as we worked side by side building the houses \nthat the Spencer and Williams families will call home. These words have \nmotivated us to see through the House the Senate Built Project to its \nstated end; at least one new Habitat home built by Members of the U.S. \nSenate in each of our home States.\n  I am thankful for the work of Habitat for Humanity in this country \nand am encouraged by the faith and hope displayed today by Ms. Helena \nSpencer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2066-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2066-S2067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECENT SCHOOL SHOOTINGS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this week, the community of Santee, \nCA was struck by a horrible tragedy when a student opened fire on his \nclassmates at Santana High School. Two people were killed and 13 others \nwere wounded in the worst episode of school violence since the mass \nshooting in Littleton, CO almost 2 years ago. Although students \nreturned to school yesterday, the grief over losing two of their \nclassmates and the memories of what occurred will stay with them \nforever. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families \nand the people of Santee, CA as they attempt to cope with this tragedy.\n\n[[Page S2067]]\n\n  In an interview on Monday night, Dr. Michael Sise, the Medical \nDirector for Trauma at Mercy Hospital, where three of the victims were \ntreated, offered his perspective on shooting. He said, ``We wouldn't be \nhere tonight talking to you if this kid, this troubled kid, hadn't had \naccess to a firearm. I think we have to start asking the tough \nquestions about firearms, what they mean. Firearms turn shouting \nmatches into shooting matches, if those two kids in Columbine had not \nhad access to firearms they would be two weird kids still wandering \naround campus, instead of dead along with a lot of dead classmates. So, \nfor us in trauma we want to get out in the community and ask our fellow \nmembers of the community the tough questions. How do we prevent this \nfrom happening again?''\n  The question raised by Dr. Sise is the same question that is being \nasked by people in Santee, CA and all over the country. After each of \nthese shootings, we ask ourselves how we can prevent other such \ntragedies from happening in the future. One way to prevent this level \nof violence from occurring again is to make it harder for young people \nto gain access to firearms. By keeping guns out of the hands of \nchildren, we can help ensure that this type of deadly violence is not \npart of another child's school day.\n  Since the tragedy at Santana High School just a few days ago, our \nNation has experienced other acts of school violence. On Tuesday, not \nfar from the Capitol, a 14-year-old allegedly shot another teenager at \na Prince George's County high school. Yesterday, it was reported that \nan eighth-grader in Williamsport, PA shot and wounded one of her \nclassmates, and a high school junior in Seattle, WA threatened his \nclass with a handgun. The shooting at Santana High School was not an \nisolated incident and these other acts of violence should not be \nwritten off as ``copycat'' incidents. These acts of violence will \ncontinue to plague our Nation until we limit the access that young \npeople have to guns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2067-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MRS. MATINA SARBANES\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life and \nlegacy of Mrs. Matina Sarbanes, the mother of our dear colleague, \nSenator Paul Sarbanes.\n  Mrs. Sarbanes personified the American dream. She came to this county \nfrom Greece in 1930 to build a better life. She and her husband, the \nlate Spyros Sarbanes, settled in Salisbury on the Eastern Shore of \nMaryland. Mrs. Sarbanes used America's unique opportunity structure to \nbuild a business and a better life for their children. She and her \nhusband opened the Mayflower Grill, a restaurant known for its good \nfood and warm atmosphere. While the restaurant eventually closed in \n1960, 3 years after the death of Mr. Sarbanes, people still share \nstories about their meals and conversations with the Sarbanes family at \nthe Mayflower Grill.\n  The restaurant was truly a family-owned and operated business. The \nchildren grew up waiting tables and washing dishes, developing a strong \nwork ethic and value of service. Although important, Mrs. Sarbanes knew \nthat hard work was not enough to ensure a better life in America for \nher children. Having never finished school herself, Mrs. Sarbanes \ntaught her children the value of a good education. She knew that in \nAmerica, as in few other places in the world, children of immigrants \ncould go anywhere that hard work and education would take them.\n  She instilled in her children the values they needed to succeed: \nfaith, family and patriotism. Her children put these values into \naction. Her oldest son attended one of the country's top colleges, \nbecame a Rhodes Scholar, and serves in one of our Nation's highest \nelected offices. Her son Anthony had a long distinguished career in \neducation and in the military. Her daughter Zoe was a community leader \nand business woman in New Jersey.\n  Mrs. Sarbanes was a patriotic woman with a deep love for this country \nand for her Eastern Shore community. She was appreciative of America \nand all the opportunities it afforded her. And while she reaped the \nbenefits of her life in America, she also knew the importance of giving \nback to her community. Mrs. Sarbanes passed this patriotism and love \nfor her community on to her children. To learn all she could about the \nUnited States, it was not unusual for CNN to be on her television or \nfor politics to be the topic of conversation at the Sarbanes' home.\n  While Mrs. Sarbanes was proud to be an American citizen, she never \nforgot her Greek heritage. She was active in the Greek community in \nDelmarva and helped found the St. George Greek Orthodox Church in Ocean \nCity, which continues to thrive. While America provided her with \nopportunity, Greece provided her with a unique perspective on life and \nappreciation for all she and her family had accomplished. Mrs. Sarbanes \nlived to see each of her children and grandchildren finish college and \ngrow up to be success stories in their own right.\n  We know how proud Mrs. Sarbanes was of her family, and she must know \nhow proud her family was of her. She lived a wonderful life in America \nand touched many people including her church community, her Greek \ncommunity, her patrons from the restaurant, and her countless friends. \nShe will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved her. Her family \nand many friends are in my thoughts and prayers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial on Mrs. Sarbanes from the \nDaily Times in Salisbury be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Salisbury Daily Times, Feb. 24, 2001]\n\n                          The Dream Epitomized\n\n       Matina Sarbanes epitomized the American success story. \n     Through fortitude and hard work, she was able to live out the \n     American dream. Born in the village of Elika in southern \n     Greece, Sarbanes was attracted to the United States and its \n     promise of opportunity. She joined family in New Jersey in \n     1930 and married Spyros Sarbanes in 1932.\n       The couple moved to Salisbury soon after and opened the \n     famous Mayflower Grill on Main Street. While forging a life \n     here, the Sarbanes family set an example for all to follow. \n     They raised three solid children--two boys and a girl. They \n     were an immigrant family who knew the meaning of hard work. \n     In their children they instilled the value of service and a \n     work ethic that was obvious to all. The Sarbanes children \n     grew up waiting tables, washing dishes and mopping floors in \n     the restaurant. Through the family business, they learned the \n     value of education and developed an understanding of people.\n       At the center of all this effort and educating was Matina \n     Sarbanes. She was a strong believer in education, though she \n     never finished school. Her eldest son, Paul, is perhaps \n     Salisbury's most distinguished native. He graduated from \n     Wicomico High School and went on to be a Rhodes Scholar and \n     graduated from Princeton University. Today he sits as a \n     member of the U.S. Senate--a seat he has held with quiet \n     distinction since 1976. Her son Anthony has remained in \n     Salisbury, where he is a valuable community leader; daughter \n     Zoe has found success in New Jersey.\n       Spyros Sarbanes, 16 years older than his wife, died in \n     1957. Mrs. Sarbanes continued on her own for three years, but \n     shut down the Mayflower Grill in 1960. When Mrs. Sarbanes \n     died Wednesday at age 92, a little bit of the old Salisbury \n     passed with her. But her spirit, just like the spirit of \n     others in her time who overcame real obstacles to make a life \n     and build a family in this country, only grows stronger when \n     we pause to reflect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2067-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2067-S2068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FEMA'S PROJECT IMPACT II\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

I \nam looking into the issue of effectiveness.\n  A White House spokesperson, recently citing a FEMA Inspector General \nreport, said that 64 percent of the money awarded by Project Impact had \nnot been spent by communities 2 years after receiving it. This \nstatement is a bit misleading. True, nearly 2 years after they were \ndesignated as Project Impact partners, seven pilot communities had not \nspent 64 percent of their grant funds. But the report also goes into \ndetail as to why this was the situation. In many cases, while FEMA \nfunds came quickly, communities needed additional time to mobilize and \nbegin their mitigation programs. These communities were not fully \nprepared, administratively or programmatically, to accept the grants. \nSome communities had identified and scheduled multiple mitigation \nprojects, only to realize later that they did not have the\n\n[[Page S2068]]\n\nstaff or resources to carry out more than one project at a time.\n  While FEMA agreed that communities should spend their grants in a \nmore timely manner, FEMA was concerned about taking steps that would \nundermine the planning process at local levels by placing more focus on \nexpenditures, or infringe upon local budget cycles and negate community \nefforts to obtain additional funding. In response to these concerns, \nFEMA now requires communities to align Project Impact funding with \nlocal projects initiated within 18 months of funding. The Inspector \nGeneral concurred with FEMA's action.\n  To deal with management issues, the Inspector General recommended \nthat FEMA provide technical assistance to new communities on federal \ngrant management. In response, FEMA has expanded opportunities for \ntechnical assistance through availability of regional staff, the \nProject Impact ``How-To-Get-Started'' course, and FEMA's Web site. The \nInspector General also recommended improved accounting and reporting by \nthe communities and FEMA to keep records current and accessible. FEMA \nagreed, implemented new procedures, and the Inspector General was \nsatisfied with their response. Here is a successful example of the \nFederal Government returning money and power to local governments.\n  The IG report recognizes the significant amount of effort already \nperformed by communities and the active involvement with communities \nthat FEMA spends before mitigation projects are accepted and approved. \nIt also recognizes that attitudinal and behavioral changes are \noccurring in communities through collaboration and increasing public \nawareness and education about disaster mitigation efforts. It states \nthat while the benefits derived from such efforts can not be \nquantified, they are very important to a community that hopes to \nsustain disaster preparedness measures, long after the initial seed \nmoney is gone.\n  Perhaps these very important, but inherently unquantifiable \nactivities are what the President's spokesman is referring to when he \nsuggests programs such as ``scout camps, training Boy Scouts in \nDelaware, sponsoring a safety fair and those kinds of things'' were not \nworthwhile and demonstrated that the program was ineffective?\n  Which scout activities should not have been sponsored? The community \nservice project in Pascagoula, MI in which local Boy Scouts were \ninstrumental in developing a database of all commercial and residential \nstructures in the 100-year floodplain? Or the Boy Scouts in Eden, NY \nwho helped clean up debris in creeks that are prone to flooding as part \nof the community flood mitigation plan? Or the Ouachita Parish, LA Girl \nScouts who sponsored a disaster safety fair. Perhaps the Boy Scouts in \nCulebra, PR, who performed an intensive door-to-door mitigation-\noriented public awareness campaign, did not deserve training?\n  The last recommendation in the report was for FEMA to realign \nresources to better manage the growing number of Project Impact \ncommunities. FEMA responded by creating a new position in each region \nto augment Project Impact staffing needs to deal with the growing \nnumber of Project Impact communities and business partners due to the \nprogram's popularity and success.\n  Project Impact is not perfect. Certainly there are areas that could \nbe improved and ways in which it could be made more efficient. FEMA's \nInspector General identified several such areas. Through communication \nand cooperation, FEMA is addressing these issues. In no part of the \nreport does the Inspector General suggest that the program be canceled. \nOn the contrary, many of its recommendations are to help FEMA deal with \nhow the program is growing so that it can continue its successes and \nimprove upon its accomplishments.\n  The 50th State is vulnerable to a host of natural disasters, and \nHawaii's state and local officials know that disaster mitigation is the \nbest way to lessen the impact of catastrophic damage and loss of life. \nI was interested that when asked about the proposed elimination of \nProject Impact, the Honorable Harry Kim, mayor of the County of Hawaii \nand formerly the county's director of civil defense for 24 years, said, \n``If it were not for mitigation efforts, we would never stay ahead of \nthe game. I hope those in authority will talk to local officials \nbecause I would be surprised if anyone would support eliminating \nProject Impact. The growing pains of any project should not be the \ncause of cancellation.'' I agree with Mayor Kim. I urge the President \nto take another look at Project Impact, which is the only federal \nprogram that requires heavy community involvement to meet FEMA's goal \nof reducing the loss of life and property by protecting the nation from \nall types of hazards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2068-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                ARLINGTON COUNTY, VIRGINIA BICENTENNIAL\n\n   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Year 2001 marks Arlington \nCounty's 200th anniversary as a separate and distinct county.\n  On March 4, 1801, the District of Columbia was organized on land \nVirginia and Maryland had ceded to provide territory for the new \ncapital. Virginia ceded part of what was then Fairfax County as its \ncontribution to the new Federal City. This area was named Alexandria \nCounty and at the time included the Town of Alexandria as well as what \nis now Arlington County. Alexandria County was later returned to \nVirginia by the Federal government. In 1870, the Town of Alexandria \nbecame an independent city, separating from Alexandria County. In 1920, \nin order to avoid confusion between the county and the city of \nAlexandria, the name of the county was changed to Arlington, after the \nCurtis-Lee Mansion located in the county.\n  Arlington's past laid a solid foundation for the community many of us \nknow today, a place rich in historic value, cultural diversity and \neconomic vitality. The Arlington County Bicentennial Task Force has \nbeen formed to coordinate commemorative activities throughout 2001. I \nask my colleagues to join me in honoring this wonderful community \nlocated just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2068-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2068-S2069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEMORIAL TRIBUTE TO DR. CLAUDE SHANNON\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in memory of Dr. \nClaude Shannon, a pioneer in the field of modern communications \ntechnology. His work provided a major part of the theoretical \nfoundation leading to applications as diverse as digital cell phones, \ndeep space communications and the compact disc.\n  Dr. Shannon died on February 24 after suffering from Alzheimer's \ndisease. He was not widely known by the general public, but he should \nhave been. His work predated the establishment of the World Wide Web, \nbut in 1948 he published a seminal paper entitled ``A Mathematical \nTheory of Communication.'' This paper was the first to provide a \nmathematical model of the communication process. He was able to define \n``information'' in a way that was unrelated to its semantic meaning by \nexplaining the power of encoding information in a simple language of \n1's and 0's. Communication then became the process of transferring \ninformation from a ``source'', modified by an ``encoder'', through a \n``channel'', to a ``decoder'' at the output of a channel. This theory \nunderlies the modern communications revolution.\n  Dr. Shannon's work showed that every kind of information source--\ntext, images, video, data--has associated with it a quantifiable \ninformation content that mandates how efficiently it can be \nrepresented, the basis for ``data compression.'' For instance, he \nshowed that, no matter how clever you are, you can't represent English \ntext with less than about 1.5 bits per letter. Dr. Shannon also \nestablished fundamental limits to how efficiently one can transmit \ninformation over imperfect communication channels; his work on reliable \ntransmission formed the theoretical basis for the modems, satellite \nlinks and computer memories that are pervasive today. These aspects of \nShannon's work became the foundation of what we now call ``Information \nTheory.''\n  As important as Dr. Shannon's 1948 masterwork was, it was not his \nsole contribution to the emerging information age. As a graduate \nstudent at MIT, Shannon made a profound and fundamental contribution to \nthe field of\n\n[[Page S2069]]\n\ncomputer design when he showed that a then-obscure branch of \nmathematics called ``Boolean algebra,'' the algebra of 1's and 0's, \ncould be used to design circuits for computation and switching. The \nresult was what some have called ``the most influential master's thesis \nin history.'' Shannon's work on cryptography during World War II also \nformed the modern theoretical framework for secure communication \nsystems.\n  The Washington Post pointed out in Dr. Shannon's obituary that his \nachievements are at the core of the technology that delivers the \nInternet and its various applications, from music to video to e-mail. \nHis work has had applications in fields as diverse as computer science, \ngenetic engineering and neuroanatomy. Some have called his 1948 paper \n``the Magna Carta of the information age.''\n  Dr. Shannon was also renowned by his friends and colleagues for his \neclectic interests and capabilities. He rode down the halls of Bell \nLabs on a unicycle while juggling; he invented a rocket-powered \nFrisbee; and he developed ``THROBAC-I,'' a computer that computed in \nRoman numerals.\n  There are only a few authentic geniuses in this world. Dr. Shannon \nwas one and today we remember him for his accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2069-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING ROBERTO ESTRADA AND THE WORLD'S LARGEST RED ENCHILADA\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Saturday, March 10, 2001, marks a \nspecial day for the city of Las Cruces, NM. In a special ceremony, Las \nCruces and Mr. Roberto Estrada will enter the Guinness Book of World \nRecords. Roberto led the effort to make the world's largest three-\nlayered, flat enchilada last October 8th during the annual Las Cruces \nWhole Enchilada Fiesta. This culinary triumph measured 33.89 feet in \ncircumference, with a diameter of 10 feet, 5 inches.\n  Roberto Estrada has worked toward this day for about 20 years, each \nyear slowly increasing the size of the enchilada. He is a native of \nMesilla, N.M., and a graduate of Las Cruces High School. A community-\nspirited chef, he began pressing corn tortillas at the age of 15. In \n1968, Roberto bought an old tortilla factory and created the New Mexico \nMexican Food. He expanded and opened a restaurant next door, \nappropriately named Roberto's.\n  The Whole Enchilada Fiesta is a three-day celebration of southern New \nMexico's traditions, people and great food. The community celebration \ncenters around making a gigantic enchilada. Chef and founder of the \nfiesta, Estrada combines Southwest ingredients to make the crowd-\npleasing enchilada.\n  You must realize a lot goes into making this enchilada. The recipe \ncalls for 975 pounds of ground corn, grated cheese and chopped onions, \nin addition to 250 gallons of red chile sauce and vegetable oil. \nRoberto designed the special equipment used to cook the enchilada, \nincluding the press, carrying plate, cooking vat and serving plate.\n  A downtown street in Las Cruces is closed for creating and cooking \nthe enchilada. To start, 250 pounds of ground corn dough, or masa, is \nplaced on the press and carrying plate and pressed to make the \ntortilla. It is then cooked in a vat of 550-degree vegetable oil. Once \ncooked, the colossal corn tortilla is laid on the serving plate. \nRoberto then ladles chile sauce and spreads cheese and onions on the \ntortilla. This completes the first layer of the enchilada and the whole \nprocess is repeated two more times. More than a dozen volunteers help \ncarry the ingredients and work the equipment.\n  All these ingredients, equipment and labor come together to create \nwhat is now known as the ``Largest Red Enchilada.'' After approximately \ntwo and a half hours from start to finish, the zesty dish is completed \nand served to the spectators who gathered to watch this event.\n  New Mexico is known for its diverse culture, great weather, and \nexcellent food. Now there will be proof in the Guinness Book of World \nRecords that the largest enchilada has been made by Roberto Estrada of \nLas Cruces, NM.\n  In a state that cherishes it's chile, red or green, this is a \nGuinness honor that belongs in New Mexico. To pinpoint it even further, \nthe Mesilla Valley in southern New Mexico is one of the more renowned \nchile growing regions in the country. And I salute Roberto for taking \nthe initiative as part of the Whole Enchilada Fiesta to bring the \nworld's attention to our love of good and spicy food.\n  I extend an invitation to anyone interested in being a part of this \ngreat annual event in Las Cruces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2069-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RENE JOSEY\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

He took an active role \nduring his tenure as district attorney, prosecuting 13 criminal cases \nand earning the genuine respect of his staff and fellow attorneys. \nAlthough he raised his profile at the office, he remained an unassuming \npublic servant and focused his energy on the tasks at hand.\n  His accomplishments are numerous, not the least of which include the \ngroup of experienced litigators he brought on board who have \nstrengthened our state's legal system. Rene Josey has returned to \nprivate practice with Turner, Padgett, Graham & Laney, a Columbia, \nSouth Carolina law firm with offices in his hometown of Florence and in \nCharleston. It has been a pleasure for both me and my staff to work \nwith a talented individual like Rene and we wish him all the best as he \ncontinues his successful career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2069-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2069-4", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2069-5", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:55 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 624.

A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to \nclarify the Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Family and Medical Leave Act was \nintended to be used by families for critical periods such as after the \nbirth or adoption of a child and leave to care for a child, spouse, or \none's own ``serious medical condition.''\n  Since its passage, the Family and Medical Leave Act has had a \nsignificant impact on employers' leave practices and policies. \nAccording to the Commission on Family and Medical Leave two-thirds of \ncovered work sites have changed some aspect of their policies in order \nto comply with the Act.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Labor's implementation of certain \nprovisions of the Act has resulted in significant unintended \nadministrative burden and costs on employers; resentment by co-workers \nwhen the act is misapplied; invasions of privacy by requiring employers \nto ask deeply personal questions about employees and family members \nplanning to take FMLA leave; disruptions to the workplace due to \nincreased unscheduled and unplanned absences; unnecessary record \nkeeping; unworkable notice requirements; and conflicts with existing \npolicies. Despite these problems, which have been well documented in \nfive separate congressional hearings, including one I chaired and a \nHouse hearing where I testified, the previous administration choose to \nignore those problems and instead pushed for a back door expansion of \nthe Act through a rule known as Baby U.I., the Birth and Adoption \nUnemployment Compensation Rule. The Baby U.I. rule allows states to \nraid their unemployment compensation trust funds for an unrelated \nprogram, paid family leave. As a former Governor, I am very concerned \nabout the impact of the rule on state unemployment trust funds, which \nshould be preserved for tough economic times.\n  The Department of Labor's vague and confusing implementing \nregulations and interpretations have resulted in the FMLA being \nmisapplied, misunderstood and mistakenly ignored. Employers aren't sure \nif situations like pink eye, ingrown toenails and even the common cold \nwill be considered by the regulators and the courts to be serious \nhealth conditions. Because of these concerns and well-documented \nproblems with the Act, I am today introducing the Family and Medical \nLeave Clarification Act to make reasonable and much needed technical \ncorrections to the Family and Medical Leave Act and restore it to its \noriginal congressional intent.\n  The need for FMLA technical corrections has been confirmed and \nstrengthened by five congressional hearings and by the recent release \nof key surveys. Conclusive evidence of the need for corrections has now \nbeen established. The Congressional hearings demonstrated that the \nFMLA's definition of serious health condition is vague and overly broad \ndue to DOL's interpretations. Additionally, the hearings documented \nthat the intermittent leave provisions, notification and certification \nproblems are causing many serious workplace problems. In addition, some \ncompanies testified that Congress should consider allowing employers to \npermit employees to take either a paid leave package under an existing \ncollective bargaining agreement or the 12 weeks of FMLA protected \nleave, whichever is greater.\n  I am concerned that a recent decrease in paid leave for employees has \nbeen attributed to the Administration's problematic FMLA \ninterpretations. Some research shows a decline in voluntarily provided \npaid sick leave and vacation leave by the private sector. The 2000 \nSHRMR, Society for Human Resource Management, Benefits Survey found \nthat paid vacation was provided by 87 percent of companies in the year \n2000 while the year before it was 94 percent. Paid sick leave was at 85 \npercent last year and 74 percent this year.\n  A recent survey conducted by former President Clinton's Department of \nLabor confirmed FMLA implementation problems. The Labor Department \nreport found that the share of covered establishments reporting that it \nwas somewhat or very easy to comply with the FMLA has declined 21.5 \npercent from 1995 to 2000.\n  The recent release of the SHRMR, Society for Human Resource \nManagement, 2000 FMLA Survey strongly reinforces the need for FMLA \ntechnical corrections. Respondents to the SHRM survey stated that, on \naverage, 60 percent of employees who take FMLA leave do not schedule \nthe leave in advance. Consequently, managers often do not have the \nability to plan for work disruptions. Respondents also reported that, \nin most cases, the burden of the workload from the employee on leave \nfalls to employees who are not on leave. When asked whether they have \nhad to grant FMLA requests they felt were not legitimate, more than \nhalf, 52 percent, said they had. Additionally, more than one-third, 34 \npercent, of respondents said they were aware of employee complaints \nover the past year regarding a co-worker's questionable use of FMLA \nleave. The issue of intermittent leave also continues to be extremely \ndifficult. Three-quarters, 76 percent, of respondents said they would \nfind compliance easier if the Department of Labor allowed FMLA leave to \nbe offered and tracked in half-day increments rather than by minutes.\n  I am very concerned that both the SHRM and the Labor Department \nsurveys show that FMLA implementation is becoming more difficult, not \neasier seven years after it has been in place. I am hopeful that the \nFamily and Medical Leave Clarification Act will advance in the 107th \nCongress on a bipartisan basis to address this problem.\n  The FMLA Clarification Act has the strong support of the Society for \nHuman Resource Management, the\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, \nthe American Society of Healthcare Human Resources Professionals and \nclose to 300 other leading companies and associations who make up the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act Technical Corrections Coalition. I have \nreceived a letter of support from the Coalition and ask that it be \nprinted in the Record. This broad based coalition, shares my belief \nthat both employers and employees would benefit from making certain \ntechnical corrections to the FMLA, corrections that are needed to \nrestore congressional intent and to reduce administrative and \ncompliance problems experienced by employers who are making a good \nfaith effort to comply with the act.\n\n  The bill I am introducing today does several important things:\n  First, it repeals the Department of Labor's current regulations for \n``serious health condition'' and includes language from the Democrats' \nown original Committee Report on what types of medical conditions, such \nas heart attacks, strokes, spinal injuries, etc., were intended to be \ncovered. In passing the FMLA, Congress stated that the term ``serious \nhealth condition'' is not intended to cover short-term conditions, for \nwhich treatment and recovery are very brief, recognizing that ``it is \nexpected that such condition will fall within the most modest sick \nleave policies.'' The Department of Labor's current regulations are \nextremely confusing and expansive, defining the term ``serious health \ncondition'' as including, among other things, any absence of more than \n3 days in which the employee sees any health care provider and receives \nany type of continuing treatment, including a second doctor's visit, or \na prescription, or a referral to a physical therapist, such a broad \ndefinition potentially mandates FMLA leave where an employee sees a \nhealth care provider once, receives a prescription drug, and is \ninstructed to call the health care provider back if the symptoms do not \nimprove; the regulations also define as a ``serious health condition'' \nany absence for a chronic health problem, such as arthritis, asthma, \ndiabetes, etc., even if the employee does not see a doctor for that \nabsence and is absent for less than three days.\n  Second, the bill amends the Act's provisions relating to intermittent \nleave to allow employers to require that intermittent leave be taken in \nminimum blocks of 4 hours. This would minimize the misuse of FMLA by \nemployees who use FMLA as an excuse for regular tardiness and routine \njustification for early departures.\n  Third, the bill shifts to the employee the responsibility to request \nleave be designated as FMLA leave, and requires the employee to provide \nwritten application within 5 working days of providing notice to the \nemployer for foreseeable leave. With respect to unforeseeable leave, \nthe bill requires the employee to provide, at a minimum, oral \nnotification of the need for the leave not later than the date the \nleave commences unless the employee is physically or mentally incapable \nof providing notice or submitting the application. Under that \ncircumstance the employee is provided such additional time as necessary \nto provide notice.\n  Shifting the burden to the employee to request leave be designated as \nFMLA leave eliminates the need for the employer to question the \nemployee and pry into the employee's and the employee's family's \nprivate matters, as required under current law, and helps eliminate \npersonal liability for employer supervisors who should not be expected \nto be experts in the vague and complex regulations which even attorneys \nhave a difficult time understanding. Under current law, it is the \nemployer's responsibility in all circumstances to designate leave, paid \nor unpaid, as FMLA-qualifying. Failure to do so in a timely manner or \nto inform an employee that a specific event does not qualify as FMLA \nleave may result in that unqualified leave becoming qualified leave \nunder FMLA. This scenario has actually been upheld in Court and has \nplaced an enormous burden on employers to respond within 48 hours of an \nemployee's leave request. In addition, the courts have held that there \nis personal liability for employers under the FMLA and that an \nindividual manager may be sued and held individually liable for acts \ntaken based upon or relating to the FMLA. See Freemon v. Foley, 911 F. \nSupp. 326, N.D. Ill. 1995, in case of first impression in 7th Circuit, \ncourt stated, ``We believe the FMLA extends to all those who controlled \n`in whole or in part' [plaintiff's] ability to take leave of absence \nand return to her position'').\n  Fourth, with respect to leave because of the employee's own serious \nhealth condition, the bill permits an employer to require the employee \nto choose between taking unpaid leave provided by the FMLA or paid \nabsence under an employer's collective bargaining agreement or other \nsick leave, sick pay, or disability plan, program, or policy of the \nemployer. This change provides incentive for employers to continue \ntheir generous sick leave policies while providing a disincentive to \nemployers considering getting rid of such employee-friendly plans, \nincluding those negotiated by the employer and the employee's union \nrepresentative. Paid leave would be subject to the employer's normal \nwork rules and procedures for taking such leave, including work rules \nand procedures dealing with attendance requirements.\n  The FMLA Clarification Act is a reasonable response to the concerns \nthat have been raised about the Act. It leaves in place the fundamental \nprotections of the law while attempting to make changes necessary to \nrestore FMLA to its original intent and to respond to the very \nlegitimate concerns that have been raised. I urge my colleagues to \nrestore the FMLA to its original Congressional intent. I ask that the \ntest of the bill and a letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 489\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (referred to \n     in this section as the ``Act'') is not working as Congress \n     intended when Congress passed the Act in 1993. Many \n     employers, including those employers that are nationally \n     recognized as having generous family-friendly benefit and \n     leave programs, are experiencing serious problems complying \n     with the Act.\n       (2) The Department of Labor's overly broad regulations and \n     interpretations have caused many of these problems by greatly \n     expanding the Act's coverage to apply to many nonserious \n     health conditions.\n       (3) Documented problems generated by the Act include \n     significant new administrative and personnel costs, loss of \n     productivity and scheduling difficulties, unnecessary \n     paperwork and recordkeeping, and other compliance problems.\n       (4) The Act often conflicts with employers' paid sick leave \n     policies, prevents employers from managing absences through \n     their absence control plans, and results in most leave under \n     the Act becoming paid leave.\n       (5) The Commission on Leave, established in title III of \n     the ACt (29 U.S.C. 2631 et seq.), which reported few \n     difficulties with compliance with the Act, failed to identify \n     many of the problems with compliance because the study on \n     which the report was based was conducted too soon after the \n     date of enactment of the Act and the most significant \n     problems with compliance arose only when employers later \n     sought to comply with the Act's final regulations and \n     interpretations.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION.\n\n       Section 101(11) (29 U.S.C. 2611(11)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as clauses \n     (i) and (ii), respectively;\n       (2) by aligning the margins of those clauses with the \n     margins of clause (i) of paragraph (4)(A);\n       (3) by inserting before ``The'' the following:\n       ``(A) In general.--''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) Exclusions.--The term does not include a short-term \n     illness, injury, impairment, or condition for which treatment \n     and recovery are very brief.\n\n[[Page S2074]]\n\n       ``(C) Examples.--The term includes an illness, injury, \n     impairment, or physical or mental condition such as a heart \n     attack, a heart condition requiring extensive therapy or a \n     surgical procedure, a stroke, a severe respiratory condition, \n     a spinal injury, appendicitis, pneumonia, emphysema, severe \n     arthritis, a severe nervous disorder, an injury caused by a \n     serious accident on or off the job, an ongoing pregnancy, a \n     miscarriage, a complication or illness related to pregnancy, \n     such as severe morning sickness, a need for prenatal care, \n     childbirth, and recovery from childbirth, that involves care \n     or treatment described in subparagraph (A).''.\n\n     SEC. 4. INTERMITTENT LEAVE.\n\n       Section 102(b)(1) (29 U.S.C. 2612(b)(1)) is amended by \n     striking the period at the end of the second sentence and \n     inserting the following: ``, as certified under section 103 \n     by the health care provider after each leave occurrence. An \n     employer may require an employee to take intermittent leave \n     in increments of up to \\1/2\\ of a workday. An employer may \n     require an employee who travels as part of the normal day-to-\n     day work or duty assignment of the employee and who requests \n     intermittent leave or leave on a reduced schedule to take \n     leave for the duration of that work or assignment if the \n     employer cannot reasonably accommodate the employee's \n     request.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. REQUEST FOR LEAVE.\n\n       Section 102(e) (29 U.S.C. 2612(e)) is amended by inserting \n     after paragraph (2) the following:\n       ``(3) Request for leave.--If an employer does not exercise, \n     under subsection (d)(2), the right to require an employee to \n     substitute other employer-provided leave for leave under this \n     title, the employer may require the employee who wants leave \n     under this title to request the leave in a timely manner. If \n     an employer requires a timely request under this paragraph, \n     an employee who fails to make a timely request may be denied \n     leave under this title.\n       ``(4) Timeliness of request for leave.--For purposes of \n     paragraph (3), a request for leave shall be considered to be \n     timely if--\n       ``(A) in the case of foreseeable leave, the employee--\n       ``(i) provides the applicable advance notice required by \n     paragraphs (1) and (2); and\n       ``(ii) submits any written application required by the \n     employer for the leave not later than 5 working days after \n     providing the notice to the employer; and\n       ``(B) in the case of unforeseeable leave, the employee--\n       ``(i) notifies the employer orally of the need for the \n     leave--\n       ``(I) not later than the date the leave commences; or\n       ``(II) during such additional period as may be necessary, \n     if the employee is physically or mentally incapable of \n     providing the notification; and\n       ``(ii) submits any written application required by the \n     employer for the leave--\n       ``(I) not later than 5 working days after providing the \n     notice to the employer; or\n       ``(II) during such additional period as may be necessary, \n     if the employee is physically or mentally incapable of \n     submitting the application.''.\n\n     SEC. 6. SUBSTITUTION OF PAID LEAVE.\n\n       Section 102(d)(2) (29 U.S.C. 2612(d)(2)) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) Paid absence.--Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and \n     (B), with respect to leave provided under subparagraph (D) of \n     subsection (a)(1), where an employer provides a paid absence \n     under the employer's collective bargaining agreement, a \n     welfare benefit plan under the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), or under any \n     other sick leave, sick pay, or disability plan, program, or \n     policy of the employer, the employer may require the employee \n     to choose between the paid absence and unpaid leave provided \n     under this title.''.\n\n     SEC. 7. REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Existing Regulations.--\n       (1) Review.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall review \n     all regulations issued before that date to implement the \n     Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C. 2601 et \n     seq.), including the regulations published in sections \n     825.114 and 825.115 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations.\n       (2) Termination.--The regulations, and opinion letters \n     promulgated under the regulations, shall cease to be \n     effective on the effective date of final regulations issued \n     under subsection (b)(2)(B), except as described in subsection \n     (c).\n       (b) Revised Regulations.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Labor shall issue revised \n     regulations implementing the Family and Medical Leave Act of \n     1993 that reflect the amendments made by this Act.\n       (2) New regulations.--The Secretary of Labor shall issue--\n       (A) proposed regulations described in paragraph (1) not \n     later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act; \n     and\n       (B) final regulations described in paragraph (1) not later \n     than 180 days after that date of enactment.\n       (3) Effective date.--The final regulations take effect 90 \n     days after the date on which the regulations are issued.\n       (e) Transitioin.--The regulations described in subsection \n     (a) shall apply to actions taken by an employer prior to the \n     effective date of final regulations issued under subsection \n     (b)(2)(B), with respect to leave under the Family and Medical \n     Leave Act of 1993.\n\n     SEC. 8.

Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman,\n     Subcommittee on Children and Families,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Gregg: the Family and Medical Leave Act \n     Technical Corrections Coalition would like to commend you for \n     reintroducing the Family and Medical Leave Clarification Act.\n       As you know, the Coalition is a diverse, broad-based, \n     nonpartisan group of nearly 300 leading companies and \n     associations. Members of the Coalition are fully committed to \n     complying with both the spirit and the letter of the FMLA and \n     strongly believe that employers should provide policies and \n     programs to accommodate the individual work-life needs of \n     their employees. At the same time, members of the Coalition \n     believe that the FMLA should be fixed to protect those \n     employees that Congress aimed to assist while streamlining \n     administrative problems that have arisen. Since the FMLA is \n     not working properly, the Coalition does not support \n     expansions to the Act.\n       Unfortunately, FMLA implementation problems, which were \n     well documented during your July 14, 1999 hearing and four \n     other Congressional hearings, continue to grow. The need for \n     your FMLA technical corrections legislation has been \n     confirmed and even strengthened over the past year through \n     additional Congressional hearings and through the release of \n     new survey information: (1) the SHRM  (Society for Human \n     Resource Management) 2000 FMLA Survey and (2) the new \n     Department of Labor (DOL) FMLA Survey. While the SHRM survey \n     is a more accurate national measure of FMLA implementation \n     since it was specifically directed to those actually charged \n     with FMLA compliance, both the SHRM and DOL surveys \n     essentially reached the same conclusion: FMLA problems are \n     growing. For example:\n       Both the DOL and SHRM surveys found that more employers are \n     finding the FMLA and its regulations and interpretations more \n     difficult than they did several years ago.\n       The Labor Department report found that the share of covered \n     establishments reporting that it was somewhat or very easy to \n     comply with the FMLA declined 21.5 percent from 1995 to 2000. \n     The fact that both the Labor Department and SHRM surveys show \n     that FMLA implementation is becoming more difficult, not \n     easier seven years after it has been in place is of great \n     concern.\n       The DOL survey conducted by former President Clinton's \n     Labor Department casts significant doubt on the need for \n     federally mandated FMLA expansions as the best way to provide \n     increased flexibility for workers. For example, the Labor \n     Department survey found that the gap between covered and non-\n     covered establishments has narrowed since 1995, as non-\n     covered establishments are significantly more likely to offer \n     FMLA-type benefits in 2000 than they were five years earlier. \n     Interestingly, non-covered employers are more likely than \n     covered establishments to offer leave for school-related \n     functions or routine medical appointments.\n       The SHRM report confirmed Congressional hearing findings \n     that the issue of intermittent leave continues to be \n     extremely difficult. Three-quarters (76 percent) of \n     respondents said they would find compliance easier if the \n     Department of Labor allowed FMLA leave to be offered and \n     tracked in half-day increments rather than by minutes. \n     Additionally, a survey by CORE, Inc. survey found that the \n     majority (54%) does not feel confident that their company is \n     tracking FMLA correctly.\n       In all SHRM and Labor Department surveys, past and present, \n     the most commonly reported method of covering work when an \n     employee takes leave was to assign the work temporarily to \n     other employees. The SHRM survey showed that a full 34% of \n     human resource professionals were aware of complaints by \n     coworkers due to questionable use of FMLA.\n       The fact that both the Labor Department and SHRM surveys \n     show that FMLA implementation is becoming more difficult, not \n     easier, seven years after it has been in place is of great \n     concern.\n       Thank you for your leadership and continued commitment to \n     restoring the FMLA to its original Congressional intent \n     through FMLA technical corrections while preserving the \n     spirit of the Act. The entire FMLA Technical Corrections \n     Coalition looks forward to working with you to ensure its \n     success.\n           Respectfully,\n                                            Deanna R. Gelak, SPHR,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS:\n  S. 490. A bill to provide grants to law enforcement agencies that \nensure that law enforcement officers employed by such agencies are \nafforded due process when involved in a case that may lead to \ndismissal, demotion, suspension, or transfer; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n[[Page S2075]]\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Law \nEnforcement Officers Due Process Act of 2001. Every day our nation's \npolice officers put their lives on the line in the fight against crime. \nEvery time they patrol a beat they put their own safety at risk to \nprotect our children and make our country a better place to live and \nwork. We all owe a great deal to these brave men and women.\n  Working police officers spend their lives among the public \nsafeguarding the innocent and apprehending those who have committed \ncrimes. Much of this contact can be stressful for everyone involved. \nPerhaps an individual has been stopped by an officer for the suspected \nviolation of a law. Or maybe the officer is assisting someone who is \nthe victim of a crime. Due to the circumstances, these are often \nunpleasant situations. And unfortunately, in some instances, contact \nwith the police officer may become adversarial and generate complaints \nabout the officer's actions.\n  These complaints range from accusations that an officer took too long \nto arrive at a crime scene, used too much force, or was not forceful \nenough, to claims that the officer was rude or didn't show proper \nrespect. Some complaints against officers are legitimate. However, some \ncomplaints are generated to intimidate an officer who is simply doing \nhis or her job, into dropping charges. Any one of these complaints can \nget an officer fired, suspended, or otherwise punished without the \nbenefit of due process.\n  A patchwork of state and local laws currently governs the rights of \nofficers when they are involved in a case that may lead to dismissal, \ndemotion, suspension or transfer. Thirty-five states have state and/or \nlocal laws in place that govern the administrative due process rights \nof law enforcement officers. However, 15 states do not have any of \nthese much-deserved due process protections for their law enforcement \nofficers.\n  The Law Enforcement Officers Due Process Act is a common-sense \nmeasure designed to replace arbitrary and ad hoc investigatory \nprocedures with consistent standards. The legislation will provide \nadditional funding to law enforcement agencies that either have in \nplace, or currently do not have but certify they will implement, \nadministrative due process for their law enforcement officers. An \nagency will be eligible for grant money if its administrative \nprocedures include the right of a law enforcement officer under \ninvestigation to: (1) a hearing before a fair and impartial board or \nhearing officer; (2) be represented by an attorney or other officer at \nthe expense of the officer under investigation; (3) confront any \nwitness testifying against him or her; and (4) record all meetings he \nor she attends. In many instances, an employer with direct control over \nan officer is also the investigator. That is why providing basic, \nexplicitly stated rights to officers under investigation is crucial to \nmaintaining impartial investigations. These rights will not interfere \nwith the management of state and local internal investigations. They \nwill merely ensure that officers receive the benefit of fair and \nobjective investigations, whether a complaint against them is \nlegitimate or not.\n  Some individuals may be concerned that providing these rights would \ndelay removal of an officer who is ultimately found to have deserved \ndisciplinary action taken against them. However, I'd like to emphasize \nthat my legislation would not prevent the immediate suspension of an \nofficer whose continued presence on the job is considered to be a \nsubstantial and immediate threat to the welfare of the law enforcement \nagency or the public; who refuses to obey a direct order issued in \nconformance with the agency's rules and regulations; or who is accused \nof committing an illegal act.\n  The Law Enforcement Officers Due Process Act does not force a law \nenforcement agency to implement due process rights for its officers. \nRather, it encourages agencies to do the right thing by offering them \nadditional funds if they establish written procedures for determining \nif a complaint is valid or merely designed to cause trouble for the \nofficer.\n  I urge my colleagues who represent states that do not have law \nenforcement officers' due process rights laws to cosponsor my bill and \ngive their police officers the protections they deserve. I also urge my \ncolleagues who represent states that have various local laws in place \nto cosponsor my bill. By doing so they will help eliminate the \ndisparity that exists among local jurisdictions, and guarantee that \nevery single officer in their state will have a minimum baseline of \nrights to help guarantee fair and impartial investigations.\n  Crime rates are down across the nation. We owe a tremendous debt of \ngratitude to our nation's police officers for helping make this happen. \nOur communities, our schools, and our places of business would not \nenjoy the level of security they have today without the efforts of law \nenforcement.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater\n\n[[Page S2076]]\n\nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in the design, planning, and construction of the Denver \nWater Reuse project; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to reintroduce a \nbill that will help millions of water consumers throughout my home \nstate of Colorado. My bill, the Denver Water Reuse Project, is based on \nlegislation I previously introduced in the last Congress. The full \nSenate passed this legislation last year, but time ran out in the 106th \nCongress before the House could act.\n  The Denver Water Department has developed a plan to re-use non-\npotable water for irrigation and industrial uses. In the arid West, \nwhere growing populations and changing values are placing increasing \ndemands on existing water supplies, water availability remains an \nimportant issue throughout the West. Recent conflicts are particularly \napparent where agricultural needs for water are often in direct \nconflict with urban needs. This legislation will help remedy some of \nthis conflict.\n  The State of Colorado, the Colorado Water Congress, the Denver Board \nof Water Commissioners, and the Mayor of Denver endorsed this \nlegislation last year. I am pleased to assist these interested parties \nwith this worthwhile proposal.\n  The Denver Water Department serves over a million customers and is \none of the largest water suppliers in the Rocky Mountain region. Over \nthe past several years Denver Water has developed a plan to treat and \nre-use some of its water supply for uses not involving human \nconsumption. In this manner, Denver will stretch its water supply \nwithout the cost and potential environmental disruption of building new \nprojects. It will also ease the demand on fresh drinking-quality water \nsupplies.\n  The Denver Water Reuse Project will treat secondary wastewater which \nis water that has already been used once in Denver's system. It is an \nenvironmentally and economically viable method for extending and \nconserving our limited water supplies. The water quality will meet all \nColorado and federal standards. The water will still be clean and \nodorless, but since it will be used for irrigation and industrial uses \naround the Denver International Airport and the Rocky Mountain Wildlife \nRefuge, the additional expense to treat it for consumption will be \navoided.\n  In the West, naturally scarce water supplies and increasing urban \npopulations have increased our need for water re-use, recycling, \nconservation, and storage proposals. These are all keys to successfully \nmeet the water needs of everyone. This plan would benefit many \nColoradans, and would help relieve many of the water burdens faced in \nthe Denver region. Again, I'd like to thank the interested parties for \ntheir support, and I am hopeful this bill can be quickly passed and put \ninto effect.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a copy of the \nletter of support from the Mayor of Denver be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 491\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Webb,\n                                                            Mayor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 493. A bill to provide for the establishment of a Sioux Nation \nEconomic Development Council; the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill along with \nSenator Johnson, to amend the Wakpa Sica Reconciliation Place \nlegislation that was enacted in the final days of the 106th Congress.\n  The original version of the Wakpa Sica bill that the Senate approved \nlast year established a center of law, history, culture and economic \ndevelopment for the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota tribes of the upper \nMidwest. The Reconciliation Place authorized by the bill will become a \nfocal point for the preservation of Sioux law and culture. It will \nenhance the knowledge and understanding of the Sioux by displaying and \ninterpreting their history, art, and culture. It will also provide an \nimportant repository for the Sioux Nation history and the family \nhistories for members of tribes, and other important historical \ndocuments.\n  Regrettably, the Reconciliation Place law that ultimately passed in \nthe 106th Congress did not include the economic development title to \nstrengthen tribal communities and expand opportunities for tribal \nmembers and businesses. That provision, which I strongly support, was \ndropped due to objections from the House of Representatives that \nthreatened enactment of the entire bill, which included Wakpa Sica.\n  The bill that I am introducing today would authorize a Sioux Nation \nEconomic Development Council. It complements the Wakpa Sica \nReconciliation Place by providing opportunities for further economic \ndevelopment and regional job creation for the Great Sioux Nation.\n  The Sioux Nation Economic Development Council will assist tribal \ngovernments and individuals in promoting economic growth on the \nreservations and surrounding communities. It will coordinate economic \ndevelopment and will centralize the expertise and technical support to \nhelp tribes obtain federal assistance. It will raise funds from private \ndonations to match federal contributions. Finally, it will provide \ngrants, loans, scholarships and technical assistance to tribes and \ntheir members, to ultimately help tribes generate jobs.\n  The strength of the Reconciliation Place lies in its diversity of \npurpose. It will have many funding sources, both public and private. \nEach agency mentioned in the bill will assist in providing funding and \ntechnical assistance to the tribes and tribal members through the \nReconciliation Place. This assistance will not diminish the government-\nto-government policy established by the United States for individual \ntribes. Instead, it will provide a focal point for governmental and \nprivate organizations to expand their ability to help the entire Great \nSioux Nation.\n  The United Sioux Tribes, the State of South Dakota and Mike Jandreau,\n\n[[Page S2077]]\n\nChairman of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, have been working on this \nproject for many years. I share their enthusiasm for the concept and \ncommitment to building a comprehensive center for Sioux culture, law \nand economic development. Enactment of this legislation is necessary to \nfulfill that commitment to the Great Sioux Nation.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to approve this legislation this year. \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 493\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow an \nabove-the-line deduction for certain professional development expenses \nand classroom supplies of elementary and secondary school teachers; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to increase tax fairness for America's primary and secondary \nschool teachers.\n  Over the past few years, much has been said about the inequities of \nsome of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Indeed, one does \nnot need to look very far in the Code to begin to see provisions that \nare just plain unfair. I would like to highlight just one egregious \nexample of this unfairness today, and introduce legislation to begin to \nrectify it.\n  Mr. President, our public school teachers are some of the unheralded \nheroes of our society. These women and men dedicate their careers to \neducating the young people of America. School teachers labor in often \ndifficult and even dangerous circumstances. In most places, including \nin my home state of Utah, the salary of the average public school \nteacher is significantly below that of other similarly educated and \nexperienced professionals in our society.\n  Moreover, school teachers find themselves further disadvantaged by \nunfair treatment from the tax code as to the deductibility of \nprofessional development expenses and of the out-of-pocket costs of \nclassroom materials that practically all teachers find themselves \nsupplying. Let me explain.\n  Like many other professionals, most elementary and secondary school \nteachers regularly incur expenses to keep themselves current in their \nfield of knowledge. These include subscriptions to journals and other \nperiodicals as well as the cost of courses and seminars designed to \nimprove their knowledge or teaching skills. These expenditures are \nnecessary to keep our teachers up to date on the latest ideas, \ntechniques, and trends so that they can provide our children with the \nbest education possible.\n  Furthermore, almost all teachers find themselves providing basic \nclassroom materials for their students. Because of tight education \nbudgets, most schools do not provide 100 percent of the material \nteachers need to adequately present their lessons. As a result, \ndedicated teachers incur personal expenses for copies, art supplies, \nbooks, puzzles and games, paper, pencils, and countless other needs. If \nnot for the willingness of teachers to purchase these supplies \nthemselves, many students would simply go without needed materials.\n  I realize that many employees incur expenses for professional \ndevelopment and out-of-pocket expenses. In many cases, however, these \ncosts are fully reimbursed by the employer. This is seldom the case \nwith school teachers. Other professionals who are self-employed are \nable to fully deduct these types of expenses.\n  Under the current tax law, unreimbursed employee expenses are \ndeductible, as miscellaneous itemized deductions. However, there are \ntwo practical hurdles that effectively make these expenses non-\ndeductible for most teachers. The first hurdle is that the total amount \nof a taxpayer's deductible miscellaneous deductions must exceed 2 \npercent of adjusted gross income before they begin to be deductible. \nThe second hurdle is that the amount in excess of the 2 percent floor, \nif any, combined with all other deductions the taxpayer has, must \nexceed the standard deduction before the teacher can itemize. Only \nabout 30 percent of taxpayers have enough deductions to itemize. The \nunfortunate effect of these two limitations is that, as a practical \nmatter, only a small proportion of teachers are able to deduct these \nexpenses.\n  Let me illustrate this unfair situation with an example. Let us \nconsider the case of a fifth-year high school chemistry teacher in Utah \nwho I will call Wendy Ruffner. Wendy is single\n\n[[Page S2079]]\n\nand earns $35,000 per year. Last year she incurred $750 in expenses for \nchemistry periodicals and for a course she took over the summer to \nincrease her knowledge of chemistry. Wendy also incurred $100 in out-\nof-pocket expenses for classroom supplies such as copies, periodical \ncharts, and equipment for classroom experiments.\n  Under current law, Wendy's expenditures are deductible, subject to \nthe limitations I mentioned. The first limitation is that her expenses \nmust exceed 2 percent of her income before they begin to be deductible. \nTwo percent of $35,000 is $700. Thus only $140 of her $840 total \nexpenses is deductible, that portion that exceeds $700.\n  As a single taxpayer, Wendy's standard deduction for 2000 is $4,400. \nHer total itemized deductions, including the $140 miscellaneous \ndeduction for professional expenses, fall short of the standard \ndeduction threshold. Therefore, not even the $140 of the original $840 \nin professional expenses is deductible for Wendy. What the first \nlimitation did not block, the second one did.\n  The legislation I introduce today, the Tax Equity for School \nTeachers, or TEST Act, would eliminate the unfairness teachers face in \nregards to these limitations by making all professional development and \nout-of-pocket expenses an above-the-line deduction. This means a \nteacher could deduct these expenses without regard to the 2 percent of \nAGI limitation and whether he or she itemizes or not.\n  Let us return to my previous example of Wendy Ruffner. Under this \nbill, Wendy would be allowed to deduct all $840 of her professional \nexpenses from her taxable income. This would help provide tax equity, \nand a measure of much-needed tax relief for an underpaid professional.\n  Some might argue that this would be giving teachers preferential \ntreatment. I disagree. Most organizations provide training for their \nemployees that is fully deductible to the organization and non-taxable \nto the employee. Yet, public teachers, who are some of the most vital \nprofessionals in our society, are left to foot the bill on their own. \nOffice supplies and instructional materials are also fully deductible \nto businesses. Shouldn't teachers who provide these similar materials \nfor their classrooms be afforded the same tax treatment?\n  School teachers deserve better tax treatment than what they receive. \nWith the low pay teachers typically receive, it is no wonder that many \nareas of the country are facing severe shortages of experienced \nteachers. The tax code is compounding the problem by adding insult to \ninjury. We need to remove the unfair disincentives that discourage \nmotivated and qualified individuals from pursuing teaching as a \nprofession.\n  I note that President Bush's tax cut plan also recognizes this need \nand provides for a deduction of up to $400 in teachers' out-of-pocket \nclassroom expenses. This is a good step in the right direction. My \nbill, however, provides an unlimited deduction for out-of-pocket \nexpenses and goes further and also includes the costs of professional \ndevelopment expenses. I do not believe we need to place a limit on \nthese deductions. Teachers are going to provide their students with \nmaterials and take the professional development courses regardless of a \ntax deduction. They should be able to deduct these expenditures.\n  Mr. President, this bill would provide modest tax equity for teachers \nwho, for too long, have been footing the bill for improving the quality \nof teaching by themselves. It is time we the tax code recognized this \nunfairness and corrected it. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to \naddress this issue today, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 495\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct to modify authorizations of appropriations for programs under such \nAct; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \ndramatically increase funding for the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, IDEA. My legislation would more than double the federal \ncommitment to IDEA funding within four years. The legislation, \n``Growing Resources in Educational Achievement for Today and \nTomorrow,'' GREATT IDEA, will take significant steps toward fulfilling \nthe federal commitment to IDEA funding. The legislation will also free \nup additional funds for local school districts to be spent on their \nhighest priorities, whether it be teacher training or salaries, \nreducing class sizes, school construction, library resources, \ntechnology, or music and arts education. The legislation is supported \nby the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and Pennsylvania Governor \nTom Ridge.\n\n[[Page S2080]]\n\n  Every child is deserving of a high-quality education in an \nenvironment that encourages them to learn and grow to the best of their \nability. Thanks to IDEA, many students are learning and achieving at \nlevels previously thought impossible, graduating from high school, \ngoing to college and entering the workforce as productive citizens. We \nmust encourage this progress and continue to give parents and teachers \nthe resources they need to create opportunities for special children. \nBy boldly increasing the IDEA funding level, we can keep more students \nin schools and help them achieve new measures of success.\n  Prior to IDEA's implementation in 1975, approximately 1 million \nchildren with disabilities were shut out of schools and hundreds of \nthousands more were denied appropriate services. Since then, IDEA has \nhelped change the lives of these children. Congress had originally \ncommitted to cover 40 percent of IDEA's costs when it passed the \noriginal IDEA bill in 1975, with the remaining balance to be met by \nlocal communities and states. Over the years, however, while the law \nitself continues to work and children are being educated, the intended \ncost-sharing partnership has not been realized. The federal commitment \nof 40 percent will be reached within eight years if the funding stream \nestablished in GREATT IDEA is sustained. This is my first priority in \nhelping local school districts provide the best education possible for \nelementary and secondary education.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this effort to double funding for \nIDEA within the next four years as we continue to work to fulfill this \nlong neglected federal commitment and free up educational resources for \nlocal education. I am pleased with the funding progress we were able to \nmake this past year. Yet, this legislation goes further by fully \nfunding approximately 700,000 additional IDEA students at an average \ncost of $13,860 per student. We must accelerate the progress we have \nmade by passing and funding this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Crapo, \n        Mr. Conrad, Mr. Specter, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        McConnell, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Jeffords, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mr. Torricelli, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Reed, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 497. A bill to express the sense of Congress that the Department \nof Defense should field currently available weapons, other \ntechnologies, tactics and operational concepts that provide suitable \nalternatives to anti-personnel mines and mixed anti-tank mine systems \nand that the United States should end its use of such mines and join \nthe Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines as soon as \npossible, to expand support for mine action programs including mine \nvictim assistance, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am today introducing the Landmine \nElimination Act of 2001. I am joined by Senators Collins, Bingaman, \nCrapo, Conrad, Specter, Feinstein, Rockefeller, McConnell, Kerry, \nSarbanes, Dorgan, Jeffords, Reed, Harkin, Mikulski, Murray, Feingold, \nTorricelli, and Durbin.\n  This legislation does three things.\n  It expresses the sense of Congress that the Department of Defense \nshould field currently available weapons, other technologies, tactics \nand operational concepts which provide suitable alternatives to \nlandmines. It is our view that such alternatives exist and are, in \nfact, better suited than mines to protect United States Armed Forces in \ntoday's fast-moving battlefield. This view is shared by many active and \nretired military officers.\n  The bill calls on the United States to end its use of mines, and to \njoin the Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines as soon \nas possible. It also codifies the U.S. moratorium on mine exports, \nwhich has been in effect since 1992 and is official United States \npolicy. Finally, it establishes an inter-agency working group to \ndevelop a comprehensive plan for expanded mine action programs, \nincluding programs to assist mine victims.\n  Mr. President, the havoc wreaked by landmines throughout the world is \nwell known. They have been responsible for by far the majority of \ncasualties of NATO and peacekeeping forces in the Balkans. They were a \ncause of American casualties in Somalia. They maimed and killed \nthousands of our troops in Vietnam. And, most often, they cripple and \nkill innocent civilians, thousands and thousands each year.\n  In 1992, the United States became the first country to stop exporting \nlandmines. That led other countries to take similar action, and in 1994 \nPresident Clinton called for an international treaty banning the \nweapons. That treaty, which came into force in 1998, has been signed by \n139 countries and ratified by 110.\n  The United States is not among them, because of concerns at the time \nabout Korea and the fact that the treaty would require the United \nStates to stop using most of its anti-vehicle mines. Those were not \nfrivolous concerns, although I do not believe either issue was fully \nunderstood or examined when the decision was made, and I have worked to \nobtain the funds to develop alternatives to mines.\n  Over the past year, however, I and others have spent a great deal of \ntime discussing these issues with both active and retired military \nofficers. These discussions have revealed a number of interesting \nfacts, which I intend to discuss with Secretary Rumsfeld, the Joint \nChiefs, President Bush and others. Most importantly, I and others have \nbecome convinced that landmines are inconsistent with current U.S. \nmilitary doctrine. They are neither cost effective nor compatible with \nour highly mobile forces, and in fact they pose serious logistical \nproblems and dangers for our troops. We can do better, and we should be \nworking together to get rid of these outdated weapons. It is not \nnecessary to waste years developing costly new alternatives. We have \nthe ``smart'' weapons and other technologies to more effectively \nprotect our Armed Forces.\n  I look forward to the day when the United States joins the Treaty, \nbecause I am convinced that without U.S. participation and leadership \nthe Treaty will never achieve its promise. But having said that, I have \nnever regarded the Treaty as a kind of ``holy grail'' of landmines. My \ninterest in this issue, which dates to 1989 when I met a young Honduran \nboy who had lost a leg from a mine, has always been to achieve a mine-\nfree world. That is an ambitious goal, but it is the right goal. And \nregardless of when the U.S. joins the Treaty, we can develop a mine-\nfree military.\n  Ironically, when that happens, the United States, which at times has \nbeen unfairly blamed for causing the mine problem, will become the \nworld's leader on this issue. We will have ended not only our use of \nanti-personnel mines, which the Treaty prohibits, but also of anti-\nvehicle mines, which, while not prohibited by the Treaty, are \nresponsible for the indiscriminate deaths and injuries of countless \ninnocent people.\n  I look forward to an opportunity to work with the Department of \nDefense and the White House to develop a common approach, because the \nissue is no longer whether we develop a mine-free military, but when. \nIt is a far more political issue than a military issue, and it is time \nto leave past disagreements and disappointments behind and work \ntogether on this common goal.\n  The problem of landmines continues to be an issue of deep concern to \npeople across this country and around the world. This week, hundreds of \npeople from dozens of countries are in Washington to focus attention on \nthis issue. Among them is Her Majesty Queen Noor, who I am honored to \ncall a friend and who has been an eloquent advocate for a mine-free \nworld and particularly for assistance for mine victims.\n  One of the purposes of this legislation is to develop more effective \nprograms to address the urgent needs of mine victims. It is one thing \nfor a person who has lost an arm or a leg from a mine to obtain an \nartificial limb. It is another to get the counseling and training to be \nable to earn income in poor countries where the disabled are often \nostracized. We need to do what we can to help mine victims reintegrate \ninto the social and economic life of their communities.\n  I want to thank the cosponsors of this legislation, who, like other \nlegislation I have sponsored on landmines\n\n[[Page S2081]]\n\nspan the political spectrum. This is not and has never been a partisan \nissue. It is a humanitarian issue. If landmines were a problem in our \nown country, they would have been prohibited years ago.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows.\n\n                                 S. 497\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Landmine Elimination and \n     Victim Assistance Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2 FINDINGS.\n\n       Congess makes the following findings:\n       (1) The threat posed by tens of millions of unexploded \n     landmines to innocent civilians is a global problem requiring \n     strong United States leadership in cooperation with other \n     governments.\n       (2) Landmines continue to maim and kill thousands of \n     people, mostly civilians, each year, and most mine victims \n     lack the care and rehabilitation services they need.\n       (3) Landmines, which remain active for hours, days or \n     years, impeded the mobility and threaten the safety of United \n     States Armed Forces, North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     forces, and other friendly forces in combat and other \n     military operations.\n       (4) At least 139 countries have signed, and 110 countries \n     have ratified, the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, \n     Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines \n     and on Their Destruction (opened for signature at Ottawa, \n     Canada, on December 3 and 4, 1997, and at the United Nations \n     Headquarters beginning December 5, 1997). Many of these \n     countries are former producers, exporters, and users of anti-\n     personnel mines. Worldwide adherence to the Convention would \n     greatly reduce the threat to future generations from anti-\n     personnel mines.\n       (5) It is United States Government policy that the United \n     States will search aggressively for alternatives to anti-\n     personnel mines and mixed anti-tank mine systems and that the \n     United States will join the Convention by 2006 if suitable \n     alternatives are fielded by then.\n       (6) Since 1992, United States law has prohibited the export \n     or transfer of anti-personnel mines.\n       (7) Since 1997, the United States has capped its inventory \n     of anti-personnel mines and has not produced anti-personnel \n     mines.\n       (8) The United States Government has contributed hundreds \n     of millions of dollars to the costly, dangerous, and arduous \n     task of humanitarian demining around the world.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Department of Defense should field currently \n     available weapons, other technologies, tactics and \n     operational concepts that provide suitable alternatives to \n     anti-personnel mines and mixed anti-tank mine systems; and\n       (2) The United States should end its uses of such mines and \n     join the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, \n     Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines \n     and on Their Destruction as soon as possible.\n\n     SEC. 4. TRANSFERS OF ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES\n\n       Section 1365(c) of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1993 (22 U.S.C. 2778 note) is amended by \n     striking ``During'' and all that follows through ``1991--'' \n     and inserting ``Beginning on October 23, 1992--''.\n\n     SEC. 5. INTER-AGENCY WORKING GROUP ON MINE ACTION.\n\n       Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the President shall establish an inter-agency \n     working group to develop a comprehensive plan for expanded \n     mine action programs, including mine victim rehabilitation, \n     social support, and economic reintegration. The working group \n     shall be composed of the Secretaries of State, Health and \n     Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Defense, Education, and the \n     Administrator of the Agency for International Development. \n     The comprehensive plan shall be developed in close \n     consultation with relevant nongovernmental organizations. As \n     part of the development of the comprehensive plan, the \n     working group shall determine an estimated cost of carrying \n     out the plan.\n\n     SEC. 6. REPORT ON ALTERNATIVES TO MINES.\n\n       No later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the \n     Committees on Armed Services and the Committees on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the House or Representatives \n     a report describing actions taken by the Department of \n     Defense to field currently available weapons, other \n     technologies, tactics and operational concepts that provide \n     suitable alternatives to anti-personnel mines and mixed anti-\n     tank mine systems.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 498. A bill entitled ``National Discovery Trails Act of 2001''; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, America's trails are one of our most \ntreasured recreational resources. Each year millions of Americans hike, \nski, jog, bike, ride horses, drive snow machines and all-terrain \nvehicles, observe nature, commute, and relax on trails throughout the \ncountry. The types of trails found across the nation are varied and \nrange from urban bike paths to bridle paths, community green ways, \nabandoned railroad right-of-ways, historic trails, and long distance \nhiking trails.\n  This legislation proposes to establish the American Discovery Trail, \nor ADT. The ADT is being proposed as a continuous coast to coast trail \nthat links the nation's principal north-south trails and east-west \nhistoric trails with shorter local and regional trails into a \nnationwide network.\n  National Discovery Trails are a new category of trails that recognize \nthat use and enjoyment of trails close to home is equally as important \nas hiking remote wilderness trails. National Discovery Trails will \nconnect people to large cities, small towns and urban areas and to \nmountains, forest, desert and natural areas by incorporating local, \nregional and national trails together.\n  The American Discovery Trail links towns and cities on America's long \ndistance trail system. Existing long-distance trails are used mostly by \npeople living close to the trail and by weekend users. Backpacking \nexcursions are normally a few days to a couple of weeks long. For \nexample, of the estimated three million users of the Appalachian Trail \neach year, only about 150 to 200 are ``through-hikers'' who hike the \ntrail from end to end. This will also be true of the American Discovery \nTrail as well, especially because of its proximity to urban areas.\n  The ADT, the first of the Discovery Trails, will connect six national \nscenic trails, 10 national historic trails, 23 national recreational \ntrails, and hundreds of other local and regional trails. The ADT will \nbe a thread that sews together a variety of events, cultures, and \nfeatures that are all part of the American experience.\n  What makes the ADT so exciting is the way it has already brought \npeople together. More than 100 organizations along the trail's 6,000 \nmiles support the effort. Each state the trail pass through already has \na volunteer coordinator who leads an active ADT committee. This strong \ngrassroots effort, along with financial support from Backpacker \nmagazine, Ford Motor Company, The Coleman Company and others have \nhelped take the ADT from dream to reality.\n  Only one more very important step on the trail needs to be taken. \nCongress needs to authorize the trail as part of our National Trails \nSystem.\n  The American Discovery Trail begins (or ends) with your two feet in \nthe Pacific Ocean at Point Reyes National Seashore, just north of San \nFrancisco. Next are Berkeley and Sacramento before the climb to the \nPacific Crest National Scenic Trail and Lake Tahoe, in the middle of \nthe Sierra Nevada Mountains.\n  Nevada will offer Historic Virginia City, home of the Comstock Lode, \nthe Pony Express National Historic Trail, Great Basin National Park \nwith Lehman Caves and Wheeler Peak.\n  Utah will provide National Forests and Parks along with spectacular \nred rock country, until you get to Colorado and Colorado National \nMonument and its 20,445 acres of sandstone monoliths and canyons. Then \nthere's Grand Mesa over Scofield Pass, and Crested Butte, in the heart \nof ski country as you follow the Colorado and Continental Divide Trails \ninto Evergreen.\n  At Denver the ADT divides and becomes the Northern and Southern \nMidwest routes. The Northern Midwest Route winds through Nebraska, \nIowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. The Southern Midwest Route leaves \nColorado and the Air Force Academy and follows the tracks and wagon \nwheel ruts of thousands of early pioneers through Kansas and Missouri \nas well as settlements and historic places in Illinois, Indiana, \nKentucky until the trail joins the Northern route in Cincinnati.\n  West Virginia is next, then Maryland to the C Canal into Washington \nD.C. The Trail passed the Mall, the White House, the Capitol, and then \nheads on to Annapolis. Finally, in Delaware, the ADT reaches its \neastern terminus at Cap Henlopen State Park and the Atlantic Ocean.\n  Between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans one will experience some of \nthe\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\nmost spectacular scenery in the world, thousands of historic sites, \nlakes, rivers and streams of every size. The trail offers an \nopportunity to discover America from small towns, to rural country \nside, to large metropolitan areas.\n  When the President signs this legislation into law, a twelve year \neffort will have been achieved--the American Discovery Trail will have \nbecome a reality. The more people who use it, the better.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. Lincoln, \n        and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 500.

REMOVAL OF IMPEDIMENTS TO SUFFICIENT SUPPORT \n                   MECHANISMS.\n\n       Section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       (m) Removal of Impediments to Sufficient Support \n     Mechanisms.--\n       (1) Removal of caps on high cost support mechanisms.--The \n     caps and limitations on universal service support contained \n     in sections 36.601(c), and 36.621(4) and 54.305 of the \n     Commission's regulations (47 CFR 36.601, [etc]) shall cease \n     to be effective on the date of enactment of the Universal \n     Service Support Act. The Commission shall not, on or after \n     such date of enactment, enforce or reimpose caps or \n     limitations on support mechanisms for rural telephone \n     companies or exchanges they acquire based on fund size or \n     other considerations unrelated to the sufficiency of support \n     to achieve the purposes of this section.\n       (2) High cost support and nationwide average \n     calculations.--The Commission shall\n       (A) calculate that portion of the high cost support \n     mechanism attributable to loops that have costs that are in \n     excess of 115 percent of the nationwide average under section \n     36.631 of the Commission's regulations (47 CFR 36.631) as in \n     effect in the date of enactment of the Universal Service \n     Support Act; and\n       (B) calculate the nationwide average unseparated loop cost \n     for purposed of sections 36.621 (a)(1)-(3) and 36.622 of \n     those regulations (47 CFR 36.621 and 36.622) as in effect on \n     such date of enactment of such Act, taking into account the \n     elimination of caps and limitations of support pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Rockfeller, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 501. A bill to amend titles IV and XX of the Social Security Act \nto restore funding for the Social Services Block Grant, to restore the \nability of States to transfer up to 10 percent of TANF funds to carry \nout activities under such block grant, and to require an annual report \non such activities by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators \nJeffords, Rockefeller, and Snowe, to introduce the Social Services \nBlock Grant Restoration Act of 2001. This important block grant, \ncommonly known as ``SSBG,'' is more than just money.\n  When SSBG was written into law two decades ago, the goals were \nspelled out clearly. SSBG was created to ``prevent, reduce or eliminate \ndependency.'' It exists to help people ``achieve or maintain self-\nsufficiency.'' It meant to ``prevent or remedy neglect, abuse or \nexploitation of children and adults unable to protect their own \ninterests,'' and for ``preserving, rehabilitating or reuniting \nfamilies.''\n  In other words, SSBG is a commitment on the part of this country to \nthe most vulnerable members of our society. SSBG has become a \ncommitment by this country to help address the pressing needs of many \nof our senior citizens. SSBG dollars are used to provide training \nservices for those making the transition from welfare to work.\n  It is a commitment to protect children. It is a commitment to those \nin need of mental health services and those with disabilities. It is a \ncommitment to states that the federal government recognizes and shares \nthe responsibility for providing human services programs.\n  For too long we shrugged off this commitment and directed these vital \nfederal dollars to other programs. Data from the Department of Health \nand Human Services shows how many lives this has affected.\n  In 1998, SSBG accounted for 25 percent of all federal, state, and \nlocal expenditures for services for the disabled; 24 percent of all \nexpenditures for child protective services; and 22 percent of all \nexpenditures for adult protective services.\n  The state of Florida relies on SSBG for 25 percent of its budget to \nprotect abused and neglected elderly persons.\n  These are all programs that touch the lives of the people who sent us \nhere--people who are rarely able to lobby us here in our nation's \nCapitol. This program directly relates to the goals that the new \nmarkets tax credit would achieve--enhancing peoples' lives and giving \nvulnerable communities the ability to thrive.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this critical piece \nof legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2082-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2082-S2087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 50--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEES OF THE \n   SENATE FOR THE PERIODS MARCH 1, 2001, THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, \n   OCTOBER 1, 2001, THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, AND OCTOBER 1, 2002, \n                       THROUGH FEBRUARY 28, 2003.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                               S.

Res. 55\n\n       Whereas the month of April has been designated National \n     Child Abuse Prevention Month as an annual tradition initiated \n     in 1979 by former President Jimmy Carter;\n       Whereas the most recent Government figures show that almost \n     1,000,000 children were victims of abuse and neglect in 1998, \n     causing unspeakable pain and suffering to our most vulnerable \n     citizens;\n       Whereas among the children who are victims of abuse and \n     neglect, more than 3 children die each day in this country;\n       Whereas the rate of child fatalities resulting from child \n     abuse and neglect in 1998 for children aged 1 and younger \n     accounted for 40 percent of the fatalities, and for children \n     aged 5 and younger accounted for 77.5 percent of the \n     fatalities;\n       Whereas head trauma is the leading cause of death of abused \n     children, including the trauma known as Shaken Baby Syndrome;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome is a totally preventable form \n     of child abuse, caused by a caregiver losing control and \n     shaking a baby that is usually less than 1 year of age;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome can result in loss of vision, \n     brain damage, paralysis, seizures, or death;\n       Whereas an estimated 3,000 children are diagnosed with \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome every year, with thousands more \n     misdiagnosed and undetected;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome often results in permanent, \n     irreparable brain damage or death to an infant, and more than \n     $1,000,000 in medical costs to care for a single, disabled \n     child in just the first few years of life;\n       Whereas the most effective solution for ending Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome is to prevent such abuse, and it is clear that the \n     minimal costs of education and prevention programs may \n     prevent enormous medical and disability costs and untold \n     grief for many families;\n       Whereas prevention programs have been shown to raise \n     awareness and provide critically important information about \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome to parents, caregivers, day-care \n     workers, child protection employees, law enforcement \n     personnel, health care professionals, and legal \n     representatives;\n       Whereas prevention of Shaken Baby Syndrome is supported by \n     groups such as the\n\n[[Page S2095]]\n\n     Shaken Baby Alliance, an organization which began with 3 \n     mothers of children who had been diagnosed with Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome, and whose mission is to educate the general public \n     and professionals about Shaken Baby Syndrome and to increase \n     support for victims and victim families in the health care \n     and criminal justice systems;\n       Whereas child abuse prevention programs and ``National \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'' are supported by the \n     Shaken Baby Alliance, Children's Defense Fund, American \n     Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical Association, Child \n     Welfare League of America, Prevent Child Abuse America, Brain \n     Injury Association, National Child Abuse Coalition, National \n     Exchange Club Foundation, American Humane Association, Center \n     for Child Protection and Family Support, Inc., National \n     Association Of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, \n     and many other organizations including the National \n     Basketball Association, which is sponsoring a series of ``NBA \n     Child Abuse Prevention Awareness Night 2001'' events to \n     generate public awareness about the issue of child abuse and \n     neglect during National Child Abuse Prevention Month 2001;\n       Whereas a year 2000 survey by Prevent Child Abuse America \n     shows that \\1/2\\ of all Americans believe child abuse and \n     neglect is the most important issue facing this country \n     compared to other public health issues; and\n       Whereas Congress strongly supports efforts to protect \n     children from abuse and neglect: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the third week of April, as ``National \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'' for the year 2001 and \n     all future years; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation urging \n     the people of the United States to remember the victims of \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome and participate in educational programs \n     to help prevent Shaken Baby Syndrome.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nto proclaim the third week of April each year as ``Shaken Baby Syndrome \nAwareness Week''. I would like to recognize the many groups, \nparticularly the Shaken Baby Alliance, who support this effort to \nincrease awareness of one of the most unspeakable forms of child abuse, \none that results in the death or lifelong disability of thousands of \nchildren each year.\n  We must recognize child abuse and neglect as the public health \nproblem it is, one that is linked with a host of other problems facing \nour country, including poverty and drug and alcohol addiction, and one \nthat needs the comprehensive approach of our entire public health \nsystem to solve. For the past twenty years, the President of the United \nStates has designated one month each year as National Child Abuse \nPrevention Month to increase awareness of the devastating harm done to \nour children by abuse and neglect. In 2001, April will be National \nChild Abuse Prevention Month.\n  The extent of the tragedy that is child abuse is well-documented. The \nmost recent government figures show that almost 1 million children were \nvictims of abuse in 1998. Each day, three of these children die as a \nresult of this abuse. The U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and \nNeglect reported in ``A Nation's Shame: Fatal Child Abuse and Neglect \nin the United States,'' that a more realistic estimate of annual child \ndeaths as a result of abuse and neglect, both known and unknown to \nChild Protective Service agencies, is closer to 2,000, or approximately \nfive children per day. The latest data showed that in 1998, the rate of \nchild fatalities resulting from child abuse and neglect in 1998 for \nchildren aged 1 and younger accounted for 40 percent of the fatalities. \nFor children aged 5 and younger child abuse and neglect accounted for \n78 percent of the fatalities.\n  Because of the problems of under-reporting and errors in diagnoses, \nthe National Center for Prosecution of Child Abuse believes that the \nnumber of child deaths from maltreatment per year may be as high as \n5,000. In most cases, the child's death is the result of head trauma, \nincluding the trauma known as Shaken Baby Syndrome, SBS. Shaken Baby \nSyndrome results from a caregiver losing control and shaking a baby, \nusually an infant who is less than 1 year old. This severe shaking can \nkill the baby, or it can cause loss of vision, brain damage, paralysis, \nand seizures, resulting in lifelong disabilities. This totally \npreventable form of child abuse causes untold grief for many families \nwhose child dies, or is left with permanent, irreparable brain damage. \nThe care for the child's resulting disability is estimated at more than \n$1 million in medical costs during just the first few years of the \nbaby's life.\n\n  The most effective solution to ending Shaken Baby Syndrome is to \nprevent such abuse, and it is clear that the minimal costs of \neducational and prevention programs may help to protect our young \nchildren and stop this tragedy from occurring. In 1995, the U.S. \nAdvisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect recommended a universal \napproach to the prevention of child fatalities that would reach out to \nall families through the implementation of several key strategies. Such \nefforts began by providing services such as home visitation by trained \nprofessionals or paraprofessionals, hospital-linked outreach to parents \nof infants and toddlers, community-based programs designed for the \nspecific needs of neighborhoods, and effective public education \ncampaigns.\n  Child abuse prevention programs have been shown to raise awareness \nand provide critically important information about Shaken Baby Syndrome \nand other forms of abuse to parents, caregivers, day care workers, \nchild protection employees, law enforcement personnel, health care \nprofessionals, and legal representatives. Many prevention programs now \ninclude not only information about the dangers of shaking babies and \nhow to cope with crying, but also address issues of anger management, \nstress reduction, appropriate expectations of children, and specific \ninformation on why shaking or impact can interrupt early brain \ndevelopment. Education programs for judges and others in the judicial \nsystem are also beneficial for SBS criminal cases. Ultimately, the \neducation of all will help us reach a critical goal of zero tolerance \ntoward shaking, a goal that will help to save children's lives.\n  The prevention of Shaken Baby Syndrome is supported by groups such as \nthe Shaken Baby Alliance, an organization which began with 3 mothers of \nchildren who had been diagnosed with Shaken Baby Syndrome, and whose \nmission is to educate the general public and professionals about Shaken \nBaby Syndrome, and to increase support for victims and victim families \nin the health care and criminal justice systems. In my own state of \nMinnesota, the Shaken Baby Alliance is represented by the outstanding \nefforts of Kim Kang, whose daughter Rachel was diagnosed in 1995 with \nShaken Baby Syndrome, after being violently shaken by a day care \nprovider. My heart goes out to her family, and to all of the families \nwho deal with the results of Shaken Baby Syndrome and all other forms \nof child abuse and neglect.\n  Child abuse and neglect is a scourge on our country, and we must do \nmore to prevent the damage done to our children, our families, and our \nsociety as a result of child abuse, and to help those who suffer its \nconsequences. Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week is supported by the \nShaken Baby Alliance, Children's Defense Fund, American Academy of \nPediatrics, American Medical Association, Child Welfare League of \nAmerica, Prevent Child Abuse America, Brain Injury Association, \nNational Child Abuse Coalition, National Exchange Club Foundation, \nAmerican Humane Association, Center for Child Protection and Family \nSupport, Inc., National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related \nInstitutions, and many other organizations including the National \nBasketball Association, which is sponsoring a series of ``NBA Child \nAbuse Prevention Awareness Nights 2001'' events to generate public \nawareness about the issue of child abuse and neglect during National \nChild Abuse Prevention Month 2001.\n  This year the Congress also has the opportunity to seriously address \nthe issue of child abuse and neglect by increasing the funding for \nprevention and training programs as part of the reauthorization of \nChild Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, CAPTA. I look forward to \nworking with my Senate and House colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto direct additional resources to the prevention of abuse and neglect \nof our children. We must do more as a country to protect our vulnerable \nchildren from this most serious betrayal of trust, to prevent the \nfatalities and severe physical and psychological harm that results from \nsuch abuse, and to help those who work to end this national tragedy by \nproviding the resources they need to do their work.\n\n[[Page S2096]]\n\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this resolution designating the third week \nof April each year as ``Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'', and to \ntake part in the many local and national activities and events \nrecognizing the month of April as National Child Abuse Prevention \nMonth. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the Resolution be \nprinted in the Record following my statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/08/senate-section/article/S2096-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2096-S2100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 19.

Senator Conrad said he would be happy to yield the floor \nto offer amendments. He will come at 10:15 or whenever we come in, in \nthe morning.\n  The point is, anyone within the sound of my voice, we have 86 \namendments. There will come a time next week when we have to dispose of \nthe amendments. That is the agreement that has been tentatively reached \nby the two leaders. I hope people are not upset next week when there \nmay be motions to table and other things done to dispose of some of the \namendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator Reid, I appreciate you saying that. That is exactly \nwhat I was urging. There are over 100 amendments pending that have been \nsuggested or listed by over 30 Senators. Some Senators may have other \ncommitments tomorrow, may be in their States with legitimate and \nofficial business, but surely not all 30 Senators are gone. Friday \nwould be a wonderful time to talk at great length on the great wisdom \nof any amendments that might be offered. I hope that happens.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the important \nprogress that has been made in the difficult post-war political and \neconomic transformation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  Some critics of American policy seem inclined to seize on every shred \nof negative news as alleged arguments for pulling up stakes and \ndisengaging from the Balkans.\n  I have never belonged to this ``cut and run school,'' and, in fact, \nthe good news I have to report illustrates two fundamental truths: \nfirst, that persistence pays; and second, that more than ever, we need \nto continue to be engaged on the ground in Bosnia.\n  Since the November 2000 elections--which, I might add, the \ninternational news media quickly, and incorrectly, dubbed a major \nsetback for the Dayton Accords - several positive political and \neconomic developments have occurred in Bosnia, at both the national and \nthe entity level, that merit our close attention.\n  In fact, the situation has progressed to the point where Bosnia and \nHerzegovina now stands at a critical juncture. For the first time there \nappears to be a fundamental shift away from the ultra-nationalist \nparties that have until now dominated Bosnia's post-war political \nprocess.\n\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, immediately after the war ended, each \nof the main ethnic groups - the Bosniaks, or Muslims, the Croats, and \nthe Serbs--rallied around ultra-nationalist leaders who had neither the \ncapability nor the intention of bringing about a united Bosnia.\n  But now there has been a fundamental shift away from these ultra-\nnationalist parties and toward a government that is more moderate and \ninclusive and less nationalistic.\n  But the tide, Mr. President, has not yet definitively turned. Let me \ntry to explain this fairly complex picture.\n  At the level of both the Muslim-Croat Federation and of the national \ngovernment of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the main agent of this remarkable \nshift has been a coalition of non-nationalist parties aptly known as \nthe ``Alliance for Change.''\n  In the wake of the November elections, these parties found the \npolitical courage to put aside their disparate interests and agendas \nand push together to oust the hardline nationalists.\n  In early February, the Alliance scored its first major victory at the \nnational level when it closed ranks to defeat the election of \nnationalist candidate Martin Raguz for Prime Minister.\n  In the process, in a truly remarkable breakthrough, the ultra-\nnationalist Serb presidency member joined the Muslim presidency member \nfrom the nationalist Bosniak SDA party in backing a non-nationalist \ncandidate for Prime Minister, Bozidar Matic, who was put forward by the \nAlliance.\n  I am told that Ante Jelavic, the third presidency member who leads \nthe hard-line Bosnian Croat HDZ party, stormed out of the presidency \nsession in a fury. Having met Mr. Jelavic in Bosnia several years ago, \nI am not surprised at his behavior.\n  Two weeks ago on February 22--three months after the elections--Matic \nand his team of ministers were confirmed as the first ever non-\nnationalist government in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  Then, on February 28, came word of a second stunning success, this \ntime at the Federation level. In another political first for Bosnia, \ntwo non-nationalist candidates nominated by the Alliance for Change, \nKarlo Filipovic and Safet Halilovic, were elected as President and \nVice-President of the Federation.\n  Mr. President, these are momentous changes. These two gentlemen are \ngenuine democrats who have bought into Dayton. I am confident that they \nand their allies will now push for full implementation, including \nadopting a new elections law, an effectively functioning Federation \nlegislature, and honest economic reform.\n  In a promising harbinger of the new political order, Prime Minister \nMatic gave the nationalist parties a clear indication of his priorities \nwhen he told them: ``I don't speak Serbian, Croatian, or Bosnian. I \nspeak the language of competitive economic skills, because that's the \nonly language that will help us survive.''\n  That would be an ordinary statement for anybody to make in any other \ndemocracy but it is a breathtaking statement in Bosnia.\n  That, Mr. President, is the language of Bosnia's future.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Jelavic and his ultra-nationalist cronies in the \nHDZ appear unwilling to accept their defeat and leave power gracefully. \nLast Saturday, at a self-appointed congress held in Mostar, the Bosnian \nCroat National Assembly announced its intention to form a separate \nCroat political entity in all but name and to establish temporary self-\nadministration. This move, which would be a clear violation of the \nDayton Peace Accords, has been roundly condemned by the international \ncommunity.\n  In point of fact, the HDZ's actions reveal just how desperate Jelavic \nand his ilk have become. With the Alliance for Change poised to \nsolidify its new political gains, Jelavic was forced to play the \nnationalist card once again by claiming that he alone is defending the \ninterests of Bosnia's Croat community.\n  This assertion, however, is patently false, for Jelavic does not \nspeak for all Bosnian Croats. People like Kresimir Zubak, the newly \nappointed national Minister of Refugee and Human Rights, and Jadranko \nPrlic, the former foreign minister and currently Deputy Minister for \nForeign Trade and Economic Relations, are both Croat moderates who are \ncommitted to Dayton's full implementation.\n  Zubak called the Croat People's Assembly ``an illegitimate \ninstitution'' that ``cannot take lawful decisions.''\n  Yesterday, in response to this illegal behavior, High Representative \nWolfgang Petritsch, an experienced Austrian diplomat, removed Jelavic \nfrom his post as Croat Member of Bosnia's collective presidency. Put \nanother way, he said, you are no longer president.\n  I met with Mr. Petritsch several weeks ago in Sarajevo, and I welcome \nhis resolute action.\n  I emphasize, Mr. President, that this move by the High Representative \nwas backed by the reformist Mesic/Racan Government of Croatia--which in \nitself speaks volumes about recent political progress in the \nBalkans. This is the new leadership in Croatia that came to power in \nthe wake of Franjo Tjudman, a man who was almost, in my view, as bad as \nSlobodan Milosevic. The new Croatian Government said it does not \nacknowledge or support Mr. Jelavic's attempt to set up a separate \nentity.\n\n  Positive change is afoot even in the Republika Srpska, where the \nultra-nationalist SDS, a party with the dubious honor of having been \nfounded by one of the worst war criminals, in my view --but whether you \nbelieve me or not, someone who has been indicted for alleged war \ncrimes--Radovan Karadzic, won a clear plurality of votes in the \nNovember elections.\n  In what had to have been a delicate political dance, the non-\nnationalist Bosnian Serb Prime Minister, Mladen Ivanic, has succeeded \nin building a government in which the influence of the SDS has been \nformally neutralized, although some SDS-leaning individuals have been \nincluded in the Cabinet. I met with him for hours when I was recently \nin Sarajevo.\n  It took great courage for him to do what he did. After all, the party \nof Karadzic had won. And what was said at the time by the Muslims, as \nwell as the Croats in attendance, was if, in fact, you do not exclude \nall those who are active members of the SDS, we will not cooperate, but \nif you do, we will form a government with you.\n  Incidentally, Mr. President, much of the credit for these success \nstories should go to our talented and hard-working Ambassador in \nSarajevo, Tom Miller.\n  In addition, two other dedicated Americans--Ambassador Jacques Klein, \nthe head of the U.N. Mission in Bosnia, and General Michael Dodson, the \nCommander of SFOR, have greatly improved the cooperation between their \nrespective organizations, which had been sorely wanting for some time \nafter Dayton.\n  An illustration of this fruitful cooperation is the fact that \nrefugees are returning in record numbers to their\n\n[[Page S2103]]\n\npre-war homes. The 2000 total was 65 percent higher than the 1999 \ntotal. And the 1999 total was 100 percent higher than 1998. This \ndevelopment is due in large part to the atmosphere of security made \npossible by the presence of SFOR and the International Police Task \nForce, run by the United Nations Mission.\n  Returns are up even in areas where some of the worst ethnic cleansing \ntook place, and even in Srebrenica--the site of Europe's worst massacre \nsince World War II, people are returning.\n  The other link in the international chain is the United Nations' \nOffice of the High Representative, whose head, Mr. Petritsch, acted so \nswiftly against the ultra-nationalist Bosnian Croat leader. Had he not, \nI believe the Dayton accords would be in shambles, and we would be back \non the verge of chaos.\n\n  This action followed a move in February in which he removed one of \nthe most corrupt Bosnian officials, former Prime Minister Adhem \nBicakcic, from his post at the head of the country's largest electric \nutility, which he was using as his own private little till for his \nparty, and banned him from holding future public office. It is \nestimated that Bicakcic diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars in \npublic funds to the Party of Democratic Action, the country's largest \nMuslim political party, and to private bank accounts.\n  He is a fitting poster-boy for the kind of behavior that can no \nlonger be tolerated in Bosnia if Bosnia is ever going to turn its \neconomy around.\n  There is more to cheer about on the economic front. Large-scale \nprivatization is finally underway, and the communist-era payment \nbureaus, long a source of petty corruption, were shut down in early \nJanuary, a move which should pave the way for a viable banking system \nto take hold.\n  Let me again stress that I do not believe by any stretch of the \nimagination we have definitively turned the corner in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. But thanks to the strikingly positive developments that \nhave occurred in the last few months, Bosnia finds itself at an \nimportant crossroads, which makes our continued, active engagement \nthere all the more urgent.\n  As I have said many times, we have come too far and accomplished too \nmuch to simply abandon the people of this region to the purveyors of \nultra-nationalism and ethnic division who are waiting and hoping that \nour resolve will dissipate over time.\n  We need to support those forces--embodied in the Alliance for \nChange--that are struggling to end the post-war status quo of \nnationalist party dominance and to implement Dayton's political \nstructures in a meaningful and durable way.\n  They represent the best hope for Bosnia's full integration into \nEurope's political and economic structures.\n  When that day comes, with mission accomplished we and our allies can \nclose up shop and head home secure in the knowledge that we have helped \nextend the zone of European stability to include another Balkan \ncountry.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
