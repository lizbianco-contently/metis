Mr. President, we all have been touched by the events at \nthe Pentagon this morning. As I walked in, there was a woman whom I do \nnot know, but she is symbolic of the sacrifices that people have made. \nHer face had been burned very badly, she had no hands, and her arms had \nbeen burned. This is what the terrorist activity is all about.\n  This innocent woman, who never did anything to anyone, has been \nsubjected to this physical torture. It goes without saying that she has \ngone through and will go through many skin grafts and other such \nprocedures so that she can learn to use her prosthetic hands, which she \ndoes not have yet.\n  It used to be when a building was constructed, they had a ceremony, \non every major construction, called the laying of the chief \ncornerstone. What does that mean? It means that the final stone in the \nfoundation of that building will be laid.\n  Why did people celebrate that event? They celebrated because they \nknew if that building had a strong foundation, it would be fine.\n  In our life in America, that foundation, that chief cornerstone is \nthe Constitution of the United States. That little document that people \nspeak about in this Chamber--led by, more than anyone else, Senator \nByrd--is the chief cornerstone of this great democracy.\n  As we are forced to remember these events of September 11--because it \nis\n\n[[Page S8476]]\n\neasy not to put unpleasant thoughts in our minds--as we are forced to \nremember these events, and rightfully so, we have to remember that this \ncountry has a firm foundation because the chief cornerstone of the \nfoundation of this country is our Constitution.\n  Today, of course, is the first anniversary of the September 11 \nterrorist attacks on America. On this day we remember, as we will do \nevery year on September 11, those tragic events that our Nation \nexperienced on September 11, 2001.\n  What happened in New York, at the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania has \nleft many of us--in fact, all of us--with memories and strong emotions. \nI know that Nevadans were deeply affected by the terrorist attacks in \nthe aftermath, and I feel good about how people in Nevada have reacted.\n  We were hurt very badly. Our No. 1 business is tourism, and tourism \ntook a terrible blow. But those business entrepreneurs, people who \nworked for those large corporations, and the people who worked for the \nsmall businesses recognized that time would solve the problems, that \ntime would heal a lot of the tourism problems, and it has. We are not \nback to where we were, but we are OK. I am proud of how the people of \nthe State of Nevada have reacted.\n  We also have had from the State of Nevada a pouring out of sympathy, \ncomfort, and consolation for those who were killed and hurt. We lost a \nteacher in the terrorism attacks, a teacher at Palo Verde High School. \nWe lost two soldiers who were killed in action. So we will always \nremember what happened.\n  As individuals and in private, we will often reflect on this national \ntragedy. We cannot confine our memories to a single day or be guided by \nthe calendar, but September 11 will forever be the day that we \ncollectively, as a nation, as a people, as America remember. We \nremember those whose lives were ended so suddenly and violently, not \nknowing what happened.\n\n  We remember the firefighters. We remember the police officers--the \nfirefighters are New York's bravest, the police officers are New York's \nfinest--and all other emergency and rescue workers who accepted the \nrisks in rushing into burning buildings giving their lives, suffering \nphysical and mental injury to help save the lives of people they did \nnot know.\n  We remember the sacrifice, the selflessness, the heroism, and the \ncourage of all of those who offered aid. We must remember those who \nsurvived and the thousands who did not. We must remember the parents, \ngrandparents, children, sisters, brothers, wives, husbands, partners, \nand friends who have been robbed of not a weekend, not a week, not a \nmonth, not a year, but they have been robbed of their loved ones \nforever.\n  From the stories they have shared, we remember not only the deaths \nbut the lives of their loved ones, remember their loss, and their \nstruggle to heal. We remember our personal losses, our pain, even our \nanger, and, of course, our tears.\n  We remember the shock of seeing massive metal towers collapse as if \nthey were Erector Sets that our grandchildren constructed. We have seen \nthese massive metal towers reduced to rubble. We all remember the fire \nand the smoke.\n  I will never forget leaving room 219, after Senator Daschle told us \nwe had to evacuate the building, looking out the window and seeing the \nsmoke billowing out of the Pentagon where we were this morning. We \nremember, though, the effort to rebuild the Pentagon. We remember the \ngenerosity and spirit of Americans coming together to offer kindness, \nmoney, compassion, and consolation. We remember the sympathy expressed \nby foreign governments. As the President expressed this morning, some \n90 foreign governments--I think it was the President; maybe it was \nSecretary Rumsfeld--are helping us in our battle in Afghanistan.\n  We remember that individuals all over the world opened their arms and \ntheir hearts to America. We remember the gruesome images so vivid that \nthey are etched in our minds, and we remember how the spirit of our \nNation was awakened, how Americans demonstrated resilience and resolve. \nWe remember how the country united to support the war on terrorism. We \nremember the soldiers who were killed as part of our military efforts \nin Afghanistan. We remember, and we must always remember, the firm \nfoundation of our country. We are a country guided by the Constitution \nof the United States, which separates us from the rest of the world. \nThat is why we have remained a strong, vibrant democracy for more than \n200 years.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak on this matter for as \nmuch time as I may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my thoughts on this \nvery solemn day of remembrance as we all return from a magnificent \nceremony at the Pentagon observing all that is strong and good and \nawesome about our country.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada for his very poignant words of \nempathy, as well as his understanding of the foundations of our \ncountry. Nevada, as all States, was hit hard.\n  We saw the outpouring of compassion all over this country, and I will \nshare some of those stories. I recall in August driving across a lonely \ntwo-lane road in South Dakota, which would eventually get to the \nBadlands. There was a big bale of hay on the side of the road which had \npainted on it the American flag. It showed the spirit of that farm. We \ndid not see any people, but we knew the sentiment of the folks who \nlived on that farm and in that region.\n  September 11, 9/11, just those words evoke sentiments and memories of \nwhere we were and what we did on that day of tragedy. As we remember \nthose vile terrorist attacks of one year ago, for many of us the \nemotions and shock, the disbelief and horror that we experienced \nindividually and as a people and a nation are still fresh. Those \nmemories, however, continue to strengthen our resolve in the same way \nthat our Nation was forged together after those vile attacks a year \nago.\n  Today, we view our Nation in a fundamentally new light. We have a \ngreater understanding of the freedoms we enjoy and how vital it is that \nthey be guarded, preserved, and even fought for, if necessary. We have \na greater appreciation for a country that respects people of diverse \nbackgrounds, cultures, and religious beliefs. We have poured out our \nhearts and our assistance to those who were injured and the families of \nthose who lost a dear one. We view firefighters, police officers, first \nresponders, with much greater appreciation, whether they are the brave \nmen and women of the battalions in New York City or northern Virginia \nor in communities large and small all across our United States of \nAmerica. These men and women were transformed on that day into our \nheroes. We will forever remember the thousands of innocent men, women, \nand children who were killed at the World Trade Center and in a field \nin Somerset County, PA.\n  This Senator will remember the 184 patriots at the Pentagon and on \nAmerican Airlines flight 77 who lost their lives on Virginia soil. It \nis indeed the heroes and the innocent patriotic victims we will \nremember the most. The images of flags raised, the solemn salute of \nrescuers to their fallen comrades, and people who were rushing into \nburning buildings on the verge of collapsing hoping to just save one \nmore life.\n  They and the freedom-loving patriots across our great Nation stand in \nstark contrast to those who only know hate, destruction, and \noppression.\n  We also see that in a time of trial, ordinary people of all walks of \nlife perform with extraordinary courage and dignity. We remember people \nsuch as LTC Ted Anderson, who carried two of the injured from the \nburning Pentagon and reentered through a broken window to drag out two \nmore, one whose clothes were on fire; 1SG Rick Keevill and Virginia \nState Troopers Mike Middleton and Myrlin Wimbish, who entered the \nPentagon three separate times looking for victims; LCDR David \nTarantino, who moved a pile of rubble enough to pull a man from the \nPentagon just before the roof collapsed; other Pentagon heroes such as \nSSG Christopher Braman; LTC Victor Correa; SGT Roxane Cruz-Cortes; MAJ \nJohn Grote; LTC Robert Grunewald; COL Philip McNair; CPT Darrell \nOliver; SP Michael Petrovich; SGM Tony\n\n[[Page S8477]]\n\nRose; LTC Marilyn Wills; and CPT David Thomas.\n\n  The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, mentioned a woman who I think was \nMrs. Kurtz at the Pentagon. Mrs. Louise Kurtz, though severely burned \nherself, valiantly tended to the needs of others around her. I am \nintroducing legislation that will change current law so that \nindividuals--such as Mrs. Kurtz, and those in her situation--can \ncontribute to her retirement and so they will be able to afford to \nreturn to work after a very lengthy period of recuperation.\n  We also remember people such as Barbara Olson, a passenger on flight \n77 who had the presence of mind to call loved ones on the ground to \nalert them of the hijacking.\n  We remember CPT ``Chic'' Burlingame of flight 77 who died fighting \noff hijackers who commandeered his plane and who is now properly buried \nat Arlington National Cemetery. These people have all touched our \nlives.\n  In talking to Mr. Burlingame's brothers and sister and wife, I find \nit noteworthy that at the Arlington National Cemetery his grave is on \nthe tour and people in the tradition of those of the Jewish faith will \nput rocks on his headstone. That is very touching to the family and \nshows the unity and appreciation of a grateful nation.\n  We also remember the survivors, survivors such as Stephen Push, whose \nwife Lisa Raines perished in the Pentagon and who has become a forceful \nand articulate spokesman for victims and families.\n  I will always remember, and thought of it last night while driving \nhome, a young boy, a neighbor, a friend of my children whose name is \nNick Jacoby. He lost his father on flight 77.\n  There are stories all over our communities and Nation. We also, of \ncourse, remember the quiet dignity of people such as Lisa Beamer who \nhelped keep their loved ones very much alive for all of us. Her husband \nTodd, who said, ``Let's roll,'' led an uprising with several other \npatriots against the hijackers of flight 93 and saved hundreds, if not \nthousands, of lives at the Capitol and in the Washington, DC, \narea. Recent reports recognize their likely target was this building.\n\n  We will remember countless others whose courageous efforts saved \nlives and provided comfort. We will remember and we will thank them for \ntheir extraordinary, inspirational dignity and their character. We will \nalso remember the construction workers, the hard-hat patriots of the \nPhoenix project who worked around the clock in their inspiring efforts \nto rebuild the Pentagon in plenty of time for employees to move in \nbefore the 1-year anniversary.\n  We will remember folks from a church that made quilts, the Christ \nBaptist Church from Prince William in Manassas, a magnificent quilt \nwith the names of all who died. Also, we will remember the \nInternational House of Pancakes in Bristol, VA, an IHOP owned by an \nAmerican who came here from Lebanon. I asked him a few months later how \nhis business was. He said right after the attacks, for a few weeks, \nthere were hardly any customers. But then a Methodist Church in \nBristol, on the Virginia-Tennessee line, brought up the situation, and \neveryone from that church on that Sunday went in with their families \nand filled up the IHOP. Since then, others were coming back. That is a \nsign of the decency and the care of communities across the Nation.\n  Five days ago, in New York City, I had the opportunity to speak to a \ngroup of 70 mothers who were pregnant last September 11, and who were \nmade widows on that terrible day. It has been said that suffering makes \nkinsmen of us all. While those mothers no longer have the physical and \nemotional support of their husbands, and the fathers of their children, \nthey are now a part of our greater American family. In those babies, \nall under 1 year, the spirit and blood of their fathers live on. We \nwant the babies to grow up with the optimism of liberty and opportunity \nand hope that is the spirit of America. These young children represent \nnot just a birth but a rebirth, a rebirth and a rededication of the \nstrength and unity of our Nation and her great, caring people as we \nmove forward. Indeed, our Nation will be changed for generations by the \ntragic events of a single day and all those that followed September 11. \nWe pray for the souls of all that we lost that day and their surviving \nfamilies as well.\n  As a Senator from Virginia, for the permanent Record of our Republic, \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed the names of all the men, \nwomen, and children who perished in that attack on Virginia soil.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   The 184 Victims Who Perished at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001\n\n     Paul W.

I add in closing, the Burlingame family, wife and \nsurviving brother and sister, gave me a replica of one of the few \nthings found from Captain Burlingame, other than his wedding ring. He \nhad a picture of his mother and a prayer. They gave this to me a couple \nhours ago at the ceremony at the Pentagon.\n  I share it with my colleagues and Americans. It is entitled: ``I Did \nNot Die,'' by Mary Frye.\n\n     Do not stand at my grave and weep;\n     I am not there, I do not sleep.\n     I am a thousand winds that blow.\n     I am the diamond glints on snow.\n     I am the sunlight on ripened grain.\n     I am the gentle autumn rain.\n     When you awaken in the morning's hush\n     I am the swift uplifting rush\n     Of quiet birds in circled flight.\n     I'm the soft stars that shine at night.\n     Do not stand at my grave and cry;\n     I am not there, I did not die.\n\n  Never forget. We will never forget. We will always remember this day \nthat forged America together. These horrific events have strengthened \nour unity of purpose and resolve as Americans, that we stand strong \ntogether for liberty. I hope and pray that as long as God continues to \nbless our United States and indeed blesses the entire world with people \nof such courage, integrity, and character, that liberty and justice \nwill endure and prevail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to remember, \nto reflect, to try to somehow do justice to the memory of those lost to \nus on September 11. The tremendous grief we felt then, and still feel \nso sharply today, makes this anniversary a painful one for all of us as \na nation, and as a people.\n  The anguish of that day will always be with us, but those of us who \nwitnessed those acts of terror on our television screens know that we \ncannot imagine the suffering of those who perished in the attacks, or \nthose who survived them.\n  The families and friends of those who died must live with terrible \nloss, and those who survived must live with searing memories.\n  No passage of time can ever erase the emotions of that day. But 1 \nyear later, we also know that no passage of time can diminish the \nlegacy left behind by those who perished. They will always be with us, \nliving on in the family and friends who loved them.\n  No passage of time will allow us to regain what was so tragically \nlost on that morning. But one year later, with the passage of time, we \nsee so clearly what was briefly obscured by smoke and fear and \ndisbelief. We see the strength of the people around us--their everyday \nheroism, their generosity, and their humanity.\n  No passage of time can change what happened on September 11. But the \nlast year has shown us that when our Nation was tested by terror, we \ndid not falter, and most of all we did not fail each other. We rose \ntogether to meet the challenges before us, and we found that together \nwe were capable of more than we ever imagined.\n  So today we find strength in each other. We find strength in the acts \nof heroism, and the acts of simple humanity, that took place on \nSeptember 11 and in the aftermath of the attacks: the bravery of the \nfirst responders at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and the \nacts of kindness of Americans all over the country who donated blood, \nobserved moments of silence, or flew the flag in a show of patriotism \nand support.\n  Each of these acts, however large or small, contributed to our \ngrowing faith in the Nation's recovery, and in each other.\n  I was deeply proud of the many Wisconsinites who reached out to the \nvictims of September 11 and their families. Volunteers from around the \nstate flocked to disaster relief organizations to donate money and \ndonate their time to support the victims of the attacks.\n  A number of Wisconsin volunteers also traveled to the World Trade \nCenter to support the rescue workers. That desire all of us felt to do \nsomething, anything we could to help the victims of the attacks ran \ndeep in my state, as it did everywhere across the country.\n  Just as the firefighters and police on 9/11 redefined bravery and \nheroism, in the uncertain days that followed, the Americans who reached \nout to help the victims and their families redefined generosity and \npatriotism.\n  A number of companies in Wisconsin, as so many businesses nationwide, \nalso donated to the rescue efforts. Fire truck manufacturers such as \nPierce Manufacturing of Appleton, WI, and Marion Body Works of Marion, \nWI, donated critical replacement equipment to the New York City Fire \nDepartment. Seagrave Fire Apparatus of Clintonville, WI, rallied to \ncomplete previously ordered equipment for the New York City Fire \nDepartment in the wake of the attacks, and sent staff to New York to \nhelp the Department repair damaged equipment.\n  These efforts reaffirmed our faith that Americans would rise to this \nchallenge, as we have so many times throughout our Nation's history. \nAnd we are rising to that challenge.\n  It has not been easy, and I frankly don't believe that all the \nchoices we have made have been the right ones. But that has never \naffected the pride I feel to be an American during this extraordinary \ntime in our history. I couldn't be more proud of the way Americans have \ncome together in the wake of this tragedy, and I have been privileged \nto serve in the Senate during this last year.\n  What we as a nation have accomplished over the last year, and what we \nwill accomplish in the years to come to meet the challenge of \nterrorism, will be our mark on history, not just as a Congress but as a \ngeneration.\n  It is of course impossible to summarize what happened on 9/11 and \nwhat it means. There were so many moments--public and private, captured \non film and also lost to history--that make up our collective memory of \nthat day.\n\n[[Page S8479]]\n\n  The New York Times section ``Portraits of Grief,'' however, is one \nlaudable effort to pay tribute to the victims as individuals by \nremembering and celebrating each of their lives. These brief stories of \nthe victims' lives remind us that the people who died that day were \nfrom every walk of life, from all over the country, and from all over \nthe world. They remind us of what America truly is--a sea of \nnationalities and ethnicities never before seen in human history. The \nbitter irony of al-Qaida's desire to kill Americans is that people from \nevery corner of the world have become citizens of this Nation. Like \nplaces all across America, the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and \nthe hijacked planes were filled with people with roots in Africa, \nEurope, the Middle East, Asia, and Central and South America.\n  These people and their families came here for different reasons, and \nthey likely lived vastly different lives. But all of them had the \nchance to be a part of this great and free Nation. And all of them were \nsenselessly struck down on September 11.\n  One such man was Ramzi Doany. I would like to read the story \npublished in the ``Portraits of Grief'' section of the New York Times \nabout this man, who lived for many years in my home state of Wisconsin.\n\n       Ramzi Doany amassed friends. He amassed them with acts of \n     kindness, like tutoring a woman with lupus, two children and \n     no husband, to get her through college, or letting his \n     college roommate and the roommate's wife live in his condo \n     for two years so they could save money for a down payment on \n     a house.\n       He amassed friends with his sense of humor, which filled a \n     room and flourished at an early age. As a boy of 9 or 10, \n     young Ramzi dug a hole in the backyard for a terrible report \n     card and put a stone on top. ``He said it was dead and \n     buried,'' said his sister, Dina Doany Azzam.\n       Mr. Doany was born to Palestinian parents in Amman, Jordan, \n     and lived for many years in Milwaukee. At 35, he devoured the \n     novels of Dickens, cooked Thanksgiving turkeys with great \n     pride (even if they were just a bit dry) and had just bought \n     a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. He chose to work as a forensic \n     accountant last March for Marsh & McLennan, the insurance \n     brokerage company, because it would bring him to New York, a \n     city he loved. The job also brought him to the World Trade \n     Center.\n       It was a funny sort of journey, his sister said.\n\n  This man's journey, like so many others, was tragically cut short on \nSeptember 11.\n  On this day, the passage of time is bittersweet. Whatever the healing \npowers of time, no passage of years can change what happened on \nSeptember 11. But the passage of time brings other gifts.\n  This last year has brought us resolve--the firm resolve to stop \nterror, to preserve our liberty, and to do justice to the memory of \nthose who died.\n  It has also shown us our own resilience--how Americans, even in the \ninitial moments of shock and horror of the attacks, showed so much \nbravery, so much compassion, and so much generosity.\n  Finally, time has brought renewal. It has renewed our strength, our \nhope, and our faith in each other.\n  So it is with this resolve, this resilience, and this sense of \nrenewal that we move forward, in the name of those who perished, \ndedicated to fighting terror, and united by our faith in this great and \nfree Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in the morning hours of September 11 our \nnation endured a terrible tragedy. Though thousands of miles from the \ncrash sites, the response from our ``Last Frontier'' was overwhelming. \nAlaskans rushed to aid the victims of the terrorist attacks. They \nvolunteered rescue dogs and handlers. They waited in line for three \nhours to donate blood. Some boarded planes and traveled to Ground Zero \nto aid in the search and rescue efforts. In December, those Alaskans \nwere still there clearing debris.\n  Alaskans who could not travel to the crash sites offered support in \nother ways. Over 10,000 Alaskans signed two fifty-foot banners bearing \nthe phrase ``Love and Prayers, from the People of Alaska.'' One banner \nwas presented in New York City by Alaskan firefighters. The other now \nhangs in the Pentagon. Countless Alaskans donated funds to help victims \nthrough the economic hardships brought on by the attacks. In Kenai, the \nFirefighters Association petitioned our state to name a mountain after \nSt. Florian, the patron saint of firefighters, as a tribute to \nfirefighters killed in the World Trade Center.\n  This year, Alaskans once again join the nation in mourning and \nremembrance. Today, I attended the Pentagon's memorial service, but in \nmy home State. Alaskans will pay tribute to our heroes in their own \nunique way. Anchorage residents will observe a moment of silence at \n8:46 a.m. Emergency responders from across Alaska will gather on Barrow \nStreet in Anchorage and join firefighters and police in a procession. A \nmemorial wall will be erected at Town Square. In Homer, Motzart's \n``Requiem'' will be performed as part of a worldwide sequence of \nperformances beginning at the hour of the attack and moving from one \ntime zone to the next. I hope all Alaskans who cannot participate in \nthese events will attend a memorial and prominently display American \nflags.\n  I am proud of Alaska's efforts to honor and remember the victims of \nthis tragedy. On that fateful morning they gave what Lincoln called the \n``last full measure of devotion.'' We honor their memory and their \nsacrifice.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming. The \nSenator is advised that under the previous order at the hour of 11:40 \nthe Republican leader will be recognized to speak.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to share some \nthoughts about this day.\n  We all have memories, of course, of a year ago. They are so clear \nafter a year. Nothing like that has ever happened in this country. We \nremember it as we see it again on TV today.\n  We have had a year to react, to recognize and accept the fact that it \ndid happen. The unbelievable thing, shocking as it was, did happen. But \nwe have also had the time to change from the immediate anger that we \nhad, and the disbelief, to a commitment and resolution to do all that \nis necessary to make certain that it does not happen again.\n  We have had this year to increase our loyalty to our country and to \nour flag, to increase our understanding of the values of freedom and \ndemocracy, to commit our resolve to help and support those who have \nlost loved ones, family members, and friends, to accept the reality \nthat here in the Congress we can disagree and have different views on \nnormal, daily issues, but when it comes to protecting our country and \nto preserving freedom, we all come together.\n  The events of September 11 have clearly changed the way Americans \nview the world. We watched the events unfold. No one will ever forget. \nEveryone around the world has been touched, and we see some of that \nnow. We are embroiled in a struggle against people who do not care \nabout their lives and have set out to ruin ours. Sadly, we lost lives, \nbut we regained a strong commitment to preserving our freedom and our \nintegrity.\n  So all and all, it has been a year of shock, disbelief, anger, \nfollowed by commitment, caring, sharing, patriotism, and determination. \nI think we should be very proud of our fellow Americans for their \ncommitment, their willingness to sacrifice and to give--whether it be \non the battlegrounds overseas, whether it be in rescue missions or law \nenforcement, in charity to the needy, leadership in our country both at \nthe community and national level, or just caring for our friends and \nneighbors and loving our families. This year has put an emphasis in all \nthese values.\n  The United States will survive and will strengthen. Freedom will \nendure, and we thank God for the opportunity to be able to ensure that \nfor our future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, my time was to begin at 11:40 and we are a \ncouple of minutes before that time. If I can take a moment before I \nbegin with that, I will seek recognition now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I acknowledge the fine statement that was made by Senator \nThomas and thank him for his efforts today to make sure that Senators \nare aware of the opportunity to come to the floor of the Senate and pay \nappropriate tribute and recognition, and express the condolences that \nare so appropriate for that occasion. I want to\n\n[[Page S8480]]\n\nmake sure he was aware of our appreciation.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this day, September 11, is its own memorial. \nA year ago I got a call from my daughter, expressing her horror and her \nsorrow on this, her birthday--and only 2 weeks after her new daughter \nwas born. She talked about how ``I will just change my birth date. I \nwill celebrate it a day earlier.'' She asked me, ``What exactly is this \nsituation in this world I have brought my daughter into?''\n\n  It struck me that she would have those questions and those concerns, \nand what she had seen that day. She worried about what it means for the \nfuture.\n  I talked to her this morning on her birthday. She celebrates her \nbirthday today, as she should--not just because it was the day she was \nborn but because she now realizes that in some ways, in spite of her \nhorror, this is an even more special day--this is Patriots Day.\n  So my special pen from the Pentagon service will go to my daughter on \nthis day because I think in a way how she felt a year ago and how she \nfeels today reflects what we have all gone through and what we have \nexperienced.\n  The truth is that this day doesn't really require any speeches or \nceremonies, though we certainly will have them all day long. We really \nneed no monument to remind us of the suffering and sorrow that befell \nour country 1 year ago today.\n  As we sat there next to the wall of the Pentagon, I kept thinking \nabout the innocent men, women, and children who lost their lives so \ninexplicably and so mercilessly on that day. But I also think about \nthose who tried so hard that day to save people's lives with danger to \nthemselves. Some of them probably were injured, and some of them maybe \nwere killed--and all that has gone into the work at that building to \nsymbolize the importance of us showing that we are mending our wounds \nand we are going to be stronger from what we have experienced.\n  The wound that we had last year hasn't healed, nor should we expect \nit to be healed so quickly, nor many of the scars. The scars will be \nthere. As a nation, we lost a great deal--not only these innocent lives \nin Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York, but also that sense of \nsecurity, and perhaps even naivety that we have experienced thinking \nthat this is America, we are free and we are accessible, and we go and \ndo what we want without being better in any way.\n  Well, that has changed. I believe we have been hurt deeply--not just \nthose who were directly involved, but all of us who watched it--all \nAmericans and all freedom-loving people all over the world.\n  I continue to be so pleased and, frankly, thrilled with the reaction \nI get when I meet with leaders from countries all over the world--and \njust average people on the streets of other countries. They come up and \nexpress their condolences and their support.\n  Yesterday I met with the President of Bulgaria and the Prime Minister \nof Portugal. Their comments were so reassuring and satisfying. They \nhave done their part. Bulgaria--yes. Bulgaria has had troops in \nAfghanistan and, fortunately, has stood with us and will stay with us \nin the future.\n  We have been hurt deeply. But our observance of this day is about \nmore than grief, it is about more than anger, and it is about more than \nappreciation. It is about valor and courage beyond words adequate to \ndescribe what has happened and how we feel. It is about compassion and \nit is about a unity of spirit.\n  I have felt that I have seen it as I have gone across this country. I \ndo not know how many States I have been in over the past year--but a \nlot of them, and there is a different feeling. When people sing ``God \nBless America'' and start taking the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag, \nthey sing and speak differently--with a little more gusto. But it is \nnot about a flag, although that is what becomes so much a symbol of \nwhat we are experiencing internally. And it is not solely even about \nindividuals. It is about ideas and principles--the values that have \nmade this country what it is.\n\n  In this body, we don't take an oath to people or an oath to a person. \nWe take an oath to the Constitution. So that unity of spirit has really \nbeen so obvious since I have gone into States in New England and the \nSouth and the West and the far West. It is about faith that looks \nthrough death and a consolation beyond all human assurance.\n  This morning, when we joined President Bush at the Pentagon to \nformally reopen that section of the building destroyed in the terrorist \nattack, we all again felt those emotions of a year ago. I was sitting \nnext to Senator Daschle, and we couldn't help but remember a year ago \nwhen we flew in a helicopter, along with Senator Reid and Senator \nNickles, right over that area. We looked down and saw what was going \non--the smoke, the confusion, and the activities in trying to save \npeople's lives, put out the fire, and deal with all that was going on. \nIt is a site that has been burned into my memory forever.\n  Needless to say, there couldn't be a better symbol than the \nrestoration of the Pentagon for the way America's Armed Forces have \nresponded to the assault on our country. God bless them for what they \nhave done and for what they are doing today.\n  But those who were responsible for that horror--and all those who \nshelter them, finance them, abet them, encourage them, or reward them--\nshould understand this: America's most important rebuilding is not the \nshattered wall of the Pentagon, nor the scar in the earth in New York \nCity. For what we have restored in the past year cannot be measured in \ngranite and steel, nor even grassy knolls, as in the case of \nPennsylvania. We have rebuilt a wall of resolve, of determination, and \nof steady purpose.\n  We have renewed trust in our leadership, and in one another, yes. We \nwill disagree on this floor and we will argue about the best way to do \nthe homeland security part and what should be the limitations on terror \ninsurance. That is what democracy is all about. But in the end we have \nbeen able to find a way over the past year to come together and get a \nresult. That is through determination and a steady purpose.\n  We have renewed trust in ways that I hope will stay with us for a \nlong time. We have rediscovered in our shared sorrow the power of a \ntruly free society to overcome the enemies of freedom.\n  These are our battlements and these are our armaments, and their \nmight is going to be felt both here at home and in lands far away--\nuntil the hand of terror is crushed and the work of justice is done.\n  Again, we extend our heartfelt condolences to those family members \nwho lost loved ones last year. We remind ourselves of how heroes were \nborn on that date out of that horror, and we rededicate ourselves to \nthe purpose of preserving this great young Republic and all the \nfreedoms for which it stands.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I begin by complimenting the \ndistinguished Republican leader on his eloquence and his message this \nmorning.\n  It was 1 year ago today that many of us turned on our television and \nsaw what we could only imagine at the time was a horrible, horrible \naccident. Soon we realized that it was no accident. Instead, it was the \nworst terrorist attack on American soil.\n  Later this morning the wing of the Pentagon that was destroyed is \nbeing rededicated. That field in Shanksville is once again green. The \ndebris from the site of the World Trade Center has been removed. The \nheavy equipment and the workers are now engaged in the act of \nbuilding--not removing.\n  Through the physical scars of that day, we see a nation beginning to \nbe healed. The emotional ones are still raw with our memory. Thousands \nof families are approaching their second Thanksgiving without a loved \none. Children are approaching their second holiday season without a \nmother--or a father. Empty locker in firehouses still bear witness to \nthe brave men who are no longer there.\n\n  And so, the Pentagon can be restored. New grass can cover the churned \nearth of a rural field. New towers can begin to rise where others fell. \nSeasons and years can pass. Through it all, we will never forget.\n  This day will forever be a part of our national memory. Nine/eleven \nwill forever be our national shorthand for all\n\n[[Page S8481]]\n\nthat we witnessed, all that we have experienced--on that day and the \ndays following.\n  That is what we remember all across America today.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, there will be a number of small \nservices, including a memorial ceremony at Mount Rushmore.\n  In Seattle, WA, citizens will march to a downtown fountain that \nbecame the city's unofficial memorial after September 11. Thousands of \nflowers had been left there. Those flowers were gathered by the city \nand composted. Each marcher will receive a bulb, in mulch generated by \nthe original memorial flowers, to plant.\n  Birmingham, AL, is dedicating a new memorial walk. San Francisco is \nunfurling a 5-mile long banner along the city's coastline.\n  From Portland, ME, to Portland, OR, people are pausing, and paying \ntribute. All tolled, more than 200 communities are holding events of \nsome kind. In one way or another, all Americans have the opportunity to \ncommemorate our Nation's loss.\n  And, of course, some people will simply go about their business--and \nthat in itself is a powerful testimonial to our ability to go on.\n  Today is also a day to remember that our national tragedy is the \ncombination of thousands of individual tragedies.\n  I think that sentiment was best stated by Janny Scott, a reporter on \nthe Metro desk of the New York Times, who was responsible for \nassembling a number of the ``Portraits of Grief'' that sought to \ncapture the essence of each of the victims.\n  She wrote about ``the individual humanity swallowed up by the \ndehumanizing vastness of the toll,'' and what she called ``the \npreciousness of each life's path.''\n  This morning, in New York, former Mayor Giuliani began the process of \nreading the names of everyone who perished on that day. If one name is \nread every 5 seconds, it will take over 4 hours to list every loss.\n  We also remember the individual acts of heroism: Firefighters who \nrushed up to help others get down; the passengers and flight attendants \non flight 93, who showed us that we don't ever have to surrender to \nevil.\n  Seeing their selflessness inspired something similar in all of us. In \nSouth Dakota, one ranch couple--themselves struggling--sold $40,000 \nworth of cattle and donated the proceeds to the victims. Similar acts \nof selflessness took place all over the country. Millions of hands \nreached out to those who had lost so much, until, by the act of \nreaching out and grieving, and remembering, we all came shoulder to \nshoulder as we understood the extraordinary nature of the loss.\n  The terrorists who brought down the World Trade Center thought they \ncould shake the foundation of this country. They didn't understand that \nthe foundation isn't concrete and steel; it is our people, it is our \ncommitment--our commitment--to freedom and democracy, and to each \nother.\n  So today, we remember those we lost, and we rededicate ourselves to \npreserving the memory of their lives, and to defeating the terror that \ntook them.\n  Our military men and women in Afghanistan and those fighting terror \naround the globe carry with them our pride, and our hopes.\n  In the most fateful struggles in human history, freedom has triumphed \nover the worst forms of tyranny, and we will defeat the tyranny of \nterror as well.\n  On March 11, 6 months after the attack, Valerie Webb, a 12-year-old \nwho had lost her only living parent in the World Trade Center, flipped \na switch, sending two towers of light rising into the darkness over \nLower Manhattan.\n  Someone compared that memorial to a national votive candle. Others \ncompared it to the lives that were lost: beautiful, powerful, and \nfleeting. On April 14, as planned, that temporary memorial was \nextinguished.\n  At sunset tonight, in Battery Park, New York's mayor will light a \nflame to commemorate the victims of that day. Unlike the towers of \nlight, that flame will not be extinguished--it will be eternal.\n  That flame will burn within sight of another eternal flame--the \nsymbolic flame from the torch held by the Statue of Liberty.\n  Those two eternal flames carry with them two eternal promises.\n  The torch held by the Statue of Liberty is our Nation's promise that \nwe will never yield in our determination to be a light to all those who \nseek freedom.\n  And the flame that will be lit tonight is our promise that though we \nmay be slowly, steadily walking the path from remembrance to recovery--\nwe will never forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/11/senate-section/article/S8481-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MOMENT OF SILENCE IN RECOGNITION OF THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, later this afternoon in my home State of \nVermont, the chief judge of the Federal district court, Judge William \nSessions, will have an immigration ceremony, and I might say that I \ncan't think of anything more fitting. We will have memorials and other \nevents throughout the State of Vermont today, just as we will in other \nStates.\n  Many of us had been at the Pentagon earlier this morning, heard the \nmoving statements, and saw the resolve of the men and women who protect \nthis Nation. We heard our President and Secretary of Defense and \nothers.\n  It is right that throughout the country we have different events to \nmark this occasion.\n  I want to especially compliment Judge Sessions for what he is doing \nin Vermont. If there is anything that speaks to the resiliency of this \nNation, the greatness of this Nation, it is welcoming immigrants, \nsaying our borders are not sealed, our borders are open.\n  We want to welcome people who will continue to make this country \ngreat, just as did my paternal great-grandparents and my maternal \ngreat-grandparents who came to this country not speaking any English \nbut who sought employment and a new life. My grandfathers were stone \ncutters in Vermont, immigrant stock. My wife was the first generation \nof her family to be born here in the United States. It is immigrants \nwho have made this Nation strong.\n  What Judge Sessions is doing is telling us that our borders and our \ncountry and our arms are still open to the mix of people from \nthroughout the world who will continue to give us the diversity we \nneed, just as our Constitution gives us diversity and guarantees that \ndiversity in the first amendment. We now have new Americans who will be \nhere with the same rights and privileges the rest of us have, and the \nNation will be a better place for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I know a lot of Senators wish to be \nheard. While I won't ask unanimous consent that this be done, I would \nurge that the Chair recognize members of both parties in alternating \nfashion to\n\n[[Page S8482]]\n\naccommodate both sides equally. That might be the best way to \naccommodate everybody. That way we can get through the afternoon in the \nmost appropriate way.\n  I urge and ask the Chair to recognize Senators on either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, we have just returned from a most \nhistoric and moving ceremony at the Department of Defense. That \nbuilding will always occupy in my heart a very special place for I was \nprivileged to serve there during 5 years and 4 months of the period of \nthe war in Vietnam in the Navy Secretariat, including my service as \nSecretary of the Navy.\n  On 9/11, of course, I joined colleagues briefly here in the Chamber \nand then we exited and with other colleagues who were gathered in the \npark, we chatted a little bit about what we should do. I returned to my \noffice and conducted a brief prayer meeting and recommended to my staff \nthat they proceed to their homes and their loved ones.\n  In about an hour or two, however, I decided I would like to go to the \nDepartment of Defense again because of my very special high regard for \nthe men and women of the Armed Forces and that dastardly act committed \nby terrorists. I called the Secretary of Defense, whom I had known for \nmany years. We both served in the administration of President Nixon and \nPresident Ford. He said: Come right over.\n  I called my good friend and colleague, Carl Levin, at his home, and \nCarl immediately said, yes, he would join us, and the two of us then \nproceeded to the Department of Defense where we joined Secretary \nRumsfeld and then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Shelton. It was \na memorable afternoon there at the command post watching the \nmagnificence of our command structure dealing with the many unknowns, \nand yet taking the proper actions.\n  The President called in. Both Senator Levin and I spoke with him \nbriefly. Then we went back with the Secretary to where the plane had \nstruck the building and visited with all those who were performing \nheroic acts right before our eyes in hopes of saving other lives and \ndoing what they could to comfort those wounded.\n  We then returned with the Secretary. And Secretary Rumsfeld asked \nSenator Levin and I to accompany him to a press conference. We stood \nbehind the Secretary and the Chairman while they spoke. And then \nunexpectedly, Secretary Rumsfeld turned to both of us and asked us to \nmake a few remarks.\n  I have here this morning the remarks I made, with no preparation, \njust speaking from the heart. And they are as true today, 1 year later, \nas they were at about 6:30 on the afternoon or the evening of 9/11 when \nSenator Levin and I joined the Secretary. I will just repeat these \nremarks.\n  I stated that I was joined by my distinguished chairman, Carl Levin, \nand I said, speaking to the Nation:\n\n       I can assure you that the Congress stands behind our \n     President and the President speaks with one voice for this \n     entire Nation. This is, indeed, the most tragic hour in \n     America's history, and yet I think it can be its finest hour, \n     as our President and those with him, most notably our \n     Secretary of Defense, our chairman [of the Joint Chiefs] and \n     the men and women of the armed forces all over this world \n     stand ready not only to defend this nation and our allies \n     against further attack, but to take such actions as are \n     directed in the future in retaliation for this terrorist \n     act--one of the most unprecedented in the history of the \n     world.\n       We call upon the entire world to step up and help, because \n     terrorism is a common enemy to all, and we're in this \n     together. The United States has borne the brunt, but [which \n     nation] can be next? Step forward and let us hold accountable \n     and punish those that have perpetrated this attack.\n\n  Under the leadership of our President and the courage of the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces and the strength of the citizens of this \nNation, that has been done, is being done, and will be done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, under the order now in effect, Senators \nhave up to 10 minutes to speak, and we would ask that everyone would do \ntheir best to confine themselves to that 10 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of speakers be as I am going to \noutline them. These names have been given to our staff. The staff has \ngiven these to me: Senator Feinstein, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, \nSenator Levin, Senator Snowe, Senator Dorgan, Senator Shelby, Senator \nDodd, Senator Bennett, Senator Durbin, and Senator Brownback. If \neveryone uses their 10 minutes, that is going to take some time. What I \nwould suggest is that staff be notified of those who wish to speak this \nafternoon, and we will be happy to do that to make it so that people \nhave to wait not a very long period of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to share some of my \nthoughts on this very special day, a day that commemorates one of the \ndarkest days in our Nation's history.\n  Those of us who listened this morning to the recitation of the names \nof those killed in the World Trade Center and the Pentagon found in \nthose names both a message of grief and one deep in sorrow. Also in \nthose names was a profound message of how deeply the world is \ninterwoven. The reading of these names was, for me, an unforgettable \nmessage of our diversity.\n  My sorrow, my sympathy, my condolences go to those who have lost so \nmuch. For many, they have lost everything; yet they still have their \nspirit, their hope, and their determination, and they still have the \nlove of a very sympathetic Nation.\n  On September 11, we all felt as if the loss was too much to bear, as \nif it would be impossible to go on. But out of the ashes of the World \nTrade Center and the Pentagon, we in Congress returned to work. We \ntried in our legislative ways to address the terrorist threat. Within a \nweek of the attack, we approved a resolution authorizing the President \nto use force against those who would perpetuate or harbor the \nterrorists.\n  Within a month, we approved the USA Patriot Act, which authorized our \nlaw enforcement and intelligence agencies to take the necessary steps \nto root out the terrorist threat and to protect the Nation.\n  In May of this year, we approved the border security and visa reform \nlegislation, which overhauled the way this Nation allows immigrants and \nvisitors into the country.\n  In June, we approved a bioterrorism bill that included strict \ncertification requirements for laboratories that handle anthrax, \nsmallpox, and more than 30 other deadly pathogens.\n  At the same time, the United States launched a war against terror. In \nAfghanistan, the U.S. forces, working with the Northern Alliance, \nousted the Taliban, fought al-Qaida troops, and made it possible for \nHamid Karzai to be elected President--Afghanistan's first democratic \nelection.\n  U.S. special forces were also sent to the Philippines, to Yemen, and \nGeorgia to train local troops on how to fight the war against terror. \nWe have broken up al-Qaida cells in Spain, France, Morocco, and \nSingapore, preventing planned attacks.\n  In the financial world, the Treasury Department began examining the \nfinancing of terrorist organizations, freezing more than $34 million in \nterrorist assets.\n  Now the Senate is considering two additional steps to defend our \nNation: a bill to create a new Department of Homeland Defense and a \ncomprehensive review of the intelligence failures that led to 9/11.\n  I would expect the Senate to approve the homeland defense bill in the \ncoming weeks, and, hopefully, it will be signed into law by the end of \nthe year.\n  On September 17, the Intelligence Committees of both the House and \nthe Senate will open their first hearings on our intelligence review, \nwhich has been going on now for 6 months.\n  One year has now passed. The Nation has shown its resolve and \nresiliency. Now we must show our staying power.\n  For me, what emerged from 9/11 were four specific points:\n  First, we must stay the course on the war on terror. We must ferret \nout, bring to justice, one by one, group by group, those al-Qaida, or \nothers, who would simply kill because they hate.\n  Secondly, we must make this country as safe as possible: eliminate \nloopholes in laws, prevent fraudulent entry\n\n[[Page S8483]]\n\ninto our country, ensure that deadly chemicals and biological agents \nare properly handled, and see that the national security is protected, \nwherever possible.\n\n  Thirdly, we have to reinforce the hallmarks of America: liberty, \njustice, freedom. Despite this crisis, the Constitution and the Bill of \nRights remain strong and central to our way of life.\n  Finally, we need to celebrate our democracy, and the way we do that \nis simple: We make it work. We produce for our people. We pass good \nlegislation. We administer the programs. We show that democracy offers \nsolutions to the real problems of our society.\n  Let me say one thing about remaining vigilant in the war against \nterror. Much of the al-Qaida organization remains intact, including \ntwo-thirds of the leadership, and possibly Osama bin Laden himself. \nAfghanistan is our beachhead in the war on terror. We cannot lose it or \nwe lose the war on terror. Yet Afghanistan's leadership is fragile. \nJust last week there was an attack on President Karzai's life.\n  We have an obligation to provide for the security of Afghanistan and \nits leaders and ensure that the nation does not fall under the control \nof regional warlords. We must ensure that the Afghan economy becomes \nupwardly mobile.\n  We have work to do to find those in hiding, whether in Pakistan, \nYemen, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, Southeast Asia, and, yes, in our own \ncountry. Al-Qaida remains poised to do their dirty deeds.\n  America learned on September 11 a very simple and sobering lesson--\nthat there are people in the world who would destroy us if they could. \nWe must remember this fact and do all we can to stop them. This means \nstaying the course and winning the war against terror. This means \nkeeping focused on the immediate threat from al-Qaida, and this means \nlooking for new ways to strengthen our Nation's homeland defense.\n  As we all consider the past year, let us remember all of those who \nperished in the attacks and in their memory rededicate ourselves to \ndoing all we can to making our Nation strong and preventing a similar \nattack in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I would like to split my time with \nmy colleague from Texas, so I wish to be notified when I have used 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, 1 year ago today, 3,000 people woke \nup, kissed their loved ones goodbye, went to work, and never returned. \nIn the blink of an eye, their lives were brutally taken by the violent \nacts of terrorists.\n  Together, we grieved and mourned for those who lost their lives. We \nmarveled at the heroism and bravery of the first responders--the \nfirefighters, emergency personnel, and police officers--who rushed into \nthe devastation to help others, many sacrificing their own lives in the \nprocess.\n  But the American spirit of resilience rose from the ashes of Ground \nZero, the Pentagon, and that quiet field in Pennsylvania. Our \ncollective anguish became our national resolve. We focused our energies \non destroying the cowardly instigators of this tragedy so they could \nnot do it again to us or any other nation on Earth.\n  We will forever recall this day, but we are not a vengeful people. As \nAmericans, we value peace, freedom, and liberty. We know our diversity \nand tolerance of other views, religions, and ways of life are what make \nour Nation great. We do not perpetuate hatred or violence. We teach our \nchildren to love one another and treat others with respect.\n  America was born out of a great struggle. The words of our Founding \nFathers ring as true today as they did more than 200 years ago. In \n1771, Samuel Adams said:\n\n       The liberties of our country, the freedom of our civil \n     constitution, are worth defending at all hazards; and it is \n     our duty to defend them against all attacks. We have received \n     them as a fair inheritance from our worthy ancestors: they \n     purchased them for us with toil and danger and expense of \n     treasure and blood, and transmitted to us with care and \n     diligence.\n\n  It is our duty to carry on the crusade for freedom that generations \nof Americans have fought and died to keep. The heroes of September 11 \ndid not lose their lives in vain. The protection of our liberty and \nfreedom remains resolute.\n  It is the words of a civilian hero that remain with us, a young man \nwith a pregnant wife at home. He saw the horrors on his airplane that \nmorning on September 11 as they were flying over Pennsylvania. He \nrealized from telephone reports that this airplane, too, was part of a \nterrible plan headed for one of our treasured symbols of freedom in \nWashington, DC. Though he had little time to prepare, he and other \nbrave passengers decided to fight. And Todd Beamer's last words in his \nvaliant effort are our battle cry in this war on terrorism: ``Let's \nroll.''\n  America is ready to roll, Madam President, and we will never forget \nthose who gave their lives for our freedom on September 11, 2001.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank my dear colleague and tell her I \nam very happy to have my remarks appear next to hers.\n  A year ago today, terrorism struck at the very symbols of American \ndemocracy and capitalism, as if by destroying those symbols, as if by \ndestroying the buildings, as if by killing innocent people, they could \ndestroy those institutions.\n  They failed.\n  Like millions of Americans, a year ago today I watched the horror of \nthe terrorist attacks. But then I watched the triumph of the human \nspirit. I watched ordinary Americans, people pretty much like us, who \non that day did extraordinary things.\n  A year ago today, our Nation's leaders watched, and we were helpless, \nlike everybody else, to do anything about the problem. I am proud to \nsay today that we are not helpless, that we have started to fight back.\n  Our homeland is more secure today than it was a year ago, but it is \nnot as secure as it has to be. We are fighting a war, but the Congress \nhas to give to our military and to our law enforcement officials the \ntools they need to finish the job.\n  When in doubt, I believe we must act. What is at issue is the safety \nof the American people, and I am not willing to turn that safety over \nto our allies, to the United Nations, or to anybody else. Where terror \nhides, it must be rooted out and it must be destroyed, and if we have \nto do that alone, then America is willing and capable of doing that \nalone.\n  In my 24 years of public service in Congress, I have always been \nproud of my country and my countrymen, but I have never been prouder \nthan I have been in the last 12 months. It has always been a privilege \nto serve, but in the last 12 months it has been my great privilege to \nserve the greatest country in the history of the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, 1 year ago today, the openness and \nfreedom of American society were used against us when terrorists \nhijacked civilian passenger jets and used them as missiles to demolish \nthe Twin Towers of the World Trade Center and destroy a large section \nof the Pentagon. The fourth jet hijacked that infamous morning, United \nFlight 93, may well have been headed for this Capitol Building before \nbrave crew members and passengers fought back against their captors.\n  One year ago today, over 3,000 people had their lives snatched away \nfrom them. The emotional trauma of those losses has affected each and \nevery American. No State, no town, no community, no person has been \nleft untouched.\n  The despicable actions of the terrorists last September 11 have \nchanged the world, not only because of what they have destroyed, but \nalso because of what they have kindled in the American people.\n  In New York City, at the Pentagon, in the skies over Pennsylvania and \nacross America, 1 year ago today and in the days since then, we have \nseen the bravery, compassion, determination, and shared sense of \npurpose of Americans from all walks of life. As one writer put it, \n``September 11 did not alter the American character, it merely revealed \nit.''\n  I would add that it did not weaken our spirit, it strengthened it \nimmeasurably.\n\n[[Page S8484]]\n\n  We have, astoundingly, already rebuilt the mangled section of the \nPentagon, and we have cleared Ground Zero in New York City. We have \nconsecrated time and place and commemorated the heroic individuals who \nfaced 9/11 head on.\n  We are now engaged in a war on terrorism. It is unlike any war we \nhave ever fought. It has no boundaries. It has no clear end. Our \nenemies target civilians. They are not soldiers. They are not warriors. \nThey are murderers.\n  We have taken the battle to our enemy. We have destroyed the Taliban \nand disrupted the al-Qaida network. Those who have not been killed or \ncaptured we have driven into hiding. We have liberated Afghanistan from \nthe clutches of terrorists, and we have put the rest of the world on \nnotice that to harbor terrorists is to invite disaster.\n  In these sterner times, we have rediscovered that we are made of \nsterner stuff.\n  Yesterday, I had the honor of helping to plant a memorial Red Ash \ntree at the Pentagon. That tree, and eight others like it planted at \nthe site over the weekend, were propagated from parts of a champion Red \nAsh tree in Dowagiac, MI, named as such because it is the largest \nexample known of its species. That champion is 450 years old and 21 \nfeet around at its trunk. It spans the history of America. And, like \nthe American spirit, it is indomitable.\n  At yesterday's ceremony, I remarked that we Americans are as well-\nrooted as that champion Red Ash in Dowagiac, and like its crown, our \nNation's aspirations reach high into the skies above. The tendrils of \ndemocracy root us; our aspiration is an unquenchable desire for \nfreedom--for ourselves and for all people everywhere.\n  Archibald MacLeish wrote, ``There are those who will say that the \nliberation of humanity, the freedom of man and mind, is nothing but a \ndream. They are right. It is the American dream.''\n  We have shared that dream with the rest of the world.\n  For the better part of the last century, the United States and our \nallies fought a successful battle against the genocidal forces of \nfascism and totalitarianism. We defeated the Nazis. We won the Cold \nWar. In the bloody struggle between ideologies, democratic governments \ntriumphed over repressive regimes.\n  This democracy of ours and our allies will prevail against the likes \nof al-Qaida because the overwhelming majority of people in the world \nwant freedom and justice and dignity and opportunity. America remains a \nbeacon of hope to the oppressed everywhere. Our current generation of \nservice men and women, and the American people generally, will meet the \nnew challenges and threats that we face as a nation as successfully as \nwe met the challenges and threats of the last century.\n  The people who perished 1 year ago did not do so in vain. We will \nalways remember them and, most importantly, we will honor them by \ncarrying on that noble struggle for what has been called the American \ndream but what is actually humankind's dream.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nDetroit Free Press titled ``Michigan's 16 Legacies'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Detroit Free Press, Sept. 5, 2002]\n\n                         Michigan's 16 Legacies\n\n                           (By Sheryl James)\n\n       They were among America's best, brightest and happiest.\n       Many had attended some of the finest schools--Cranbrook, \n     Detroit Country Day, the University of Michigan, Harvard, \n     Yale, Princeton and Vanderbilt.\n       As teens, they walked the halls of schools from Cass Tech \n     in Detroit to Traverse City High, all of them contributing, \n     achieving, giving back. They were young scholars and \n     financial wizards, technology gurus, National Honor Society \n     members, athletes, musicians, champions of theater, \n     contributors to their communities.\n       Most of them were well traveled--and well on their way to \n     the kind of success that defines the American Dream. A few \n     already had achieved that dream, with homes in Manhattan, \n     book credits, TV appearances.\n       One of them survived the 1993 terrorist bombing of the \n     World Trade Center.\n       They are gone now, these 16 terrorism victims who had \n     significant Michigan ties. But their legacies live on--in \n     their accomplishments and through their loved ones left \n     behind.\n\n\n              financial whiz kid on fast track to success\n\n       Terence Adderley Jr., 22, had a head and a heart for \n     finance by the time he was a teenager. Before even graduating \n     from Detroit Country Day in 1997, he had started an \n     investment club. His grandfather, William Russell Kelly, \n     founded Kelly Services of Troy in 1946, and his father, \n     Terence E. Adderley, is its president and chief executive \n     officer.\n       Adderley, who grew up in Bloomfield Hills, took his love of \n     finance to Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., where \n     he earned a bachelor's degree in economics in May 2001. Soon \n     after, he landed a job with Fred Alger Management Inc., which \n     had offices on the 93rd floor of the trade center's north \n     tower.\n       Joseph White, a University of Michigan business professor \n     and former interim president, said Adderley had tremendous \n     potential\n       White knew Adderley through U-M alumnus David Alger, \n     president of Fred Alger Management. As a young analyst for \n     the company, ``Ted was thriving,'' White said. ``He loved \n     what he was doing.''\n       Besides his father, survivors include his mother, Mary \n     Elizabeth; five sisters, and a grandmother.\n\n\n                 EXECUTIVE HAD EYE FOR BEST, BRIGHTEST\n\n       David Alger, 57, president of Fred Alger Management Inc., \n     was a familiar fixture on CNN, MSNBC and CNBC--and at many U-\n     M events. He was a prominent alumnus and supporter of the U-M \n     business school, where, White said, he was the spring \n     commencement speaker in 1997 and served on the school's \n     senior advisory board.\n       Alger loved grooming young people for business and often \n     returned to his alma mater.\n       ``David was a terrifically talented man,'' White said. ``A \n     colleague of mine said, `I loved David's rational \n     exuberance,' and she got it just right. That was David: very \n     analytical and very optimistic. . . .\n       ``David encouraged people to participate in what he thought \n     would be the biggest bull market in American history--in \n     1991. It was an incredible prediction.''\n       Alger was born Dec. 15, 1943, in California but grew up in \n     Grosse Pointe. He received his undergraduate degree from \n     Harvard University and a master's in business administration \n     from U-M in 1968. He joined his brother Fred's company, Fred \n     Alger Management, in 1972 as an analyst. He eventually owned \n     20 percent of the business.\n       In 1995, Alger's brother moved to Geneva, Switzerland, and \n     left him in control of the company's daily operations. At the \n     time of Alger's death, the firm's assets had grown from $3 \n     billion to $15 billion and its workforce from 82 to 220.\n       Alger, who owned homes in Manhattan and Tuxedo Park, N.Y., \n     loved technology stocks and managed mutual funds that ranked \n     near the top of the 1990s bull market. He often appeared on \n     financial TV programs and wrote ``Raging Bull:` How to Invest \n     in the Growth Stocks of the '90s.''\n       On Sept. 11, Alger was working in company offices on the \n     93rd floor of the trade center's north tower. There were \n     1,300 people at his funeral, said White, who attended. Alger \n     is survived by his wife, Josephine; two daughters; his \n     brother, and a sister.\n\n\n                 UNFETTERED SPIRIT LOVED THE CITY LIFE\n\n       Eric Bennett, 29, a Flint native, caught the travel bug \n     early when he took a trip overseas with a high school foreign \n     language club. He traveled often afterward, said his mother, \n     Kathy Bennett of Flint.\n       He visited Brazil, Puerto Rico, Rome, London and Paris. but \n     Bennett also loved the Brooklyn, N.Y., brownstone where he \n     lived, the big-city life in New York and his job as area vice \n     president for Alliance Consulting Group. His office was on \n     the 102nd floor of the trade center's north tower.\n       ``From his home, he could see the towers, and from his desk \n     at work, he could see Brooklyn,'' his mother said. ``He just \n     loved life.''\n       In 1989, Bennett graduated from Flint's Kearsley High \n     School, where he had been cocaptain of the football team the \n     year before. In 1993, he received a bachelor of science \n     degree in computer information systems from Ferris State \n     University. He also played football at Ferris State and \n     earned an All-Midwest Intercollegiate Football Conference \n     honorable mention in 1992.\n       In addition to his mother, he is survived by his father, \n     Terry Bennett, and a sister.\n\n\n                WINGS FAN HELD FAMILY CLOSE TO HIS HEART\n\n       Frank Doyle, 39, formerly of New Boston and Bloomfield \n     Hills, was a loyal Detroit Red Wings fan. He grew up playing \n     hockey and was the varsity goalie from his first year on at \n     Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. Later, he played on \n     three mens hockey teams near his Englewood, N.J., home.\n       Doyle attended Huron High School in New Boston and \n     graduated from the Cranbrook Schools in Bloomfield Hills in \n     1980. He earned a bachelor of arts degree from Bowdoin with \n     majors in economics and government in 1985. He also earned a \n     master's in business administration from New York \n     University's Stern School of Business in 1993.\n       Doyle was senior vice president of the Keefe Bryuette & \n     Woods brokerage in the trade center's south tower. He \n     directed its equity and trading department and was on the \n     company's board of directors.\n       Just before his death, Doyle was training for triathlons.\n       ``He was probably in the best shape of his life'' and \n     planned to run a triathlon the weekend after the terrorist \n     attacks, said his\n\n[[Page S8485]]\n\n     wife, Kim Chedel. But, she said, Doyle mostly ``loved being a \n     dad'' to their children, Zoe and Garrett, who were 3 and 16 \n     months when their father died.\n       Doyle and Chedel had both escaped harm when the trade \n     center was bombed by terrorists in 1993. Chedel, who then \n     worked at a brokerage in a different part of the complex than \n     her husband, escaped within 2 hours. She said she cried for \n     hours while waiting for Doyle to emerge.\n       On Sept. 11, Doyle called Chedel after the first plane hit. \n     He was on the 87th floor of the south tower--the second hit \n     but the first to fall.\n       ``He said, `If you think we got rocked in `93, this was 10 \n     times worse,' '' Chedel said.\n       ``I said, `Frank, get out of there.' He said to me, `The PA \n     system said it was .  .  . more secure to stay in the \n     building.' ''\n       Doyle called his wife again at 9:22 a.m. ``He said, \n     `Sweetie, we've gone up to the roof. The doors are locked, \n     and we can't go down. I know you know this, but I love you .  \n     .  . and you need to tell Zoe and Garrett every day for the \n     rest of their lives how much Daddy loves them.''\n       His survivors also include his mother, Maureen Doyle of New \n     Boston, and three siblings.\n\n\n                Teacher kept her friends for a lifetime\n\n       Barbara Edwards, 58, who grew up in Wyoming, near Grand \n     Rapids, was a woman of character and warmth. She kept friends \n     for a lifetime and, as a high school teacher, showed up at \n     her students' soccer games on her own time.\n       ``Barb was a people person,'' said her sister Jane Gollan \n     of Seattle. ``If you met her 30 years ago, she would still be \n     friends with you. She had a knack for keeping in touch.''\n       Edwards also was a fan of Bette Midler and of personal \n     mementos like the 40-year-old accordion she had as a child. \n     She never threw anything out, and her garage never had room \n     for a car, family members said.\n       Edwards, who lived in Las Vegas, graduated from \n     Kelloggsville High School in Grand Rapids in 1961 and from \n     Western Michigan University in 1965. She worked for a time at \n     Catholic Central High School in Grand Rapids. She also \n     married, had three children and lived in various states \n     before divorcing in the early 1990s.\n       She was a high school French and German teacher in Las \n     Vegas when she went to a friend's wedding in Connecticut the \n     weekend before the Sept. 11 attacks. She was supposed to \n     return home, but friends convinced her to stay for a couple \n     of days. She wound up on American Airlines Flight 77, which \n     left Dulles International Airport in suburban Washington, and \n     crashed into the Pentagon.\n       Just before the attacks, one of Edwards' sons had left a \n     job as a broker in the World Trade Center. In addition to her \n     children, Edwards' survivors include her parents, Jack and \n     Liss Vander Baan who live south of Grand Rapids in Allegan \n     County; a sister, and two grandchildren.\n\n\n                avid reader relished his michigan roots\n\n       Brad Hoorn, 22, originally from Richland, near Kalamazoo, \n     never lost his affection for his favorite childhood book, \n     ``Charlotte's Web.'' He learned to read using that book and \n     he reread it periodically, said his mother, Kathy Hoorn of \n     Richland. A voracious reader, Hoorn often read an entire book \n     to relax before an important college exam, she said.\n       Bright, energetic and outgoing, Hoorn played several \n     musical instruments; had been president of the National Honor \n     Society at Gull Lake High School in Richland, from which he \n     graduated in 1997, and cocaptain of the tennis team.\n       He was a computer whiz, his mother said, and loved coming \n     back to Michigan from his New York City apartment to golf \n     with his father, Dennis; play with the family's two Labrador \n     retrievers; visit friends and enjoy boating on lakes near the \n     family home.\n       In May 2001, Hoorn received a bachelor's degree in \n     economics from Yale University. On Sept. 11, he was working \n     at Fred Alger Management Inc. on the 93rd floor of the north \n     tower.\n       In addition to his parents, he is survived by a sister.\n\n\n                consultant made her own way in the world\n\n       Suzanne Kondratenko, 27, formerly of Romeo, had such zeal \n     and spark, her sister called her a spitfire, Patricia \n     Kondratenko said Suzanne was creative, independent and had a \n     daring sense of humor.\n       ``Things she would say, other people wouldn't get away \n     with,'' Patricia Kondratenko of Rochester said. She \n     especially remembers Suzanne's beautiful skin and how she \n     always smelled like flowers.\n       Kondratenko and her sisters--all seven of them--attended \n     the Academy of the Sacred Heart in Bloomfield Hills. Suzanne \n     graduated in 1992. In 1996, she earned a bachelor's degree in \n     English literature and humanistic studies from St. Mary's \n     College in Notre Dame, Ind.\n       An employee of Keane Consulting in Chicago, Kondratenko was \n     in New York on Sept. 11 to do consulting work for Aon Corp. \n     on the 92nd floor of the trade center's south tower.\n       ``Suzanne committed herself, entirely, to her every \n     endeavor,'' said her sister Aimee Kondratenko of Chicago. \n     ``She was capable of so much.''\n       She is survived by her sisters and her parents, Eric and \n     Patricia Kondratenko, of Romeo.\n\n\n              actress captivated by the allure of theater\n\n       Margaret Mattic, 51, knew by her senior year at Cass Tech \n     High in Detroit that she wanted to be an actress and live in \n     New York. She accomplished that goal, and more. Before she \n     died, she was writing plays and planning to produce them, her \n     sister, Jean Neal of Detroit, said.\n       ``My earliest memories of Margaret are of her performing in \n     school plays,'' said Peggy Robinson, who grew up with Mattic \n     on Detroit's east side. ``She was always the lead. I was a \n     narrator. When we did `Snow White,' she was Snow White. And \n     she was Gretel when we did `Hansel and Gretel.' ''\n       Mattic also was adventurous, Neal said. ``She did more \n     traveling and living away from home. The rest of us remained \n     in Detroit. Margaret lived in New Orleans and New York.''\n       While Mattic was a student at Wayne State University, where \n     she received a bachelor's degree in liberal arts in 1973, \n     ``she traveled to Europe for 8 weeks, all by herself,'' Neal \n     said. ``She had more nerve than all of us.''\n       Mattic, the youngest of five children, always loved to read \n     and write, said her mother, Katie Mattic of Detroit. As an \n     adult, she bought dozens of books for herself and for her \n     mother.\n       After graduating from Cass Tech in the late '60s, she \n     appeared in several plays in Detroit and New York, \n     particularly ones with African-American themes. Mattic worked \n     as a customer service representative for General Telecom in \n     the trade center's north tower.\n       She was single and had no children.\n\n\n                  he was on way to a hawaii honeymoon\n\n       Robert R. Ploger III, 59, of Annandale, Va., approached his \n     life's work with a sense of adventure, said his father, Maj. \n     Gen. Robert Ploger of Ann Arbor. He studied philosophy in \n     college but wound up working with computers.\n       He worked for major corporations, established his own \n     successful company and finally became a computer architect \n     for Lockheed-Martin in Washington.\n       Ploger's parents--his father is retired and his mother, \n     Marguerite, is deceased--were originally from Owosso. Their \n     son graduated in 1959 from Paris American High School in \n     France and attended Michigan State University in 1959-60. He \n     served in the U.S. Army from 1960-62. Ploger then earned a \n     bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University of Denver \n     in 1965, married and raised two children. He and his first \n     wife, Sheila, later divorced.\n       Ploger had lived in California, Virginia and Maryland, \n     working as a computer specialist.\n       He married his second wife, Zandra, in May 2001. On Sept. \n     11, they were on their way to Hawaii for a honeymoon. Both \n     were aboard American Flight 77 when it crashed into the \n     Pentagon. A memorial service was held at the same hotel in \n     Annandale where the couple celebrated their wedding.\n\n\n                  gentle giant won people over easily\n\n       David Pruim, 52, was ``the kindest, nicest, most gentle, 6-\n     foot-4 person there ever was,'' his wife of 28 years, Kate, \n     told the New York Times shortly after his death. ``He made \n     everyone he came into contact with feel good about himself, \n     from children to adults.''\n       Pruim was senior vice president of risk services for Aon \n     Corp., on the 103rd floor of the trade center's south tower.\n       The Pruims, both originally from Michigan, lived in Upper \n     Montclair, N.J., with their 10-year old daughter, Carrington. \n     David was a 1966 graduate of Western Michigan Christian \n     High School in Muskegon. He received a bachelor's degree \n     in political science from Hope College in Holland in 1970.\n       Last October, the college dedicated its homecoming football \n     game to Pruim.\n       He is survived by three brothers and his stepmother, Louise \n     Pruim, who lives in Norton Shores. His late father, James \n     Pruim, was mayor of Muskegon from 1994 to 1996.\n\n\n                  Brilliant man had an empathetic ear\n\n       Josh Rosenthal, 44, was a brilliant guy with a big heart. \n     He doted on his nieces and, despite a terrible allergy to \n     cats, kept his Manhattan apartment window open to provide a \n     scratching post for his neighbor's cats, his sister Helen \n     Rosenthal recalled.\n       ``He had this ability to reach in and really touch people \n     and make them feel like he was truly listening and \n     understanding what they were saying,'' she said.\n       Rosenthal was raised in Livonia and graduated from \n     Stevenson High School in 1975. His mother, Marilynn Rosenthal \n     of Ann Arbor, is a professor of behavioral sciences at the \n     University of Michigan-Dearbon. His father, Avram (Skip) \n     Rosenthal of Southfield, owns Books Abound in Farmington and \n     is a former director of the Henry Ford Community College \n     Library in Dearborn.\n       In 1979, Rosenthal earned a bachelor of arts degree in \n     political science from the U-M in Ann Arbor. In 1977, he was \n     named a Truman Scholar, a merit-based scholarship award given \n     to outstanding college juniors.\n       In 1981, Rosenthal received a master's degree in public \n     affairs from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and \n     International Affairs at Princeton University. He moved to \n     New York afterward, and on Sept. 11, was at work as senior \n     vice president of Fiduciary Trust Co. on the 90th floor of \n     the trade center's south tower.\n       Rosenthal lived in Manhattan, but stayed involved with \n     family and friends in Michigan. He was godfather to several \n     children of friends his sister said.\n       ``Josh had a large and wonderful family that he was very \n     close to,'' his mother said.\n\n[[Page S8486]]\n\n              Onetime star pitcher had new life with wife\n\n       Brock Safronoff, 26, originally from Traverse City, worked \n     as a computer systems analyst for Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc. \n     on the 96th floor of the trade center's north tower. He was a \n     1993 graduate of Traverse City Central High School, where he \n     had been a star pitcher for the baseball team.\n       In 1997, he earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from \n     Amherst College in Massachusetts, where he also was a \n     starting pitcher on the baseball team. Later, he finished \n     course work toward a master's degree from Columbia University \n     in New York.\n       Safronoff and his wife, Tara, were married in August 2001 \n     on Staten Island. They had just moved to a Manhattan \n     apartment before the Sept. 11 attacks. In addition to his \n     wife, his survivors include his parents Joel and Debra \n     Safronoff of Traverse City; a brother, and a sister.\n\n\n                 Military man had 2nd child on the way\n\n       Lt. Col. Kip Taylor, 38, originally from Marquette, came \n     from a military family. He loved his job as an assistant to \n     three-star Gen. Tim Maude at the Pentagon.\n       But at home, Taylor loved the gentler art of cooking. He \n     especially loved trying out new recipes on unsuspecting \n     visiting friends, his wife, Nancy, said.\n       Taylor also loved working with wood. He build a deck and \n     worked on other projects at his McLean, VA., home. He had a \n     22-month-old son Dean. On Oct. 25, his wife gave birth to his \n     second son, John Luke who will be called Luke.\n       ``He considered his most important role as that of \n     father,'' his wife said. ``We were both so excited about the \n     baby.''\n       In 1985, Taylor graduated from Northern Michigan University \n     with a bachelor's degree in management. He had two \n     scholarships, one for basketball and one for the ROTC \n     program.\n       He died when American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the \n     Pentagon. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel from major \n     posthumously, his wife said.\n       His survivors also include his mother, Kay Taylor, who is \n     executive director of a child care referral agency in \n     Marquette; a brother, also in the Army, and a sister. \n     Taylor's late father, Don, was a retired Army lieutenant \n     colonel who gave his son his commission in 1985 and later \n     taught military science at Northern Michigan University.\n\n\n                   horse enthusiast coordinated show\n\n       Lisa Marie Terry, 42, of Oakland Township found time every \n     summer, no matter how busy she was, to hold her Summer \n     Sizzler Horse Show in Mt. Pleasant.\n       It was not an easy task for Terry to put on a quarter horse \n     event while working full time with Marsh Inc., a national \n     construction company with offices in Detroit and in the trade \n     center's north tower. But horses were her passion.\n       ``She did it all by herself,'' said Sarah Tupper of \n     Metamora, Terry's best friend and fellow horse enthusiast. \n     ``She worked on it all year, getting sponsorships, making it \n     nice for exhibitors. She made a huge effort to put stuff in \n     the show people wanted.''\n       Terry especially encouraged young exhibitors, Tupper said.\n       On Sept. 11, Terry, a vice president in charge of \n     construction for the New York-based Marsh, was going to \n     Hawaii for a project. She stopped at the World Trade Center \n     for a business meeting and was among some 300 Marsh employees \n     lost in the attacks, company officials said.\n       A couple of years before her death. Terry, who was single, \n     celebrated her rise to vice president--a rare position for \n     women in her field--by buying a red BMW convertible, said her \n     aunt, Olga Stevens of Troy. Soon after, she bought her \n     Oakland Township home.\n       Terry had one brother and grew up in Troy, graduating from \n     Troy High School in 1977. She studied a social services \n     program at Ferris State University from 1977 to 1980 and was \n     a member of the Theta Tau Alpha sorority. She studied \n     insurance at Michigan State University in the mid-1980s.\n       She loved skiing, flowers and her two cats. An accomplished \n     horsewoman, she showed for the American and Michigan Quarter \n     Horse associations. The latter named her Sportswoman of the \n     Year in 1993.\n       Terry also was a member of the American Business Women's \n     Association and the National Association of Women in \n     Construction.\n\n\n               flight attendant had the heart of a child\n\n       Alicia Nicole Titus, 28, whose parents live in Dexter, was \n     a positive, peace-loving, let's-make-the-world-a-better-place \n     kind of person.\n       ``She was very much into acceptance of world cultures and . \n     . . very embracing of people with different belief systems,'' \n     said her father, John Titus. ``So it is ironic, sadly so,'' \n     he said, that she was a flight attendant on United Airlines \n     Flight 175, which crashed into the trade center's south tower \n     Sept. 11.\n       Titus had just become a flight attendant. Disillusioned \n     with corporate life as a marketing director for a firm in San \n     Francisco, where she lived, she switched careers, said her \n     father, who is director of student advisement services at \n     Schoolcraft College in Livonia. Alicia's mother, Beverly, \n     teaches part-time at the college's Women's Resource Center \n     and Continuing Education Department.\n       Titus grew up in St. Paris, Ohio. She graduated from Graham \n     High School there in 1991 and earned a bachelor's degree in \n     international business from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, \n     in 1995.\n       ``She had lead roles in musicals in high school and was \n     into track, cheerleading and National Honor Society,'' her \n     father said.\n       She also loved outdoor sports such as snowborading, \n     mountain climbing and sky diving. She had traveled to Spain, \n     Morocco, England and France.\n       Titus' roommate in San Francisco told her parents that the \n     Sunday before the attacks, the two went to a local park, \n     where they twirled hula hoops and played on the swings and \n     slides--typical of Titus' childlike zest for life, her father \n     said.\n       Titus, who was single, also is survived by two brothers; a \n     sister, and a nephew.\n\n\n                 recent graduate had energy, potential\n\n       Meredith Lynn Whalen, 23, who was originally from Canton \n     Township, loved animals, particularly horses. She always \n     wanted to own a horse, said her mother, Pat Whalen of Canton.\n       But Whalen valued friends most of all. Her mother was \n     comforted by her daughter's friends after the Sept. 11 \n     attacks.\n       ``Her friends have all described her as a very energetic, \n     caring person with a lot of compassion for others,'' Pat \n     Whalen said.\n       Whalen was just as energetic in high school. She was a \n     varsity swimmer and in the National Honor Society at Plymouth \n     Salem High School, from which she graduated in 1996. She \n     earned a bachelor's degree in business administration with \n     honors from the U-M in Ann Arbor in 2000.\n       ``Meredith was an outstanding graduate of our 2000 BBA \n     program,'' said White, the U-M business professor and former \n     interim president.\n       White said David Alger, another U-M graduate and World \n     Trade Center victim, spotted Whalen as a young person with \n     great potential and convinced her to work for his company.\n       She became a research assistant for Fred Alger Management \n     on the 93rd floor of the trade center's north tower and lived \n     in Hoboken, N.J.\n       She is survived by her mother; three sisters, and a \n     brother. Her late father, Henry (Hank) Whalen, had been a \n     Canton Township trustee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. A few short hours ago, at the Pentagon, we bore witness to \nthe essence of this solemn anniversary. It was a message of restoration \nand renewal from a grateful nation.\n  Today is the commemoration of both incalculable loss and limitless \ncourage, of enduring sorrow and indomitable spirit.\n  We seek to honor the bravery and heroism displayed by so many for so \nlong on this day and the days following. We are moved to grieve for \nwhat and whom we lost--such as Maine victims Anna Allison, Carol \nFlyzik, Robert Jalbert, James Roux, Stephen Ward, Robert Norton, \nJacqueline Norton, and Robert Schlegel.\n  Today, we embrace all that we have retained as a nation--our \nstrength, our sense of purpose, our unity, and our veneration of the \nprinciples of freedom and justice--for today, the hearts of Americans \nand freedom-loving people across the globe are beckoned at once by \nsorrow and resolve, and we should heed the call of both.\n  The snapshots of insanity etched in our minds, the indelible stain of \nunfathomable inhumanity, these must remain if we are to triumph over \nthe tyranny of terror, and triumph we must.\n  In a horrific irony, the forces of darkness had their way on an \nespecially bright and beautiful morning, much like today, and the evil \nthat fueled their horrible deeds lives on in the shadows of the world. \nThe struggle before us will be constant, and therefore our vigilance \nmust be unflagging.\n  So on this first anniversary of a new era, let us continue to brace \nourselves to perpetuating what is good and just, as we and our allies \ndid in the 20th century's great struggles against evil. And let us \nremember how that one day in September not only changed America and the \nworld but also reminded us of what really matters, of the principles \nand the people we value and certainly should appreciate--our \nfirefighters, police officers, rescue workers, our troops, and \nseemingly ordinary Americans who, when faced with the horrible \ncertainty of their circumstances, knowingly bring down a plane to save \nthe lives of others, not to mention the very symbols of our democracy, \nthe Capitol and the White House.\n\n  On this solemn occasion, we celebrate those heroes who walk among us \ntoday, while the legacy of those who made the ultimate sacrifice \nreverberates throughout New York, Washington, Virginia, Pennsylvania, \nand\n\n[[Page S8487]]\n\nevery town and city in this land. Indeed, if it is true that a nation \nis defined by its response to adversity, then America redefined its own \ngreatness.\n  Men and women searching and clearing the World Trade Center site \nworked day and night, while volunteers brought them food and water. \nTheir labor will stand as a memorial beside the hallowed site's eternal \nflame near the hole in the Earth that mirrors the hole in our heart \nthat will never fully mend. And just across the Potomac, engineers and \nconstruction workers poured forth every last ounce to rebuild the \nPentagon within 1 year in a gesture comprised of equal parts defiance \nand pride. At the building's D-ring, a father literally helped repair \nthe broken stone and mortar near the very spot where his son perished \nthat fateful morning.\n  What is lost can never be recovered, but with this first anniversary \nof September 11, it is as though life has reclaimed its rightful place \nwhere destruction dared intrude. At the Pentagon there is a single \nblackened stone set within the new wall to symbolize what cannot and \nmust not ever be forgotten. We have witnessed an almost \nincomprehensible transformation from the blackened devastation we saw a \nyear ago, just as America itself has been transformed.\n  An unparalleled sense of unity and compassion swept across America, \nproving once again that the true strength of our Nation has always \nflowed from the fortitude of our people.\n  As we lifted up the hearts of those grieving for loved ones, we moved \ntoward a swift and just defense of our freedom, and the President \nworked vigorously and mightily to build an international coalition. And \nwhile the war on terror will unquestionably be long and dangerous, our \nheroic men and women in uniform struck quickly and decisively at the \nheart of the Taliban.\n  In February, I had the privilege of visiting our troops and meeting \nwith President Karzai as part of a congressional trip to Afghanistan. \nWhat left the most profound impression on me, one I will never forget, \nwas the unflinching commitment, the indefatigable resolve, and highest \nlevel of professionalism, not to mention bravery, of our troops.\n  Indeed, much was revealed to us on the morning of September 11, 2001: \nThe extent of the threat against us, the image of the devil incarnate, \nbut also the face of a resilient and passionate and a united nation \nthat would not allow this travesty to stand.\n  We have learned that we can continue the process of healing, even \nknowing we will never fully be healed. We have learned we can move \nforward, without moving away from the anger we justifiably feel. \nIndeed, if we are to properly memorialize those whom we lost on that \nday and the days since, then we must maintain a boundless resolve in \nperpetuity that is so essential to keeping America secure and eradicate \nthe roots of terrorism and the bloody instruments of fear.\n  At Gettysburg, President Lincoln said:\n\n       It is for us the living . . . to be dedicated here to the \n     unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so \n     nobly advanced. It is . . . for us to be here dedicated to \n     the great task remaining before us.\n\n  That is our call yet again today. That is the destiny to which we \nmust rise. Now, like then, we are equal to the challenge. God bless \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I was not sure if I was going to come \nand say a few words today. I am almost fatigued by the coverage of 9/\n11, and yet there is something so important about this moment that \nsilence somehow is not an appropriate response.\n  The horror of the moment of September 11 last year remains with us \neven as we ache in our heart for those who lost their lives on that \nday. I think all of us understand the target was not buildings. It was \nnot buildings in New York or Washington, DC. The target was the spirit \nof our country. The target was democracy. The target was Americans and \nwhat Americans represent.\n  With the 1-year anniversary of that event, it is important for our \ncountry again to take stock of where we are, who we are, and what our \ncitizenship responsibilities are as Americans.\n  One year ago, I left the Capitol Building late at night to drive home \nand drove past the Pentagon. It was still burning, with smoke billowing \nout of the Pentagon that was then bathed in floodlights. It was an \neerie sight to see the fire at the Pentagon even late at night and to \nhear and see the F-15 and F-16 fighter planes flying combat missions \nover our city and the Capitol that day and that evening.\n  We went back to the Pentagon a few days later, and we were, as \nMembers of Congress, meeting with Pentagon officials and viewing the \ndamage. As we were there, one young marine was hanging by a crane in a \nbucket up near what had been the fourth floor of the Pentagon in what \nnow was an open wound and gash in that concrete building. He had been \nhoisted up in the bucket by a crane that was moving toward this open \ngash. As we watched him, he reached around into this open area where \nthis airplane hit and he pulled out a flag he had spotted up in an open \narea that had miraculously burned, and he brought this red and gold \nflag, which was the Marine flag, a brilliant red and gold color. He had \nthe crane lower him to the ground. He marched over to where we were, \nwalked past us and said: I am going to give this flag to the Marine \nCommandant. He said: Terrorists could not destroy this flag, and they \ncannot destroy this country.\n  I think the spirit of that young marine and the spirit of people at \nGround Zero, where we visited a week following the attacks, is \nsomething I will always remember.\n  The visit to Ground Zero that many in Congress conducted was a very \nsad visit, showing the carnage and destruction of the World Trade \nCenter where so many thousands died. The event I recall from that day, \namong many, was a firefighter who came to me with a several-day growth \nof beard, blood-shot eyes. He had worked around the clock for many \ndays. He told me of the friends he had lost, those who were his fellow \nfirefighters who had died in the tragedy. Here was a man who obviously \nhad very little rest, had worked day and night. Through his blood-shot \neyes and with a uniform that was quite dirty, having worked around the \nclock, he looked at me and said: Senator, you must promise me to do one \nthing.\n  I asked: What is that?\n  He said: Get them. Get them. If you do not get them, they will do \nthis to this country again.\n  He represented the feeling of all Americans. We must make certain \nthat terrorists are not able to do this again in our country. Our \ncountry is, in my judgment, as united as ever, united to battle \nterrorism wherever it exists in the world. We have come to understand \nas a country that a battle against terrorism is not quick. It is not \neasy. But it is something to which all America is committed. Every \nfanatic anywhere in the world who thinks terrorism is an acceptable \nmeans to an end needs to hear and know that America is united.\n  My State is half a continent away from Washington, DC, and New York \nCity where the attacks took place. Let me speak for a moment about my \nrural State, so distant from the urban areas where the attacks took \nplace.\n  First, tragically, we, too, experienced the loss of life. A young \nNorth Dakotan, Ann Nelson of Stanley, ND, died when the World Trade \nCenter collapsed. I knew Ann and her family. She was a very special \nyoung woman. Her father has been a good friend of mine for many years. \nShe had a bright future ahead of her, and she was a joy to all who knew \nher. Ann Nelson was a young North Dakota woman seeking a career, \npursuing a job in the World Trade Center in New York City. She died \nbecause she was an American. She was one of thousands of innocent \nAmericans who lost their lives because of these heinous, unspeakable \nacts of horror committed by terrorists.\n  The day of the attack in Washington, DC, I looked up in the sky to \nsee fighter jets flying overhead. I found out later that day they were \npilots from Fargo, ND, members of the Air National Guard called the \nHappy Hooligans, some of the best fighter pilots in the world. Over the \nyears, they have won three William Tell Awards which is the award for \nthe best fighter pilots. They are stationed on a rotating basis at \nLangley Air Force Base.\n  Part of their mission is to protect the Nation's Capital. They were \nthe\n\n[[Page S8488]]\n\nfirst scrambled and the first in the air and the first over the \nNation's Capital on that very day, 9/11. We are so proud of them. They \nare the ones we saw in the air almost immediately after these attacks.\n  Their mission, I told them, reminds me of something I read some long \nwhile ago. I don't know where it comes from, a verse that said: When \nthe night is full of knives, and the lightning is seen, and the drums \nare heard, the patriots are always there, ready to fight and ready to \ndie, if necessary, for freedom.\n  A lot of patriots last September 11 said: I'm here and I'm ready to \nfight for freedom.\n  In the weeks and months that followed the attacks of September 11, \nour country has come together like never before. We understand that we \nface a very special and unusual challenge. We are a big, wide open, \nfree democracy. It is very hard to provide absolute security in every \nway, every day all around our country. We do not want any of us to \ndiminish the basic freedoms that represent America, the basic freedoms \nin our Constitution. We do not want to diminish those freedoms in order \nto fight terrorism. We want to fight terrorism and eradicate terrorism \nwherever it exists. We want to preserve that which makes America \nunique, the most wonderful country on the face of the Earth.\n\n  A year ago when I spoke in this Chamber about the events of September \n11, I recalled the words that Shakespeare wrote: Grief hath changed me \nsince you saw me last.\n  It continues to change us as we go forward carrying the heavy burden \nthat grief imposes. But part of that change is much more than grief. \nPart of it is a steely resolve to respond forcefully and strongly and \nwith precision to those who carried out the attacks 1 year ago. Our \nresolve in this year, in my judgment, has grown even stronger.\n  This will be a day that Americans will think about for many decades \nto come, the September 11 anniversary of 2001. My hope is we rededicate \nourselves today to the mission ahead and the challenge ahead to \npreserve our democracy. My hope is that today we also pay honor to the \nmemory of those innocent Americans who lost their lives, and then say \nthank you to all of the heroes who, on September 11, extended forward \nand said: Let it be me to reach out and help. And especially we say \nthank you to the men and women of the Armed Forces who serve in harm's \nway all across the world.\n  Finally, months after September 11, I was in Afghanistan, Baghram, \nKabul, and that region of the world. As you fly into Afghanistan and \nlook down through an airplane window to the hills and the mountains and \nunderstand that somewhere in caves deep in the mountains there were \npeople plotting the murder of innocent Americans, you understand we \ncannot ever be oblivious to what is happening in the rest of the world. \nIt can have a profound impact on the lives of those who cherish \nfreedom.\n  I say to the young men and women I met in Kabul and Baghram and \nelsewhere, thanks for your service to America. Thanks for helping us \nwage the fight against terrorism, a fight this country is determined \nand destined to win.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, one year ago, America awoke to a tragic \nand devastating incarnation of hatred and evil. Incomprehensible to \nmost citizens only a day before, the terrorist attacks of September 11 \ndramatically changed our people, our country, and the entire world.\n  Insulated for over 50 years from foreign attacks on our soil, \nAmericans in an instant grasped the magnitude of the threat we face \nfrom terrorism. In the days after the attacks, the dangerous world in \nwhich we live never seemed more precarious.\n  The immediate aftermath brought a tremendous outpouring of grief and \nsorrow.\n  Our Nation mourned as the realities of the events of September 11 \npenetrated our collective psyche. Candles were lit in remembrance and \nflags were flown in patriotic displays of unity. Stories of bravery and \ncourage emerged in the wake of the attacks which helped to inspire and \nremind us of all that is great about the American spirit.\n  This foundation of strength which was built in the days after the \nattacks prepared us for the challenges ahead, and helped harden our \nnational resolve to deliver our enemies to justice.\n  We live in a far different world than the one we occupied just 12 \nmonths ago.\n  With a clear sense of purpose our country has engaged the war on \nterrorism on every conceivable front. The vision outlined by President \nBush in his September 20 address to the nation has been undertaken with \nextraordinary success. We have been vigilant in our fight to hunt down \nthose responsible for the attacks, as well as those who might do us \nharm in the future. We have fortified our defenses and reorganized our \ngovernment. Americans everywhere are more aware of their surroundings \nand remain defiant of those wishing to do us harm. We as a nation have \ngrown stronger and more united than ever.\n  We have been blessed with enormous freedoms and prosperity in this \ncountry. Over the course of our history, many Americans have made the \nultimate sacrifice by giving their lives to protect our freedoms. \nAlthough we have enjoyed many years of peace, the events of September \n11 showed us that this fight is far from over.\n  We must continue to build on the successes of the past year, and \nnever become complacent with our victories. The burden cast upon our \ngreat Nation was one we neither asked for nor deserved, but we carry it \non our shoulders consoled by the memories of those who went before us \nwho sacrificed in the name of freedom.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. In the absence of anybody else on the floor seeking \nrecognition, I ask consent that I be permitted to speak for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, Senator Santorum, Senator Ensign, and I \nhave just returned from memorial services in Shanksville, PA, \ncommemorating the downing of Flight 93. It was truly an inspirational \nand emotional occurrence. The families of the victims of flight 93, the \ncrew and passengers, were seated front and center, and then a large \ncrowd was assembled, estimated in advance to be in the range of 20,000 \nto 30,000 people.\n  Gov. Mark Schweiker, Governor of Pennsylvania, spoke, as did former \nGov. Tom Ridge, now the Homeland Security Director. There was not a dry \neye in the entire assemblage. The message delivered by Governor \nSchweiker and Governor Ridge was a moment of remembrance, a moment of \ncommemoration, and a moment of hope for the future, with a \ndetermination that a united America will repel terrorists wherever \nterrorists exist and that the struggle for freedom will be maintained \nand will be won.\n  Governor Schweiker went to the Shanksville Elementary School in \nadvance of the ceremony and brought to the assemblage, especially the \nfamilies of victims of flight 93, this message from the Shanksville \nElementary School:\n\n       If God brought you to it, God will bring you through it.\n\n  That brought quite a response.\n  Churchill was quoted, I think, so appropriately:\n\n       Never was so much owed by so many to so few.\n\n  I think that is especially applicable to the Members of the Senate \nand the Members of the House of Representatives because flight 93 was \nheaded to the U.S. Capitol. That had long been the speculation, and it \nwas confirmed 2 days ago in an article in the New York Times, quoting \nmembers of al-Qaida.\n  Ms. Sandy Dahl, wife of pilot Jason Dahl, made an emotional speech \nand later came down and sat right next to where I was sitting and was \nholding her infant daughter, Michaela, who will be 2 at the end of \nSeptember. It was quite a poignant picture of the widow, grieving for \nwhat happened a year ago today, but holding her child and looking \nforward to the future. The child was smiling, and so was Mrs. Dahl, \nlooking at her infant daughter.\n\n  It is my hope that the Congress will yet act on legislation which has \nbeen introduced to grant Congressional Gold\n\n[[Page S8489]]\n\nMedals to the 40 who were crew and passengers of flight 93. As I moved \nthrough the assembled ladies and gentlemen who were families of the \nvictims and spoke to them and heard of their grief, the common thread \nwas: Please move ahead. Thank you for the legislation--thanking the \nCongress for the legislation authorizing the creation of a memorial at \nShanksville, a national memorial site, but also asking that our \nlegislation for the Congressional Gold Medals be completed.\n  The family of Georgine Rose Corrigan presented me with this photo and \nthe ribbons, red, white, and blue. These photos were worn by so many--\nvirtually all of the families of the victims who were in attendance.\n  Yesterday, I spoke on the floor of the Senate and said that sometime \nbefore dusk today I would ask unanimous consent for the consideration \nof the bill S. 1434, which has 69 cosponsors, which would grant the \nCongressional Gold Medal posthumously to the victims of flight 93. This \nbill should have been moved a long time ago. I have taken it up with \nthe appropriate Senators to get it moved, and it has not moved because \nof the interest of some in expanding it to cover other victims--the \nfirefighters, the police, and others.\n  I certainly think it would be appropriate to grant recognition to all \nof those people. However, I think the victims of flight 93 are in a \nspecial category because they saved the Capitol.\n  In order to avoid the complications of having a bill discharged from \ncommittee, I have consulted with the Parliamentarian as to the \nprocedures for having a bill held at the desk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/11/senate-section/article/S8489-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1434\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the vicious \nterrorist attacks that occurred on our Nation a year ago today, \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  Over the past few days, in large cities and small towns, in New York \nand the Pentagon today, in my home State of South Dakota, people have \ngathered to remember and to reflect upon what happened this last year.\n  In many ways it still does not seem possible that a year has passed \nsince the attacks of September 11, 2001. It seems too soon to look back \nand reflect on the meaning of September 11 because the events of that \nday still echo in our daily lives. The wound is still too fresh, the \nloss too great. Every American will remember exactly where they were \nwhen they realized that our Nation was under attack. The images of that \nday will be with us forever: The burning buildings, the endless \ntelevision footage of airplanes crashing into the Twin Towers, the \nimages of New York covered in rubble.\n  I will always remember the smoke of the Pentagon as it appeared \nthrough a\n\n[[Page S8490]]\n\ntoo-perfect blue sky here in Washington DC. But other thoughts--\ncandlelight vigils, American flags adorning buildings, fences, and \nbarns, the heroism of the passengers of American flight 93, and the \nlasting bravery of firefighters and other first responders--will also \nremain in our hearts as constant reminders of that day in September.\n  Across the Nation and around the world, people came together to do \nwhat they could for the victims and their families. I was proud, but \nnot at all surprised, when South Dakotans overwhelmingly responded with \noffers of blood and other assistance. Millions of dollars were donated \nby South Dakotans to relief organizations, and thousands of hours of \ntime were volunteered in efforts to aid survivors and the family \nmembers of victims. Employees at Luverne Fire Apparatus in Brandon put \nin 2,000 hours of their own time to build a fire truck that was donated \nto New York City. Red Cross volunteers from Rapid City assisted in \nrecovery efforts at the Pentagon. Farmers and ranchers throughout the \nstate sold cattle and grain at auctions and livestock drives and \ndonated that money to relief efforts. In one extraordinary example, Don \nand Adeline Hight of Murdo sold 100 calves and donated the proceeds, \nabout $40,000, to help victims of the terrorist attacks. In Brown \nCounty, the Rural American Patriot Fund used the money they collected \nfrom fellow farmers and ranchers to buy thousands of dollars in Patriot \nBonds. The idea of Patriot Bonds began with a call from a South Dakotan \nto my office, and were approved by the Treasury Department last \nDecember. Patriot Bonds, similar to World War II war bonds, allow \nAmericans to support the relief and recovery efforts at the World Trade \nCenter and the Pentagon and to help fund the war on terrorism.\n  South Dakotans also helped to ease the emotional strain that the \nattack had on survivors and the victims' families. Police officers \nspecializing in stress management from Mitchell and Yankton went to New \nYork to help the police officers there deal with the emotional \naftermath of the terrorist attacks. Lance Fillspipe, Junior Rodriguez, \nand eight other police officers from Pine Ridge Indian Reservation \ntraveled to New York to help the police there handle security. Bonnie \nRiggenbach and Bob Holmes of Rapid City, both therapists, traveled to \nNew York to do what they could to help people mend their lives. The \nDisaster Mental Health Institute at the University of South Dakota went \nto New York City in the wake of the September 11 attacks and played a \nkey role in helping the recovery process. Students at Mount Marty \nCollege put together a banner signed by members of the community with \nwords of sympathy and support for the city of New York. That banner is \nbeing considered by the Guinness Book of World Records as being the \nlargest handmade banner ever made. Through gestures large and small, \nSouth Dakotans united with their neighbors and worked to bring \nsomething positive from all of the terrible destruction.\n  A lot has changed in our country, and in our world, since September \n11. Our Nation has learned, to our vast sorrow, that we were not as \nuntouchable as we had believed ourselves to be. Our country is involved \nin a war against terror that has taken our courageous military men and \nwomen, including my son Brooks, to Afghanistan as well as other far-off \ncorners of the world. Our military effort in Afghanistan has helped to \nfree people who were oppressed by a dictatorial regime that, in \naddition to the atrocities that the government inflicted upon its own \npeople, harbored a terrorist group representing the worst humanity can \nbecome.\n  Here on the home front, things have changed as well. Barricades have \nbeen erected around national monuments, the Capitol, and the White \nHouse. Lines are longer and security more thorough at airports. Despite \nthe longer lines and tighter security, our Nation still moves and \nfunctions much as it has for the last 225 years. We remain a beacon of \ndemocracy and justice for much of the world, and I work very hard as a \nSenator to make certain that new regulations, however necessary they \nmay be in our post-September 11 world, do not infringe upon the basic \nrights of our citizens that we seek to secure.\n  So as we take this day to reflect upon the many lives lost last year, \nwe are to reflect on the courage and heroism of those who did so much \nto save lives and defend our liberty today. We take comfort that the \nterrorists' goals were not realized--that there were attacks on \nbuildings, but there were also attacks on everything America stands \nfor--on individual liberty, on religious tolerance, on democracy, on \nfree speech, and all the rights of our Constitution. These forces of \nhate, these forces of intolerance tried to destroy the very things that \nmake this Nation strong. Buildings are being repaired but, more \nimportantly, the light of democracy that holds this Nation together and \nour fundamental values burn just as brightly as it ever has.\n  The United States took a hit, but we have responded aggressively, and \nAmerica will remain a beacon of liberty and freedom for the world \nforever after.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, as I contemplated what I might say here \ntoday, I went back in my computer and pulled up a letter I wrote on \nSeptember 22, 2001, in response to a friend of mine who corresponded \nwith me in that difficult time. He is a history professor. I have known \nhim since high school. And I sat down at my computer and simply let \nthings flow out. I have now decided to share that letter with the \nSenate and with the country as I look back on it after a year's time. I \nthink it reflects better than anything I could create now not only my \nfeelings at the time but my concern for where we should be and what we \nshould be doing.\n  I read the letter dated September 22, 2001:\n\n       I have your letter, dear friend, and am moved to reply in \n     depth using you as my audience as I make an attempt to speak \n     to all the issues I see.\n       I start with the President's address to the Congress last \n     Thursday. It has been called historic, one of the greatest \n     Presidential addresses ever given. It certainly had that \n     character and, listening to it in a packed chamber more \n     hushed than I can ever remember, I was struck by the power, \n     eloquence and directness of his words. From a distance of a \n     day or two, however, as I analyze it and discuss it with my \n     colleagues, I realize that the speech was more than moving \n     rhetoric. For the first time since the end of the Cold War, a \n     U.S. President has laid out a clear statement of what the \n     world is now like and what the U.S. role must be in that \n     world.\n       The fact that this has not been done before is less a knock \n     on previous Presidents than a realization that, until \n     September 11, Americans in general were probably not yet free \n     of all our Cold War illusions. We are the world's only \n     remaining superpower, we told ourselves. We are a just \n     compassionate nation, we said. Ergo, we reasoned, it follows \n     that, under our vigorous stewardship, the world itself will \n     become a just and compassionate place, albeit little by \n     little.\n       With Hitler and Stalin and Mao all dead, we thought, with \n     the Soviet Union gone, evil--true malevolence--has gone from \n     the world stage. It only pops up here and there in the form \n     of an isolated Serb or Somali warload.\n       No more.\n       Now we know that evil is alive and thriving, still \n     threatening the peace everywhere in the world. Irrational \n     hatred has not disappeared. The same mindset of fanaticism \n     that built gas chambers 60 years ago is now hijacking \n     airplanes and flying them into buildings, overseeing the \n     preparation of chemical and biological weapons of mass \n     destruction. As the President made so starkly clear, the \n     world's new enemies hate freedom as much as Hitler did, and \n     are prepared to kill millions as much as Stalin did. Evil has \n     not gone away; it has simply changed its political language \n     and its physical address.\n       Our Cold War mentality told us that the trouble in the \n     Middle East was about Israel, about power politics between \n     established nation states, about borders and economics and \n     markets. I readily agree that Israel has real problems with \n     her neighbors, and they with her, but this is not about those \n     problems. It is not about Israel. It is about defending the \n     helpless against evil.\n       President Bush told us that America is feeding the poor in \n     Afghanistan. I didn't know that before. Since his speech I \n     have been in briefings from those familiar with the region \n     who tell us that the Taliban uses food as a weapon, denying \n     it to those that oppose them. They say they hate us for our \n     support of Israel, but they also hate us because we are \n     trying to feed the starving in their own country, and thus \n     undermine their effort to starve everyone into submission.\n       They hate us because we profane their world with our \n     notions of freedom--we ``pollute the holy places'' with \n     business people and diplomats who let women drive and appear \n     in public with bare faces. They hate us because we take the \n     youth of all countries,\n\n[[Page S8491]]\n\n     including theirs, into our universities and teach them about \n     science and economics and democracy, as well as about blue \n     jeans and movies and freedom to travel and open debate. \n     President Bush said it better than I can, and it was \n     necessary for him to lay all that out if the Country is to \n     ``get'' what we are facing.\n       The President spoke of the diplomatic front in this war, of \n     our need for partners. . . . He reported good progress there, \n     citing Pakistan as an example. In the same briefings that \n     told us about food shipments to Afghanistan I learned that \n     the current leaders of Pakistan really don't have much of a \n     choice in this fight because they are a target themselves. \n     They hardly qualify as democrats by our definition, but the \n     radicals still hate them for even their tenuous ties to us. \n     By some estimates, the radicals are close to bringing the \n     government down and turning Pakistan into another \n     Afghanistan. The same is true, in terms of the radical's end \n     goal, in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.\n       The leaders of those countries know they are at risk, and \n     have been for some time. Sadat was murdered because he was \n     willing to go to Jerusalem and say, ``No more war.'' Those \n     leaders need our help and are willing to help us in return \n     because, long term, they know that the only nation with the \n     capacity to lead a world wide campaign to eliminate this evil \n     is ours. The success we are having in building a coalition of \n     partners in the first days of this conflict is one of the \n     most encouraging signs that things are, for the moment, going \n     somewhat well.\n       You are a historian; you know that the Second World War \n     didn't begin on December 7th. Neither did this one begin on \n     September 11th. As was the case with Europeans in the 30's, \n     Americans have been in Foreign Policy denial in the 90's. \n     Thrilled with the demise of our four-decade Soviet enemy, we \n     read articles about the ``end of history'' and ignored the \n     signs that were there to be seen. Now we have to go back and \n     examine those signs . . .\n       We must realize that we are truly at war, and, as was the \n     case in 1941, really have been for some time. The embassy \n     bombings, the attack on the U.S.S. Cole, the intelligence \n     warnings--all these should have told us that this is a war \n     and not, as some of the commentators have described it, a law \n     enforcement problem. What's the difference? . . .  In a war \n     you focus on prevention of attack, not punishment. You . . . \n     go after the enemy's assets to destroy them before they can \n     be used to destroy you, gather the best intelligence you can \n     and then play hunches and probabilities. You don't give out \n     Miranda warnings.\n       Please accept my assurance that our leaders know how \n     different and difficult this war will be. They know that we \n     have to have partners, and that many of these partners have \n     internal problems that will prevent them from being the kind \n     of ``allies'' on which we could traditionally count. . . . \n     The team that President Bush has assembled is experienced, \n     intellectually nuanced in its understanding, and deep. Down \n     below the level of Cheney, Powell, Rumsfeld and Rice is a \n     significant bench of very solid players who understand what \n     we are up against. . . .\n       So there we are. It has fallen our lot . . . to be the \n     leader of the free world in a struggle that is global and \n     against an enemy that is fanatic, decentralized, persistent, \n     completely fearless and very, very patient . . . . bin Laden \n     and his fellow fanatics have decided that they can defeat \n     [us] . . . by keeping intact their capacity to visit horror \n     on us at unexpected times. We will not have won until that \n     capacity is destroyed. This will be a very long, tricky and \n     difficult fight.\n       But, as the President said, we will win it. And it will be \n     worth it. The stakes are nothing less than they were in 1941 \n     and through the Cold War years, for us and for all the rest \n     of those who want to live in freedom.\n  Madam President, reading that a year later, I still feel the same \nway.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak for up to 10 minutes in this slot previously \nreserved for the Senator from Illinois and that Senator Durbin be \nrecognized to speak in the next Democratic slot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, it is truly an honor to have the opportunity to come \nand speak on the floor of the Senate today. This is one of those days \nwhen the Senate Chamber is really the people's forum, when the partisan \nor ideological or regional or whatever differences that sometimes \nseparate us in votes fall aside and we stand here before the Chair, \nunder the slogan that describes us--``E pluribus unum,'' ``Out of many, \none''--and truly represent the common and shared values, hopes, and \naspirations of our people.\n  I am proud of what my colleagues have said thus far in this \ndiscussion and very grateful to be a part of it.\n  In New York City today, they are reading the names of the victims, \nthe names of 3,000 of God's children, magnificent in their \ncharacteristic American diversity, whose lives were savagely taken on \nSeptember 11 of last year simply because they were American. None of us \nhere can say anything as powerful or profound as the recitation of \nthose names today.\n  The Pentagon, the World Trade Center, and that field outside \nShanksville, PA, will forever be hallowed battlegrounds, places where \nwe will take our children to stand silently and contemplate their \nmeaning, places of worship, really, where we will revere the lives lost \nand honor their place in our history.\n  This morning, as I left the very moving and unifying commemorative \nrededication service at the Pentagon, I came across a family, and I \nsaid hello and shook their hands, and I realized these were survivors \nof a man killed in the Pentagon on September 11 of last year: A young \nboy about 10 or 12 years old, full of innocence and youth, a great \nlooking kid, carrying an American flag in a case--I presume the flag \nthat was either placed over his father's coffin or given to him in \nmemory of his father--a woman, who was the wife of the deceased and his \nparents--strong American stock--a man wearing the cap of a veteran, \ntears under his eyes. And there it was: A son without a father, a woman \nwithout her husband, parents without their child. I was speechless. \nThere was nothing I could say except to shake their hands and put my \nhands over my heart.\n  In some ways, silence is a more appropriate response to the dreadful \nlosses that were suffered on September 11. Silence, somehow, speaks \nmore loudly to the horror and the complicated feelings that we all had \non that day. Nevertheless, we must speak, to reflect on what happened \nthat day, in the year that has passed, and to try to learn from that \nday and chart our way forward.\n  Madam President, our enemies hoped that September 11, 2001, would be \nthe first page of a new chapter in world history: The end of the \nAmerican century; the end of America as we know it; the beginning of a \ncivilizational conflict, based on theological differences, taken to an \ninhumane extreme, which would end in the victory of radical extreme \nIslam.\n  As a distinguished Muslim citizen of Connecticut said yesterday at a \npublic ceremony, al-Qaida hijacked his religion.\n  In this the terrorists betrayed their ignorance, not just about Islam \nbut about America; not just about the American people but American \ndemocracy and its values.\n  I wish to speak for a moment about this conflict that September 11 \nhas put us into and the differences between us and our enemies, which \nis what this is all about. This is not a simple struggle for power. \nThis is a global conflict for values, for ideals. We are idealists. We \nand our many allies around the world, including so many millions in the \nMuslim world, believe in the inalienable and inviolable rights of every \nindividual. Our enemies are craven cynics who desire raw power for \nthemselves and seek to crush those who look or act or think \ndifferently. They claim to be religious, but how can they be religious \nand faithful in any way in which any of the world's religions \nunderstand it, if they are prepared to kill thousands of God's children \nallegedly in the name of God?\n  We are different. We are optimists. We grant people liberty, not as \nthe gift of politicians but as our Declaration of Independence says: As \nthe endowment of our Creator. We have confidence that a society \ngoverned by its people will progress, and that is why we seek to open \nthe world and broaden the community of nations living under democracy, \nas we have so magnificently since the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n  Our enemies are not just pessimists; they are fatalists. They fear \nthe voices of the people. They want to bring down a theological iron \ncurtain to divide the world into acceptable and unacceptable people and \nnations and faiths, to those worthy of living and those targeted for \ndeath and domination.\n  Third, we are skeptics in a very healthy way. We question one another \nand ourselves. We are proud of who we are but not so proud that we \npretend to be without fault. Our enemies proceed with a chilling sense \nof certainty and an unwillingness to look at themselves in the mirror.\n  It is those values that have guided us through our history and \ndistinguish us\n\n[[Page S8492]]\n\nnow from our enemies. The men and women of our military performed \nbrilliantly in unfamiliar territory against an unprecedented foe. Our \npolice officers, firefighters, and other first responders have had \nreason to despair, but they have risen to the immense challenge and \nreminded us of what heroism they display every day. Every day Americans \nin our communities have had reason to lose faith and to turn from hope \nto fear, but they have not faltered. They have come together, finding \nour strength, not losing our optimism and our courage.\n  Here in Congress, though we still have work to do, we have faced the \nnew reality of the post-September 11 world. We have asked tough \nquestions of ourselves. We have supported our President as Commander in \nChief. We have realized that we have not been as prepared as we should \nhave been on September 11 last year, and we are taking steps to close \nour vulnerabilities.\n  As we do, we must remember that September 11 was not just a tragedy \nthat happened. It was not just a natural disaster. It was an unnatural \ndisaster, carried out as an intentional act by people who were evil.\n  That is why, as Charles Krauthammer wrote in the Washington Post a \nwhile ago, we must understand this anniversary as more than a day of \nmourning and solemn remembrance. It must be not just a day of \ncommemoration but a day of rededication. Charles Krauthammer wrote:\n\n       We would pay such homage had the World Trade Center and the \n     Pentagon collapsed in an earthquake. They did not. And \n     because they did not, more is required than mere homage and \n     respect. Not just sorrow, but renewed anger. Not just \n     consolation, but renewed determination. . . .\n\n  We will build beautiful memorials to those killed on September 11, \nbut there are other memorials that we here in Congress can and must \nbuild: a Department of Homeland Security that does everything humanly \npossible to prevent anything such as September 11 from recurring, and \nit need not recur. We must support and encourage our military to search \nout and destroy or capture al-Qaida wherever they exist. We must reach \nout to the Muslim world, the great majority who are not fanatics or \nextremists, who suffer from a lack of freedom and a lack of material \nresources and hope, and offer them the support and the freedom that \nthey desire and that is ultimately the best defense against the evil \nterrorism of the minority in the Islamic world that al-Qaida \nrepresents.\n  As we approach the great debate in this Chamber on the questions \naround Saddam Hussein and Iraq, we must remember the lessons of \nSeptember 11. As we look back, having heard the warnings of Osama bin \nLaden, having experienced the attack against the World Trade Center in \n1993, against the two embassies in Africa, against the U.S.S. Cole, as \nwe look back, don't we wish we had taken the kind of action we are \ntaking today to destroy al-Qaida?\n  In her foreword to ``At Home In The World,'' a collection of Daniel \nPearl's writings in the Wall Street Journal, his widow Mariane Pearl \nwrote:\n\n       The terrorists who killed Danny stood at the other extreme \n     of what Danny represents. They could only wield their knife \n     and cowardice against Danny's intellectual courage and bold \n     spirit. Danny died holding only a pen. They stole his life \n     but were unable to seize his soul. By killing Danny, \n     terrorists took my life as well but could not lay claim to my \n     spirit. We will never let them win.\n\n  So, too, the terrorists may have killed 3,000 innocent Americans on \nSeptember 11 of last year, but they will never lay claim to America's \nliving spirit. We will never let them win.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise to speak about the events of 1 \nyear ago. I am delighted to follow my colleague, Senator Lieberman of \nConnecticut, with whom I have worked and will continue to do so. I add \nmy name to his comments.\n  Today we are gathered to remember those who lost their lives on \nSeptember 11, to honor those who sacrificed everything for the concept \nof and belief in freedom. That day and every day since then are stark \nand simple reminders that freedom is not free and that it is never \nsecure.\n  This is something the people of my home State of Kansas have long \nunderstood. Our very motto is ``ad astra per aspera''--``To the stars \nthrough difficulties.'' We have lived this every day, every year since \nbefore we were a State.\n  It is also a theme our entire Nation embraces today. We were not \nbowed by last September's attack. In fact, we arose from the ashes \nstronger and more resilient than ever.\n  ``The greatest victories come when people dare to be great,'' Ronald \nReagan said, ``when they summon their spirits to brave the unknown and \ngo forward together to reach a greater good.''\n  In the days immediately following that fateful day, we summoned our \nspirits and went forward together. We dared to be great.\n  As you look at the memorials, and as you listen to the speeches of \nremembrance, think of the sacrifice of all those involved, and of the \nlives cut short, the promises broken, the happiness destroyed. It is \nall too easy to cloak these sacrifices in mere platitudes. We must \nremember exactly what it means to sacrifice and what exactly was \nsacrificed.\n  These were not nameless, faceless people who just simply acted out \nsome role. These were sons, daughters, husbands, wives, brothers, \nsisters, mothers, and fathers. They were scared men and women who had \nthrust upon them the part of hero, and they lived up to the billing.\n  It is also too easy to just call them heroes and walk away. It is not \neasy to recognize the fear and the strength and the courage they \nexhibited on that particular day.\n  I have been particularly taken now, reading stories of the heroes of \n9/11 and the miracles that happened on that day--stories that we are \nall familiar with now--Todd Beamer and ``let's roll,'' and the flight \nthat went into the field in Pennsylvania, which was the very flight \nheaded for this building. It probably would have reached its target had \nthey not been heroes on that day. Would this place even be here now? It \nmay have been rebuilt, but would we be back here yet? How many lives \nwould have been lost here?\n  I read last Friday in USA Today about miracles of 9/11. Some police \nofficers, one a rookie, went into the south tower; they were buried in \n20 feet of rubble. Three of them were together. The first was killed in \nthe first crushing, but two survived and they were able to crawl \naround. The second tower came down and they were pinned underneath the \nrubble and stayed there almost 24 hours. They could see a light about \n20 feet up, and they knew there was a possibility they would get out. \nAs they faded in and out of consciousness during the night, one of them \nhad a vision, it said in USA Today. The vision he saw was Jesus coming \ntoward him, bringing him a bottle of water. It gave him strength. He \nwasn't fearful of death. He was able to reach out with strength and \nyell for help. They were eventually found by a marine and were dug out \nfrom the rubble. That is one of the miracles of 9/11.\n  I think of the heroes that were going up the tower, instead of coming \ndown, on 9/11. It was an amazing day, a tragic day, one we should not \nand we won't forget.\n  Also, sometimes it is easy to think that perhaps life does not change \nthat much when actually life has irrevocably changed. It is not that \nlife doesn't go on; it certainly does. We must never forget.\n  As author Elie Wiesel said in his Nobel lecture:\n\n       For me, hope without memory is like memory without hope. \n     Just as a man cannot live without dreams, he cannot live \n     without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the \n     future. Does this mean that our future can be built on a \n     rejection of the past? Surely, such a choice is not \n     necessary. The two are incompatible. The opposite of the past \n     is not the future, but the absence of the future; the \n     opposite of the future is not the past, but the absence of \n     the past. The loss of one is equivalent to the sacrifice of \n     the other.\n\n  We must not forget our past or the attacks or the outpouring of \ngenerosity and patriotism and simple kindnesses in the days following \nthe attacks. All of this must continue. We cannot return to the safety \nof our homes and pretend the storms buffeting the lives of people \nhundreds and thousands of miles away does not affect us.\n  September 11 was a wake-up call that we cannot and will not forget. \nIt has changed us. It has changed us in substantial ways that we can \nsee and feel,\n\n[[Page S8493]]\n\nand in ways that I don't think we have wrestled with yet.\n  One simple thing: ``God Bless America'' has become a national song--\nnot the National Anthem but the national song. We gathered again today \nas Members of the Congress on the steps and sang it as we did on \nSeptember 11. I hope we can officially continue to do that. Even though \nit was unofficial today, I hope our national song will become official.\n  We are a nation founded by men and women who are willing to stake \ntheir lives upon the conviction of universal rights and freedoms; that \nthis was larger than their own lives and small roles that they felt \nthey would play; that their actions were just a shot across history's \nbow on behalf of all people who both desired to be free and honored the \nsense of duty that liberty engendered.\n  On September 11 we saw a number of people step forward to recognize \nand fight for those universal rights and freedoms, each of us in our \nown way in our own actions. Today, we still have a torch to carry--for \nall those who died on September 11, all those who have died in the war \nagainst terrorism, and all peoples across the world who desire freedom.\n  These may seem to be the worst of times, but we are resilient and, \nmost importantly, we are a hopeful people and we will prevail. There is \na Biblical verse that says:\n\n  And not only so, but we glory in tribulation also: knowing that \ntribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, \nhope: and hope maketh not ashamed. . . .\n\n  We are a hopeful people. God bless America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I joined my colleagues in the Senate \nthis morning on a trip to the Pentagon. The project there is known as \nthe Phoenix Project, and those familiar with mythology know that the \nPhoenix is the great bird that rose from the ashes and flew again. \nWell, the spirit of America was flying again this morning at the \nPentagon as we looked at a restored building--more importantly, a \nrestored spirit.\n  The President, the Secretary of Defense, and others spoke. We all \ngathered--thousands of us--to pay tribute to those who lost their lives \non September 11 there, as well as the victims in Pennsylvania and in \nNew York.\n  As our buses came back, there were a number of people gathered in \nWashington on The Mall. Many of them were--in their own way, with their \nfamilies and friends--commemorating September 11. As I passed, I saw \none man standing there with a handwritten sign that said ``United in \nMemory.'' I thought that really captures what we are doing today. We \nhave stood united since September 11, but today we reflect. We are \nunited in memory. We grieve for the victims. We mourn those who died.\n  But we also stand in praise of those heroes of September 11. Each one \nof us carries certain images in our minds of where we were when we \nheard it, what we did. For most of us, the first calls were to our \nfamilies, and maybe it was indeed proper that we would turn to those we \nlove the most to make certain they were safe.\n  I still remember images of that day, and the days following, just as \nreal as the moment when I experienced it. One was a photograph from the \nNew York Times, which showed a New York firefighter racing up the \nstairs, as you saw a long line of people racing down the stairs of the \nWorld Trade Center. A young, handsome face--probably a man with a \nfamily himself, thrusting himself into the jaws of that disaster in the \nhope that he could save someone's life.\n  Many like him--firefighters, policemen, first responders, medics, and \nothers--gave their lives on September 11. They got up that morning and \nput their badges and uniforms on and probably never thought twice about \nwhether they would return to their families. Sadly, many never did. \nThey are truly American heroes.\n  I can recall a few weeks later being out on Lake Michigan, near \nChicago, in a Coast Guard vessel with the young men who were keeping \n12-hour shifts, patrolling the shores to keep them safe, checking every \nvessel that came on the Great Lakes. Most people in Chicago didn't even \nknow they were there. But they were--every single day.\n  I can remember, as well, the Capitol Police just outside this door \nand around this complex, who worked 12-hour shifts day after day, week \nafter week, to protect us, to protect the visitors, to protect the \nstaff, to protect this great building after September 11. They are \ntruly American heroes.\n  In January, as part of the first congressional delegation to visit \nAfghanistan in the daylight hours, we went to Bagram Air Force Base. It \nwas an old Soviet base, and we were using it as part of our efforts to \nliberate Afghanistan from the Taliban.\n\n  To sit down with those young men and women in uniform who had missed \nChristmas with their families, did not know how long they were going to \nbe there, and just to talk with them and eat with them and share some \nstories about home, and to have one young man come up to me and say: \nSenator, I am from Illinois. Can I ask you a favor? When I come back \nafter this, could you give me a helping hand?\n  I said: Sure, what is it?\n  He said: I would like to become an American citizen.\n  I said: Wait a minute, you're a soldier here.\n  He said: Yes, I am. I was born in Panama, and I am not an American \ncitizen. Will you help me become an American citizen?\n  I said: You got it, buddy; whatever you want, I will be there.\n  I also remember another incident in the middle of December. I flew \ninto O'Hare, and I went down to get in the line for a taxicab. I drew a \ntaxicab, and the driver was wearing a black turban and a beard. As we \nstarted to move along, I said: Excuse me, sir, would you happen to be a \nmember of the Sikh religion?\n  He said: Yes, I am.\n  I remember I had been visited by Muslims, Sikhs, and others worried \nabout people who would discriminate against them, and I knew a little \nbit about some of the terrible things that happened to them--they were \nisolated, but that did happen.\n  I said to the taxicab driver: How have things been for you over the \nlast several months, wearing your turban, trying to be a regular \ntaxicab driver?\n  He said: Most people couldn't be nicer. There were bad ones, too. \nSome cussed me out; some wouldn't get in my cab. They think I am a \nterrorist, too.\n  He said most people could not be nicer. He said: I have been in the \nUnited States for 33 years. I wish they would get in my cab because I \nwould like to show them something.\n  I said: What is that?\n  He reached over and pulled down the visor, and there was a photograph \nof a young man in a U.S. Army uniform.\n  He said: I want to show them a picture of my son Michael.\n  I said: Michael is in the Army?\n  He said: Oh, yes; he was in Kosovo.\n  I said: Where is he now?\n  He said: He is with the Special Forces in Afghanistan, and I haven't \nheard from him in 6 weeks.\n  I thought to myself: Boy, does that tell the American story. Here we \nhave a man who some, with little education or learning, in their \nignorance, would say is an enemy of America. No, that man is a loyal \nAmerican who was offering his greatest treasure on Earth, his son, to \nour Nation to serve and who was in harm's way at that very moment.\n  Just a few weeks ago, four widows from the World Trade Center came to \nsee me. They want a public investigation of what happened leading up to \nSeptember 11. I completely support them. I think it is now overdue. We \nshould do it.\n  They talked about their experiences with their families. They told \ntheir stories over and over in all the Senate offices. Some of them \ncarried around their necks photographs of husbands and families.\n  I remember one saying: I am lucky. My three friends here do not have \nany evidence of their husbands they lost, but I was a lucky one because \nthey found a hand, and on that hand was my husband's wedding ring which \nI now have on my hand. That is all that survived.\n\n  She was grateful for that one memento of his life and how much it \nmeant to her, and what a reminder it is to all of us of the true grief \nand loss that so many families have endured.\n\n[[Page S8494]]\n\n  I suppose the lesson from September 11 should be clear: Let all those \naround the world who would attack the United States know that they will \npay a heavy price. We approve of that. But also let everyone around the \nworld know that we are not an aggressive, angry people. We are a caring \nand compassionate nation, and if others will reach out with a hand of \npeace, we will extend ours as well, no matter where you are from, no \nmatter what your religion or ethnic or cultural background. Osama bin \nLaden and al-Qaida did not understand that, but we in America \nunderstand it well.\n  When I reach back in history for words that bring inspiration, I so \noften turn to one of our favorite sons, Abraham Lincoln from Illinois, \nand his second inaugural address right outside this building in which \nhe said:\n\n       With malice toward none; with charity for all; with \n     firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let \n     us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the \n     nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the \n     battle, and for his widow, and his orphan--to do all which \n     may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among \n     ourselves, and with all nations.\n\n  Lincoln said those words as we came to the close of the most \ndevastating war in our history. He reached out to try to find common \nground, even with the enemy, to bind this Nation. So, too, should we \nreach out in this world to tell the story of America, to help build a \nmore peaceful world, a world where our children and grandchildren never \nhave to fear another September 11.\n  After September 11, we were not just united in anger, not just united \nin sympathy. We were united in memory and united in hope--hope for a \nworld of peace, hope that our children and children around the world \nwill be spared the horror, the disaster, and the tragedy of September \n11.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, as we observe the 1-year passing of \nthe day al-Qaida attacked America, we have in our hearts, our thoughts, \nand our prayers the victims and their families. On this painful \nanniversary, they do not stand alone in their grief. All Americans of \nall faiths, colors, and creeds mourn the senseless loss of life on \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  The war on terrorism is a fight against evil forces bent on \ndestroying America and our many freedoms. President Bush said this war \nwill be unlike any we have ever seen, and he is certainly right. This \nis a war without borders and one in which the battle must be brought to \nthe enemy, lest terrorists strike again on our own soil.\n  In the long proud arc of our Republic, America's courage has been too \ngreat, its values too strong, and its freedoms too dear to ever be \nturned back by an enemy. As we stand at the beginning of a new century, \nI am certain in the knowledge that we will prevail again.\n  Madam President, the watchwords for Kentuckians and all Americans on \nthis day must be: Never again.\n  I think we can safely say that 1 year after September 11, 2001, we \nhave ended the first chapter in the book about the war on terrorism. \nBut the second chapter is going to be, in many ways, much more \nchallenging.\n  The President and many of us in this Chamber are haunted by the \nnotion that a year ago today, had those planes been full of something \nother than gasoline--a chemical weapon, a biological weapon or, worse \nstill, a nuclear weapon--all of the destruction that we remember so \nvividly today would have been dramatically worse.\n  We will have before us in the Senate in the next few weeks a \nresolution giving the President the authority he will be seeking, and \nwe will need to give him, to begin to launch the second chapter in this \nwar, which is to target weapons of mass destruction, wherever they may \nbe in the world, in the hands of leaders or gangs who wish to use them \nagainst our own people here at home.\n  This is a new doctrine the President will be laying down. In the \npast, we have turned the other cheek, if you will; we have waited to be \nattacked, and then we have responded. But that approach, when one \nconsiders the devastation of weapons of mass destruction, is simply \nunacceptable. The American people will not accept a strategy based upon \nresponding after the next attack on our own soil using weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  This will be one of the most important debates we will have in the \nhistory of this body, and it will come up in the next few weeks. It \nwill be an appropriate memorial and remembrance to those who lost their \nlives a year ago today as a result of a conventional attack. Were they \nalive today, I am sure they would applaud our efforts to prevent \nanother attack with weapons even more devastating on other Americans \nhere at home.\n  Make no mistake about it, this is the new challenge of the 21st \ncentury: Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of gangs such as al-\nQaida or regimes such as the one in Baghdad used on Americans here at \nhome by people who really are against modernity, who want to roll the \nclock back to the Middle Ages where women had no rights, where people \nhad no opportunity to speak or to worship as they chose.\n  This is a war between modernity and the Middle Ages. Our enemies are \nquite intelligent and resourceful, and this challenge is going to go on \nfor quite some time.\n  In conclusion, this would be a fitting memorial to those who died a \nyear ago today, that America in a very proactive way seeks to prevent \nthe next attack in the United States using weapons of mass destruction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I think all Americans today are pausing, \nif not for a moment, for a longer time just to think, to kneel and \npray. On their mind is a historic incident that occurred a year ago \ntoday in this country.\n  Many of my colleagues and I went to the Pentagon this morning to \nrecognize that great tragedy once again and to be there to honor those \n184 civilian and military men and women who tragically died in the \nPentagon when it was struck by terrorists.\n  There is no doubt in my mind, and my guess is there is no doubt in \nany American's mind, they again relived the events of the phenomenal \nand tragic incident that occurred a year ago today, both mentally and \nvisually on television or in ceremonies or prayers or moments of \nsilence around this country.\n  In rethinking that day myself, I thought of my own emotions; that I \ngrew angry at first to realize we were being attacked by terrorists. \nThen I experienced for a moment on Capitol Hill that day a sense of \nfear that maybe the Capitol itself would be struck, or our office \nbuildings, and that my staff might be in some way injured or my family \nmay not be safe. Out of that fear, though, grew in my mind, and grew in \nmost Americans' minds, a phenomenal sense of resolve.\n  Since that tragic day, we have seen that resolve take shape in so \nmany forms, whether it is the celebrating of a complete reconstruction \nof the Pentagon today in almost unbelievable time, or whether it was \ncitizens across this Nation reaching deep in their pocket to give a \nlittle or a lot of their personal wealth to help the remaining citizens \nwhose husbands, wives, sons, or daughters were the victims of the 9/11 \nincidents.\n  As I was listening to our Secretary of Defense and our President \ntoday, I thought of two Idahoans who died a year ago today at the \nPentagon, one LTC Ron Vauk of Nampa, ID, and one Brady Howell of Sugar \nCity, ID.\n\n  I have known LTC Hawk only by a piece of paper. When I was a young \nMember in the House of Representatives, I had looked at his resume. I \nhad studied his grades and I, along with the rest of my colleagues, had \ndecided he was eligible for and ought to be nominated to the Naval \nAcademy at Annapolis. We did nominate him, and he served with honor.\n  He had retired out of the military and was serving in the Navy \nReserve, teaching in this area. He was serving only as a reservist at \nthe Pentagon in a temporary status for a few days, having been called \nfrom his job to do so when that plane struck. I will never forget the \ntime I spent with his bride and their small son in Maryland. I watched \nthe unity of that family coming around the widow and that small son of \nLTC Ron Vauk. That was the kind of resolve we have seen repeated time \nand time again out of the tear-\n\n[[Page S8495]]\n\nstained faces of Americans as they recognized that they had to commit \nthemselves, as our President and as this Congress has committed itself, \nto never letting this happen again.\n  I remembered Jennifer Vauk today, and I can only say to that brave \nwidow that I thank her for her courageousness at this tremendously \ndifficult time for her. Resolve and resilience flowing from the veins \nof Americans into the energy of their souls clearly speaks so well in \nthis country today. It is not just a 9/11 feeling, it is a sense of \npatriotism and resolve that has grown out of nearly every crisis this \ngreat country has experienced down through the years. It comes in all \ndifferent forms.\n  At this instance, in Idaho, it was the Red Cross sending volunteers \nall the way across the country to Ground Zero in New York, or it was \nthe numerous churches or memorial services held across the State of \nIdaho, or it was a marvelous little gal in Pocatello who had saved \n$1,000 of her own money to buy a horse, and she gave all of it to the \n9/11 charities so some other child could have a little bit because that \nchild had lost so much, a mother or a father.\n  It was not just an Idahoan doing it. It was thousands of Americans \nspeaking out from the smallest, almost the poorest, to the tallest and \nthe most wealthy in our country who found the capacity in their heart \nto experience this resolve and dedicate themselves, as did Leah Wright \nin Pocatello with her $1,000.\n  I suspect every generation has a defining moment. My guess is that \nSeptember 11 is the defining moment for America's current generation. \nOur President, in speaking today, has given a name for all of us who \nwould call it 9/11. It will be a Patriots Day, and I hope that every \nyear we stop to remember Patriots Day and why we now recognize it in \nthat capacity.\n  Congress is now debating legislation to create homeland security as a \ndepartment, hopefully to bring our country together more cohesively, to \nallow our law enforcement communities to do so in a way that will give \nus greater intelligence and therefore greater resolve. In doing so, we \nmust not allow terrorism, or our commitment to stopping it, deny us our \nown personal freedoms. We should never select security over freedom \nbecause it is the very freedom of our country that gives us the resolve \nwe have today. Tragically enough, it was the very freedom of our \ncountry that caused terrorists to strike at us because we do not speak \nof freedom for Americans only, we speak of it for all citizens of the \nworld and citizens of all countries as a right of humankind to be as \nfree as possible, and for this great country to be dedicated to that \nfreedom.\n  In our search for security, let us not deny ourselves the very \nfreedom that is the strength of our country.\n  Many more will speak today, and at the end of the day many tears will \nbe re-shed in memory of the men and women who died on 9/11. I am so \nproud of my country and so proud to be but a small part of its \nleadership because I have sensed in the Senate that while we may have \nour differences politically, a resolve all Americans have at this \nmoment is to never allow this to happen again, never allow our citizens \nto be the target of an enemy that would choose to strike them down for \npolitical expression.\n  So be it 9/11 or be it Patriots Day, I hope on September 11 next year \nwe will once again be speaking out about that day on September 11 of \n2001 when thousands of Americans lost their lives, but America found \nonce again a revitalized reason for being what we are and striving to \nallow the rest of the world to have the same kind of human freedoms we \nhave and cherish.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, though we would never wish to relive the \nhorror of September 11, 2001, we must dedicate ourselves to \nappropriately remembering it. That is the task we begin with this first \nanniversary of that darkest of days, to properly and lastingly honor \nthe sacrifice of the more than 3,000 women, men, and children who \nperished at the Pentagon, at the World Trade Center, at the crash site \nof flight 93 in Shanksville, PA.\n  September 11 will be a day of mourning for many years to come. And it \nshould be, for the grief of those who lost loved ones on that day will \npass only with their passing. Nothing can wipe away the memory of a \nfriend or a family member taken before their time. The victims of \nSeptember 11--those who died and the friends and family who survived \nthem--deserve our enduring respect.\n  Though the attacks were carried out in New York, Washington, and \nPennsylvania, no American was left untouched by this tragedy. That \nincludes the men and women of my home State of Tennessee. I think of \nJohn and Pat Lenoir of Knoxville who lost their son, Rob, when the \nWorld Trade Center collapsed. Francis Hall of Knoxville lost her \nsister-in-law. And Otis and Nancy Tolbert of Brentwood, TN, lost their \nson when flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon. We keep those Tennesseans \nin our thoughts and prayers today.\n  It is entirely appropriate that the President and First Lady began \ntheir September 11 by attending a church service. I hope Americans all \nacross this country follow their example by spending some part of their \nday in a house of worship or on bended knee in prayer. Regardless of \nthe God we may worship, faith in a higher power can help heal and \nexplain and console and reassure us today, just as it did a year ago.\n  Though September 11 attacks did bring one of the darkest days in our \nhistory, a few rays of light did shine through. Americans rallied to \nhelp those in need by waiting hours to give blood, by donating supplies \nto the rescue effort, by digging deep in their own pockets for the \nSeptember 11 charities. I am especially proud of the Tennessee Baptist \nConvention that sent 30 volunteers to prepare food for the rescue \nworkers at the World Trade Center.\n  I am still moved to this day, as we were at the Pentagon a few hours \nago, by the presence of members of the Tennessee Task Force One who \nhelped search for survivors and recover the fallen at the Pentagon.\n  America will always remember the men and women who risked their lives \nto save the lives of others on September 11: Those on the front line, \nthe medical personnel, the firemen, the police officers, all who rushed \ninto harm's way, who forever touched our hearts with their heroism. \nTheir example exists, survives, as an inspiration to us all. It will \nremain so for generations to come.\n  Britt Brewster, a 12-year-old Tennessee girl, who came up yesterday \nfrom Tennessee to participate in the remembrance services said earlier \nthis week:\n\n       The one good thing [about September 11] was that America \n     started coming together as one.\n\n  I remember visiting Ground Zero with about 40 of my colleagues from \nthis body a couple days after the attacks. Smoke was still rising from \nthe debris. Almost everything was covered with the fine ash. The only \ncolor, other than the workmen's bright yellow hats, was the American \nflags that hung so proudly posted on the buildings around that World \nTrade Center site. We should fly our flags on this anniversary and show \nour common love for country and our fellow countrymen.\n\n  There has been much debate about what we should teach our children on \nthis first anniversary of the September 11 attacks. I believe they need \nto know the truth. I had the opportunity to take my wife and my three \nteenage boys to Ground Zero about 2 months after the attacks. I wanted \nthem to see firsthand the destruction with their very own eyes and \nremember, long after I am gone and my generation is gone, what evil \nonce did--and, I should add, can do again--to our country. I will take \nthem back to New York. We were just there 5 days ago and saw the \nrebirth, the vitality of that remarkable city. I also want my sons to \nsee what good can be done, and can always be done, in our country.\n  The Gettysburg Address is considered one of the most powerful pieces \nof funeral oratory ever delivered on American soil. As Lincoln himself \nadmitted, even he could not dedicate the battlefield beyond what those \nwho fell there had already done. Instead, he urged his audience at the \ntime to dedicate themselves, ``that from these honored dead we take \nincreased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full \nmeasure of devotion.''\n\n[[Page S8496]]\n\n  The terrorists attacked on September 11 and continue to make deadly \nthreats because they hate our country and everything we represent. The \n3,000 women, men, and children who died on that tragic day did so for \nthe same cause as those who fell on the battle green of Lexington, and \nthe forests of Argonne, and on the beaches of Normandy--justice, \nequality, liberty, democracy.\n  I urge every American to offer their respects to families who lost \nloved ones, to put those who perished in their prayers, and to show \ntheir patriotism by unfurling the American flag. But above all, I hope \nwe will rededicate ourselves to those values, to the values that have \nbeen the core of the greatness of our country for more than two and a \nquarter centuries. Those values may be threatened sooner than we may \nthink. If they are, we will find strength and hope and resolve in \nremembering, properly and lastingly, September 11, 2001.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, this past year, has been one of \ntragedy and challenge for the American people. Just a year ago, on \nSeptember 11, 2001, we experienced a dawning national tragedy.\n  Just as the workday was beginning--8:46 a.m. to be precise--\nterrorists struck this country in a series of savage attacks. Over \n3,000 were killed and many more were injured. Those attacks struck a \nvicious blow at every American everywhere.\n  Over the past year we have labored with the highest degree of human \nspirit to address our grievous losses--as individuals, in our families, \nin our communities, and as a nation. At the same time, we have worked \nhard to deal with the challenges that confront us now and into the \nfuture. We are resolved to put an end to the scourge of terrorism and \nto bring its perpetrators to justice. Our response to terrorism must be \ncommitted and complex, for no simple solution or single action can \naccomplish our goal. We must engage in the broadest possible \ninternational effort, for we know that terrorists are not contained by \nnational borders. As we move forward, we take our inspiration from the \ncalm determination and steely resolve of the firefighters, police, \nemergency personnel, and airline passengers who responded to the \nattacks, and from the resilience of those who are rebuilding lives and \nfamilies and communities.\n  And we shall move forward, for we have families to care for, \nneighbors to look after, jobs that must be done, and civic obligations \nthat must be met. The events of September 11, 2001, were tragic beyond \nmeasure, but our response to those events demonstrates the great \nstrength of America and provides a new sense of what it means to be an \nAmerican. The future of our Nation is ours to make.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, a year ago today our Nation was \nsavagely attacked in maybe the most evil attack ever on American soil. \nOver 3,000 innocent people were killed. I call it an evil attack \nbecause how can it be more evil than to kill people who are totally \ninnocent--men, women, and children?\n  The attack on the World Trade Center was an attack on the United \nStates, on our economic beliefs and foundations. The attack on the \nPentagon was an attack on our national security and defense. Flight 93 \nwas, we now find out, headed for the Capitol, an attack on our \ndemocracy. I thank God for the heroes, the passengers on the plane.\n  A lot of heroes came out as a result of these savage attacks a year \nago--men and women who were running into the buildings, not away from \nthe buildings; into the buildings to save lives.\n  It is amazing. If you look at the pictures we have seen in the last \nfew days of the World Trade Center and Pentagon--it is amazing that \nthere are only 3,000 that were lost. That number could have been \nsignificantly higher. If you look at the devastation in New York City \nalone, it would not have been hard to imagine 20,000 lost, not 3,000. \nIt probably would have been 20,000 lives lost had it not been for the \ncourageous acts of firemen and policemen and fellow workers putting \ntheir own safety at risk to save other lives, not to mention the \npassengers on flight 93 who kept that plane from running into our \nCapitol, from hitting our Capitol. I cannot imagine the loss that would \nhave happened, not just the loss of life--of Senators and Congressmen, \nour staffs, our employees, our security officers--but also the effect \nit would have on democracy. I shudder to think what would have happened \nif they would have hit our Nation's Capitol.\n  Today I joined with the President and many others in rededicating the \nPentagon. It is great to see the Pentagon rebuilt, and my compliments \ngo to the workers and others who rebuilt such a wonderful building in \nsuch a short period of time. But we also remember the loss of life in \neach of these instances.\n  In the Pentagon, a former employee and personal friend of mine, \nBarbara Olson, was killed. She was a passenger on that airplane. My \nheart still aches for Ted Olson and their family. What a terrible loss \nthat was, taking the life of a person who was so bright, had so much \nlife, was so engaged in the political life of our country. To have that \nlife taken is just a very sad tragedy. To think that is multiplied by \n3,000 times all across the country, it is a very sad reminder of the \nenormous tragedy we have suffered.\n  It reminds me of the Oklahoma City bombing we suffered on April 19, \n1995. In Oklahoma City, we lost 168 lives. I knew some of those people \nas well. When you know somebody it makes it more personal. It is not \njust 3,000 lives. You realize it is individual families and some of \nthose families were totally devastated and their futures enormously \nchanged, if not destroyed because of this senseless, cowardly, evil \nattack that happened a year ago.\n  Like Oklahoma City, we had a lot of heroes. The heroes, the firemen \nwho raced into the building, the heroes on flight 93, the heroes who \nwere saving lives in the Pentagon, the medical personnel and others who \nsaved countless lives, in some cases they gave up their life in order \nto save lives. The Bible says:\n\n       Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his \nlife for his friends.\n\n  We had a lot of American citizens who laid down their lives to save \nother lives. What an enormous gift they have given. They did this to \npay the ultimate price or make the ultimate sacrifice--to save the \nlives of other Americans.\n  Thousands of people killed one year ago today. Why? Because they were \nAmericans, because they happened to be citizens of the United States, \nbecause they stood for freedom, they happened to share freedom.\n  Our country was attacked economically and militarily and politically. \nHowever, we survived that attack. The American economy is fine. Our \nAmerican military stands strong. Our American democracy remains \nsteadfast.\n  My compliments to the men and women in the military who are \nprotecting our freedom daily and who have done a fantastic job going \nafter the culprits, those who are responsible for this attack, in \nAfghanistan and other places.\n  My compliments to the administration, President Bush, Secretary \nPowell and Secretary Rumsfeld and others, who are going after the \nperpetrators of this crime--not just in Afghanistan, but in countries \nall across the world. My compliments to them for building up an \ninternational coalition of over 90 countries who are joining us in this \nattack, fighting the battle against terrorism throughout the world.\n  There is a lot of work that has been done and a lot of work that yet \nneeds to be done. This Congress needs to join with the administration, \nboth legislatively but also in support in continuing this attack and \nthis battle on terrorism. We are not finished. There are still a lot of \ntrained terrorists who threaten our country. Unfortunately, maybe they \nhave been brainwashed into thinking it is good to try to kill innocent \npeople if they happen to be Americans, or maybe if they happen to be \nfriends of Israel. There is a lot of hatred that has been fomented for \na long time, and that is very regrettable, but it is important that we \nband together--people all across the world--to condemn and combat \nterrorism.\n  I think the President has done an outstanding job, leading this \ncountry and leading the free world in that battle. I compliment him for \nit. We have a\n\n[[Page S8497]]\n\nlot of work ahead, but I am absolutely confident that freedom will \nprevail. We are a great country because we are a free country. We have \ngreater freedoms--political freedom, economic freedom, religious \nfreedom--than any other country in the history of mankind. I am \nabsolutely confident, though, in 10 years from now or 20 years from \nnow, we will still be able to say that we live in the greatest and most \nfree country in the history of mankind. However, these freedoms have \nbeen attacked. Frankly, these freedoms have been under attack for \nseveral years. Now we are responding and we are responding strongly. \nYet we still have a lot to do. I am confident that the people who \nchallenge us will not be successful. Freedom will prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think my colleague from Oklahoma is \nexactly right. We can carry it one step further. We have these freedoms \nand that is why they hate us so much; they don't have these freedoms. \nThe idea that individuals can have the freedoms we in this country have \nis totally alien to everything they believe in.\n  I sat there as others did--I am sure my colleague from Oklahoma did \nthis morning--and looked at the Pentagon, and I know what went through \nhis mind and what went through my mind was the Murrah Federal Office \nBuilding in Oklahoma City in 1995. We lost about the same number of \nlives back then as we did in the Pentagon. There are a lot of other \nsimilarities there.\n  The appearance after the airplane struck was so similar to that which \nwe experienced in Oklahoma City. That brought back those very sad \nmemories.\n  I sometimes look at things and ask, How can anything good come from \nsomething as bad as all that? Yet I can see--it is obvious, as I saw \nthe changes in attitudes of people here in this body, and also the body \ndown the hall--they are reflecting the interests of the American \npeople.\n  I have been concerned for the last 10 years with the deterioration in \nthe condition of our military. We talk about the authorization program. \nWe talk about our end strength. We talk about the fact that we don't \nhave a national missile defense system.\n  Somebody very smart back in 1983 determined that there will be a \nday--and they put the date, fiscal year 1998--when we are going to have \nto be able to defend our people from an incoming missile. So we got on \nschedule to be able to deploy something to defend against a limited \nmissile attack.\n  We talked about land-based, air-based, space-based, and the AEGIS \nsystem, and evaluated all of these until the early 1990s when the \nprogram stopped. President Clinton was President at that time. He \nvetoed the Defense authorization bill. In his veto message, he said: I \nwill continue to veto any bill that has money in it for a national \nmissile defense system because there is no threat.\n  Now we know there is. We know the threat is there, and we wish we \ncould look back and say, Why didn't we stay on schedule where we would \nhave to deploy by fiscal year 1998?--which is really 1997.\n  We have been watching the deterioration of our military in terms of \nend strength and in terms of authorization. Right now, we are sending \nour troops out into battle with inferior equipment.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma and I have both experienced the condition \nof our artillery system. It is one that has 1958 technology. You can \nthink of it as Civil War technology where you have to run the barrel \nbetween each shot.\n  I think even some of the military leaders in America do not realize \nhow deteriorated it is. I think a lot of our leaders were not aware \nuntil September 11 that there are many other countries making more \nsophisticated strike systems than we have. Our best air-to-air defense \nand air-to-ground vehicle is the F-16. They now have the SU-27 and SU-\n30. They are on the open market. We know that China has bought around \n240 of these. It is a very threatening situation.\n  I can recall the day this happened. A year ago, we had the Chamber of \nCommerce in from the State of Oklahoma. They come up once a year. And \nthey were over in the Hart Building. It was my turn to address them \nfrom 9 to 9:30. Senator Nickles was addressing them from 9:30 to 10. As \nI got to the end of my 30-minute speech, I ended it the same way I have \nended my speeches since 1994/95; that is, today we are in the most \nthreatened position we have been in as a nation in the history of our \ncountry. Just as I said that, I looked up, and I saw this billowing \nsmoke--not knowing what it was, not even finding out until Senator \nNickles ended his speech that in fact it was the bombing of the \nPentagon.\n  This mentality that has been permeating the Halls of both the House \nand the Senate--that somehow the cold war is over and the threat is not \nout there anymore--is something that people now understand is not true.\n  When this administration came in, they saw our end strength and the \nproblems we have in the military. We have to change our policy--which \nhas always been to defend America against two MTW; that is, two major \ntheater wars. Now it is to defend America against one theater.\n\n  This is something that is not acceptable to the American people. And \nthey find out. I know this, Mr. President, because every time I say it, \nthey ask the question: Do you mean that we don't have that capability, \nand we have abandoned the policy we have had in this country for the \nlast 20 years? I say: Yes, that is where we are.\n  I think Secretary Rumsfeld was right when he testified before our \nSenate Armed Services Committee and said now we are trying to keep a \nmilitary on a smaller amount of money relative to our gross domestic \nproduct than before Pearl Harbor. We are spending less today--3 percent \nof our gross domestic product--on our military.\n  People talk about how much stronger we are than anyone else. There \nare not many other countries that do not spend more than that \npercentage. Historically, it has been between 4 percent and 5 percent.\n  We are having a markup of the Defense authorization bill. I came over \nfrom there because I wanted to get on record as strongly as I can about \nthe result and how we might benefit from this tragedy a year ago today.\n  In this debate which we are in, we need to know if there is some way \nwe can relieve the Guard at the gates at our military operations so \nthey can go and relieve some of the Guard and Reserves who are \noverworked. Right now, there is not a Senator in here who hasn't heard \nfrom Guard and Reserve back home. They are overworked and overdeployed. \nThey have lost their jobs. Many of these individuals have had to quit \nthe Reserves and the Guard. Sadly, we are missing the critical MO \nauthorization specialties. It is something we are going to have to do.\n  But there is a mentality among people--and we don't disrespect those \npeople who believe the threat is not out there. There are some people \nwho honestly in their hearts believe that if we all stand in a circle--\nall countries--and hold hands and unilaterally disarm, all threats will \ngo away. I know that doesn't sound reasonable, but in Washington, there \nare quite a few of those around.\n  I think the shock treatment we got on September 11 of 2001 brought us \nout of that. We understand what we are going to have to do. We are \ngoing to have to do a rebuilding.\n  I think if there is anything to come to benefit us as a result of \nthis tragedy a year ago, it is to remind not the people in this \nChamber--they react to the people at home--but to remind people at home \nthat we are in a very threatened situation and the most vulnerable in \nthe history of this country.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld said it in a way which I think is very good. He \nsaid the consequences of making a mistake now are far greater than ever \nbefore. He said they are minuscule by comparison--that the consequence \nof making mistakes in Somalia in 1993 was that we lost 18 soldiers. The \nconsequence of making mistakes in Yemen in 1999 was tragic. We lost 17 \nsailors. But he said the consequence of making a mistake right now is \nthat we could lose hundreds of thousands of people.\n  We need to move on and allow this tragedy in America to serve as a \nreminder to the people of America that we have to rebuild. We have to \nmake America strong again to the point that we can meet the minimum \nexpectations of the American people. We do not today.\n\n[[Page S8498]]\n\n  I only say, as tragic as it is, that the best way to ensure that \nthose individuals who died--over 3,000--a year ago will not have died \nin vain is by learning the lesson and rebuilding and preventing a far \ngreater catastrophe from happening again.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it is a privilege to welcome a \ndistinguished delegation from the Norwegian Parliament. Nine members of \nthe Committee on Defense are with us today in the Senate Chamber. They \nhave come to the United States this week as a part of an ambitious \nseries of events which will include meetings at the Pentagon, the State \nDepartment, the National Security Council, and Central Command in \nFlorida.\n  They had been scheduled to leave Washington this morning, but they \nhave changed their itinerary deliberately because they wanted to be \nwith us here, the U.S. Senate, in the Capitol Building on this solemn \nday.\n  As fellow legislators and close NATO allies, the Norwegian Defense \nCommittee wanted to express its solidarity with Congress and with the \nAmerican people on the first anniversary of September 11.\n  I would like to read a letter into the Record from the Defense \nCommittee of Norway.\n  They have written:\n\n       To the Senate of the United States:\n       The Standing Committee on Defense of the Norwegian \n     Parliament wishes to express its deepest sympathy and \n     solidarity with the American people on this day of \n     remembrance--one year after the horrible terror attack on the \n     United States that occurred September 11, 2001.\n       Let us never forget all those individuals who lost their \n     lives in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, including \n     firemen, police officers, and volunteers who tried to rescue \n     people from the flames.\n\n  The letter continues:\n\n       September 11 changed the world and international politics. \n     Norway is proud to participate in the broad coalition against \n     terrorism and does so by taking part in ``Operation Enduring \n     Freedom'' under U.S. command. The fight against terrorism is \n     a fight for democracy, for an open and free society, and for \n     human rights.\n\n           Sincerely,\n       The Standing Committee on Defense [of Norway]:\n         Ms. Marit Nybakk, Chairman DC, Ms. Aase Wisloeff Nilssen, \n           Member DC, Mr. Bjoern Hernaes, Member DC, Mr. Kjetil \n           Bjoerklund, Member DC, Mr. Per Roar Bredvold, Member \n           DC, Mr. Gunnar Halvorsen, Member DC, Mr. Aage \n           Konradsen, Member DC, Mr. Leif Lund, Member DC, Mr. Per \n           Ove Width, Member DC, Mr. Joern Olsen, Secretary DC.\n  I know that I speak for all Members of the Senate when I say that we \ndeeply appreciate your support today. Your presence here reminds us of \nthe importance of allies and the enduring bond between the United \nStates and Norway.\n  During the long decades of the Cold War, Norway was the only NATO \nmember to border directly on the Russian Republic. This ``front-line'' \nposition imposed a special burden on Norway, and its value as a member \nof the Alliance far exceeded the size of its population.\n  The border between Norway and Russia is now peaceful and cooperative. \nYet Norway still bears burdens from its history as a front-line state. \nIn particular, it must contend with the environmental dangers created \nby the nuclear-powered Soviet-era fleet that is deteriorating on the \nnearby Kola Peninsula.\n  In June of this year, I had the pleasure to visit Norway following an \nextensive trip to Russia. There I met with many members of the \nNorwegian defense establishment, including members of the Defense \nCommittee. We talked a great deal about nuclear clean-up issues on the \nKola Peninsula. Norway has been an invaluable partner in addressing \nthis nuclear threat through its support for the Nunn-Lugar program and \nits participation in the trilateral Arctic Military Environmental \nCooperation program or AMEC. Under AMEC, our country has been working \nwith the Russians and Norwegians to safely dispose of the nuclear \nmaterial from decommissioned vessels.\n  We have had great success so far, but the challenges of safeguarding \nweapons and materials of mass destruction are immense. I am hopeful \nthat our efforts can be expanded and accelerated, and I know that \nNorway will work closely with us to address these dangers.\n  So we welcome the Norwegian Defense Committee and draw encouragement \nfrom their presence here on this day of remembrance. We look forward to \nall that we can accomplish together, as we strive to make the world \nsafe from terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/11/senate-section/article/S8498-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I rise today in honor of those in New \nYork, at the Pentagon, and in the skies over Pennsylvania who lost \ntheir lives 1 year ago today.\n  None of us in the Senate will ever forget the events of that terrible \nmorning, nor will we ever forget the courage and compassion displayed \nby Americans everywhere in response to the attacks.\n  Today, my thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, \nand all of those who risked their lives to save others on that awful \nday. The despicable acts that we witnessed were meant to create havoc \nand to test our resolve as Americans. America passed that test. We are \nstronger and more united as a Nation today than we ever were. Despite \nthe fact that our buildings were damaged, America's foundations remain \nunshaken. And despite the fact that 3,000 of our friends, relatives, \nand neighbors were murdered, America's sense of community is stronger \nthan ever.\n  This morning, many of us took part in a memorial service across the \nriver at the newly restored Pentagon. One year ago today, that building \nwas on fire. One of its five sides essentially lay in ruin.\n  Last September, I visited the Pentagon just days after the attack. It \nwas a terrible scene of devastation. But today we saw a building that \nhas been completely rebuilt. The Pentagon, both on the inside and on \nthe outside, is better than before. The offices within are busy now \nwith the activity of military men and women who are hard at work in the \nwar against terror.\n  The Pentagon, today, stands as a reminder of the American spirit and \na warning to those who want to terrorize us: America will triumph, and \nthose who want nothing less than to destroy our way of life will fail. \nThey will fail because of the American spirit. They will fail because \nof our faith in freedom and democracy. They will fail because of the \nstrength and character of the American people.\n  I believe Americans have emerged from the attacks even stronger and \nmore dedicated to our beliefs and to our Nation. But we cannot let our \nguard down again. We cannot forget that evil is lying in wait for \nanother opportunity to attack. So far, we have been able to anticipate, \nwith intelligence, any future attacks. But we know the enemy will try \nagain.\n  It has been said many times--but it bears repeating--it might not \nseem that we are at war, but we are at war. It is a different kind of a \nstruggle than we have ever fought before.\n  On the surface, it might not seem like World War II, Korea, Vietnam, \nor any other conflict of the past. Make no mistake about it, danger \nstill lurks, and we must remain vigilant.\n\n  Americans have made many sacrifices, big and small, over the last\n\n[[Page S8499]]\n\nyear. They gave blood and contributed to relief efforts. They became \nmore vigilant in their communities. They volunteered to help those in \nneed. We have come a long way since the attacks a year ago, and I could \nnot be prouder of our people.\n  In that time, I believe we have found new national unity, not only \nfrom the heroism of firefighters, police, and our military, but also \nfrom the everyday efforts of regular everyday Americans.\n  I am proud of the way we in Congress responded to the attacks. By \nputting aside politics and working together with President Bush for the \ngreater good, we have shown that, while we all wear political labels as \nRepublicans and Democrats, we are Americans first.\n  The President has done a superb job leading our country in the war on \nterror, and we in Congress have done our best to provide him with the \nresources necessary to persecute and win that war.\n  Much has been done, but we must continue to remain focused on the \ntask at hand--protecting our homeland. And that job continues tomorrow \nin the Senate. We will finish it, and we will finish it successfully.\n  People often ask me how things have changed in Washington since 9/11. \nSome things on the surface certainly have changed. There are more \nconcrete barriers, roadblocks, and security precautions, but looking \nbeneath the surface, I think the better question to ask is, What did 9/\n11 reveal about us? It showed that we are still a good and \ncompassionate Nation and people. It showed that, under the worst of \ncircumstances, we will come to the aid not only of our friends and \nneighbors, but to complete strangers. It showed that America is still \nthe greatest nation on Earth, and it showed that, in the war on terror, \nwe will prevail.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will spend a few minutes remembering \nthe day, as we all have taken some time to express our individual \nthoughts and honor this day in the best way we can, to express what it \nmeans for us, for all Americans, and actually for millions of people \naround the world.\n  It is truly a somber day for all of us. In a nation that has known \nunparalleled success, coping with a tragedy of this enormity is all \nthat more difficult. We love our liberty, we love our freedom, and we \nwant nothing from the world or for the world but peace and prosperity. \nYet today we find our liberty and our personal freedoms restrained. We \nare fighting one war and are poised on the brink of another. It is no \nwonder the anxiety of the American people is palpable.\n  As we search for certainty and leadership in these uncertain times, \nit is only natural we turn towards one of our greatest leaders, Abraham \nLincoln. As our leader during our greatest crisis, his words carry a \nresonance and wisdom that ring true today.\n  President Lincoln's second inaugural address, delivered at the \ntwilight of the Civil War, reads like a prayer. It is a request to God \nto show us how to be just, and to grant this Nation peace. Yet, while \nit is a prayer, it is also a plan. President Lincoln wrote:\n\n       Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty \n     scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that \n     it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's 250 \n     years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop \n     of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn \n     with the sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so still must it \n     be said, the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous \n     altogether.\n       With malice towards none, with charity for all, with \n     firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let \n     us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the \n     Nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the \n     battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may \n     achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves \n     and with all nations.\n\n  President Lincoln asked for God's assistance, but also to shine a \nlight on the righteous path to victory. We must finish the work we are \nin, but we must also care for the victims of war and do all we can to \nachieve a lasting peace.\n  That is how President Lincoln wanted the Civil War to end. Not with \nrecriminations that would tear the country apart forever and sow seeds \nfor the next war but, rather, to approach victory with charity. For a \npowerful nation such as the United States, it is only in demonstrating \nour commitments to a world order that we can attain a lasting peace.\n  It is only in our generosity to the struggling nations to the world \nwe can enjoy the full fruits of our labors and the great bounties of \nour democracy. It is part of the twin ironies of being the sole \nsuperpower in the world. The first is that to preserve the peace, we \nmust prepare for war. The second is that to attain any real victory, we \nmust show mercy to those we have vanquished.\n  Louisiana lost three sons on September 11: Petty Officer Second Class \nKevin Yokum of Lake Charles, Navy LT Scott Lamana of Baton Rouge, and \nLouis Williams of Mandeville. The quick and expedient thing for our \ncountry would be to cry for their revenge and the revenge of the \nthousands of other Americans who died for freedom that day. Yet that is \nnot America. It is not what these three men would have wanted. Rather, \nthey would want to know that their deaths had helped to sow a lasting \nand just peace among ourselves and with all nations.\n  So I join my colleagues today in saluting the heroism of these men, \nof the men and women who died and were wounded at the Pentagon, the \nheroism of the men and women of our great metropolis, New York, and the \nsurrounding States and regions--of course, New Jersey lost many \npeople--and the men and women aboard flight 93. Let their heroism be \nour inspiration to finish the work that we have at hand.\n  We have a great amount of work ahead. We can be proud of the work we \nhave accomplished in the last 12 months, any number of initiatives and \nbills and legislative proposals and endeavors that have really made \nthis country much stronger, more secure than we were on this day, this \nhour, a year ago. But there is no doubt there is a great deal of work \nto be done. Let us remember that we will show leadership in our might \nand power. We will also show leadership in our mercy, in our \nwillingness to leave this world to a much more just and fair place, \nwhere democracies rule the day and people can enjoy freedoms unheard \nof, really, and not yet experienced in the world. That is America's \ngreatest challenge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one year ago today, September 11, 2001, \nterrorists attacked our country, killing almost 3,000 people. Each of \nus has, in the year since the attack, had our lives touched by the \nhorrific events of September 11th. Each of us has, in the year since \nthe attack, been shocked by the terrible images of destruction and \nsuffering at the sites of these attacks--at the World Trade Center, in \nPennsylvania, and at the Pentagon. Paradoxically, each of us has also \nbeen uplifted by the stories of heroism and self-sacrifice that have \nemerged from around the country in the wake of these terrible events.\n  From this act of war and hatred against all Americans, our country \nhas demonstrated once again the resilient strength in the fabric of our \npeople. Make no mistake about it: Our country is at war. But unlike \npast wars, we face a new challenge, a new type of enemy, one that is \nloosely organized throughout the world, with tentacles stretching into \nevery corner of the globe, and one which is steadfast in its \ndetermination to defeat America.\n  We cherish our freedoms, our opportunities, and our tolerance. But we \nremain vigilant in our determination to meet and defeat our enemy--\nterrorists who threaten our security and our freedoms. Throughout our \ncountry's history, our people, its leaders, and Congress have \ndemonstrated time and time again that when we work together--when we \nharness the full energy and commitment of our country--we can overcome \nany adversity or any enemy to our people. The tragic events of \nSeptember 11th have united this country and challenged our country once \nagain to face down the terrible threat of terrorism.\n  Beginning with the PATRIOT Act, which was signed into law soon after\n\n[[Page S8500]]\n\nthe September 11th attack, and continuing today with the pending \nlegislation to create a new Department of Homeland Security, I have \nbeen committed to aiding our country's fight against terrorism in order \nto defeat our enemy and make our homeland safe from future attacks. My \ncommitment is strong and my determination is unwavering to ensure that \nour President has all the tools and resources needed to fight and win \nthis war so that the scourge of terrorism is extinguished forever.\n  In supporting the war against terrorism, I want to highlight some of \nthe legislative measures that I have proposed or supported during the \n107th Congress.\n  The Military Force Authorization Bill, P.L. 107-40, enacted September \n18, 2001: This bill provided President Bush with the full and necessary \nauthority to use force against those who took part in the terrorist \nattacks.\n  U.S.A. PATRIOT Act of 2001, P.L. 107-56, enacted October 26, 2001: \nThis comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation provided new tools for \nlaw enforcement and for improved information sharing among Federal \nagencies to deter and protect against further terrorist attacks. The \nAct is tough on terrorists and those who harbor or assist them. The \nAct: one, increased criminal penalties for various terrorism crimes and \nmoney laundering schemes used to finance terrorists; two, reformed our \nimmigration laws to ensure that suspected terrorists are denied \nadmission into, or deported from, the United States; three, authorized \nthe sharing of intelligence and criminal information among law \nenforcement and intelligence agencies to ensure that all information is \navailable for preventing further terrorist attacks; four, updated law \nenforcement surveillance tools needed to investigate terrorists who use \nnew communications and related technologies to conduct their terrorist \nschemes; and, five, required criminal background checks for commercial \ntruck drivers transporting hazardous materials.\n\n  Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Recovery from and Response \nto Terrorist Attacks on the United States, P.L. 107-38, enacted \nSeptember 18, 2001: This bill provided $40 billion to support our \ncountry's war against terrorism, and provided substantial disaster \nassistance and recovery funds.\n  Department of Homeland Security, H.R. 5005, pending before the \nSenate: This proposal is currently being considered by the Senate would \ncreate a new Department of Homeland Security, which would be \nresponsible for preventing terrorist attacks, protecting our country's \ninfrastructure from attacks, coordinating the review and analysis of \nintelligence information among intelligence and law enforcement \nagencies, and coordinating response efforts by federal and local \nresponse agencies.\n  The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act, P.L. 107-173, \nenacted May 14, 2002: This act tightened our border and visa policies \nby requiring the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the State \nDepartment, the FBI and Central Intelligence Agency to share \ninformation in order to identify individuals who may pose a terrorist \nthreat to our country. In addition, the act: one, requires the State \nDepartment to issue visas and other travel documents which include \nbiometric identifiers--i.e. fingerprints, retinal scan; two, mandates \nthe INS to implement an entry-exit tracking system; three, requires the \nINS to install biometric scanners at all United States entry points; \nand four, provides greater access to law enforcement databases for INS \nand intelligence agencies. The act also increases funding for \nadditional INS inspectors.\n  Secure Transportation for America Act, P.L. 107-71, enacted November \n11, 2001: This act improved airport security for all United States \ntravelers by adopting new and more stringent requirements for hiring of \nairport screeners to eliminate potential security risks; required \nairlines to install stronger cockpit doors to protect against possible \nforced entry into the cockpit and implemented the air marshal program \nto increase the presence of air marshals on all flights.\n  The Public Health Safety and Bioterrorism Response Act, P.L. 107-188, \nenacted June 12, 2002: This act provides $1 billion to State and local \ngovernments to improve planning and preparedness, $450 million to the \nCenters for Disease Control (CDC) to upgrade their capacities to deal \nwith public health threats, and $1 billion to expand our current \nnational stockpiles of medicines and vaccines. In addition, the act \nprovides $200 million to protect our food supply and livestock and our \ndrinking water from terrorist contamination.\n  The Terrorist Bombings Convention Implementation Act, P.L. 107-197, \nenacted June 25, 2002: This act ratified and implemented the \nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, a \nUnited Nations treaty that seeks to suppress terrorist bombings and the \nfinancing of terrorism, and enhances our ability to extradite \nindividuals responsible for terrorist bombings.\n  While we have accomplished much, there is still much to do. Since \nSeptember 11th, we all recognize that we live in a different and more \ndangerous world. We must unite in our continuing support for our \ncountry's war against terrorism; we live with an ongoing and serious \nthreat to our society. We must remain vigilant in protecting our way of \nlife and meeting the challenges ahead.\n  I want to take a moment and offer my prayers and condolences for \nthose families and friends who lost loved ones on September 11th. Today \nwe all join together, hand-in-hand, heart-in-heart, tear-in-tear, to \nshare as a country all of the pain of September 11th. We recognize your \nterrible loss, we offer you our support and we give you our love. We \nwill never forgot the terrible tragedy of September 11th. We will do \nall we can in our prayers and in our deeds to make sure that such an \nattack never occurs again.\n  It is a new era in America and I ask for your prayers and support as \nwe face many difficult challenges ahead. We do so with a steely resolve \nto never, ever let this horrible event ever occur again.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in the year since last September 11th, \nthere has been much debate on the Senate floor on how to stop \nterrorists; and there will be plenty of time in the coming months to \ndebate what we do insofar as organizing homeland security, and how we \ndeal with Iraq and the fanatics who want to blow us up and the like.\n  But on this September 11th, this Senator wants to remember the 3,000 \nlives lost in New York, at the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania. Obviously \ntheir loss has been felt by their families in ways none of us can \nimagine. But their loss has also been felt by all Americans. As a \nSenator, in the last year, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought \nabout what happened last September 11th, and what actions this Congress \ncan take to prevent such horrifying events. September 11th has moved \nthis nation to respond and to defend ourselves in ways that has made \nAmerica stronger, I have no doubt.\n  In addition, I want to honor the men and women in the armed forces, \nwho have put their lives on the line in the last year to track down \nterrorists in caves and everywhere else they are hiding. I honor the \nlaw enforcement officials all over this country, who protect our \nhomeland every day. And I have great respect for the newly hired men \nand women of the Transportation Security Administration, who are \nwearing the newest American uniform to ensure the safety of our \nairports.\n  September 11th made us address our security vulnerabilities, but \nthere is more work to be done. In the coming months, on days that are \nless emotional than this anniversary, I hope we remain as strong and \ndetermined to win the war on terrorism.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, many of us will spend a good deal of \nthis day reflecting on what happened one year ago in New York, \nWashington, DC, and Pennsylvania. The images of horror, confusion and \nbravery that dominated our television screens last September will, once \nagain, be refreshed in our minds. The raw emotion that we felt then \nwill also be revisited. And, as is our nature, we will, again, try to \nrationalize why such tragedy befell our Nation. But this effort will be \nfutile, because those who attacked us are filled with a hatred that is \nincomprehensible to American logic. Simply put, for us, life is a \nprecious gift of God; to our enemy, it is utterly dispensable. So how \ncan we constructively approach September 11, 2002? I believe\n\n[[Page S8501]]\n\nthat Americans can do three things today to accomplish a sense of \nhealing.\n  The first step focuses on our children. No group was scarred as much \nby the terrorist attacks as were they. Their innocent view of the world \ndid not contemplate the kind of evil that was perpetrated on September \n11, 2001. So for them, the images of crashing planes, burning \nbuildings, and crying adults shattered their belief in a world that was \ngood and safe. Not only were they frightened, they were also confused \nabout why others wanted to hurt us. Today, many children may experience \nthe same anxiety about terrorism that they did one year ago; let us \nrecognize that and take a moment to reaffirm to them that they are \nloved, that they are protected, and that the good people in the world \nfar outnumber the bad.\n  Secondly, be a patriot. This can be accomplished in many ways. Flying \nthe flag is the most recognized. But telling a service-veteran that you \nappreciate his or her sacrifice is equally valuable. The civic heroes \nof September 11th, firefighters and police officers, also deserve our \nrecognition for selflessly responding to the needs of the country. And \nacts such as giving blood, helping a neighbor in need or giving to a \ncharity are just as patriotic. All these acts have the effect of \nuniting us behind a common purpose and remind us that no enemy can \nweaken our moral fabric.\n  Lastly, reflect back upon these words spoken by President Bush last \nSeptember 20: ``We will direct every resource at our command--every \nmeans of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of law \nenforcement, every financial influence, and every necessary weapon of \nwar--to the disruption and defeat of the global terror network.'' This \nbold commitment by the President signaled to all that the United States \nwas entering a long struggle that would require our desire for action \nto be checked by patience.\n  Patience, of course, remains necessary, but we have achieved much in \nour initial response to last year's attack. U.S. military action has \nunseated the Taliban government that once protected al-Qaida in \nAfghanistan, while terrorist training camps in that country have been \nrendered inoperable. At home, Congress and the President are working to \nestablish a new Department of Homeland Security to enhance coordination \nof our government's anti-terror effort, both Chambers of Congress have \npassed the largest defense budgets in our Nation's history, and \nextraordinary effort has been made to improve air safety, intelligence \ngathering and counterterrorism methods. To be sure, our war on terror \nis just beginning, but we should remember that American action since \nlast year's attack has been strong and has yielded positive results.\n  Contemplating what happened to our country one year ago is difficult \nfor all of us. It is difficult for the friends and family of flight \nattendant Al Marchand, a New Mexico native who was one of the victims \naboard United Airlines flight 175. It is difficult for the urban rescue \nteam that traveled from New Mexico to New York in hopes of finding \nsurvivors. But remembering those lost is a duty. Today, if we focus on \nour children, our communities and the progress we have made in the last \nyear, we will honor the fallen as well as re-energize ourselves for the \nstruggle ahead.\n  Before I end, I want to make note of a poem I received from a young \ngirl from Los Alamos, New Mexico. The title of the poem is ``Who Am \nI,'' and it reflects some of the very serious thoughts that the reality \nof terrorism has forced upon our young people, thoughts about humanity, \nand thoughts about whether peace can prevail. I ask unanimous consent \nto print this poem in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Who Am I?\n\n     A face, different from others around me.\n     A name, unusual to outsiders, yet beautiful in meaning.\n     A voice, bold but not abrasive when spoken to the world.\n     To my parents, I am their pride, their courage.\n     To my teachers, I am a word of exquisiteness.\n     Me: lucky and fortunate to be here and to have what I have.\n     In my family I am the listener and the speaker.\n     To my friends, I am the fun and happiness.\n     To my enemies, I am ignored like dust swept away.\n     To many strangers, I am another face smiling in the crowd.\n     My mind is mature, but there is much I don't know.\n     I am a child in every way.\n     Successes come and go, and I'm sure there will be \n           disappointments.\n     I dream about the future and what it brings.\n     I always remember the good things and seldom the bad.\n     I forget the days when I was little, and they disappear into \n           vast space.\n     People don't understand my thoughts, my culture, or \n           sometimes, just me.\n     My frustration makes me want to be alone.\n     Who am I?\n     I am a voice with laughter, thoughts and opinion.\n     A name with pride and courage.\n     But most of all, a person waiting to fulfill a life of \n           wonders, dreams, and the happiness that comes with it.\n\n       By Noopar Goyal,\n\n\n                        Los Alamos, New Mexico,\n\n                               May 2002.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of the \nevents of September 11, 2001. It hardly seems that it was one year ago \nthat New York City and Washington, D.C., awoke to an astonishingly \nsunny late summer day whose calmness belied the tragic events that \nwould come that morning. While the passage of time has continued as it \ndid before that day, our lives, our Nation, and the entire world have \nsince been profoundly transformed.\n  As that day unhinged one year ago, we all struggled to answer the \nquestions that raced through our heads: ``Who is capable of such \nmonstrous violence?'' ``Why would they do this to us?'' And like the \nfamilies of the victims, many of us sat at the end of that long day and \nwondered: ``How do we go on from here?''\n  A deep sense of loss and uncertainty permeated the Nation in the \nweeks that followed the attacks. But in spite of the somber mood, we \ndid what Americans do best. United as never before, we found our \nresolve to forge ahead. We found strength by turning to family and by \nturning to our neighbors. We rededicated ourselves to the civic \nresponsibility that is the cornerstone of freedom.\n  While memory remains scarred by the worst act of terrorism on \nAmerican soil, the past year has been a time for healing. Today, we \ncontinue to heal by remembering those who lost their lives on September \n11. We remember the men and women who worked at the World Trade Center, \nthe military and civilian personnel at the Pentagon, the firefighters \nwho did what they could to ease the tragedy, and the heroes of United \nAirlines Flight 93 who gave their lives to spare the Nation an even \nlarger loss.\n  Each day that passes will bring us a bit closer to becoming whole \nagain. But we must all take time on this day to mourn those who lost \ntheir lives on September 11 and honor the heroes who saved so many \nlives. We must also keep in our thoughts the troops who are fighting \noverseas in defense of our nation.\n  Today is about remembrance, but tomorrow is always about the future. \nOnce again, we have to ask ourselves, ``How do we go on from here?'' \nAnd answer with certainty and strength. America will not be deterred by \nterrorism. Instead we will celebrate what it means to live as citizens \nof this country and honor our continued responsibility to advancing the \nfreedoms that are the hallmark of this country.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today, on this somber occasion, \nto remember and honor the thousands of lives that were lost one year \nago today in the tragic terrorist attacks on our Nation. The United \nStates will never forget the horrific events that occurred on what \nbegan as a peaceful morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001. The \ntranquility of that morning was shattered by the evil acts of \nterrorists, filled with hatred for our Nation and opposed to the ideals \nwe treasure. With their terror, our Nation was plunged into one of the \ndarkest days of our history as thousands of Americans lost mothers and \nfathers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, friends and \nassociates.\n  However, during this tragedy, the American spirit shined through that \ndarkness and continues today, as a beacon to the world. It is that \nspirit, the willingness to expend the last full\n\n[[Page S8502]]\n\nmeasure of one's life in service to others, that is the strength of our \nNation. It is a power that grows as we are challenged. It is a force \nwhich has helped this Nation through difficult times and will see us \nthrough these times as well.\n  On that dreadful day, the terrorists failed miserably in their \nattempt to weaken our Nation. Their goal was destined for failure, for \nAmerica has faced adversity numeorus times before and has always \nemerged stronger. The acts of heroism and charity by Americans in New \nYork City, at the Pentagon, over the skies of Pennsylvania, here in \nWashington and across the Nation were extraordinary but not surprising.\n  Today, I also honor the men and women of our Armed Forces. They serve \naround the world defending the freedoms we enjoy and securing the \nliberty we cherish. I have stated many times that the highest \nobligation of American citizenship is to defend this country in time of \nneed. Our citizens have accepted that obligation, some giving their \nall. Whether serving abroad or at home, the men and women in uniform \nare performing in an outstanding manner and deserve the appreciation \nand respect of all Americans.\n  History will not forget the events of this day. Likewise, we must \nnever forget the thousands of Americans to whom we pay tribute today.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, anniversaries are a time for reflection, \nand I wanted to take a few moments to share what emotions this North \nDakotan is experiencing.\n  First, I feel sorrow, I feel sorrow for the thousands of innocent \nvictims and the scores and scores of families and friends most directly \nand tragically affected. Those murdered were fathers and brothers, \ndaughters and spouses; they were coworkers earning a living and \nsupporting their families; they were best men in weddings, and mothers \nflying home to see their children.\n  They were also honorable Americans, as well as citizens from 86 \ncountries around the world. The victims included North Dakotan Ann \nNelson. Ann was the kind of daughter every parent wishes for, she was \nintelligent, caring, adventurous, and had a real zest for life. Ann was \nsimply doing her job that day in the World Trade Center. Ann, the pride \nand joy of Stanley, ND, didn't make it home from work that fateful day.\n  When I think about Ann and her family and the other victims and their \nloved ones, I also feel anger. One of my home State newspapers, the \nGrand Forks Herald put it best, ``Americans should accept that at the \ncore of their grief is a white-hot fury and a sense of being \noutrageously wronged. . . . The World Trade Center didn't collapse in a \nstrong wind. The Pentagon didn't fall into a sinkhole from an abandoned \nmine, and United Flight 93 didn't crash in a Pennsylvania field because \nit ran out of gas. No, those things happened because a band of \nterrorist fanatics slit the pilots' throats and then flew the planes, \npassengers and all, into the buildings for the mad glory of killing \ninfidels by the score.''\n  This North Dakotan's anger and sorrow also fuels my resolve. I feel \nresolve to continue working with members from both sides of the aisle \nand with our President to make sure we are doing everything in our \npower to protect North Dakotans and all Americans.\n  Over the past year, we have enacted vital anti-terrorism legislation, \nincluding provisions I authored to shore up our visa and border \nsecurity laws. And while we have paid more attention to the challenges \nof protecting our 4,000 mile northern border from terrorist \ninfiltration, I continue in my resolve to focus the necessary attention \nand resources to get the job done right.\n  So, I feel sorrow, anger, and resolve, but I also feel pride, pride \nin how our heroes performed that day in response to the attacks; pride \nin our police officers and firemen; pride in those risking their lives \nto save coworkers; and pride in members of Flight 93 who lost their \nlives to save countless others.\n  I also feel pride at North Dakota's own, the Happy Hooligans, who \nminutes after the terrorist attacks took to the skies over Washington, \nprotecting our Nation's Capital at this most critical time.\n  I feel pride at the men and women in uniform, who have served and \ncontinue to serve in Afghanistan and across the world, with the \nunfailing twin goals of eradicating global terrorism and protecting \ntheir fellow citizens. I feel pride in the dedication of those \nreservists who have put their lives on hold to serve our country.\n  I also feel pride in our country, and it is certainly appropriate \nthat Congress and the President agreed to designate September 11 as \n``Patriot Day.'' September 11 brought out the best in our fellow \ncitizens and showed us again why we are all so fortunate to be a part \nof the greatest Nation on earth. Rather than the disillusionment that \nthe terrorists hoped for, our country responded with renewed \npatriotism.\n  And finally, on this first anniversary of one of the darkest days in \nour country's history, this North Dakotan feels optimism. In times of \nchallenge, moments of great opportunity also present themselves. In \nthis instance, we stand at a critical time in our Nation's and the \nworld's history, and the decisions we now make will influence the shape \nof our world in the 21st century and beyond.\n  Will we live in a world of freedom or fear? Will democracy reign or \nwill fanaticism retain its lure? Will our country try to build a wall \naround ourselves or will we continue to be a beacon of freedom, \ndemocracy, and tolerance around the world?\n  Some fifth grade North Dakota students are planning to commemorate \nthe September 11 attacks by planting trees at the International Peace \nGarden, just north of Dunseith, ND. The name of the program is ``Seeds \nof Peace.'' I have the optimism to believe that this is the perfect \nsymbol to commemorate the first September 11 anniversary.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I am here on this day of \nremembrance to express on behalf of the National Funeral Directors \nAssociation and all Nebraskans our heartfelt sorrow for those who lost \ntheir loved ones on September 11, 2001. We Americans can be proud to \ndeclare the continued strength of our Union one year after this \nhorrific act.\n  The United States of America continues to stand as a beacon of \nfreedom and opportunity for everyone, regardless of race, creed, or \nreligious belief.\n  The United States of America was founded on the fundamental principle \nthat all citizens have the inalienable right of life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness and the vitality of the United States of America \nis in the diversity of ideas, the freedom to express those ideas, and \nthe opportunity to achieve one's potential and direct one's destiny.\n  These principles are absolute and will not be surrendered or weakened \nby the cowardly acts of terrorists who are afraid of the sunshine of \nfreedom and the responsibility it brings.\n  On this day we must continue our unity, which reaffirms the \nprinciples for which this country was founded and that on this day \nfreedom shall ring from every community in this great land and the \nvoice of America will be heard around the world.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, we will always remember where we were \non this day, 1 year ago. As on other moments of tragedy in American \nhistory, September 11 will forever be in our hearts and mind. For those \nwho were lost, for those who gave of themselves to save others. On that \nday, we were all one. We were all Americans.\n  When we reflect upon a tragedy such as this, there are many who come \ninto our minds. We reflect upon the honored dead who we remember today, \nincluding the friends and family we lost. We think of our loved ones \nwho are still with us today. We remember all of the firefighters, \npolice and ordinary citizens who risked their lives to save people they \noften did not even know. We reflect upon the members of our armed \nforces who diligently work to protect us from any future tragedy.\n  On this solemn occasion, I would like to take a brief moment to \nrecognize the efforts of the members of the AFL-CIO on September 11 and \nits aftermath. Indeed, there were few others as affected by September \n11 than the labor community. The firefighters and police who bravely \nsacrificed and risked their lives were union members. The laborers, \nironworkers, and operating engineers who helped dig for survivors while \nthe fires still burned were union members. The nurses, doctors and EMTs \nwho cared for the injured and\n\n[[Page S8503]]\n\ndying were union members. Those who manned the ferries and fireboats \nthat transported both the survivors and the bodies of the victims \nacross the harbor were union members. Their efforts greatly affected \nthe lives of many.\n  In the aftermath, unions across America started up blood drives and \nthe AFL-CIO Union Community Fund along with dozens of local and \ninternational unions raised relief funds for the families and children \nwho have been left behind.\n  On this day of solemn remembrance, I want to recognize all of the \nsacrifices of these valiant men and women. Their response to this \ntragedy was truly heroic.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today we remember the terrible events of \nSeptember 11. A year has passed but for those who lost loved ones or \nsustained serious injuries in the terrorist attacks on the World Trade \nCenter or at the Pentagon, the pain is still fresh and the loss is \nstill palpable. Losing a loved one is always difficult but to \nexperience loss as a result of a senseless act of terror can only \ncompound the pain.\n  For Americans in general, the sheer number of lives lost on September \n11 was a national tragedy. Those of us who did not lose friends and \nfamily also experienced loss on September 11, albeit a loss of a \ndifferent kind.\n  On September 11, we lost our sense of personal safety. The idea that \nterrorism could strike Americans going about their business, working in \ntheir offices or taking a simple plane ride for business or pleasure, \nhas changed us forever. Travel by air will never be the same post-\nSeptember 11. And on a less tangible level, we are now cognizant that \nin a free society like ours terrorists cannot truly be contained. The \nthreat of terrorism may subside but it will never disappear.\n  On September 11, we lost our sense of trust. We have become more \nsuspicious of those who want to enter our country. The Federal \nofficials who protect our borders and control access to our country \ncontinue on heightened alert, on the lookout for aspiring terrorists. \nOur first responders, our local police and fire officers, have been \ntasked to survey our towns with a new eye and have entrusted all of us \nwith the unsettling job of reporting suspicious activity in our \nneighborhoods.\n  Most of all, on September 11, we lost our sense of national security. \nThe attacks of September 11 brought with them the realization that our \nrobust defenses, the biggest and best in the world, cannot protect us \nfrom terrorists. Our sophisticated planes, submarines, and missiles \ncannot deter a terrorist attack, and cannot protect us from the \nunconventional attacks we now know the al-Qaida terrorists were \ncontemplating .\n  Today, however, is not just a day to reflect on loss. Just as the \nstories of those who experienced personal loss on September 11 have \nevolved into stories of determination to carry on, our losses are \ntempered by resolve.\n  We are resolved to uproot the terror cells which may now be lurking \nin as many as 60 countries, waiting for us to let down our guard so \nthey can attack us at home or abroad. Working with our allies around \nthe world we are determined to disrupt these cells by stopping their \nfunding and prosecuting their members. We will also remain vigilant. To \nthe best of our abilities, we will take all precautions to deny these \nterrorists the opportunity to strike again.\n  We are resolved not to succumb to hate and to stereotyping of those \nwho share ethnic or religious backgrounds with the terrorists. One of \nthe biggest fears after September 11 was that there would be a backlash \nin this country against those of Middle Eastern descent or against \nadherents of Islam.\n  While there were reports of hate crimes, many Americans reached out \nto their Muslim or Middle Eastern neighbors to reassure them--whether \nthey were American citizens or just residents that they should not feel \nat risk. While the heinous acts of September 11 elicited many emotions, \nI was proud that most Americans recognized that taking our revenge \nagainst those who had nothing to do with Osama bin Laden would have \nsunk us to the level of the terrorists themselves.\n  The threat of terrorism does have the potential to change the \ncharacter of our nation. Just as we are vigilant about our physical \nsecurity, we are resolved not to let terrorism curtail our freedoms. We \nmust not allow the war on terror to infringe on the rights and \nliberties we hold dear. Terrorism will not go away, but it will have \nsucceeded if we use it as an excuse to trample on the Constitution. The \nwonderful outpouring of patriotism which occurred this past year was \nnot just an expression of national unity, it was a strong statement \nthat we cannot and will not allow terrorism to undermine our democratic \nway of life.\n  In the days after September 11, many Americans wondered how we would \ncarry on. And yet we have carried on. We have danced at weddings, \nrejoiced in new babies, and it is the brave family members of those who \nperished on September 11 who have led the way: the mothers who gave \nbirth without the presence of their husbands and the brides who walked \ndown the aisle without their fathers. This has been a difficult year, a \nyear of inconceivable loss, but a year which has been marked by resolve \nand a rededication to the ideals and principles upon which our Nation \nwas founded.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know Senator Jeffords and Senator Grassley \nare here. We are going to go out before 4 p.m. today, the reason being \nwe have services for the Senate family, but that gives adequate time \nfor everyone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today on this 1 year anniversary \nof September 11 to join my colleagues, as well as the rest of the \ncountry, in a day of reflection and remembrance. It is often said that \ntime heals all wounds. Obviously, it is going to take an eternity for \nthe grief to subside for the families of the 3,000 people mass-murdered \nlast year, with the mental image of commercial jetliners searing into \nthe national landmarks remaining fresh in our mind. If they do not, we \nare reminded of it by watching TV this very day and maybe all week.\n  Such horrific acts that happened a year ago today seemed impossible \nat that time. But, of course, all that has changed. Now it is hard to \nunderstand how such hate and extreme acts of horror against humanity \ncan take place. While the Federal Government is working to beef up the \nmilitary to protect our borders and to improve its intelligence \ngathering, it is virtually impossible to guarantee a risk-free \nenvironment in a free and open society that we proudly claim as \nAmerica.\n  One year after the attacks, I am not so sure the American people \nreally remember that we are in a war on terrorism. But the fact is, we \nare, and we will be for some time to come. I pray that we do not end up \nwith a situation in the Middle East that we see too often on television \nwhere there are random suicide bombings. The risk exists and Americans \nare not realistic if they do not think of those things happening here \nlike they might happen in Jerusalem. Terrorism has changed our way of \nlife. We might be complacent about it and not want to realize it, but \nit is here. And every one of us, then, has a responsibility to remain \nvigilant.\n  The 1-year anniversary of September 11 is an important reminder that \nthe war against terror has not yet be won. Considering the loss of \nhuman life, imminent terrorist threats to our security, and even our \nailing economy, it is not easy to look for the silver lining on the 1-\nyear anniversary of the September 11 attacks. But remember what the \nPresident said in the week after those attacks: The terrorists \nsucceeded in tearing down bricks and mortar, but they failed to rock \nthe foundation that has kept America strong.\n  A year later, America's resilience can be seen from sea to shining \nsea.\n  September 11, 2001, ushered in a new era. Notions of invincibility \nhave been shattered. But the uncommon courage of first responders \ncalled to duty on that day reflects the steadfast spirit of our great \nNation and our people called Americans. Our resolve to pull together \nand to stand united against evil immediately resurrected the principles \non which this country was founded some 226 years ago. Despite the \nattacks, attacks defined to pit fear against freedom, the United States \nof America is yet stronger than ever.\n  Like the rest of the country, lawmakers in Washington, DC, dropped \npartisan pretense, worked quickly to assist survivors, backed recovery \nefforts, ensured the safety of the flying\n\n[[Page S8504]]\n\npublic, and got the economy rolling again. The 107th Congress threw its \nsupport behind the President to root out the terrorist networks \nresponsible for the attacks, realizing the war in Afghanistan is \nprobably only one of many battles to be fought and hopefully won.\n  Thanks to courageous service men and women, the al-Qaida network has \nbeen largely dismantled from its base in Afghanistan but not elsewhere. \nThat evil continues to lurk in other regions of our world. And with the \nsecurity of the American people first and foremost in our mind, the \nPresident has worked to leave no stone unturned. That includes creating \na new Cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security and keeping Iraqi \ndictator Saddam Hussein from unleashing weapons of mass destruction \nagainst the United States or other places within our world.\n  The President needs to make the case to the American people, to \nCongress, and our allies abroad, and he will do that hopefully within \n48 hours, and do it in a way that says freedom and peace will remain at \nrisk, as he explains it, until rogue dictators and others who harbor \nterrorists and finance their evil acts are no longer able to do those \nthings.\n  This month, the Senate is debating the proposal to realign the \nFederal Government's infrastructure and operations charged with \nthwarting acts of terrorism. I am working to make sure the new \nDepartment helps to solve the shortcomings exposed by September 11 and \nnot create new ones.\n  Many recall the patriotism displayed by native Iowan Coleen Rowley, \nwho blew the whistle on bureaucratic bungling at the FBI. I will work \nin this bill to see that new Department employees are guaranteed strong \nwhistleblower protections and to strengthen accountability within the \nintelligence community. These protections for whistleblowers are very \nimportant to make sure our intelligence community and the homeland \nsecurity is working for the good of the American people and to see the \nstatutory requirements are carried out.\n  When the Department of Homeland Security bill is up, I will make sure \nthat hard-working taxpayers' money is not wasted with this new Federal \nagency.\n  One year later, after September 11, life goes on in America. It is \nnot the same as it was a year ago. Life is not as secure or risk free \nas we once thought it was--and maybe we should not have thought that it \nwas, but we did. Air travelers deal with tightened security measures at \nthe Nation's airports. People are staying closer to home, flying less. \nOrdinary Americans and law enforcement officials do not hesitate to \nreport suspicious activity. For many, it has enhanced common courtesies \nand boosted greater appreciation for the simpler things of life.\n  Iowans deserve a lot of credit for their outpouring of support in the \nlast year. From a remarkable quilt-making project for the victims, \nparticularly in New York City, to generous charitable cash donations, \nand to those serving in our military, Iowans are proud, compassionate \nAmericans. Many agree that the tragedy a year ago has renewed a sense \nof civic duty, patriotism, and appreciation for the U.S. military. \nThere is a spirit of all-for-one and one-for-all, as we wear, display, \nand decorate with all things red, white, and blue.\n  With this 1-year anniversary, I join my colleagues in reflection and \nremembrance. While we go about our daily business, we can consider the \ntragic loss in human life and the acts of heroism by brave defenders. \nIn the weeks and years ahead, we can continue to work for the \nbetterment of our communities. We can donate blood, pray for the \nvictims and their families, support emergency workers, and give thanks \nfor the precious freedoms we enjoy every day.\n  We cannot erase the sorrow and suffering brought by September 11, but \nwith our actions each one of us can make America stronger.\n  I remember this day especially Miss Kincade, from Waverly, IA, who \nwas on the plane that hit the Pentagon. She was an intern in my office \nin 1984.\n  I remember Mr. Edward V. Rowenhorst, whom I did not know but I know \nhis brother who goes to my church in Cedar Falls, IA. He was in the \nPentagon working.\n  I remember traveling to a ceremony last Veterans Day in Anamosa, IA, \nwhere they honored one of their own who was also killed in the Pentagon \n1 year ago today.\n  So Iowans, as most people in most States, have victims to remember. I \nremember them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today we as a nation commemorate a most \nunfortunate milestone, the 1-year anniversary of the tragic attack of \nSeptember 11, a day that will sadly live in infamy. Since that time, \nmuch has been said and written about the terrible events of that day.\n  As we reflect on the events of the past year, I would like to commend \nthe thousands of rescue workers, volunteers, and countless others who \nhelped rebuild our Nation in the months following the attacks. In \nparticular, I would like to especially commend the work of the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, fondly known as FEMA.\n  To give some background, on August 15, 2001, I became chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over \nFEMA. A short month later, terrorists attacked the Pentagon and the \nWorld Trade Center. Later that day, following the attacks, I visited \nthe Pentagon. I was amazed that literally overnight FEMA had \nestablished a well-coordinated Federal response at the Pentagon. \nVirginia, Maryland, and other first responders came--from as far away \nas Nebraska. As soon as possible, they were all working, as coordinated \nas I have ever seen.\n  As soon as possible after that, I traveled to the World Trade \nCenter--again to take a look at FEMA's response. Again, I was \noverwhelmed by the organizational capacity of FEMA and the fine work \nbeing done by that agency's men and women, under the guidance of FEMA \nDirector Joe Allbaugh. There, on the piers of Manhattan, FEMA had \nquickly created a disaster field office that was a small city unto \nitself. Thousands of workers from around the country came together to \nbring calm and order to an otherwise chaotic situation.\n  Visiting the Pentagon this morning brought back a flood of memories \nfor me about my own visits to the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. \nJust days after those attacks, I vividly remember the sights and sounds \nand smells. The devastation I witnessed was incredible, and difficult \nto put into words. Thousands of people lost their lives due to the \ncruel and cunning acts of evil perpetrated by a few. The victims of \nthese attacks were men, women, and children, people with well-laid \nplans for their pleasant futures.\n  Although I left both the Pentagon and the World Trade Center with a \nheavy heart, I also left with a profound sense of gratitude for the \ngallant efforts of these rescuers and volunteers who tirelessly, and \nmostly anonymously, worked in places reserved only for the Ground Zero \nheroes.\n  In the year following the attacks, I have spoken with many people, \nVermonters and others, about the attack. We have all expressed profound \nsadness for our Nation's great loss. They have also left me with the \nconfidence that freedom will prevail, that good will triumph over evil, \nthat these horrible attacks cannot break our resolve to stand together \nas free Americans.\n  Abraham Lincoln once said:\n\n       Freedom is the last best hope of Earth.\n  Time is a great healer. The passage of time has brought thoughtful \nrecollection. The passage of time has not dulled my recollection of \nwhat I saw and felt in those days following September 11. For me, this \nhealing process has brought a renewed commitment to move forward with \nthe hope that freedom prevails.\n  In closing, I would also like to pay tribute to the work of the \nVermont Air and National Guard, which did an outstanding job of \nprotecting our skies and our borders and our airports in the days after \nSeptember 11. When our Nation was most in need, we pulled together \nsuccessfully to bring this Nation into a position where it feels secure \nand with hope for the future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S8505]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here today to thank Gary \nChenett, Diane Rey, and John Schniedermeier. They are responsible for \nawarding The Silver Rose to our veterans in Nebraska. The Order of The \nSilver Rose was established in 1997 by Mary Elizabeth Marchand. Her \nfather, Chief Hospital Corpsman Frank Davis, died from illnesses \nresulting from the use of Agent Orange in the Vietnam War. He was a \ncombat veteran; however, he was not wounded in combat, but was exposed \nto a dangerous substance while fighting for his country that took his \nlife many years later.\n  The Department of Defense has determined that Chief Davis and many \nlike him do not qualify for The Purple Heart. It is the mission of The \nOrder of The Silver Rose organization to recognize the courage, \nheroism, and contributions of American service personnel found to have \nbeen exposed to Agent Orange in a combat zone. I am sure that as time \npasses, they will expand their focus to members who have died from \nother conflicts.\n  The Order of The Silver Rose gives many veterans the satisfaction \nthat they are being recognized for giving their Nation the ultimate \nsacrifice. There are thousands of veterans who served this country \nfaithfully and now find themselves in poor health, some fatal health, \ndirectly due to being exposed to harmful substances during war.\n  Gary Chenett, Diane Rey, and John Schniedermeier have awarded eleven \nNebraskans with The Silver Rose, I would like to honor them today, they \nare: Raymond D. Todorovich of Omaha; Edgar Fleherty of Omaha; Randy E. \nHolke of Fremont; John Schniedermeier of Omaha; Ronald R. Charles of \nOmaha; Terry H. Greenwell of Omaha; David C. Smith of Firth; Joseph E. \nStillwell of Omaha; Roy R. Rogers of Fremont; Albert W. Kowalski of \nOmaha; Gilbert J. Styskal, Jr. of Omaha.\n  On behalf of Nebraska, I thank these brave patriots for their \nsacrifices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/11/senate-section/article/S8505-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 2, \n2002 in Shelton, CT. A 42 year old gay man was beaten at a Labor Day \nparty. The three attackers made derogatory remarks about the victim's \nsexual orientation and then assaulted him, breaking his facial bones \nand ribs. Police are investigating the incident as a hate crime.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/11/senate-section/article/S8505-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2810.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nreceives from the House H. Con. Res. 464, a concurrent resolution \nregarding the anniversary of the terrorist attack, the preamble and the \nconcurrent resolution be agreed to; that any statements thereon be \nprinted in the Record; and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, provided that it is identical to the resolution that I ask be \nprinted in the Record following the granting of this request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (H. Con. Res. 464), with its preamble, reads as \nfollows:\n\n                            H. Con. Res. 464\n\n       Whereas on September 11, 2001, while Americans were \n     attending to their daily routines, terrorists hijacked and \n     destroyed four civilian aircraft, crashing two of them into \n     the towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, and a \n     third into the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C.;\n       Whereas the valor of the passengers and crew on the fourth \n     aircraft prevented it from also being used as a weapon \n     against America;\n       Whereas thousands of innocent Americans were killed and \n     injured as a result of these attacks, including the \n     passengers and crew of the four aircraft, workers in the \n     World Trade Center and in the Pentagon, rescue workers, and \n     bystanders, making these attacks the deadliest terrorist \n     attacks ever launched against the United States;\n       Whereas when the gravest moments came, many regular \n     Americans, relying on courage, instinct, and grace, rushed \n     toward the flaming buildings in order to rescue or toward \n     terrorist-controlled cockpits in order to resist;\n       Whereas by targeting symbols of American strength and \n     success, these attacks clearly were intended to assail the \n     principles, values, and freedoms of the United States and the \n     American people, intimidate the Nation, and weaken the \n     national resolve;\n       Whereas while the States of New York, Virginia, and \n     Pennsylvania bore the brunt of the terrorist attacks, every \n     State and Territory and all Americans were affected and \n     mourned these tragic losses;\n       Whereas Americans reached out to help strangers who had \n     lost loved ones, colleagues, and their businesses;\n       Whereas local, State, and Federal leaders set aside \n     differences and worked together to provide for those who were \n     attacked and to protect those who remained;\n       Whereas Americans continue to repair damage to buildings \n     and the economy, while relishing the freedoms they enjoy as \n     Americans;\n       Whereas on September 14, 2001, in Public Law 107-40, \n     Congress authorized the use of ``all necessary and \n     appropriate force'' against those responsible for the \n     terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas the United States Armed Forces subsequently moved \n     swiftly against Al Qaeda and the Taliban regime in \n     Afghanistan, whom the President and Congress had identified \n     as enemies of America;\n       Whereas, in so doing, brave servicemen and women left \n     family and friends in order to defend the Nation;\n       Whereas a year later, many servicemen and women remain \n     abroad, shielding the Nation from further terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas, while the passage of a year has not softened the \n     memory of the American people, resolved their grief, or \n     restored lost loved ones, it has shown that Americans will \n     not bow to terrorists;\n       Whereas the Congress has passed, and the President has \n     signed, numerous laws providing additional resources for the \n     overseas effort against terrorism, as well as additional \n     tools for Federal, State, and local law enforcement and \n     judicial systems to protect Americans at home; and\n       Whereas the Government reexamined the need for domestic \n     security and the Congress is currently considering \n     legislation to create a Department of Homeland Security with \n     the specific mission of preventing further attacks.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, what we saw happen to our country 1 year \nago today will be forever etched in our memories. Several of our \ncolleagues have taken time here on the floor today to reflect on that \nhorrible day.\n  Though our Nation was wounded deeply that day, we learned a great \ndeal about ourselves--and that has made our country stronger. The \ncourage of the first responders, the valor of the passengers on flight \n93, the strength of the families of the victims, the character of our \narmed forces, and the generosity of Americans from each and every State \nin the Union have shown to terrorists, and to the world, that America \nis strong and will not bow to terror.\n  H. Con. Res. 464 is a small tribute to each of these heroes. It \nspells out, in broad bipartisan fashion, Congress's memory for lost \nloved ones, our deep admiration for the families of these innocent \nvictims, our respect for the work of our first responders and armed \nforces, and our resolve to find and bring to justice those responsible \nfor the attacks.\n  That resolve was made clear on September 14, 2001, when we \noverwhelmingly passed S.J. Res. 23. In that resolution, we granted the \nPresident the authority to pursue the nations, people or organizations \nwho perpetrated the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United \nStates in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism \nagainst the United States by such nations, people, or organizations.\n  With today's resolution, we look back at the horror and the hope we \nsaw on a day we will never forget. There may come a day when we must \nagain look ahead to threats to our Nation that lie on or beyond the \nhorizon. I am confident that when that time comes, Congress will again \nact in a bipartisan fashion to take the steps needed to keep America \nstrong, and Americans safe.\n  But today, as we walk the path from remembrance to recovery, this \nresolution says what we all know in our hearts: We will never forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/11/senate-section/article/S8507-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 2002\n\n  Mr. REID.
