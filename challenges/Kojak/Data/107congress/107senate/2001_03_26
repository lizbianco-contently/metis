Here in the Senate, where debate over issues is \nthe order of the day, it is a temptation to think of those with whom we \ndisagree as adversaries, sometimes as political enemies. The very \npeople who may need our prayers sometimes are neglected in our \nintercessory prayers because of their position on our cherished \nproposals.

Madam President, I thank my outstanding colleague from \nWest Virginia, Senator Byrd.\n  I rise today to discuss a matter of great importance to this body and \nI believe to the country that has to do with the formulation of a \nbudget for the United States for the coming year.\n  Last week, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee told me he \ndoes not intend to hold a markup in the Budget Committee to craft a \nbudget resolution for this year.\n  All of the Democrats on the Budget Committee have written the \nchairman asking him to hold a markup. Today I again publicly ask the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee to allow the Budget Committee \nto do its work. Never in our history have we failed to have the Budget \nCommittee write a budget resolution for the country--never. There is no \nreason not to try this year.\n  I understand we have an unusual circumstance because the Budget \nCommittee is divided equally between Democrats and Republicans. That \nhas never happened before either. I do not think any of us can know \nwhat would happen if we met as a committee, if we debated, deliberated, \nand voted; it is amazing what can happen when we listen to each other.\n  I just had the experience of the staff of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, the staff of the chairman, totally misrepresenting the plan \nI have proposed--totally misrepresenting it. It is clear to me they are \nnot doing that on purpose because I know they are people of good will \nand they are honest people. I know that. I know they are not \nmisrepresenting it willfully. They are misrepresenting it because they \ndo not understand it. They are misrepresenting it because we have not \nhad a full chance to hear each other. That is why we have committees. \nThat is why we have held hearing after hearing on the questions of how \nshould we craft a budget for the country for the coming year. That is \nprecisely what the Budget Committee has done.\n\n  The result is there is no group of Senators that has spent more time \nanalyzing what the budget should be. There is no group of Senators that \nhas more fully considered the question of the revenue base, the \nquestion of what the spending ought to look like going forward, what we \nought to do in terms of paying down national debt.\n\n[[Page S2836]]\n\n  I think it would be a profound mistake for us to miss the chance to \nhave the Budget Committee do what it was designed to do, which is to \nmake the work of the larger body easier because of the concentration of \neffort of the members of the committee on the responsibility they have.\n  As I sat last week and heard my colleagues on the other side taking \nmy budget proposal and completely misrepresenting it, I realized even \nmore clearly why it is essential that we have a markup in the Budget \nCommittee because that is one place where 22 Senators can sit across \nthe table from each other and debate, discuss, explain, and vote.\n  If we just come out here on the floor, it is going to be chaos. \nTrying to write a budget for the United States out here on the floor of \nthe Senate will be utterly chaotic. It is not the responsible thing to \ndo.\n  The chairman says we are deadlocked. How do we know? We have never \ntried. We have never debated, discussed, or voted. That is the role of \na committee. I do not think anybody can say where it would end.\n  Last week our colleagues were saying that my plan has more debt \nreduction in it than there is debt available to be retired. That is \njust not the case. The plan I have offered saves every penny of the \nSocial Security surplus for Social Security. It saves every penny of \nthe Medicare surplus for Medicare. That is a principle I think most \npeople would endorse. We ought not raid the trust funds.\n  Then with what is left, my plan takes a third for a tax cut--$900 \nbillion--takes a third for high-priority domestic needs, such as \nimproving education, providing a prescription drug benefit, \nstrengthening national defense, dealing with the agricultural crisis, \nand then with the final third, it starts to address our long-term \nproblem with the retirement of the baby boom generation by dealing with \nour long-term debt, the debt that is going to face us when the baby \nboomers start to retire and the requirements and the liabilities of \nSocial Security and Medicare escalate dramatically.\n  What my friends on the other side of the aisle have done is to take \nthe money we have set aside for Social Security and Medicare and say \nthat since that money is not needed immediately, all of that will go \nfor paying down the publicly held debt. And that is the case. That is \nexactly how the President's plan works with respect to the $2 trillion \nof publicly held debt he wants to pay down. He is getting that money \nfrom the Social Security trust fund because that money is not needed \nright now. So all of that money is available to pay down the publicly \nheld debt.\n  That is the way my plan functions in part as well, although I set \naside all of the Social Security trust fund and all of the Medicare \ntrust fund. The President sets aside just part of the Social Security \ntrust fund and none of the Medicare trust fund. The total for paydown \nof the publicly held debt under my plan is $2.9 trillion.\n  We just had testimony from the man who managed the very successful \ndebt buydown program under the Clinton administration, Mr. Gary \nGensler, that there is that much debt available to pay off. And in \nfact, it is very clear there is that amount of debt to pay off because \njust in terms of debt that is maturing in this next 10-year period, \nthere is $2.6 trillion. The President's people have said they can only \npay off $2 trillion. It is just not true. I don't know a nicer way to \nsay it. It is just not true. There is $2.6 trillion that matures during \nthis 10-year period alone. Clearly, you can pay all that. We have done \na detailed cashflow analysis, saving all the Social Security trust \nfund, all the Medicare trust fund.\n  People have said, well, you have a cash buildup problem in the \nFederal coffers if you reserve all of the money for Social Security and \nMedicare. It is just not true. We have done a detailed year-by-year \ncashflow analysis, and it shows very clearly there is absolutely no \ncash buildup problem until the year 2010. And who knows, there may not \nbe a cash buildup problem then because we are all operating off a 10-\nyear forecast--a 10-year forecast--that the forecasting agencies say \nthemselves there is only a 10-percent chance it will come true. That is \nthe forecasting agencies, the people who made the projection, saying to \nus: We want to alert you; there is only a 10-percent chance this \nprojection is going to come true; there is a 45-percent chance there \nwill be more money; there is a 45-percent chance there will be less \nmoney.\n  How would you bet, based on what has happened in the last 6 weeks \nwith the national economy? Do you think that forecast which was made 8 \nweeks ago is going to be on the high side or the low side? I know where \nI would be betting. I certainly would not be betting the farm that that \nnumber is going to come true.\n  That is unwise. There is not a company in America that would decide \nto make 10-year commitments of all its nontrust fund money--all of it--\nbased on a forecast, a forecast that has only a 10-percent chance of \ncoming true. It is just not wise. It is not prudent. It is certainly \nnot conservative.\n  After my plan sets aside all of the Social Security surplus and all \nof the Medicare surplus, as I said, it then divides the rest in equal \nthirds--a third for a tax cut, a third for high-priority domestic \nneeds, and a third for our long-term debt. That is where the confusion \nhas come from with the other side. They think anything that has to do \nwith debt must be the publicly held debt. Thus, they are taking the \nmoney I have set aside for Social Security and Medicare, which will go \nto paying down publicly held debt because that money is not needed for \nthe other purpose at the present time, and adding it to the $900 \nbillion we have set aside in our plan to deal with long-term debt. They \nhave assumed that means we are trying to pay off $3.8 trillion of \npublicly held debt.\n  It is just not the case. It is not what the plan does, not what the \nplan says, and obviously we know there is only $3.4 trillion of \npublicly held debt that is currently on the books of the United States. \nWe are not trying to pay off debt we do not have; we are trying to pay \noff debt we do have. We do have $3.4 trillion of debt today, publicly \nheld debt. That is not the only debt we have because in addition to \nthat, we have the gross debt. The gross debt of the United States as we \nsit here today is $5.6 trillion. And at the end of this 10-year period, \nif we follow the President's plan, it will be $7.1 trillion. Gross debt \nis going up as the publicly held debt comes down.\n\n  How can that be? That can be because what is happening here is a \ntransfer. As the publicly held debt gets paid down, it is getting paid \ndown under the President's plan and any other plan by the surpluses of \nthe Social Security trust fund. And guess what happens. That money from \nthe Social Security trust fund--under the President's plan, $2 trillion \nof it--is being used to pay down publicly held debt. So the Social \nSecurity trust fund has money in surplus at the present time. Part of \nthat money is being used to pay down the publicly held debt. Guess what \nhappens. The general fund of the United States that is receiving that \nmoney to pay down debt now has an IOU to the Social Security trust fund \nfor the same amount. It is similar to taking one credit card and paying \noff your other credit cards and thinking you are debt free. We are not \ndebt free. The gross debt of the United States is growing.\n  What my plan intends to do is not only address that short-term debt, \nthe publicly held debt, and pay that down, but also to address our \nlong-term debt crisis that is going to get much worse--not because of \nprojections, not because of the forecasts, but because of what we all \nknow is true: The baby boomers have been born, they are living, and \nthey are going to retire. That process starts right beyond this 10-year \nperiod when we are all talking about these big surpluses. If we really \nhonestly account for things, if we do it the way any company accounts \nfor things, we do not have a surplus.\n  All this talk about surpluses. Well, I hate to rain on the parade, \nbut there really is no surplus. If we were really being straight in the \naccounting systems, we would find we do not have a surplus because we \nhave these long-term liabilities that we do not account for in the \nFederal system, and they are real; they are here to stay. We can just \nkind of forget about them and wish them away or put them off until \ntomorrow, but the hard reality is they are there, and they are growing. \nDuring this period when we are all talking about surpluses and we are \nall talking about paying down the debt, the gross debt of the United \nStates is actually growing--$5.6 trillion today. It is going to be $7.1 \ntrillion at the end of this 10-year period. Those are not Kent Conrad's \nnumbers; those are the numbers that are right in the President's\n\n[[Page S2837]]\n\nbook he sent us, the budget blueprint. It says very clearly that gross \nnational debt is growing.\n\n  The distinction between this publicly held debt and gross debt is the \nfollowing: The publicly held debt is held outside government hands. The \neconomists argue that is where you should pay attention because it is \nthat debt of government which is competition with other debt. That is \ndebt that is in the public marketplace. That is debt that has to be \nfinanced by somebody. That is the debt that is in competition with \nother, private sector players who are seeking to finance what they do--\nwhether it is build a building, build an Internet highway, or build new \nhousing. That is why economists say: Pay attention to the publicly held \ndebt.\n  It is also true that this other debt, the gross debt of the United \nStates, has exactly the same legal claim on our government as the \npublicly held debt. Just because the Social Security Administration \nholds the bonds and says, Federal Government, you have to pay us back, \nthat is no different than a German bondholder, holding that bond, \nsaying, we want to be paid back. Both of them constitute legal claims \nagainst this government. Both of them require our attention. So far the \nPresident only talks about the publicly held debt. He says he is paying \noff as much of it as can be done. We disagree on that point. We think \nwe can pay off much more of the publicly held debt than he asserts. We \nthink the hearing before the Budget Committee last week demonstrated \nthat quite clearly, that there is more publicly held debt to be paid \noff than the President asserts.\n  The much larger point is the President is not addressing this long-\nterm debt, this gross debt that is growing every day. He is doing \nnothing in terms of setting aside money to deal with that long-term \ndebt.\n  That is why the plan I have proposed uses 70 percent of these \nprojected surpluses--70 percent--for debt, both short term and long \nterm. The President's proposal reserves about 35 percent of these \nprojected surpluses for debt. The plan that I have proposed on behalf \nof Democrats pays down about twice as much debt as the President's \nplan. He has a much bigger tax cut; we have a much smaller tax cut. Our \ntax cut is about half as big as his because we are paying down twice as \nmuch debt. That is the biggest difference.\n  There are also some differences in spending, although they are more \nmodest differences than the difference between what we are doing on the \ndebt and what he is doing with respect to tax cuts. The big difference \nis, we are more aggressive at paying down debt; he is more aggressive \nwith the tax cut. He says it is the people's money. He is exactly \nright; it is the people's money, but it is also the people's debt. \nDon't make a mistake about this. We are the ones who are going to have \nto pay this debt. It is the people's Social Security and it is the \npeople's Medicare and it is the people's defense.\n  This is not a question of the government versus the people--not at \nall. The truth is, this is the people's money. I don't think any of us \never forget that. This is the people's money. It is also the people's \ndebt. And that debt will come due just as certainly as we are standing \non this floor today. If we have failed to be responsible about getting \nready for when that debt comes due, all of us who are here now who make \nthe fateful decisions are going to be held to account. It will be our \nnames in the book of history as to what was done at the critical time \nin our Nation's economic future. It is our responsibility to be good \nstewards of the people's money.\n  I end by urging the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to have a \nmarkup in the committee to establish a budget for the country for the \ncoming year. We have that responsibility. The suggestion that we are \ndeadlocked before we even start misses the point. We are often \ndeadlocked before we debate and discuss and vote. That is why we have \ndebate, discussion, and votes--to break deadlocks.\n  I hope very much that the Budget Committee will meet its \nresponsibility and attempt to write a budget resolution. That is our \nobligation. I hope we will meet it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I congratulate the Senator on his very illuminating \nremarks. I heard his talk about the gross debt, which really doesn't \nget mentioned very often as far as I can tell, and his discussion about \nthe publicly held debt. I think this is very useful knowledge.\n  This is the people's money, as we hear. I take it that the interest \nwe pay on the debt is also the people's money, am I correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly correct. And of course that money \nwe are using to pay interest on this debt can't be used for any other \npurpose. It can't be used for a tax cut; it can't be used to build a \nroad; it can't be used to build a bridge; it can't be used to build a \nschool; it can't be used to pay a teacher. It is money down a rathole, \nbut it has to be paid.\n  Mr. BYRD. It can't be used to buy even a pencil.\n  How much money are we talking about in interest on the debt? We are \ntalking about the people's money. The interest that is being paid on \nthe debt is the people's money, as well. That comes out of the pockets \nof the taxpayers.\n  Does the Senator have information at his fingertips as to the amount \nof the people's money we pay in interest on the debt annually?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The gross interest that we are paying a year would be \nover $300 billion. If you think about that, that is a stunning amount \nof money. The gross interest is over $300 billion.\n  Perhaps one of the staff people has the budget book in front of them \nand can tell us a precise number.\n  While we are waiting for that--the point is very clear. Although you \nowe $5.6 trillion, which is the gross debt of the United States, \ninterest on the publicly held debt is what gets all of the attention. \nThe press and our colleagues and our President have all focused on the \npublicly held debt. That is $3.4 trillion as we sit here today--$3.4 \ntrillion. But that is the debt the Federal Government owes people who \nare outside the government. That is what we owe to bondholders. That is \nwhat we owe to kids who have a savings bond. That is what we owe to \npeople who buy Treasury bills. That is what we owe to people who are \nholding instruments in other countries, who have loaned money to the \nUnited States. That is the publicly held debt, $3.4 trillion.\n  But the gross debt includes the debt of the general fund to trust \nfunds, money we have borrowed over time to trust funds to use for other \npurposes. We have borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars from the \nSocial Security trust fund. We are paying interest on that, too. That \nis part of the gross debt, and that has to be paid just as certainly as \nthis publicly held debt. It has the same legal position as the publicly \nheld debt and it, of course, is much larger. As I said, that is $5.6 \ntrillion of gross debt that the Nation has today.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is the rate of interest that the people are paying on \nthe debt? I know it varies. Generally speaking, is there a figure we \ncan use?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Generally speaking, we are paying between 5 percent and 6 \npercent on the debt of the United States.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is that the people's money?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is the people's money, the people's money that we \nare paying to service the people's debt.\n  Again, I wish to be very clear. I agree with the President absolutely \nwhen he says it is the people's money--absolutely that is true. It also \nhappens to be the people's debt. It also happens to be the people's \nSocial Security and the people's national defense and the people's \neducation.\n  The thing that worries me the most--I have been reading David \nStockman's book, ``The Triumph Of Politics.'' I hope every Member of \nthis body will read that book before we vote on the budget. It goes \nback to 1981 when we had a massive tax cut, massive increase in \nspending for defense, and we put this country in a deficit ditch from \nwhich it took us 17 years to get out. We exploded the national debt, \nquadrupled the national debt.\n  That could happen again. Back in the 1980s we had time to recover. \nThis time there is no time to recover because this time the baby \nboomers start to retire in 11 years. Back in the 1980s we had 17 years \nto get well. It took tax increases, it took spending cuts, it took \ntremendous political will to change the fiscal\n\n[[Page S2838]]\n\ncourse of the country, to get us back on track. But, make no mistake, \nthis time there is no time to get well because the baby boomers start \nto retire in 11 years. If we get it wrong this time, that debt will eat \nour country alive.\n  I wish every Member could have heard the briefing we got from the \nComptroller General of the United States, who warned us, who alerted us \nto where we are headed with debt. Yes, we have a surplus now. That \nsurplus is temporary, and we are headed for big debt. We can either dig \nthe hole deeper before we start filling it in--which is a very \nattractive thing to do because that means we all get to vote for a \nmassive tax cut. I am advocating a tax cut, about half as big as \nthe President's. But I think we all should be alert to what we are \nfacing.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the distinguished Senator yield \nfurther?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much of this money, the people's money--the people of \nthe United States--how much of that money that is being paid for \ninterest on the debt is going into the pockets of foreign holders of \nthese securities? What percent?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I do not recall the exact percentage that foreign debt \nholders have. It is interesting; I looked at those numbers last week, \nbut as I am getting older, my mind retains things less well. Although I \nlook young, I am aging rapidly.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is it not sufficient to say that a considerable amount of \nthis money, which the Senator and I would probably agree is something \nlike 40 percent--40 percent of these securities are held by foreign \ncountries----\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Japanese and Germans and the Belgians--the Belgians \nhave a lot of this debt.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Japanese are foremost; Great Britain is second.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I believe China is fourth or fifth or sixth; China.\n  This is the people's money, isn't it, that we are talking about? The \nSenator is trying to reduce that interest on the debt by reducing the \ndebt. We are talking about the people's money. He is trying to save the \npeople the people's money.\n  And a lot of it is going overseas. The interest that is paid on the \ndebt, 40 percent of it, is not of securities held by Americans but by \npeoples overseas. Is that what we are saying?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is exactly, in part, what we are saying. This debt \nis real. It is there. It is growing. We are paying interest on it.\n  One of the things we learned in the 1980s is it really works to \nreduce deficits and reduce debt. Alan Greenspan alerted us to this and \nSecretary Rubin alerted us to this, by saying: Look, when you are \npaying down debt instead of building debt, you take pressure off of \ninterest rates because it means the Federal Government is borrowing \nless money. When we borrow less money, that means there are fewer \npeople in there competing for the funds to loan. That means interest \nrates are lower. That means the economy is stronger. That means our \ncompetitive position in the world is better. That means we have \nstronger economic growth.\n  In fact, I remember Secretary Bentsen saying for every 1 percent we \nare able to reduce interest rates, that lifted the economy by over $100 \nbillion because of the debt burden taken off the economy.\n  That is a bigger assistance to the American economy and American \ntaxpayers than any tax cut we are contemplating around here.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is a real tax cut, isn't it? The equivalent of a real \ntax cut?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is a real tax cut. It is a real cut in costs for \nAmericans. It is a real lift to the economy. It is something that puts \nus in a much stronger competitive position. It puts us in a much \nstronger position when the baby boomers start to collect on their \nMedicare and Social Security because the country is then in a stronger \nfinancial position to deal with those liabilities.\n  Mr. BYRD. And that is a tax cut that is across the board, isn't it? \nIt is across the board; it benefits everybody.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It benefits every taxpayer.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the distinguished Senator yield \nfurther for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Our time is short. We are about to use all of our hour. Let \nme ask the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee this \nquestion. First of all, I assume the Budget chairman's mark will \ninclude budget instructions. When does the ranking member expect to \nreceive from the distinguished Budget Committee chairman information \nconcerning the resolution that the chairman intends to send to the \nSenate without its being marked up by the Budget Committee?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The chairman of the committee has not told me that. After \nI asked him last week to reconsider the decision not to hold up a \nmarkup, he told me he would give me a final answer today. I still \nretain some hope that he will permit a markup in the committee.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I hope so also.\n  I ask the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee, \ninasmuch as the budget resolution will contain instructions, the \ndistinguished ranking member asked this Senator to move to strike those \ninstructions; am I correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the resolution were marked up in committee, I assume the \nsame motion would be available there.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It would. It would require a simple majority in the \ncommittee. When we get out here on the floor, as the Senator well \nknows, we have a different situation.\n  Mr. BYRD. I believe that the motion to strike even on the floor would \nrequire only a majority vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct; on a motion to strike. As the Senator \nknows, we may face a series of different parliamentary circumstances \nboth in the committee and on the floor, and the test, based on the \nparliamentary circumstance we face, may be different in the committee \nrather than on the floor. On the motion to strike, the Senator is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me ask this question: The committee is required to \nreport the Budget Committee resolution no later than April 1, which \nwill fall on a Sunday. So it would be April 2. Does the Senator \ncontemplate that on April 2 it is the plan, as having been announced I \nthink by the majority leader, that the Senate would proceed to the \nconsideration of that budget resolution on that day or does the ranking \nmember contemplate that the committee chairman might give us an extra \nday by not reporting the matter to the Senate, or at least by helping \nus to get consent to delay that for a day so we can study the \nresolution?\n  Mr. CONRAD. First of all, I am still retaining some hope that the \nchairman of the committee will go to markup in the committee. I really \nbelieve that is the right thing to do. Failing that, the Senator is \nexactly right. The Budget Committee is discharged on April 1, so we \ncould have a budget resolution on the floor on April 2.\n  I hope that in the spirit of comity and bipartisanship we are \npermitted some time to review what the Budget Committee chairman will \noffer before we are expected to debate it and discuss it on the floor \nof the Senate, amend it, and vote on it--we would have an opportunity \nto review it.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the plan of the majority in the Senate is to complete \naction on the budget resolution by the end of next week, that would \nmean, would it not, that the Senate would have completed action on the \nbudget prior to the submission of the budget by the President to the \nSenate, which I understand now is going to be on April 9, the first day \nof the 2-week Easter break?\n  If that is the case, what are the disadvantages to Members of the \nSenate as they act on a Budget Committee resolution without any \nknowledge other than what we have seen in this blueprint, which I hold \nhere in my hand, of the President's--this is the outline, ``A Blueprint \nFor New Beginnings''--outline of his budget?\n  We don't have any idea, of course, what the President is going to \nrecommend in filling out this bare skeleton outline, what kind of a \nposition--I realize it was 1993 when the Senate acted on a budget \nresolution prior to the submission of the budget by the\n\n[[Page S2839]]\n\nPresident. That was a far different situation. What are some of the \ndifferences between the situation then and the situation now?\n\n  Let me preface that question by saying that last week the very \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, for whom I have a very \nhigh regard, came to the floor and, in response to a statement I made \non the floor, indicated that the budget resolution in 1993 was reported \nto the Senate and was acted upon by the Senate before the President of \nthe United States had submitted his budget to the Senate.\n  That is one of the things about which I and others have been \ncomplaining. That is what is going to happen now.\n  The schedule, as I understand it, is that we are going to be acting \non the budget resolution. It will be reported from the committee \nwithout a markup in committee, and, after the 50 hours have run their \ncourse, the Senate will act on the Budget Committee resolution. I \ncomplained about that.\n  The distinguished Senator from North Dakota pointed to the fact that \nthe Senate had acted on the budget resolution in 1993 prior to the \nsubmission to the Senate and to the House of the President's budget. \nBut there were very important differences. One was that in 1993 the \nBudget Committee marked up its resolution in committee before that \nresolution was sent to the floor. That is a very important difference.\n  The distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. Domenici, said last \nweek that we should consider the 1993 action on the budget resolution, \nprior to the submission to Congress by the President of his budget, to \nbe a role model.\n  But I add, if that is going to be the role model, we should also have \na markup prior to the committee reporting that budget resolution to the \nSenate, because the Budget Committee reported the resolution in 1993 to \nthe Senate, did it not? If that process is going to be the role model, \nwhy not include that? I think it should be included.\n  What does the ranking member have to say about that, and what are \nsome of other differences that confronted the Senate at that time with \nwhat we are going to be facing here?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator may recall, I was here in 1993, as was the \nSenator from West Virginia. The Senator from West Virginia, as always, \nwas in a critical role in the Appropriations Committee. I was serving \non the Budget Committee.\n  There are a series of differences from 1993. First of all, the budget \noutline we had from that President was far more detailed than the \nbudget outline we have from this President.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We had a good deal of detail from that administration \nwith respect to their recommendations to us on how much money we should \nspend on various items--what the tax base of the Federal Government \nshould be; what we should be doing with respect to the deficits.\n  There was really a rather detailed outline that is, frankly, missing \nfrom what we have been sent so far this year.\n  When you think about it, it is really a very odd circumstance. Not \nonly did we have a full markup in the Budget Committee at that time, so \nthat when it got to the full Senate they had guidance, they had a \nblueprint for the administration that had substantial detail, and they \nhad full detail from the Senate Budget Committee.\n  What they are proposing this year is little detail from the President \nand no help from the Senate Budget Committee: Let's just put the budget \nof the United States out here. It is going to be chaotic because you \ndon't have substantial guidance from the President; you have none from \nthe Senate Budget Committee. There is going to be a free-for-all out \nhere.\n  When they say 1993 should be a role model for what we should do now, \nthere is no comparison. There is no ``there'' there.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. This is a 10-year plan that we are being told will be \nencompassed in the budget resolution of this year. Was that a 10-year \nplan in 1993?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No. That was a 5-year plan. That was a 5-year plan; this \nis a 10-year plan. And, of course, that means the whole basis for the \nplan is even more uncertain.\n  Now, I tell you, I used to have to project the revenue for my State. \nThat was one of my jobs. I had to do it for 30 months--30 months. That \nwas very difficult to do. The truth is, nobody can foretell 10 years \ninto the future. There isn't a soul who knows what is going to happen--\nwhat we are going to face in terms of international conflict, what we \nare going to face in terms of natural disaster, what we are going to \nface in terms of a health threat, what we are going to face in terms of \nwhat this human genome research is going to mean to medical costs. \nThere isn't a soul who can tell us today what we are going to face in \nterms of international threats, in terms of requirements for our \nmilitary.\n  There isn't a soul who knows, with any certainty, what is going to \nhappen for 10 years. Yet we have people who are betting the entire \nfarm--I am from North Dakota. That is a phrase we use. We talk about \nbetting the farm. You don't bet the farm in a cavalier way. And that is \nwhat is happening. We are betting the farm on a 10-year forecast that \nthe forecasting agency itself says has only a 10-percent chance of \ncoming true.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senate will be contemplating, in the consideration of \nthe budget resolution this year, a massive tax cut. As one who had an \nimportant role in writing the Budget Reform Act of 1974, I had no \ninkling--young men dream dreams and old men have visions--I never had \nany dream or a vision at that point that we would ever use the Budget \nCommittee resolution, that process, for increasing or for cutting \ntaxes.\n  The idea was to bring about a resolution that would contemplate \nincome and outgo in such a way that we would balance the budgets. We \nwould have control over spending, control over outgo, and manage the \nincome and the outgo in such a way that we would balance the budget. We \nnever contemplated using that process--which is a beartrap because of \nits limitations on time for debate and on amendments--we never \ncontemplated it would be used in the manner that it is being used and \nhas been used more recently. The idea was to manage our affairs in such \na way that we would keep our budgets balanced. We would balance the \nbudgets.\n  That is not the case. The budget resolution, the budget process is \ngoing to be used now to bring about a huge tax cut. That is not going \nto balance the budget. That was not contemplated when we wrote that \nlaw. But is that not another major difference between the actions that \nwere taken in 1993 with reference to the budget resolution and the \nactions that are being contemplated now?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, the Senator is quite right. What is being \ncontemplated now is to use this special process that avoids the rules \nof the Senate called reconciliation. The reconciliation process was \ndesigned to reduce deficits. That is the whole purpose it was put in \nplace. That was back in the time when we had massive red ink, running \nhuge deficits, again, because of what happened in the 1980s, which I am \nvery much fearful we could repeat this year. So a special provision was \nput in place back at the time that the Senator has addressed, a special \nprocedure that avoided the rules of the Senate, that circumvented the \nrules of the Senate; and it was designed for one reason, which was to \nreduce deficits. And now it is being used to expand debt. It is \nstanding the whole purpose for reconciliation on its head.\n\n  I conclude by saying we are talking about coming to the floor to do a \nbudget resolution before we ever receive the President's budget. This \nis the point the Senator from West Virginia was making. We have \nreceived an outline from the President. It does not have much detail in \nit--a lot of pages but not much detail about where the money is \nsupposed to go. We have not yet received the President's budget. Yet we \nare talking about the Senate passing the budget resolution for the\n\n[[Page S2840]]\n\nyear before ever seeing the President's budget.\n  It makes no sense at all. It makes no sense. It seems to me we should \nspend that week--instead of debating a budget when we have never seen \nthe President's recommendations--to provide for a stimulus package so \nthat we are dealing with the immediate weakness in the economy and then \ncome back to this longer term plan that the President proposes after we \nhave seen the President's budget.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield to me, finally?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator take the few remaining minutes under my \ncontrol and sum up the points that have been made here this morning as \nto the differences between what the Senate was confronted with in 1993 \nand what we are being confronted with today anent the budget resolution \nand the budget process? There are several items. Will the Senator sum \nthem up?\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I would be happy to try to sum up by \nsaying, first of all, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee told \nus last week he does not intend to mark up the budget in the Budget \nCommittee. We urge him to reconsider. We urge him to have a public \nmarkup in which there is debate, discussion, and votes so that the \nBudget Committee meets its obligation and responsibility.\n  No. 2, when talking about 1993--because some have said, well, this is \nwhat happened in 1993; that we did not have the budget from the \nPresident before we wrote a budget resolution on the floor of the \nSenate--the differences are quite clear. In 1993, the Senate Budget \nCommittee marked up fully a budget. No. 2, we had a good deal more \ndetail from the President in 1993 in terms of functional totals, in \nterms of what each of the areas should get or what kind of cuts they \ncould expect.\n  We do not have that this time. So now, in 2001, we do not have the \nBudget Committee doing a markup. At least that is what the chairman so \nfar has said. We hope he will reconsider. We do not have the level of \ndetail we had in 1993. So what is about to happen is really quite \nremarkable. We are going to have the Senate write a budget resolution \nwithout ever seeing the President's budget and without the Budget \nCommittee ever doing its job to write a budget and to mark it up.\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the Senate \nBudget Committee. I assume that consumes all of the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator's time has expired. \nUnder the previous order, the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas, or his \ndesignee is recognized for 1 hour.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/26/senate-section/article/S2840-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, we have been consumed over the last week, \nand will be for the remainder of this week, with campaign finance \nreform, an issue that has been about for some time and has been \nstressed by a number of Members of the Senate. I have indicated before \nthat, certainly, it is an important issue. However, it is time we \ncomplete that issue, as there are many others that probably are of more \nimportance to most people than that of campaign finance reform. \nNevertheless, that is the commitment.\n  It has been an interesting debate. It will continue to be an \ninteresting debate. I am hopeful we will come up with some kind of a \nproposition when it is over and not have wasted the entire 2 weeks \ndiscussing the various aspects of it.\n  This evening we will hear the introduction of the Hagel proposal, of \nwhich I am an original cosponsor. It is an important issue to be \ndebated, one that deals with campaign finance reform more clearly than \ndoes the floor bill, which is the McCain-Feingold approach. One has to \nmake a decision as to whether or not they want the Federal Government \nto be managing elections or whether, under the Constitution, elections \nshould be comprised primarily of freedom of speech and an opportunity \nfor people to participate. In terms of elections, it would be wrong if \nwe found ourselves in a position of seeking to limit the opportunities \nfor people to express themselves.\n  The Hagel bill, which he will discuss in great detail, deals with the \nmost important aspect of campaign finance reform; that is, disclosure. \nWhenever dollars are given to a candidate for the purpose of election, \nthey are disclosed, disclosed immediately so voters can then determine \nfor themselves whether they think that is a legitimate expenditure or \nnot.\n\n  The bill also provides for an increase in the level of hard money \nthat goes to candidates. That was set in law in the 1970s. It has not \nbeen changed since that time. Obviously, the amount of money \nrepresented in the 1970s through inflation is not nearly as expansive \nas it is today. It changes that. It also puts a limit on soft money.\n  I am hopeful that when the bill comes forward we will be able to \ndiscuss an alternative which I believe is a more reasonable alternative \nthan the one that has been discussed. Then we can move on to some items \nof dire importance: Obviously, taxes--giving people an opportunity to \nkeep more of their own money. When we find American taxpayers paying \nmore today than they have ever paid in history as a percentage of gross \nnational product, paying more now than they did in World War II, that \ndoesn't seem appropriate. Where should the money go? It should go back \nto the people who have paid it in.\n  We will also be discussing the economy, an issue that needs to be \ntalked about immediately. We will be talking about the opportunity of \ntax relief to assist in strengthening the economy. I am sure we will be \ntalking more clearly about the idea of putting some money back into the \neconomy more immediately, some $60 billion that is in surplus of this \nyear's needs for the budget and could be placed back into the economy \nin some method or other.\n  Those are topics that need to be debated.\n  We say education is an issue that means more to people than any other \nindividual subject. We ought to be talking about that. We ought to be \ntalking about the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We ought to \nbe debating whether or not Federal dollars for education ought to be \ndesignated in terms of where they go by the Federal Government, or \nshould they be sent to local and State governments to decide for \nthemselves where their needs are.\n  I am from Wyoming. Certainly, the needs in Chugwater, WY, are \ndifferent from those in Pittsburgh, PA. We ought to have the \nopportunity and the flexibility to send those dollars there.\n  Certainly, we need to be discussing preserving Social Security as we \nhave in the past, making sure those dollars are there. We need to be \ntalking about paying down the debt, which we have an opportunity to do \nnow. We ought to be discussing doing something with health care to \nprovide more availability for people all over the country.\n  There are many topics we ought to be debating, and hopefully we will \nbe able to move to those. One of them, of course, is energy and the \nenvironment. We now find ourselves in a position of facing great \ndifficulty with energy, made more visible and accentuated by the \nproblems existing in California.\n  The California problems are not necessarily typical of energy \nconcerns throughout the country. Indeed, many of them have been brought \non by some unusual efforts in terms of electric reregulation in which \nCalifornia chose to\n\n[[Page S2841]]\n\nput limits on the cost of retail electricity but not wholesale. We can \nimagine that that is not a workable situation, and it has caused many \nproblems, not only in California but throughout the West as well.\n  We will be talking about energy, and we should be. Often when we \ndiscuss energy, we also have to talk about the environment, although \nthe environment is an issue that we need to be concerned with all of \nthe time, in my judgment. One of the reasons energy and the environment \nare of particular importance to me and to others in the West is the \nfact that the Federal Government is a principal owner of lands in the \nwestern United States.\n  I brought this visual display to show what Federal land ownership is \nin each State. Most people are surprised by the percentage. In my State \nof Wyoming, nearly half of the land belongs to the Federal Government. \nSome States, of course, are even higher than that. In Alaska, almost 68 \npercent of the land is owned by the Federal Government. In Nevada, \nalmost 85 percent is owned by the Federal Government.\n  So the kinds of regulations that are put into place, the kinds of \nissues that arise in terms of the environment and the usage of public \nlands, become very important to us. That, of course, is not the only \naspect of the environment, but it is one that is very important and, \nfrankly, quite difficult.\n  The point I want to make is, as we go about a number of the problems \nthat we have before us, and a number of the opportunities to solve \nthem, unfortunately, we find ourselves with environmental groups and \nmany Members of the Senate making the case, let's either protect the \nenvironment or ruin it by using it. I suggest to you that those are not \nthe only two alternatives. You can access the lands; you can use the \nlands as multiple-use lands, yet continue to protect the environment.\n  In Wyoming we think we have done that pretty well. We have had \nmining, oil production, hunting, fishing, and we have had access to the \nlands for more than 100 years now. We are pretty proud of the \nenvironment we have there. So this idea that is often out here that you \nhave to choose between the opportunity to have multiple use and the \nopportunity to protect the environment is wrong.\n  Certainly, protecting the resources is a high priority for most \neveryone. I happen to be chairman of the parks subcommittee. Certainly, \nregarding our national parks, the basic, No. 1 issue is to protect the \nresource and, 2, to let the owners, the American people, enjoy those \nresources. That is really the purpose of having a park.\n  We find ourselves, from time to time, in conflict with that, in that \nprotecting the resources, to some people, means we should not let \nanybody have access to enjoy those resources. One of the issues is to \nallow access. We have seen a great deal about that lately.\n  One of the things that prompts me to visit about it this morning is, \nMembers of this Senate have been, in the last few days, getting up and \nsaying this administration is anti-environment because they have \nchanged some of the regulations that were put in place in the last \nadministration. Well, I think it was a legitimate, reasonable thing for \na new administration to do, to look at those literally hundreds of \nregulations that were put in the day before the administration left, to \nsee if indeed they are reasonable and consistent with the efforts of \nthe new administration. I think that is not unusual at all.\n  We also now have the issue of energy. Of course, much of the energy \ncomes from land. Whether it be coal, oil, natural gas, hydro or water, \nit comes from various uses of the land. I think we find ourselves now \nwith a real issue as to what is the best way to preserve the \nenvironment and to be able to meet the needs of domestic energy \nproduction. That is kind of where we are.\n  The complaints about this administration are not valid. I think they \nare totally political, and we ought to really examine them in terms of \nwhere they are. One of the reasons we are having problems, of course, \nis that we have let ourselves, over the last year, go along without an \nenergy policy, without a decision on a national level on what we want \nto do with respect to energy--what kinds of energy we want to promote. \nBut more importantly, do we want to let ourselves get into the position \nof becoming totally dependent on foreign imports--in this case, OPEC? \nThat is basically what we have allowed ourselves to do.\n  The prediction is that we will have 60-percent dependency on foreign \noil within the next couple of years. We are now 55- or 56-percent \ndependent. When OPEC decides, as they recently did, to reduce \nproduction, we find ourselves going to the gas pump with higher prices \nor, even worse, finding ourselves without the kind of energy we need to \ncontinue to have the economy that we have now and want to have in the \nfuture.\n\n  So I think one of the things that is happening that is very helpful \nis that this administration, with the leadership of the President, has \nassigned Vice President Dick Cheney to a work group to define where we \nneed to be in terms of energy and in terms of the economy in the \nfuture. They are due to have a report in about 6 weeks or a month from \nnow which will put us in the position of having a national policy on \nenergy for the first time in many years. Hopefully, that will give us \nsome direction as to how we can resolve that.\n  There are lots of alternatives, of course, in energy policy. We need \nto talk about the diversity of energy--not all natural gas. We also \nhave coal, our largest resource. In the budget, we have some \nopportunities to research some more in coal, to make it a cleaner fuel \nso it is a fuel for stationary electric production. We can use \nsomething in hydro, one of the renewables that in the last \nadministration there were efforts made to reduce, to tear down some of \nthe dams that are there that provide those kinds of resources. So there \nare a lot of things that can be done.\n  We are talking more about the opportunity for nuclear power, which is \none of the cleanest opportunities for electric generation, of course. \nFirst of all, we need to find a place to store nuclear waste. We have \nbeen fighting over that for a number of years. We need to finally make \na determination. Despite the fact that we have spent billions of \ndollars already at the Yucca Mountain storage site in Nevada, we \nhaven't resolved that completely. There is an opportunity for \nrenewables--sun and wind. We can do more with that. We need research to \nmake those things more economical and more well placed.\n  Also, of course, one of the things we need to do is look at ourselves \nin terms of conservation and areas where we can do a better job of \nusing energy so that we can reduce demand, as demand continues to go \nup--in the case of California, very sharply--and production does not go \nup. You know you have a wreck coming when that sort of thing happens.\n  So we are looking forward to that kind of an opportunity.\n  Beyond that, of course, I suggest that all of us are in the position \nof wanting to protect the environment. Obviously, we want to protect \nour lands. We are very pleased with the lands. We have talked for a \nnumber of months now in Wyoming about what we want our State to look \nlike in 15, 20 years. We called it Vision 20/20, which is an \nopportunity to get an idea where we want to go.\n  One of the things we want to have, of course, is open space. That has \nbeen a very vital part of the West and of Wyoming. We also want to have \nfish and wildlife--again, a vital part of what we want to do. In order \nto do that, we have to protect the environment. We are prepared to do \nthat, and, at the same time, we want to be able to produce many of the \nthings that need to be done to provide power and energy for this \ncountry.\n  We have recently heard--I am sorry to hear this--accusations that \nthis administration is turning around some of the useful things that \nhave been done over the last 8 years. I am here to tell you that not \nall those things have been based on facts. Not all of them have been \nbased on research. This idea that the administration is a ``charm \noffensive'' turned into a ``harm offensive'' is a ridiculous statement \nto make. It doesn't have any basis in fact at all.\n\n  Talking about CO2, for example, CO2 was \nincluded in regulations put out just as this administration went out. \nCO2 is not included and identified as a pollutant. Do we \nwant to work at doing something? Of course, we do. CO2 also \nhas a lot to do with the ability to generate electricity. In the \nAgriculture\n\n[[Page S2842]]\n\nCommittee we are looking for tradeoffs, where you can use timber, \ngrasslands to absorb CO2, and some of the things we can do \nthere. But to suggest that is a terrific environmental problem is \nsimply not supported by facts.\n  The same thing is basically true of arsenic. The new Administrator of \nthe EPA delayed the recommendations that were put in on arsenic. Why? \nBecause there wasn't sufficient study, there weren't sufficient \nscientific bases. Furthermore, under the original plan, there were \nanother 2 years to establish that level. She has assured that there \nwill be a level. But this one was not scientifically put into place in \nterms of water projects for communities throughout the country.\n  This idea that it is setting back 8 years of progress is ridiculous. \nWe ought to be working together to find a way for our communities to \nhave a good water supply and at the same time be affordable. I think we \ncan do that.\n  Another one of our friends said George Bush has declared war on the \nenvironment. That is a ridiculous idea. No one is declaring war on the \nenvironment. The environment is something all of us want to protect. \nThe question is how do we do that and at the same time let people enjoy \nthe resources.\n  We have had an interesting debate about the roadless areas in the \nFederal lands of the West. The Forest Service put out a regulation on \nroadless areas. I happened to attend some of the meetings. They called \nfor local meetings. Not even the local Forest Service people knew what \nthey were talking about.\n  We have national forest plans. New plans are developed every 10 \nyears. The Forest Service goes through a very complex system of setting \nup a forest plan designed to deal with forests differently because they \nare, indeed, different. This was an idea that came from the Department \nof Agriculture deciding that all forests should be dealt with in the \nsame way.\n  It does not work. It does not work that way. Do we want roads \neverywhere? Of course not, and there is no need to have them \neverywhere. But we do have to have some if people are going to have \naccess. The environmentalists claim it is just the timber people. I \nheard from a lot of folks, including disabled veterans, who said: How \nare we going to enjoy these public lands if we don't have access to \nthem?\n  I agree with them. Limit the roads? Of course. Roadless does not seem \nto work.\n  In Yellowstone Park, the people have an opportunity to see \nYellowstone Park in the wintertime and they can see it with snow \nmachines. The park did not manage them at all. They sat and watched it \nfor years, and all of a sudden, they decided the parks cannot have this \nhappen and wanted to discontinue allowing snow machines. We have \nsuggested, rather than that, to take a look at those snow machines. Get \nEPA to do their job and set some standards for emissions and noise and \nthen the park can say: Look, if you want to come to the park, you have \nto have a machine that meets these standards. It can be done, and the \nmanufacturers say they can do it. It is a good idea. People can have \naccess.\n\n  Instead, this past administration said: We are tired of it; we are \ngoing to do away with it, without even making an effort. If there are \ntoo many there, manage them. They are talking now about west \nYellowstone where too many of them pile up at the gate, and the park \nranger is getting a sore throat, or something. We should not do that. \nThere is a way to manage them.\n  Agencies seem to have a hard time figuring out how to manage it. When \nthere is a problem, everybody else manages it and changes it. We can do \nthat. Access is something that I think is important.\n  All I am suggesting and hoping is that this administration will seek \nsome reasonable approaches to the things that need to be done.\n  The Clean Water Act--do we like clean water? Of course, everybody \nlikes clean water. This EPA last year came up with the clean water \naction plan that had about 100 different proposals in it, some of which \nwere not authorized under the law, and sought to put those into place. \nThis administration is taking another look at them and, indeed, they \nshould. We can find ways to have clean water and allow the lands to be \nused.\n  Those are the kinds of changes this administration is seeking to make \nthat are being called ``a war on the environment.''\n  I do not think we can come to reasonable decisions in this body if \nMembers take far-end positions such as if you are for the environment, \nyou cannot be for using it. That is what we find ourselves faced with. \nThat is not a workable answer. I am hopeful we can move toward finding \nsolutions that are, indeed, useful and at the same time, of course, \nprotect the environment.\n  Getting back to carbon monoxide, this was largely a product of the \nKyoto agreement sometime back, signed by the United States as a treaty \nand brought to this body. We unanimously decided not to consider it. \nNow we find complaints because CO2 changes have been made \nand it was not even considered as part of the Kyoto agreement. Do we \nwant to have clean air? Of course.\n  These are some issues we need to look at in a balanced way, with good \nscience and not just political decisions. We can consider ways to \npreserve those resources and at the same time utilize them.\n  These are the issues which we ought to be talking about. I am \ndistressed, frankly, when I hear on this floor statements such as \n``going from charm to harm''; ``going to destroy the environment''; \n``declared war on the environment.'' That is not a fair presentation. \nIt is not a logical presentation. I hope we can, indeed, look at some \nresponsible answers rather than looking for a political issue for the \nnext election.\n  Mr. President, I will shortly be joined by the Senator from Alaska. \nIn the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will address an issue that I ran into \nlast weekend at home regarding some of the tragedies that have happened \nand continue to happen in high schools. We had a threat in one of our \nschools. Fortunately, it was dealt with before anything tragic happened \nas in Columbine and some of the other schools.\n  One of the judges indicated he thought it would be useful, and I tend \nto agree with him, if we could find a way to get one of the agencies--\nperhaps the FBI or Education, including someone in psychiatry and \nothers--to try to come up with a plan that schools can put into effect \nto try to avoid the problem of terrorism, shootings and guns and, more \nimportantly perhaps, describe a better system. It seems in many cases \nthe young people who sought to carry out these deeds had indicated they \nwere going to do that prior thereto. I believe his view was not all \ncommunities and not all schools are prepared to deal with those \nthreats.\n  Perhaps it would be useful if, indeed, we had some assistance putting \ntogether a combination of educators, law enforcement, psychologists and \na program that could be put into place in a school to try to avoid \ntragedies of violence; and also, when there was some evidence of it, in \nthis case even a note written of people this student intended to deal \nwith; and then if it does happen, what you do when those things occur. \nI imagine there are techniques which could be applied, more \nprofessional techniques than most schools are capable of on their own.\n  I suggest, perhaps some Federal agencies, there could be some kind of \nmeeting of the involved people to come up with what they think are the \nmost useful techniques for dealing with this kind of violence in \ncommunities and high schools and in detecting it and doing something \nabout it, in dealing with it, if it does happen, and to provide that \nkind of leadership to communities and to the very school districts \nthroughout the country that would be interested in that type of \nassistance.\n  I don't think it is particularly a legislative question, but to \nencourage the\n\n[[Page S2843]]\n\nadministration and, as I said, particularly the Department of \nEducation, or perhaps the law enforcement department, to try to come up \nwith some things that could be used by communities so we can avoid, \nwhenever possible, the kinds of things that have happened around the \ncountry, and I suppose will continue to be a threat. I think it will be \nworthwhile.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, over the last several days I have had \nan opportunity to respond to inquiries regarding the energy crisis in \nthis country and specifically the bill Senator Breaux and I introduced. \nIt covers many of the questions surrounding the adequacy of energy in \nthis country.\n  We have attempted to focus, first, on the reality that we are in an \nenergy crisis. I wonder when the media and some of the people in this \ncountry are going to figure out the reality of this. The issue is not \nabout oil. It is not about ANWR. We have a 303-page bill, and it seems \nas though everybody wants to focus in on one segment, and that segment \ncalls for increasing our supply of oil from ANWR in my State of Alaska.\n  It is not just about oil. It is about a terrible energy shortage in \nthis country. It is about our national security. It is about our \neconomy. And it is, indeed, about the recognition that if we do not \ntake some immediate action, this crisis is going to get worse.\n  I am amused at some of my colleagues. It seems to be focusing in, \nsomewhat, on a partisan basis. To suggest somehow the crisis is being \noverblown by our President, that by drawing attention, we are \ncompounding the problem, befuddles me. The reality is that what we have \nseen, over an extended period of time, at least the last 8 years or \nthereabouts, is a failure to recognize our demand has been increasing \nand our supply has been relatively stagnant.\n  To some extent, we have seen that in the crisis in California. We saw \nan experiment in deregulation fail. We saw an effort to cap, if you \nwill, the price of retail power in California. The results of that \neffort are associated with the bankruptcy, for all practical purposes, \nof California's two main utilities as a consequence of the inability to \npass on the true cost of that high-priced power that came from outside \nthe State of California, that California absolutely had to have to meet \nits demand. Those costs, unfortunately, were not able to be passed on \nto the consumer.\n  Now we see the utilities basically bankrupt. We see situations where \nthe State is stepping in and guaranteeing the price of power. I wonder \nif there is any difference between the California consumer ratepayer \nand taxpayer. They are all the same. But the burden is being shifted \nnow to the taxpayer as the State takes an increasingly dependent role \nin ensuring that California generates power and has enough power coming \nin. When we talk about talking down the economy, I wonder if we are not \nbeing a little unrealistic.\n  If we look at what happened in reporting fourth quarter earnings of \nthe Fortune 500, we find that many of these reports have the notation \nthat increased energy costs is one of the reasons for the projections \nnot being what they anticipated.\n  We also have what we call the phenomena of NIMB--not in my backyard. \nIn other words, we want power-generating capacity but we don't want it \nin our backyard. Where are you going to put it?\n  It reminds me very much of the situation with regard to nuclear \nenergy. Nuclear energy in this country provides about 20 percent of the \npower generated in our electric grid. Yet nobody wants to take the \nnuclear waste. We have expended $6 billion to $7 billion out in Nevada \nat a place called Yucca Mountain, which was designed to be a permanent \nrepository for our high-level waste. The State doesn't want it. The \ndelegation doesn't want it.\n  Are there other alternatives? The answer is yes. What are they? \nTechnology.\n  It is kind of interesting to look at the French. Nearly 30 years ago \nat the time of the Yom Kippur War in the Mideast, in 1973, the French \ndecided they wouldn't be held hostage again by the Mideast on the price \nof oil. They embarked on technology. Today they are 85-percent \ndependent on nuclear energy. What do they do with the high-level waste? \nThey reprocess it, recover it and put it back in the reactors. It is \nplutonium. They vitrify the rest of the waste, which has a lesser \nlifetime. As a consequence, they don't have a proliferation problem and \nthe criticism that we have in this country over nuclear energy. But, \nagain, the NIMB philosophy is there--not in my backyard.\n  From where are these energy sources going to come? Are you going to \nhave a powerplant in your county in your neighborhood? That isn't the \nquestion exactly. But in some cases it is the question.\n  Some suggest we can simply get there by increasing the CAFE standards \nand increase automobile mileage. We have that capability now. You can \nbuy cars that get 56 miles per gallon, if the American public wants it. \nThey are out there. Some people buy them, and we commend them for that. \nBut is it government's role to dictate what kind of car you are going \nto have to buy?\n  Some people talk about the merits of climate change. There is some \nconcern over Kyoto and the recognition that we are producing more \nemissions. But are we going to solve the Kyoto problem by allowing the \ndeveloping nations to catch up or, indeed, are we going to have to use \nour technology to encourage the reduction of emissions?\n  Let me conclude my remarks this morning with a little bit on the \nrealization that we have become about 56-percent dependent on imported \noil. This is an issue that affects my State. We have been supplying \nthis Nation with about 25 percent of the oil produced in this country \nfor the last decade. One of the issues that is of great concern in the \ndevelopment of oil from Alaska--particularly the area of ANWR--is \nwhether we can do it safely. Of course. We have had 30 years of \nexperience in the Arctic.\n\n  Another question is: What effect will it have on the economy? What \neffect will it have on national security?\n  About one-half of our balance-of-payment deficit is the cost of \nimported oil. That is a pretty significant outflow of our national \nproduct in the sense of purchasing that oil.\n  The national security interests: At what time and at what point do \nyou become more dependent on imported oil, and at what point do you \nsacrifice the national security of this country?\n  We fought a war in 1991. We lost 147 lives. There is a colleague over \nin the House who made the statement the other day that he would rather \nsee us drill in cemeteries than to see his grandson come back from a \nconflict in the Mideast in a body bag. We already did once. How many \ntimes are we going to do it as we become more and more dependent? It \naffects the national security and it affects the economy.\n  As far as the attitude of those in my State, a significant majority--\nover three-quarters of Alaskans--support opening up ANWR.\n  Why do you want to open an area on land in a refuge? Let's put it in \nperspective. This refuge is the size of the State of South Carolina. \nThis refuge contains 8.5 million acres of a wilderness that is \ndedicated in perpetuity and will not be touched. There are 19 million \nacres in the refuge that are off limits, leaving 1.5 million acres, a \nlittle sliver up at the top. That little sliver consists of 1.5 million \nacres out of 19 million acres. People say that is the Serengeti of the \nnorth. That is an untouched area.\n  First of all, they have never been there, unlike the occupant of the \nchair who has been there. And I appreciate his wisdom and diligence in \nmaking the trip up there.\n  There is a small village there with 147 people. They live in Kaktovik \nwith a school, a couple of little stores, a radar site, and there is a \nrunway.\n  What do the people think about it? They want it. They want the \nalternative ability to have a lifestyle that provides jobs, educational \nopportunities, personal services, health care, and so forth.\n\n[[Page S2844]]\n\n  It is amazing to me to kind of watch and participate in this effort \nto communicate because the environmental community is spending a great \ndeal of money portraying this area in 2\\1/2\\ to 3 months every summer. \nThey are not portraying it in its 10-month winter period. They are not \nportraying it accurately relative to the people who live there.\n  They suggest it is going to take 10 years to develop the area. That \nis absolutely incorrect. They don't point out the reality that we have \nthe infrastructure of an 800-mile pipeline already there, and that we \nhave moved over towards the ANWR line to the Badami field, which is \napproximately 25 miles away from the edge of ANWR. If Congress were to \nauthorize this area, it would take roughly 3\\1/2\\ years to have oil \nflowing.\n  Some people say it is only a 6-month supply. Tests estimate that \nthere is a range of between 5.6 billion to 16 billion barrels. At an \naverage of 10 billion barrels of production, it would be the largest \nfield found in 40 years in the world.\n  That will give you some idea of the magnitude. It would be larger \nthan Prudhoe Bay, which has been producing for the last 27 years 25 \npercent of the total crude oil produced in this country.\n  Let's keep the argument in perspective. It is a significant \npotential. It can reduce dramatically our dependence on imported oil \nfrom Saddam Hussein and others. It can have a very positive effect upon \nour economy.\n  Some Members have threatened to filibuster this. I am amazed that \nanyone would threaten a filibuster on an issue such as this. It is like \nfiddling while Rome burns.\n  Those who suggest that fail to recognize the reality that we have an \nenergy problem in this country, and we have a broad energy bill that we \nthink covers all aspects of energy development as well as new \ntechnology.\n  I urge my colleagues to go back and reexamine the potential.\n  First of all, let's recognize we have the problem. We are going to \nhave to do something about it. We are not going to drill our way out of \nit. It is going to take a combination of a number of efforts to utilize \nexisting energy sources. But opening ANWR is significantly a major \nrole, if you will, in reducing our dependency on imported oil.\n  I remind my colleagues of one other point, and that is, a good deal \nof the west coast of the United States is dependent on Alaskan oil. \nThat is where our oil goes. If oil does not come from Alaska, oil is \ngoing to come in to the west coast from some place else.\n  Oftentimes people say, developing Alaskan oil has nothing to do with \nthe California energy crisis because they do not use oil to generate \nelectricity. That certainly is true. I agree.\n  But what I would add is, California is dependent on Alaskan oil for \nits transportation, its ships, its airplanes. As a consequence, if the \noil does not come from Alaska, it is going to come from someplace else. \nIt is going to come from a rain forest in Colombia where there is no \nenvironmental oversight. It is going to come in ships that are owned by \nforeign trading corporations that do not have Coast Guard inspections \nand the assurance of the highest quality of scientific applications to \nensure the risk of transporting the oil is kept at a minimum.\n  I urge my colleagues to reflect a little bit on the reality that this \nis an energy crisis. We are not going to drill our way out of it. We \nare going to have to use all of our resources, all of our energy \ntechnology, and a balanced approach, which is what we have in our \nenergy bill, to confront this energy crisis.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your time and attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/26/senate-section/article/S2844-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I rise to extend an invitation to all \nMembers of the Senate to take advantage of an opportunity this weekend \nrelative to a trip to my State of Alaska to visit the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge.\n  If Members are free, I would appreciate their contacting my office at \n224-6665. We do have room to accommodate more Members. We anticipate \nleaving Thursday at the completion of business and flying up to \nAnchorage. We will be in the accompaniment of the new Secretary of the \nInterior, Gale Norton, and we will be having breakfast in Anchorage \nFriday morning, then flying on down to Valdez where we will see the \nterminus of the 800-mile pipeline. Valdez is the largest oil port in \nNorth America, one of the largest in the world. We will see the \ncontainment vessels, the technology that is used to ensure that if \nthere is an accident of any kind, the capacity for cleanup is \nimmediately there.\n  We will also have an opportunity to go across from the terminal to \nthe community of Valdez. We will be able to monitor the Coast Guard \nstation that basically controls the flow of tanker traffic in and out \nof the port of Valdez. Then we will fly on to Fairbanks where we will \novernight and have an opportunity to attend a dinner hosted by some of \nthe people of Fairbanks, including Doyon, which is one of the Native \nregional corporations. At that time, we will have an opportunity to \nhear firsthand the attitudes of the people in interior Alaska.\n  Fairbanks is my home. The 800-mile pipeline goes through Fairbanks. \nAs a consequence, there will be an opportunity to visit the largest \nmuseum in our State which contains all the material from public lands \nthat have been generated over an extended period of time. It is an \nextraordinary collection. It is regarded as one of the finest \ncollections outside of the Smithsonian.\n  The next morning, we will fly up to Prudhoe Bay. We will visit \nDeadhorse. We will see the old technology. Then we will go over to the \nvillage of Kaktovik in ANWR. We will be in ANWR, and we will be able to \nmeet with the Eskimo people and see physically what is there. We will \nbe able to fly over ANWR, and then we will go back to a new field near \nwhat they call Alpine and be hosted by a group of Eskimos at Nuiqsut \nwhere they are going to have a little bit of a potlatch for us. Then \nthat evening, we will be in Barrow overnight. Barrow is the \nnorthernmost point of the world.\n  Many of you, if you have any questions about a trip such as that, \nmight contact Senator Helms. Senator and Mrs. Helms made this trip a \ncouple years with us. They could be firsthand advocates. What it does \nis give every Member an opportunity to view objectively the issue of \nwhether or not it is in the national interest to open ANWR, whether we \ncan do it safely, whether indeed it makes, as it does in my opinion and \nthose of many other Alaskans, a significant contribution to the \nnational security interests of this Nation and makes a significant \ncontribution to the economy. They will have an opportunity to hear from \nAlaskans themselves their attitude on whether or not this can be opened \nsafely.\n  One of the things that bothers me about this issue is, I continually \nhave to account for my knowledge of the issue as an Alaskan. Yet my \nopponents, who have never been there and don't have any intention of \ngoing, never seem to have to account for their ignorance or lack of \nknowledge--if I may put it a little more kindly--on the issue.\n  So this is a rare opportunity, Mr. President. I again encourage \nMembers to think about it. Spouses are welcome to accompany Members. We \nin Alaska are certainly willing to do our part. This development would \ntake place on land as opposed to offshore. It is much safer to do it on \nland. It seems to me that as we look at the high price of energy, there \nis a recognition that we can have some relief, at least from dependence \non imported oil, which affects our\n\n[[Page S2845]]\n\ntransportation costs; that it is significant.\n  Some Members obviously don't notice much of an increase in their \nbills because maybe somebody else pays the bills. A lot of people in my \nState of Alaska, including fishermen--and, for that matter, fishermen \non the east coast, in Massachusetts and other States--are affected by \nthe high price of fuel for their vessels. They are all affected by the \nhigh cost of energy. So I don't think we should rely on the NIMBY \ntheory--not in my back yard.\n  I was doing some figuring the other day as a consequence of a little \naddress we did on ``Face The Nation'' this weekend, where we had a \ndebate with one of my friends from Massachusetts. I am told there is \nenough oil in ANWR to fuel the State of Massachusetts for 125 years. \nANWR happens to be about four times the size of the State of \nMassachusetts.\n  In any event, I am not picking on Massachusetts this morning. I am \nextending an invitation to Members that this weekend would be an ideal \nopportunity for you to see and evaluate for yourselves, and not \nnecessarily take the word of America's environmental community, which \nhas seen fit to use this issue as a major factor in generating \nmembership and dollars.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Wellstone, is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 145\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 145 and ask \nthat it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 145.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To apply the prohibition on electioneering communications to \n      targeted communications of certain tax-exempt organizations)\n\n       On page 21, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 204. RULES RELATING TO CERTAIN TARGETED ELECTIONEERING \n                   COMMUNICATIONS.\n\n       Section 316(c) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 \n     (2 U.S.C. 441b), as added by section 203, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(6) Special rules for targeted communications.--\n       ``(A) Exception does not apply.--Paragraph (2) shall not \n     apply in the case of a targeted communication that is made by \n     an organization described in such paragraph.\n       ``(B) Targeted communication.--For purposes of subparagraph \n     (A), the term `targeted communication' means an \n     electioneering communication (as defined in section \n     304(d)(3)) that is distributed from a television or radio \n     broadcast station or provider of cable or satellite \n     television service whose audience consists primarily of \n     residents of the State for which the clearly identified \n     candidate is seeking office.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his \nremarks and in particular for his focus on the importance of what some \ncall clean money, clean elections, others call public financing, \npartial or full public financing.\n  Before I talk about this amendment, I want to give it some context \nwith the argument I made on the floor of the Senate last week.\n  I am bitterly disappointed my amendment was not adopted. That \namendment was an effort to say that our States should have the option \nof applying a voluntary system of partial or full public financing to \nour races. A couple of Senators said to me during the vote that they \ndid not want their State legislatures deciding ``how to finance my \ncampaigns.'' They are not our campaigns. These campaigns belong to the \npeople of the country. I do believe, until we move to some system of \npublic financing or move in that direction with some reforms, we are \ngoing to continue to have a system that is wired for incumbents. \nSometimes I think the debate is as much between ins and outs as it is \nbetween Democrats and Republicans.\n  I want to put the defeat of that amendment in the context of some of \nthe reform amendments being defeated and other amendments which I think \nsignificantly weaken this legislation, at least if one's interest is in \nreform and in trying to get some of the big money out of politics and \nbring some of the people back in.\n  The acceptance last week of the so-called millionaire's amendment, \nwhere we tried to fix the problem of people who have wealth and their \nown economic resources and spending it on their own campaigns with \nbasically another abuse, which is to take the limits off how much money \npeople can contribute--I fear this week we are going to take the lid \noff individual campaign contributions as some have suggested, going \nfrom $1,000 to $3,000 or $2,000 to $6,000 a year.\n  The point is, again, one-quarter of 1 percent of the people in the \ncountry contribute $200 or more and one-ninth of the voting age \npopulation in the country contribute $1,000 a year or more. How last \nweek's support of the so-called millionaire's amendment can be \nconsidered a reform--it probably will be challenged constitutionally as \nwell.\n  The point is, I do not know how bringing more money into politics, \nand more big money in politics, and having Senators--Democrats and \nRepublicans--running for office more dependent on the top 1 percent of \nthe population represents a reform.\n  If the Hagel proposal passes, I think that is a huge step backward. \nIf part of the Hagel proposal passes and we raise the limits on \nindividual contributions, then we have created a situation where I have \nno doubt incumbents will have a better chance of going after those big \nbucks.\n  Frankly, I think some of us probably will not be too successful, and, \nin any case, why in the world would you want a system more dependent \nupon the top 1 percent of the population who can make those \ncontributions?\n  I worry about a piece of legislation that has moved in this \ndirection. There were some good victories. I always will give credit to \ncolleagues for their good work, and I certainly give full credit to \nSenator McCain and Senator Feingold for their good work. But I am in \nprofound disagreement, first of all, with defeat of the amendment last \nweek which would have allowed people at the State level to organize--\ngrass roots politics at the State level. I am especially worried about \ncreating loopholes in this bill or moving toward taking off the cap \nwhen it comes to the raising of hard money. Again, I do not believe it \nis much of a reform.\n\n  I have heard some argue it is a fact that since 1974 there has been \ninflation and $1,000 is not worth $1,000. It is also a fact that one-\nquarter of 1 percent of the people in the country contribute over $200. \nIt is a fact that one-ninth of the people contribute over $1,000. It is \na fact that most people do not have that\n\n[[Page S2846]]\n\nkind of money and cannot make those kinds of contributions.\n  Eighty percent of the money in the 2000 elections was hard money. \nThat is PAC money included. If we take the limit off individual \ncontributions and raise those limits in the direction some of my \ncolleagues are talking about, we are moving toward politics yet even \nmore reliant on big money.\n  What in the world will we have accomplished if, in fact, we are \nultimately going to have the same amount of money spent but in a \ndifferent way, which now gives me the opportunity to talk about the \namendment I offer today, which will plug a loophole in this bill. It \nhas to do with the treatment of sham ads. The purpose of this amendment \nis simple: It is to ensure that the sham issue ads run by interest \ngroups fall under the same rules and prohibition that the McCain-\nFeingold legislation rightly imposes on corporations and union shame \nads.\n  I make this appeal to my colleagues: This was in the Shays-Meehan \nbill. This was in the original McCain-Feingold bill. I know people have \nhad to negotiate and make different political compromises, but from the \npoint of view of policy, what good will it do if we have a prohibition \nof raising soft money on political parties and a prohibition when it \ncomes to unions and corporations, but then other interest groups and \norganizations will be able to, using soft money, put ads on television? \nThe money will just shift.\n  My argument is twofold: No. 1, I do not think it is fair to labor and \ncorporations to say there is a prohibition on raising soft money for \nthese sham issue ads and then not applying that standard to every other \nkind of group or organization, whether they are left, right, or center.\n  No. 2, I think we are going to have a proliferation of new stealth \ngroups and organizations, all operating within this loophole, so that \nsoft money will shift from the parties to these sham ads. There is this \nhuge loophole and all those ads will go into the TV ads.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, I would rather point my finger at an opponent \nor another political party and say, look, your ads are not fair. I \nmight say they are scummy or poisonous. Instead, we will have a \nproliferation of these stealth sham ads. This is a huge loophole in \nthis bill.\n  In the original McCain-Feingold, the same rules and prohibitions that \napply to corporations and unions apply to all the other interest \ngroups. That is the way it should be. It is not fair to corporations \nand unions. We know it is a loophole. We know we will be back in a \ncouple years dealing with this problem, and there will be plenty of \nlawyers who will figure out how to create the organizations and put the \nmoney into the sham issue ads.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Minnesota is entirely correct; that \nis exactly what will happen.\n  I wonder if he would be willing to modify his amendment to eliminate \nthe exception for the media. The media are specifically exempt from all \nof these bills. If we are going to be pure, I say to my friend from \nMinnesota, why eliminate the media in the last 60 days if we are going \nto try to get true balance across the entire board?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I could ask my colleague, I am trying to \nunderstand.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Just a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I understand it is just a question. We may be focusing \nin on different issues. I am focusing on one problem; you may be \nfocusing on what you consider to be another problem.\n  I don't identify the media with the sham issue ads. Whether I agree \nor disagree, it seems to me, the media are there to inform people. So \nthe answer is no, I wouldn't want to include the media.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Obviously, the Senator gets better treatment on the \neditorial pages than the Senator from Kentucky, particularly in \nproximity to an election. I have noticed that in the last 60 days of an \nelection.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I understand my colleague's point. I guess I say with \na twinkle in my eye to the Senator from Kentucky, I think people in the \ncountry and certainly everybody in this Chamber should be very worried \nabout just this loophole in the shifting of soft money to these sham \nads. That is what we should worry about.\n  I see a whole bunch of interest groups and organizations that will do \nit. I see a whole bunch of new ones that will be created that are going \nto do it unless we go back to the original standard that was in the \noriginal bill, and that is basically in the Shays-Meehan bill coming \nout of the House. I don't think I would include the media or journalist \nbroadly defined, whether I agree or disagree with their particular \neditorials.\n  Now, the soft money and issue ad provisions of McCain-Feingold \nrestrict sham issue ads run by parties, corporations, and labor \nunions--that is important--but not by other groups. Limiting the ban in \nsuch a way seems to invite--this is what I am trying to say--a shift in \nspending to private groups in future elections, suggesting in the \nfuture years, even if this bill passes, that Congress is going to be \npredestined to revisit sham issue ad regulation to close yet another \nloophole in Federal election law.\n\n  I say as a matter of policy, why not do it now. And I continue to \nmake this argument.\n  I argue this loophole is already pretty wide. The Campaign Finance \nInstitute Task Force on Disclosure estimated that perhaps over $100 \nmillion was spent by independent groups trying to influence Federal \nelections with sham ads during the 2000 cycle. I don't think this comes \nas any surprise to the Presiding Officer or any of my colleagues. Many \ncolleagues have seen such ads run during their own election.\n  The Brennan Center for Justice and the University of Wisconsin found \nthese ads are overwhelmingly negative. Here is something I was not as \naware as I should have been--again, I think many know what I am talking \nabout; many have been the target of these negative ads; in some cases, \nsome have perhaps been the beneficiaries of the negative ads against \ntheir opponent if that is what you like--the Brennan Center for Justice \nfound specifically that more than 70 percent of these sham \nelectioneering ads sponsored by groups are attack ads that denigrate a \ncandidate's image or character as opposed to 20 percent, the good news, \nof the candidate-sponsored ads.\n  The point is, if you are concerned about poison politics, leave this \nloophole open, let these interest groups run these sham ads. \nOverwhelmingly they are negative, they can be vicious, they are poison \npolitics.\n  The study concluded:\n\n       . . . candidates and the American public can expect a wave \n     of television advertising in the last 60 days of an election, \n     casting aspersions on a candidate's integrity, health, or \n     intentions.\n\n  Why in the world do we want to keep this loophole? Why do we want to \npass a piece of legislation where the soft money is going to all shift \naway from the parties to these sham issue ads which are so \noverwhelmingly negative, which so overwhelmingly epitomize poison \npolitics?\n  These groups are accountable to virtually no one, to nobody. And \nfrankly, they do the dirty work for too many people in politics. I \nwould like to do away with poison politics.\n  Make no mistake about it, every Senator--I am not talking about ads, \nI say to the Presiding Officer, that are legitimately trying to \ninfluence policy debates--rather, this amendment only targets those ads \nthat we all know are trying to skew elections but until now have been \nable to skirt the law. I am not talking about legitimate policy ads. I \nam not talking about ads that run on any issue. I am talking about the \nads that end up bashing the candidate or whoever is running. They don't \nsay just vote against them. I am talking about sham issue ads. Any \ngroup, any organization, any individual can finance any kind of ad they \nwant. I am just applying the standard of this bill to where there is a \nhuge loophole.\n  Title II of McCain-Feingold consists of several sections known as the \nSnowe-Jeffords provision, named after similar legislation first \nproposed by my two colleagues from Maine and Vermont. This provision is \nan excellent first step toward curbing sham issue ads in that it \nprohibits such ads from being paid for with corporate or union treasury \nmoney.\n\n[[Page S2847]]\n\n  Under the bill as currently written, broadcast ads that mention a \nFederal candidate that are made within 60 days of a general election, \nor within 30 days of a primary, and are transmitted to an audience that \nincludes the electorate of the candidate, are defined as \n``electioneering communications.'' That is a pretty tight test.\n\n  Now the value of this difference, in addition, has been discussed \npreviously in this debate, so I will not spend a lot of time on its \nmerits now. Suffice it to say this amendment has been carefully \ncrafted, and I believe it is fully constitutional.\n  First, because it is totally unambiguous. It is perfectly obvious on \nthe face whether an ad falls under this definition. This means there \nwill be no ``chilling'' effect on protected speech, a concern raised by \nthe Supreme Court in the Buckley decision because a group would be \nuncertain if an issue ad they intended to run would be covered or not. \nIn other words, this is a bright-line test.\n  Second, the test is not overly broad. A comprehensive study conducted \nby the Brennan Center of ads run during the 1998 election found that \nonly two genuine issue ads out of the hundreds run would have been \ninappropriately defined as a sham ad. You want to have a tight test, \nyou want to have a high standard, that is what we do.\n  Snowe-Jeffords forces disclosure of all ads that fall under this \ndefinition, but under this bill, only corporations and unions may not \nspend funds from their treasury or soft money for this purpose. If a \ncorporation or union wishes to run electioneering communications, they \nmust use a PAC with contributions regulated by Federal law to do so. \nThe point is, they have to do it with hard money. The point is, every \nother group and organization, pick and choose--it can be the NRA, it \ncan be the Christian right, it can be the Sierra Club, it can be other \norganizations on the left, other organizations on the right, \norganizations representing every other kind of interest imaginable--\nthey can continue to use soft money and pour it into these sham ads.\n  Why are we not applying this prohibition to them? Why are we creating \nthis huge loophole? Do we want to pass a piece of legislation which is \njust like Jell-O? Push here, no, it doesn't go do parties and now it \nall goes into the sham issue ads.\n  We will not be doing right for people in the country if we pass a \nbill that does not get, really, very much big money out of politics but \njust changes the way it is spent. Maybe it will even be less \naccountable.\n  Here is the exemption in this bill for certain organizations: \n501(c)(4) groups and 527 groups--this exemption means that Sierra Club, \nNational Rifle Association, Club for Growth, or Republicans for Clean \nAir would be able to run whatever ads they want using soft money to \nfinance them. They would, for the first time, have to disclose how much \nthey are spending, but there is no bar to such groups running sham ads \nunder this bill.\n  Fine. They can disclose how much they are spending. Three weeks \nbefore election, they pour in an unlimited amount of money with poison \npolitics attacking Republicans, I say to the Chair, or Democrats, or \nindependents. Why do we want to have this loophole?\n  I want to see this soft money prohibition and this big money out. I \ndo not want to see us have this loophole in this piece of legislation \nwhich may mean that we passed a piece of legislation that has shifted \nall of this big money in the worst possible direction. I think this is \na mistake. Already these interest groups are spending over $100 million \non sham ads to influence our elections. Over 70 percent of them are \nbitterly personally negative.\n  So these groups already play a major role in our elections, and I \npredict, if we do not close this loophole now with this amendment, we \nwill be back here in 2 years or 4 years, or I hope and pray people do \nnot--maybe it will not be for another 20 or 30 years--trying to do what \nI am trying to do today. The reason will be that the center of power--\nplease listen to this--in Federal elections will move much closer to \nthese unaccountable groups because they will be able to pump millions \nand millions of dollars in soft money into these sham ads. That is \nwhere this money is going to go.\n  We will see what the other arguments on the floor are. I can \nanticipate some of them, and I will continue to make mine brief. But I \nsay to the Presiding Officer, I do not know how many votes this \namendment will get. I really do not know. But I will tell you this. My \nwife's family are from Appalachia--Harlan County, and Letcher County in \nKentucky--the Isons. They talk about poor cities. When I am 80 years \nold, I at least am going to be able to tell my grandchildren--I am \nsorry, I have grandchildren now--my great grandchildren, great, great, \ngreat grandchildren, I hope and pray--that I laid down this amendment, \nI tried to close this loophole, I tried to do something that for sure \nwould get more of the big money out of politics.\n  I do not know what the vote will be, but I know I am here, and I know \nI have to be a reformer, and I know I have to make this bill better. I \nhave to lay down this marker just as I tried to do last week in an \namendment that should have passed. I cannot believe that colleagues, \nauthors of this bill, did not support it. I cannot believe that during \nthe vote I had people telling me: I don't want my State legislature or \npeople in my State telling me how to finance my campaign--as if it were \nour campaign. I could not believe it.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I could not believe Republicans, who \nalways argue for States rights, voted against the proposition that \nevery State ought to decide whether or not they wanted on a voluntary \nbasis to apply some system of voluntary or partial public financing. \nTalk about encouraging grassroots politics. People in the country say: \nWe can get at it in Arizona. They already have. You have clean money, \nclean elections. We can get at it in Minnesota, in Nevada. We don't \nknow if we can ever be effective in D.C. toward public financing, but \nwe can do it right here, we don't have to take expensive air trips to \nD.C. And it is defeated. Now I am trying to plug this loophole, and \ntomorrow or the next day we are heading towards raising spending \nlimits.\n\n  Let me be clear, this amendment does not say any special interest \ngroup cannot run an ad. A lot of interests are special. That is fine. \nThey are special to the people they represent, and sometimes they are \nspecial to the public interest, depending on your point of view. It \nonly says these groups and organizations need to comply with the same \nrules as unions and corporations. Groups covered by my amendment can \nset up PACs, they can solicit contributions, and they can run all the \nads they want. All this amendment says is they cannot use their regular \ntreasury money. They can't use the soft money contributions to run \nthese ads.\n  This is an amendment about fairness. It is an amendment about \nleveling the playing field.\n  I know some of my colleagues may come to the floor and oppose this \namendment because, while they believe as a matter of policy this \namendment is the right thing to do, they fear the Court may find that \ncovering these special interest groups under the Snowe-Jeffords \nelectioneering communication provision is unconstitutional. And, in all \nhonesty, this is probably a question upon which reasonable reformers \ncan disagree. But it is a debate worth having. I think this provision \ncan withstand constitutional scrutiny, but it is probably not a slam-\ndunk.\n  Still, in a moment I want to talk about why I think the courts will \nuphold this amendment. But before I do--this has to be in the summary \nof this amendment tomorrow, before people vote--I want to make one \nimportant point. I have drafted this amendment to be fully severable. I \nhave drafted this amendment to be fully severable. In other words, no \none can suggest that even if the courts find this amendment \nunconstitutional, it would drag down the rest of this bill or even \njeopardize the other provisions of Snowe-Jeffords.\n  This creates a totally new section under title II of this bill. Under \nthe worst case scenario, if the Supreme Court rules that groups covered \nby my amendment cannot be constitutionally barred from using treasury \nfunds for these sham issue ads, then the rest of the legislation will \nbe completely unaffected. The rest of the legislation will be \ncompletely unaffected. And we are going to have a debate on \nseverability anyway.\n  This is what gets to me. Colleagues will come out here--they did it \non the\n\n[[Page S2848]]\n\namendment to allow States to light a candle and move forward on public \nfinancing--and they will say: Oh, no, if you get a majority vote for \nyour amendment, then it could bring down the bill. The argument is the \nmajority of Senators vote for the amendment and then later on the same \nmajority of the Senators who vote for the amendment say they are going \nto vote against the bill because they just voted for an amendment? Come \non. I am just getting frustrated out here. Let's vote for these \namendments on the basis of whether they are good policy and whether or \nnot they represent reform.\n  I want to talk about this bill from the point of view of the \nconstitutional arguments. I do it with a little bit of trepidation. I \nam not a lawyer, but I can certainly marshal some evidence for my point \nof view.\n  A February 20, 1998, a letter signed by 20 constitutional scholars, \nincluding a former legislative director of the ACLU, which analyzed the \nSnowe-Jeffords provision on electioneering argued that, even though the \nprovision was written to exempt certain organizations, the \norganizations that I don't want to exempt from the ban on \nelectioneering communication, such omission was not constitutionally \nnecessary. And the scholars noted:\n\n       The careful crafting of the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment stands \n     in stark contrast to the clumsy and sweeping prohibition that \n     Congress originally drafted in FECA. Unlike the FECA \n     definition of electioneering, the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment \n     would withstand constitutional challenge without having to \n     resort to the device of narrowing the statute with magic \n     words. Congress could, if it wished, apply the basic rules \n     that currently govern electioneering to all spending that \n     falls within this more realistic definition of \n     electioneering. Congress could, for example, declare that \n     only individuals and PACs (and the most grassroots of \n     nonprofit organizations) could engage in electioneering that \n     falls within this broadened definition. It could impose \n     fundraising restrictions, prohibiting individuals from \n     pooling large contributions toward such electioneering.\n\n  I argue colleagues can vote for this amendment in good conscience, \nbut let me take a few moments to address in some detail and try to \npreempt some of the contentions we are likely to hear on the other \nside.\n  The main argument that I think colleagues will hear advanced against \nthe constitutionality of this amendment is based upon a 1986 Supreme \nCourt case called the Federal Election Commission v. Massachusetts \nCitizens for Life. In that case, a 5-4 decision, the Court found a \nflier produced by the group that urged voters to vote ``pro-life'' and \nmentioned candidates could be paid for using the group's regular \ntreasury funds. But I think the five reasons why the Court would find \nthis amendment, which is different constitutionally, is:\n\n  First, it is important to note tonight at the onset that this \namendment--and indeed the Snowe-Jeffords motion already in the bill--\nonly covers broadcast communications. It does not cover print \ncommunications such as the one issue in the Massachusetts Citizens for \nLife. Indeed, the group argued that the flier should have been \nprotected as a news editorial. Snowe-Jeffords specifically exempts \neditorial communications.\n  Second, the Court based its decision in part on the logic that the \nregulation of election-related communication was overly burden to small \ngrassroots organizations.\n  Under our amendment--and under Snowe-Jeffords the group would have to \nraise $10,000 on broadcast ads that mention a candidate 60 days before \nthe election before their provision would kick in.\n  Third, the Federal law that the Court objected to was extremely \nbroad. And the Court specifically cited that fact as one of the reasons \nit reached its decision, saying ``regulation that would produce such a \nresult demands far more precision than [current law] provides.''\n  This amendment, which is patterned after the Snowe-Jeffords \namendment, has that provision.\n  Finally, and most importantly of all about this Court decision, the \nCourt actually argued that the election communications of nonprofit \ncorporations, such as the one covered in this amendment, could be \nregulated once it reached a certain level. In fact, this is what the \nCourt said:\n\n       Should MCFL's independent spending become so extensive that \n     the organization's major purpose may be regarded as campaign \n     activity, the corporation would be classified as a political \n     committee. As such, it would automatically be subject to the \n     obligations and restrictions applicable to those groups whose \n     primary objective is to influence political campaigns.\n\n  Since this decision, these groups have operated outside the law with \nimpunity.\n  Take, for example, the organization Republicans for Clean Air. \nDespite its innocuous name, this was an organization created for the \nsole purpose of promoting the candidacy of George W. Bush during the \nlast Republican primary election. That is another example, again with \nan unlimited amount of advertising soft money. And we now have a \nloophole in this bill that will enable them to do it again.\n  If you are going to say corporations and unions can't do this 60 days \nbefore an election--they can't finance these sham issue ads for soft \nmoney--it should apply to all of these groups and organizations.\n  If you do not, it is not only unfair to unions and corporations, you \nare going to have a proliferation of these organizations. Republicans \nfor Clean Air, Democrats for Clean Air, People Who Do Not Like Any \nParty For Clean Air, Liberals For Clean Air, Conservatives For Clean \nAir, Citizens For Dirty Air--I don't know what it will be. Another \nexample is the Club For Growth. This was an outfit that ran attack ads \nagainst moderate Republican congressional candidates in the primary.\n  Both groups, which would be covered by my amendment, are not covered \nby this bill. But they could clearly be banned from running these sham \nissue ads from their treasury funds under the Massachusetts Citizens \nfor Life decision. It is that simple.\n  By the way, this is amazing. In the 1986 decision, the Court \nconcluded:\n\n       The FEC maintains the inapplicability of current law to \n     MCFL to open the door to massive, undisclosed spending by \n     similar entities . . . We see no such danger.\n\n  In all due respect to this Supreme Court, it is clear that the FEC \nhad it exactly right and the Supreme Court had it exactly wrong. If we \nhave seen money to the tune of $100 million this last election, it was \nthese sham issue ads.\n  I am going to say it won more time. I don't know whether this \namendment will pass. I do not know whether it will get one vote. But I \ntell you this: I am going to be able to say later on that I at least \ntried to get this reform amendment passed. This is a huge loophole. In \nthe Shays-Meehan bill, they plugged the loophole. In the original \nFeingold bill, they plugged the loophole.\n  I will say it again. How can you say to corporations and to labor \nthat they can't run these sham issue ads in the 60-day period before \nelections and the 30-day period before primaries but at the same time \nnot apply that prohibition to every other group and organization, \nwhatever cause they represent?\n  And, No. 2, don't you realize that what everybody is going to do is \nset up another one of these groups and organizations? Then you will \nhave a proliferation of influence groups and organizations. And \nindividuals with all of this wealth and organizations that want to make \nthese huge soft money contributions will make their soft money \ncontributions to these sham issue ads run by all of these groups and \norganizations, which under this loophole can operate with impunity.\n  We are going to take soft money out of parties and we are going to \nput it into the sham issue ads. Frankly, I don't want my colleague from \nKentucky to count me as an ally. If I am going to be the subject of \nthese kinds of poisonous ads, I would rather point my finger at the \nRepublicans. Or if I were a Republican, I would rather point my finger \nat the Democrats. Or I would rather point my finger at the opposing \ncandidates. I wouldn't want to be put in a position of not knowing \nexactly who these different groups and organizations were with all of \nthis soft money pouring into these poisonous ads in the last 3 weeks \nbefore the election. That is the loophole that we have.\n  I am not telling you that some of these groups and organizations, \nright, left, and center, are going to necessarily like this. But I am \ntelling you, if you want to be consistent, that we have to support this \namendment. If we don't want a huge loophole that is going to create \nmaybe just as much soft money in politics as now, you have to support \nthis amendment.\n\n[[Page S2849]]\n\n  If you want to try to get as much of the big money out of politics as \npossible, you have to support this amendment. If you hate bitter, \npersonal, poison politics, you have to support this amendment. Because, \nbefore the Presiding Officer came in, I was saying that the Brennan \nCenter said that 70 percent of the money spent by these sham ads by \nthese groups and organizations is personal, negative, and going after \npeople's character. I am glad to say that only about 20 percent of the \ncandidates' ads do that.\n  The Campaign Finance Institute at George Washington University in a \nFebruary 2001 report found this to be the case. This is the quote.\n\n       These undisclosed interest group communications are a major \n     force in U.S. politics, not little oddities, or blips on a \n     screen.\n\n  Maybe when the Supreme Court issued its ruling in 1986 it was a blip \non the screen. But today we are talking about tens of millions of \ndollars that go into these sham issue ads. These groups and \norganizations have become major players in our election. But the law \ndoesn't hold them accountable.\n  One more time: I think Senators are aware of this. Some of you have \nbeen candidates in which these special interest groups have come in and \ncarpet bombed your State with these sham issue ads. Maybe they were run \nagainst you. Maybe they were run against your opponent. In some recent \nelections there have been more special interest group ads run than by \nthe candidates of a party.\n  May I make clear what is going on? We have to plug this loophole. If \nyou just have the prohibition on the soft money to the party, and then \nyou apply it to the sham issue ads by labor and corporations, and you \ndon't apply it to any other group or organization--the 501(c)(4) groups \nand the 527 groups; the National Rifle Association, the Sierra Club, \nthe Club for Growth, Republicans for Clean Air, and the list goes on \nand on--all you are doing is, No. 1, being patently unfair, by any \nstandards of fairness, to corporations and labor, and, No. 2, you are \ninviting all of the soft money to go to these other groups and \norganizations. There will be a proliferation of them. We will have sham \nissue ads. There will be carpet bombing in all of our States and \ncarpetbagging. Who knows where these ads come from?\n\n  Even if all my other arguments on constitutionality fall--and I think \nthey are pretty sound--I think there is an excellent reason to believe \nthat the Court today would look at this issue in a completely different \nway than it did in 1986.\n  As I said before my colleague came in, I have written a separate \nprovision. This is a separate section of the bill. Even if this section \nwere declared unconstitutional, I have written it so that it is \nseverable, so it would not apply to Snowe-Jeffords or the rest of the \nbill. It does not put the rest of the bill in jeopardy at all.\n  I think it is on constitutional ground, but it does not put the bill \nin jeopardy. We are going to have a vote on the whole issue of \nseverability anyway. So no one can come out here and say, if this \namendment is adopted, it will jeopardize the constitutionality of the \nbill.\n  As I said before, I am getting tired of this other argument, which is \nthat if a majority of the Members vote for the amendment, then this \nwill bring the bill down. How does that happen--a majority of the \nMembers vote for the amendment, and then a majority of the Members turn \naround and vote against the bill because of the amendment that the \nmajority of the people just voted for? I do not think there is anything \nwrong with trying to strengthen legislation.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for this amendment.\n  I want to shout it from the mountaintop, I want to be on record, I \nthink it would be a major mistake not to close this loophole. If we do \nnot close this loophole, we are going to see millions of dollars of \nsoft money flow to these special interest groups, we are going to see \nmore and more of these sham issue ads with their shrill, bitter \nattacks. I think people in the country, and people in Minnesota, are \ngoing to wonder, why didn't we fix this problem when we had a chance.\n  I think this amendment adds significantly to this bill. It makes it a \nbetter bill. It is better for politics. It is better for public policy. \nIt is better for all of us. And most important of all, it is better for \nthe people in this country and it is better for the people in \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the quorum call I \nwill initiate be charged equally against both sides.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before we go to a quorum call, I would \nlike to say one thing. I think it comes with being 5 foot 5\\1/2\\. I \nwon't say that we not go into a quorum call, but if people oppose this \namendment, they should come out and debate it, really. If they oppose \nthis amendment, they should come out here and debate it.\n  Mr. President, if we go into a quorum call equally divided, how much \ntime do we have? Are we moving on to the Hollings amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 48 minutes; the \nSenator from Kentucky has 90 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. We move on to the Hollings amendment at what time?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  It is my understanding we move to the Hollings constitutional \namendment at 2 o'clock. That being the case, there are 45 minutes \nremaining. It is my understanding that the Senator has used about 45 \nminutes. Is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Approximately. So half of the next 45 minutes would be \ncharged to the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. OK. I say to my colleague, I will reserve that. I hope \nat some point in time before the vote tomorrow I will have an \nopportunity to respond to whatever criticism there might be of this \namendment. I have done a lot of work getting ready for this amendment. \nI am ready for the debate. I am not talking about my colleague from \nNevada, but I think the Senators who oppose this----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I, of course, supported the Senator from Minnesota in his \nother amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. I believed that the amendment the Senator offered last week \ndid nothing other than to allow States to do what they believe is \nappropriate. That was not adopted. I was disappointed it was not \nadopted because I think there is so much talk that goes on in this body \nabout States rights, and there was no better example than that that I \nhave seen in this body in a long time in talking about States rights. \nIf a State did not want to do as indicated in the Senator's amendment, \nthen they would not have to do it.\n  So I appreciate very much the work the Senator has put on that \namendment, and this amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  If I may, before we go into a quorum call, I will take just a couple \nminutes.\n  I repeat one more time what I said about the whole question of \nconstitutionality. On the whole question of the Snowe-Jeffords \nprovision, of any other provision, there could be a challenge. This \namendment uses the same sham issue test, ad test, as the Snowe-Jeffords \nlanguage in the bill. I think it is constitutional. But if bulletproof \nconstitutionality is the standard, then I do not know why we adopted \nthe Domenici millionaire's amendment because I think that most \ndefinitely subjects this bill to a constitutional challenge--arguing \nthat millionaires have the same first amendment rights as the rest of \nus.\n  Most important of all, this amendment is fully severable. If the \nCourt does strike it down, it is a separate provision; the rest of the \nbill will be unaffected. We are also going to have a separate vote on \nthe whole question of severability. I certainly plan on voting for \nseverability.\n  So I want to make it clear, I hope Senators will vote on this on the \nmerits of the proposal. Don't get the soft money out of this place--\nparties--and let it shift to these sham ads. Don't have a prohibition \nthat applies to corporations and unions and none of these other groups \nand organizations. It is not fair to them, and there will be a\n\n[[Page S2850]]\n\nproliferation of these groups and organizations. The soft money will \nflow to them; and we are going to have these sham ads which are \ndestructive and personal and bitter, and that is going to become \nAmerican politics.\n  This amendment plugs that loophole. Vote up or down on the basis of \nwhether you think it is good public policy. Come out here, someone, and \ntell me why it is not good public policy.\n  Well, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and the time will be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is a book. I don't agree with all \nof its analyses. It has a catchy title and was written by Jim \nHightower. The title is, ``If The Gods Had Meant Us To Vote, They'd \nHave Given Us Candidates.''\n  The reason I mention this book is there is this one graphic that is \ninteresting: The percentage of the American people who donate money to \nnational political candidates. Ninety-six percent of the American \npeople donate zero dollars. The percentage who donate up to $200 is 4 \npercent. The percentage who donate $200 to $1,000 is .09 percent. And \nthe percentage who donate $1,000 to $10,000 is .05 percent. The \npercentage who donate from $10,000 to $100,000--and he points out in \nhis book that you need a magnifying glass for this one--is .002 \npercent.\n  The percentage who donated $100,000 or more--you need a Hubble \ntelescope, he says, for this one--is .0001 percent.\n  I use this graph from my friend Jim Hightower's book for two reasons. \nFirst of all, I have an amendment that tries to make sure a lot of this \nbig money doesn't get--it is like Jell-O, you push it here, it shifts. \nIt shifts from the party into the sham issue ads, not to the \ncorporation, not to labor, but to every other group and organization. \nThere will be a proliferation of it. This amendment plugs that \nloophole.\n  The Shays-Meehan bill basically has the same approach. This was \noriginally part of the Feingold-McCain bill. I made it clear this \nprovision is 100-percent severable. This is a separate provision. In \nany case, we will have a debate on severability. I have made it clear \nit is hard to make the argument that when a majority vote, you can't \nmake the argument that to vote for this reform would bring the bill \ndown.\n  I think we voted for other reforms that have a better chance of \nbringing down the bill. But it doesn't make sense. You say the majority \nvoted for this amendment; now they are going to vote against the bill \nthat has this amendment.\n  The other point I want to make is with this graph, what we are doing \nhere is voting down reform amendments, such as the amendment last week \nthat would have allowed States to light a candle and move forward with \nsome voluntary system of partial or public financing, or maybe vote \ndown this amendment, which would be a terrible mistake.\n  We are going to revisit this. This is going to be the loophole, I \npromise you. Let's do the job now, while we can. At the same time, they \nwant to raise the hard money limits. Now we are supposed to feel better \nthat we have gotten rid of a lot of soft money. That is what is \nsignificant about this effort by Senators McCain and Feingold. That is \na significance that cannot be denied. But the problem is, it may shift \nto the sham issue ad. The other problem is, since 80 percent of the \nmoney spent in 2000 was hard money, PAC money included, you are going \nto raise the hard money limits.\n  It is crystal clear what people are talking about with one another. \nWhy are we going to do that? Why are we going to bring yet more big \nmoney into politics and make people running for office more dependent \non the top 1 percent of the population? How did that get to be a \nreform? And then I hear Senators say, well, the point is, if you go \nfrom 1 to 3 or 2 to 6, we will have to spend only one-third of the \ntime.\n  Permit me to be skeptical. Everybody will be involved in this obscene \nmoney chase. They will be just chasing $3,000 contributions and $6,000 \ncontributions. Somehow, people in Minnesota are going to be more \nreassured that we are putting more emphasis on the people who can \nafford to make $3,000 or $6,000, or maybe it will go from 1 to 2, or 2 \nto 4, and we are doing something that gives people more confidence in a \npolitical process that is more dependent upon the people who have the \nbig bucks.\n  I raise this because I want to know why I am not having a debate on \nmy amendment. I would like to know why Senators don't come out here and \nspeak against this amendment. I don't mind people disagreeing or having \nother points of view. That is what it is about. But I would be \ninterested in the opponents coming out here and opposing this \namendment. Don't just wait until the last 5 minutes and get up and say \nwe oppose the amendment, or we oppose it because there has been an \nagreement to oppose the amendment, because it will bring down the bill, \nor because it is not constitutional. I am trying to deal with \narguments, but maybe there are arguments I don't know about.\n  This is very similar to what passed in the House. Well, it is my \nnature to like everybody and have a twinkle in my eye, so it looks as \nif in the world's greatest deliberative body, that there is not going \nto be a lot of deliberation or debate on this. I will have other \namendments. This is a reform amendment, and this is the right thing to \ndo.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the balance of my time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will momentarily yield back all the \ntime in opposition to this amendment.\n\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on this amendment \noccur in a stacked sequence at 6 p.m. with 15 minutes to be equally \ndivided between Senators Wellstone and Feingold.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I want to \nmake clear that my understanding is that we will vote on the \nconstitutional amendment of Senator Hollings, and after that vote there \nwill be 15 minutes of debate?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, and then a second vote.\n  Mr. REID. No objection, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, consistent with the agreement, I yield \nback the balance of the time in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if someone else has business involving this \namendment, I will be happy to yield the floor. However, in the meantime \nI will take the opportunity to speak on the constitutional amendment to \nbe offered at 2 o'clock by my friend, the junior Senator from the State \nof South Carolina, Mr. Hollings.\n  I have been involved in debating this issue of campaign finance \nreform for many years. In fact, when I first came to the Senate I could \nnot believe I'd ever be involved in another election like the one I \nwent through in 1986. But I have been through two since then. And in \neach campaign, the money problem got more magnified and worse. So I am \nhappy that we are having this debate. I am happy we are having the \ndebate, and I extend my appreciation to Senators McCain and Feingold \nfor giving us this opportunity. I also applaud and congratulate the two \nleaders, Senators Lott and Daschle, for setting up a procedure where we \ncan have this free-wheeling debate. I think it has been very good. It \nhas been great for the Senate. I think this best represents what this \ninstitution is all about.\n  Underlying this debate is the threshold question: Are we able to \nwithstand legal challenges to whatever we wind up doing here, or is \nthis just a waste of time because the bill will be struck down by the \ncourts as unconstitutional, as an infringement on rights guaranteed by \nthe first amendment? I think the bill is constitutional, but I\n\n[[Page S2851]]\n\nhave been surprised by the courts before and I can't say with certainty \nthat is the case.\n  Some say it is constitutional, some say it is not constitutional. We \nhave heard from renowned legal experts from all over the country, in \nletters and in newspaper opinion columns, and in testimony they have \ngiven to Committees of Congress. There are mixed opinions as to whether \nor not this legislation is going to be upheld as constitutional.\n  With my legal background, I personally think there is a sufficient \nfoundation for this bill to withstand the parameters of our \nConstitution. I think it certainly should be considered constitutional. \nBut many of my colleagues in this Chamber have been prosecutors, \nattorneys, who have served in various capacities, including teaching \nthe law, and they have some disagreement as to whether or not this bill \nis constitutional.\n  So it is fair to say that there is a lot of disagreement as to \nwhether or not what we are doing is going to be upheld as \nconstitutional. Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have, on \nvarious occasions, disagreed. I believe it is, but many others \ndisagree.\n  I repeat, we have heard many lawyers and experts analyze not only \nwhat we are doing with this bill, but what the Supreme Court said in \ntheir decision in the Buckley v. Valeo case. And after all the experts \nhave weighed in, what we are left with is that we really don't know \nright now.\n  Because of this uncertainty, I signed on a long time ago to Senator \nHollings' effort to amend the Constitution, to overrule Buckley v. \nValeo.\n  In effect, this constitutional amendment will allow us in the \nCongress of the United States to set financial limits and do other \nthings to improve the election process in our country. \nConstitutionally, until we do that, I do not know how far we can go in \nregulating campaign finance money. I do not know how far we can go in \nregulating issue ads, even the ones that are deceptive or misleading. I \ndo not know how far we can go in regulating how corporations or unions \nspend their money in political campaigns.\n  In spite of my positive feeling about this underlying legislation, \nthere is an uncertainty hanging over this debate like a cloud. Some \nMembers will not vote for certain amendments because of the \nconstitutional uncertainty. Other Members want to insert amendments \nthey believe to be unconstitutional. They do it for other reasons; that \nis, they want to kill this bill.\n  This week we will debate the question of severability, whether the \nbill as a whole stands or falls if any one of the provisions is struck \ndown by the courts. When we take this issue up, the issue of \nconstitutionality moves front and center to this debate.\n  Every one of my colleagues who has questioned the constitutionality \nof any portion of this bill should support the Hollings-Specter \nbipartisan constitutional amendment because that amendment will clarify \nonce and for all the power of this body, the Congress of the United \nStates, to regulate campaign finance in this country.\n  In simple terms, the amendment says the Congress shall have the power \nto set reasonable limits on campaign contributions and expenditures and \nthat Congress shall have the power to enforce this provision through \nappropriate legislation. In other words, it gives this body the power \nto do something about reforming our broken campaign finance system in a \nway that is unambiguous and free from doubt. The amendment does not \nrequire that any of the current reform bills be enacted. It does not \nmatter whether one supports McCain-Feingold, the Hagel bill, or any \nother approach, or whether one is opposed to reform entirely. Even if \nthe amendment is enacted, one can still vote against specific reform \nlegislation.\n  Even those who are opposed to any kind of reform should support this \namendment because it at least makes clear what we can and cannot do \nwith campaign finance reform. It allows us to do what we were sent here \nto do: Debate the issue, whatever it might be, consider alternatives to \nwhatever that issue might be, and vote our beliefs, what our \nconstituents believe, in a way that is final, binding, and free from \ndoubt or ambiguity.\n  I recognize that amending the Constitution is not something to be \ntaken lightly. Our Constitution is rightfully the envy of the world for \nit establishes firm and lasting rules for our Federal Government and \nour State governments and gives the people rights that cannot be taken \naway. We have been studied by historians and scholars, we have been \nanalyzed as a country, and everyone agrees the reason we have had our \nlasting legacy of freedom is because of our Constitution.\n  We cannot change it on a whim, that is for sure, and we cannot change \nit in the heat of battle or in a passing moment of passion, but in \norder to be lasting, while still remaining just, it must be flexible to \nchange with changing times. That is what the Constitution is all about. \nWe should, in general, only amend it in response to a national crisis \nthat cannot be resolved any other way.\n  I believe we are attempting to resolve this campaign crisis. I say to \nthe Presiding Officer and all those within the sound of my voice that \nwe do have a crisis. When you have a State the size of the State of \nNevada, and in 1998 two candidates, equally financed, spent over $20 \nmillion in the State of Nevada--that is a crisis.\n\n  I repeat, Mr. President, what I have said on this floor before. My \nfriend and colleague, the other Senator from the State of Nevada, and I \nwere involved in a bitterly contested race in 1998, a race in which we \nboth spent about 4 million of hard dollars, campaign dollars. We spent \n$8 million between us. Then our State parties spent another $6 million \neach, or $12 million between them, on issue ads. That is $20 million \ntotal. These State party issue ads were all negative against my \nopponent and all negative against me. I do not think they did anything \nto better the body politic. They certainly did nothing to better \npeople's feelings about who I think were two good people running for \noffice.\n  That was not the end of it. Then we had independent expenditures \ncoming in: the National Rifle Association, the League of Conservation \nVoters. They would have ads running against me; people who believed in \nme would have ads running against my opponent. I have no idea how much \nmoney these outside groups spent, but probably another $2 million to $3 \nmillion.\n  The State of Nevada at that time had less than 2 million people. That \nis too much. Something is wrong with the system. If there were ever a \nnational crisis, something pressing on a national scope, it is this. \nTwo-thirds of all voters do not even bother going to the polls. These \npeople should be voting.\n  My wife and I have a home in Nevada. We also have a home here in \nWashington. We moved from a home where we raised our children to a \nsmaller place, a condo. Somebody doing some work there boasted to my \nwife that he did not vote. It was his way of protesting. Protesting \nwhat? I guess the system that he thinks does not meet his expectations. \nI met the man. He is a very nice man. It is too bad, but I think a lot \nof these negative ads have turned off people like him.\n  There is a national crisis. We should resolve it by amending our \nConstitution. Make no mistake, we are experiencing, I repeat, a \nnational crisis, a crisis of confidence. The American people have lost \ntrust in their government. Two thirds of the voters do not bother going \nto the polls. We need to do something about this.\n  The American people have lost trust in us. That is too bad. People on \nthat side of the aisle, 50 Republicans, and where I stand, 50 \nDemocrats--these are good people on both sides of the aisle, people who \nyou can trust on a handshake; we do not need a written contract, we do \nnot even need a handshake. All we need is someone saying what they are \ngoing to do, because they are good and trustworthy people.\n  What is going on in the campaign process is hurting us, hurting the \nbody politic, hurting our country, hurting the State of Nevada. Because \nthe public does not see us as trustworthy. We need to do something \nabout it.\n  I appreciate the Senator from South Carolina, who has spent a \nlifetime doing things that are right. In South Carolina, he recognized \nthe evils of segregation a long time ago and as a young Governor spoke \nout against it. He realized the imbalance of segregated schools, and he \nparticipated in\n\n[[Page S2852]]\n\nthe Brown v. Board of Education brief writing. Fritz Hollings from \nSouth Carolina is a fine man. I could go on for a long period of time \nabout what a fine man he is and what he has done to better the State of \nSouth Carolina and our country. He is an example of why people should \nfeel good about their Government because, even though there are not \nmany people who have the experience and the background of Fritz \nHollings, there are good people in this body.\n  I admire Senator Hollings for offering this constitutional amendment. \nHe has mounted this effort on a number of occasions. He hasn't gotten a \ntwo-thirds vote--that is too bad--and I do not think he will get two-\nthirds votes this afternoon, and that is a shame.\n  When Americans do not trust their elected officials, when they do not \nthink they have their best interests at heart, that is a crisis. When \naverage Americans think they are shut out of the system because they \ncannot afford to make campaign contributions--that is a crisis.\n  I used to have fundraising events where I raised money $5, $10, $20 \nan effort. People would give money in small amounts, and it would add \nup. When I was elected Lieutenant Governor in the State of Nevada in \n1970, I had as much money as anybody running for Lieutenant Governor; I \nwon; I spent $75,000. That was slightly different from 1998 spending--\nover $10 million.\n\n  We need to do something. Average Americans should believe they can \nparticipate in the system. That is why I admire my friend from \nMinnesota, who offered an amendment that says in the State of \nMinnesota, in the States of Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, South \nCarolina, if the State wants to implement some type of matching funds \nsystem or do something else in the political process as far as money is \nconcerned, let them do it; it should be up to them. Unfortunately, we \nvoted that down.\n  We need a constitutional amendment. I believe the system is broken. I \nknow Senators McCain and Feingold are doing the best they can to fix \nit. I support them in their efforts. If we pass the bill the way it is, \nand it still has a lot of problems, then there are things we will have \nto come back and fix. But if we don't take care of McCain-Feingold \nhere, we will not be able to come back and debate it for another few \nCongresses, years from now.\n  No matter what we do in McCain-Feingold, we need to make sure the \nBuckley case is overturned so we can fix the many parts of the system \nthat are simply broken. We need to pass the amendment that will be \noffered this afternoon. It is the first step in being able to even talk \nabout reform.\n  I remind my colleagues of an important point. Let's do our duty and \nsend the amendment on to the States. It takes two-thirds of the States \nto ratify an amendment to the Constitution. Let's at least give them a \nchance to decide. Give Senator Hollings what he needs; that is, a two-\nthirds vote out of this body.\n  The American people believe we are taking advantage of a broken and \ncorrupt system to keep ourselves in power. In my personal opinion, the \n``millionaire'' amendment that passed last week was just that; it was \nmore legislation to take care of us. In my opinion, the ``millionaire'' \namendment was a guise to help incumbents.\n  For example, under the amendment that passed last week, if I decide \nto run for reelection in 2004, say I start to campaign with $3 million \nin the bank, money donated by ordinary people. As I indicated, since we \ndon't go out and raise money at $20 a whack anymore, we have to raise \nhundreds and thousands of dollars, and with soft money it is tens of \nthousands of dollars. Say I have hard money in the bank amounting to $3 \nmillion and soft money is no longer allowed. That would be a miracle, \nbut say that is the case. Under the amendment that passed, some poor \nguy or woman who runs against me--I don't mean ``poor'' in the sense of \nnot having anything--say they mortgage their home, and take a loan out \nsomeplace, and spend their own money. I would be able to increase my \nfundraising limits because they mortgaged their home. This is what the \nmillionaire amendment does. It has nothing to do with millionaires. It \nhas everything to do with protecting us. It is an incumbent advantage \nmeasure in this underlying bill. I believe that was not the right way \nto go.\n  I hope the efforts of my friend from South Carolina bear fruit. I \nbelieve what he is doing is the right thing to do. In the court's 5-4 \ndecision in Buckley v. Valeo; five justices voted for, four against it. \nWe have to pass a law, as we do many times, to correct what five \nmembers of the Supreme Court have done. They are the Supreme Court, and \nthey, in effect, invite us to change what we don't like about what they \nhave done. I accept that invitation.\n\n  I invite my colleagues to change the Constitution and overturn \nBuckley v. Valeo, so we can do what this country needs us to do. So \nthat we can look at what happens with the campaign finance system and \nbe able to fix a little bit here, fix a little bit there, and not have \nto go through this unwieldy procedure of debating whether it is \nconstitutional, unconstitutional, a first amendment problem, or not a \nfirst amendment problem.\n  I think we should do something to restore the confidence of the \npeople, to let them become more involved in the process. I think \npassing this amendment is a step in the right direction.\n  I have spoken for 25 minutes, I say to my friend from South Carolina, \nextolling the virtues of this constitutional amendment. I have not only \nextolled the virtues of the constitutional amendment but I have \nextolled your virtues.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You have gone too far now.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator, but the Senator from Nevada has \ngone a little far. I want him to be believed about this constitutional \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. I hope I am believed about this. The Senator is doing the \nright thing. We have a constitutional crisis in this country created by \nBuckley v. Valeo, and we should change it. We should not have to go \nthrough this process we have been working through all last week and \nthis week: Is this constitutional? Is that provision constitutional? \nAre we violating the first amendment?\n  I think this constitutional amendment should get a two-thirds vote. \nIf people don't like McCain-Feingold, they still should vote yes. If \nthey like it, they still should vote yes. I am a proud sponsor of the \nSenator's amendment. I can't express publicly enough how much I admire \nand appreciate the work of the Senator on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nNevada. He is more than gracious to me personally. It is reciprocated \nbecause there is no one I admire more in the Senate. I have watched him \nover the years. He is so conscientious. And what is wrong this minute: \nWe really are not conscientious about our duties and responsibilities \nin the Senate.\n  I will mention the no-no word, ``corruption,'' and I do so very \nsincerely because the system has become corrupted.\n  Now the distinguished Presiding Officer never had a part in this, but \nI can say the rest of the Members have, except the newcomers. That is \nthe best way to put it.\n  Welcome to the $7 million club. That is the average cost of the last \ncampaign in order to become a Senator. Unless you have $7 million by \nthe time of the next election, you are not going to be able to keep the \njob. Therein is the corruption. Our effort, our determination, our \nendeavor, is to keep the job rather than doing the job. That is why we \ndon't have anybody here but us chickens. This Chamber is intentionally \nempty. Why? Because we are all out trying to get that $7 million in \norder to continue to serve. Mr. President, that's nearly $1.2 million a \nyear, each year, for 6 years. That's more than $3,000 every day \nincluding Sundays and Christmas Day. I am a little behind this morning \nbecause I have not collected $3,000. In fact, I am behind this past \nweek because I didn't get my $22,000. And others believe they are \nbehind. So the whole system now of considering the people's problems \nand their business is corrupted.\n  I was here back in 1966 and early on in the war in Vietnam. It amused \nme the other day when they said we finally had some debate going on in \nthe Senate.\n  The reason we have a debate is because this is the first subject we \nknow\n\n[[Page S2853]]\n\nanything about. All the rest of it is canned speeches that the staff \ngives you, and you come out and you talk about Kosovo, you talk about \nthe defense budget, or you talk about the environment, and you read \nscientific statements and everything--but we know about money. Oh boy, \ndo we know.\n  It is 2 o'clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/26/senate-section/article/S2853-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2853-S2879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PROPOSING AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 2 p.m. \nhaving arrived, the Committee on the Judiciary is discharged from \nfurther consideration of S.J. Res. 4, which the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 4) proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States relating to \n     contributions and expenditures intended to affect elections.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nhours of debate equally divided between the Senator from South \nCarolina, Mr. Hollings, and the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent S.J. Res. 4 be \nprinted in the Record at this particular point.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               S.J. Res 4\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, to be valid only if ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States within 7 years after the \n     date of final passage of this joint resolution:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``Section 1. Congress shall have power to set reasonable \n     limits on the amount of contributions that may be accepted \n     by, and the amount of expenditures that may be made by, in \n     support of, or in opposition to, a candidate for nomination \n     for election to, or for election to, Federal office.\n       ``Section 2. A State shall have power to set reasonable \n     limits on the amount of contributions that may be accepted \n     by, and the amount of expenditures that may be made by, in \n     support of, or in opposition to, a candidate for nomination \n     for election to, or for election to, State or local office.\n       ``Section 3. Congress shall have power to implement and \n     enforce this article by appropriate legislation.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as I was saying, we know about money. In \nfact, I had the small business appropriations subcommittee and I do not \nknow 100 better small businessmen than the 100 Senators. You have to \ncollect millions just in $1,000 increments. You wouldn't incorporate at \n$1,000-a-share of stock--you wouldn't get anywhere. You would have to \nwork much longer than this, of course. But we do it.\n  Back in 1966, Senator Mansfield said we would start voting at 9 \no'clock on Monday morning. I will never forget it. Then votes would \nensue, and debates would ensue, and we would work until generally \naround 6 o'clock on Friday. It was a full workweek.\n  I see my colleague from Kentucky is back down on the floor I want to \ntalk about corruption because that is the sensitivity he has, that \nthere is nothing corrupted--ha-ha.\n  Monday is gone. And Fridays are gone. And Tuesday mornings are gone. \nAnd Wednesday evenings you have a window, and Thursday evening you have \na window, and Wednesday at lunch you have a window, and Thursday at \nlunch you have a window--all for at least 20 to 25 percent of your time \nto collect money. Lunches, meetings with different groups downtown--I \nam part of it. I know. I struggle. I am from a Republican State, so I \nhad to travel all around raising money during my last campaign. I am \nconfident that people are ready and willing to vote for me. I have \ntalked to them. But the contributions, incidentally, are listed in the \nnewspaper and some people don't want to see their contributions appear, \nbecause when they go to the club on Saturday night, someone asks them, \n``Why did you give to that Democrat?''\n  I mean, heavens above.\n  So I travel the country, up to Minnesota, everywhere and anywhere I \ncan, to collect money. That takes my time on weekends, weekdays, any \nnights that I can. So I am part of the corruption I am trying to cure.\n  Mind you me, they do not have any idea of stopping this corruption. \nThey thoroughly enjoy it because they know the one way to really play \nthe campaign finance game for keeps and not for play, not for fun, is \nto pass a constitutional amendment.\n  The constitutional amendment which was just printed in the Record \ndoes not endorse, it does not support, it does not oppose any bill or \nany initiative. It merely gives authority to the U.S. Congress to limit \nor regulate expenditures and contributions in Federal elections. And \nthe state and municipal officials, as well as the state governors, have \nasked for a similar provision. So we have that provision in there for \nState elections as well.\n  We all know, out in the hinterland, beyond the beltway, what a \ncorruptive influence this has been. It takes all the time in the world \nto collect that $3,000 a day, every day, including Saturday and Sunday. \nWe have gotten to the point that we have to collect more than a church \non Sunday. It is a pitiful situation. But they know this is \nunconstitutional. It is unconstitutional, McCain-Feingold.\n  It might be appropriate at this point to say the unanimous consent \nagreement was supposedly at the termination or the disposition of \nMcCain-Feingold, because I did not want to interfere with the \ninitiative of the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin \nin McCain-Feingold. I voted for it, I guess, about five times. I will \nvote for it again because it may be constitutional--you can't tell with \nthis Supreme Court. They found that the States always regulate their \nown elections, except when it came to Florida and the Presidency. And \nthe very crowd in the minority, always talking about the States having \ncontrol, became the majority and took over the election. Given this \nreversal of opinion, you never can tell if the Court would change their \nopinion about Buckley v. Valeo. I will vote for the severability also.\n\n  I hope part of it is sustained by the Court. But we know good and \nwell that they enjoy the wonderful charade and farce that has been \ngoing on in the Senate last week and this week, and particularly in the \nmedia. They don't have any idea of exposing this. If you can find in a \nnewspaper that a constitutional amendment is to come up on Monday and \nbe debated all day Monday, I will give the good government award to \nthat particular newspaper. It is not even printed, they couldn't care \nless, because they know this thing should continue on, up, up, and \naway, millions upon millions, in order to hold a job, get elected.\n  So, as to its unconstitutionality, let me refer, first, to my friend, \nthe Senator from Kentucky. I do not like to mention him when he is not \npresent on the floor, but I will again, when he comes to the floor. \nS.J. Res. 166, in 1987, by Senator McConnell of Kentucky, of a \nconstitutional amendment. He says:\n\n       The Congress may enact laws regulating the amounts of \n     expenditures a candidate may make from personal funds or the \n     personal funds of the candidate's immediate family, or may \n     incur with personal loans, and Congress may enact laws \n     regulating the amounts of independent expenditures by any \n     person other than by a political committee of a political \n     party, which can be made to expressly advocate the election \n     or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for Federal \n     office.\n\n  The Senator from Kentucky and I appeared, and we testified before the \nSubcommittee on the Constitution of the Judiciary Committee in the \nSenate back at that time. And I quote Senator McConnell:\n\n       I would not have any problem with amending the Constitution \n     with regard to the millionaire's problem.\n  (Mr. AKAKA assumed the chair.)\n  The reason I emphasize that is because every time I have mentioned \nthis since that time, I had Senator McConnell worried about buying the \noffice. But he found out that is the best and easiest way for that \ncrowd to do it. He has sort of left me. He pontificates about the idea \nand how it is just horrible having a constitutional amendment to amend \nfreedom of speech.\n  Let me see exactly what he said at the particular time just by way of \nemphasis. He said on June 19, 1987, at page\n\n[[Page S2854]]\n\nof the Congressional Record, U.S. Senate:\n\n       I believe that this resolution, unlike most constitutional \n     amendments, would zip through this body and zip through the \n     State legislatures.\n\n  He didn't complain at that time about the time it took. But he says:\n\n       These are constitutional problems demanding constitutional \n     answers. This Congress should not hesitate, nor do I believe \n     it would hesitate, to directly address these imbalances of \n     the campaign finance laws. I offer this constitutional \n     amendment in the sincere hope that the Senate will begin to \n     turn its attention to the real abuses in campaign finances, \n     millionaire loopholes, independent expenditures, political \n     action committee contributions, and soft money, and develop \n     simple, straightforward solutions rather than strangle the \n     election process with overall spending limits and a larger \n     political bureaucracy.\n\n  The distinguished leader in opposition to McCain-Feingold, I used to \nstand with him because he was against soft money. He was against buying \nthe office. But there you are.\n  Of course, he reiterated on the floor the other day that we had \nreached the nub of the problem. He recognizes it still as a \nconstitutional question.\n  We go right to the long, hard task in March of trying to bring people \nto their senses once Buckley v. Valeo amended the first amendment. \nThere isn't any question. They equated money with speech when Justice \nStevens in the Nixon case said money is property. It was Kennedy who \nsaid that by the bifurcation and separating the contributions from the \nactual expenditures we had developed a new form of speech. Having money \nas speech is out of the whole cloth.\n  I don't go out and ask one dollar for one vote. It is one man-one \nvote; or one person-one vote. But under Buckley v. Valeo, it is one \ndollar-one vote.\n  By limiting the amount given but not the amount expended, they have \ntaken away the freedom of speech of the Presiding Officer, and this \nparticular Senator, because we don't have those millions to spend on \nelections such as we see being done this day and age. No questions are \nasked. The trend is more, more, and more.\n  There was an article in the newspaper last week on how the Democratic \nParty was looking for millionaire candidates so we don't have to raise \nthe money. If we can find a bunch of millionaire candidates, it would \nbe wonderful. We would be in the majority. But that is very enticing \nbut very corruptive for the simple reason that Buckley v. Valeo took \naway our freedom of speech.\n  This constitutional amendment will reenact the freedom of speech for \nall Americans. What will happen is, of course, you can pass anything \nyou want, I emphasize once more. This is not in support of McCain-\nFeingold, or in opposition to McCain-Feingold, or in support or \nopposition to any particular initiative that the Senate may take or the \nCongress may take.\n  But it frees us up--``Free at last,'' so to speak--in order to enact \nwhat we desire to enact with respect to campaign financing.\n  I refer to the article ``Democracy or Plutocracy? The Case for a \nConstitutional Amendment to Overturn Buckley v. Valeo,'' by Jonathan \nBingham.\n  Mr. President, former Congressman Bingham wrote about it with \ndistinction. But there is a more recent article from the James Madison \nCenter for Free Speech, and an analysis of McCain-Feingold by James \nBopp, general counsel for the James Madison Center for Free Speech. It \ncan be found at: www.jamesmadisoncenter.org.\n  Mr. President, an article entitled ``Court Challenge Likely if \nMcCain-Feingold Bill Passes'' from the Washington Post of March 19 of \nthis year by Charles Lane also points out the unconstitutionality of \nMcCain-Feingold.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Court Challenge Likely if McCain-Feingold Bill Passes\n\n\n   Foes Cite Free-Speech Issues as Debate On Campaign Finance Reform \n                                 Begins\n\n                           (By Charles Lane)\n\n       The debate over campaign finance reform that begins today \n     in the Senate is just the start of a long journey that likely \n     will end in the courtroom.\n       As even supporters of the bill sponsored by Sens. John \n     McCain (R-Ariz.) and Russell Feingold (D-Wis.) concede, the \n     measure poses fundamental free-speech questions and faces an \n     inevitable court challenge by opponents if it becomes law. \n     The questions are serious enough that they will probably have \n     to be resolved by the Supreme Court.\n       ``Everyone recognizes that there are constitutional issues \n     in McCain-Feingold, and everyone assumes it will end up at \n     the Supreme Court if it passes and is signed,'' said Lawrence \n     Noble, a former general counsel of the Federal Election \n     Commission who is executive director of the pro-reform Center \n     for Responsive Politics.\n       The most vulnerable provision in the McCain-Feingold \n     legislation is a section that bars unions and corporations \n     from buying ``issue advertising'' on television and radio \n     that mentions federal candidates during a specified period \n     before elections. The same section also would subject other \n     interest groups that buy ads to new funding disclosure rules.\n       McCain-Feingold's supporters say that under the law, the \n     ads are a sham--that they are not intended merely to inform \n     citizens about issues but rather to influence the outcome of \n     elections. The provision in the reform law, they say, is \n     necessary to close a loophole through which vast de facto \n     campaign contributions pass unregulated each election year.\n       But the loophole exists largely because the Supreme Court \n     has said issue ads are a form of political expression that \n     must be left untouched by federal regulation. Opponents of \n     the bill say that means the issue-ad provision would be \n     overturned in the courts.\n       ``It has no chance of being upheld,'' said James Bopp, \n     general counsel of the James Madison Center for Free Speech, \n     who has successfully challenged similar state issue-ad laws \n     in lower courts.\n       Supporters of the McCain-Feingold bill say the provision \n     was carefully written to take into account the court's key \n     precedent in campaign finance matters, the 1976 case Buckley \n     v. Valeo.\n       The court ruled in that case that the Constitution permits \n     the government to regulate the flow of money in politics to \n     prevent actual or apparent corruption. But such regulations \n     must be subjected to ``strict scrutiny'' by the court to \n     ensure that they do not unduly impede the free expression of \n     the political ideas that money pays for.\n       Applying that balancing test to a 1974 campaign reform law, \n     the court upheld limits on contributions as well as \n     disclosure requirements. But it struck down limitations on \n     political communications ``relative'' to federal elections. \n     The court concluded that part of the statute was so vague it \n     could stifle too much political speech.\n       Since Buckley, only limits on ``express advocacy''--\n     political communications that specifically tell voters to \n     cast their ballots for or against a candidate--have been \n     upheld. So parties, unions, corporations and interest groups \n     have been able to buy issue ads freely, as long as they don't \n     urge a vote for a particular candidate.\n       But McCain-Feingold's issue-ad provision is based on the \n     view that the court would accept an alternative to the \n     ``express advocacy'' standard as long as it isn't as vague as \n     the one the justices struck down in the Buckley case.\n       The bill seeks to provide such an alternative by creating a \n     new category, ``electioneering communications,'' defined as \n     broadcast ads that refer to clearly identified candidates and \n     appear within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general \n     election.\n       Having redefined issue ads in a way that captures their \n     true nature as campaign-related communications, McCain-\n     Feingold backers say, Congress could subject those who pay \n     for the ads to spending and disclosure regulations without \n     running afoul of Buckley.\n       Under the bill, unions and corporations would be barred \n     from spending their own funds on such ads. Interest groups \n     would be allowed to air them but would have to use individual \n     contributions to pay for them and disclose where the money \n     came from.\n       ``There will be questions about issue ads,'' McCain said in \n     an interview, ``but I also believe . . . Supreme Court \n     justices . . . do read newspapers and watch TV. And it would \n     be hard to argue from a logical standpoint that the sham ads \n     are not intended to affect the election or nonelection of \n     candidates.''\n       But McCain-Feingold opponents say the justices won't buy \n     this proposed revision of the ``express advocacy'' standard, \n     which has survived repeated challenges in lower federal \n     courts. No matter how McCain-Feingold defines the new \n     regulations, they argue, the court would see it as curtailing \n     a certain amount of political expression that has heretofore \n     enjoyed constitutional protection.\n       ``To the extent the bill would . . . make illegal or \n     burdensome the funding of speech that has been protected up \n     till now, it is vulnerable to challenge,'' said Joel Gora, a \n     professor at Brooklyn Law School who represented the \n     plaintiffs in Buckley and is working with the American Civil \n     Liberties Union to defeat McCain-Feingold.\n       Gora said that under McCain-Feingold, a group that opposed \n     that law but had no position on whether McCain should be a \n     senator would be subject to regulations if it wanted to run \n     an ad attacking the bill in Arizona within 60 days of a \n     Senate election involving McCain.\n       The only alternative to the McCain-Feingold bill, a reform \n     proposal by Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.), does not include \n     restrictions on issue ads by corporations and unions, and \n     would not raise the same kinds of constitutional questions.\n\n[[Page S2855]]\n\n       The best-known provision of McCain-Feingold, a ban on \n     ``soft money,'' is a relatively open constitutional issue \n     because there is little in case law to suggest how a majority \n     of the court might view it.\n       Under the law, wealthy individuals, unions and corporations \n     may give unlimited amounts of money to political parties for \n     ostensibly general purposes such as educating voters about \n     the issues and getting them to the polls on Election Day. \n     This is in contrast to ``hard money''--donations to specific \n     candidates that are subject to limits and disclosure \n     requirements.\n       Reformers argue, however, that soft money has evolved into \n     a de facto campaign contribution because so much of it is \n     used to finance issue advertising targeted at specific \n     elections. They say it should be easy to persuade the court \n     to uphold a ban, just as it upheld contribution limits in \n     Buckley.\n       ``The court will respect Congress's judgment that money is \n     fungible and that soft money is really working on a national \n     election,'' said Alan Morrison of the Public Citizen \n     Litigation Group.\n       In a case decided last year, Nixon v. Shrink Missouri \n     Government PAC, the court, by a vote of 6 to 3, reaffirmed \n     Buckley's holding that contribution limits may be imposed to \n     combat political corruption or the appearance of corruption.\n       The six-member majority included the court's four liberal \n     members and two conservatives, Chief Justice William H. \n     Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. The opinion by \n     Justice David H. Souter cited ``the broader threat from \n     politicians too compliant with the wishes of large \n     contributors.''\n       Two justices, Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, \n     said in a concurring opinion that a soft money limitation \n     might well be constitutional under Buckley.\n       However, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Antonin \n     Scalia, published a dissenting opinion indicating that even \n     existing campaign finance regulations suppressed too much \n     speech and that Buckley should be overruled on that basis.\n       McCain-Feingold opponents say they would challenge the soft \n     money ban as an attack on free association and a threat to \n     the two-party system. Quite simply, they argue, soft money is \n     not a sham. It is used not only for issue ads but also for \n     general ``party-building'' activities and cannot be \n     eliminated without crippling the parties.\n       As evidence of recent sympathy on the court for the special \n     role of parties in American politics, they cite a 1996 case \n     in which the court held that the government could not limit \n     the spending of hard money by a political party on behalf of \n     a candidate as long as the spending was ``independent'' of \n     the candidate's campaign.\n       In reaching this conclusion, the court observed that it was \n     ``not aware of any special dangers of corruption associated \n     with political parties'' that would have warranted a \n     different conclusion.\n       ``If the court continues to view parties as they did in \n     [that case] and other cases, I don't see how the soft money \n     ban can survive,'' Bopp said. ``There is no compelling \n     government interest that would support the gut-ripping of \n     political parties.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I harken to the memory of working with \nmy distinguished colleague from Kentucky when he and I were on the same \nside. I also worked with the former counsel to the President, Lloyd \nCutler, also the former Senator from Kansas, Mrs. Nancy Kassebaum, and \nothers on the committee on the constitutional system. They appeared and \ntestified about the need for a constitutional amendment.\n  On every amendment, starting with the Domenici amendment last week, \nthey are going to raise a constitutional question.\n  There it is. Everybody likes to adhere to the Constitution because \nthey respond to the very solemn scare tactics of my friend from \nKentucky.\n  The reason I described it as scare tactics--let me quote from last \nweek, March 19 on page S2440 of the Congressional Record, I quote \nSenator McConnell:\n\n       You have to go right to the core of the problem. The junior \n     Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Fritz Hollings, will offer \n     that amendment at some point as he has periodically over the \n     years. He deserves a lot of credit for understanding the nub \n     of the problem. The nub of the problem is you can't do most \n     of these things as long as the First Amendment remains as it \n     is.\n       So Senator Hollings, at some point, I think under the \n     consent agreement, will probably at the end of the debate \n     offer a constitutional amendment . . . to regulate, restrict, \n     and even prohibit any expenditures ``by, in support of, or in \n     opposition to a candidate for public office.'' It would carve \n     and etch out of the First Amendment, for the first time since \n     the founding of our country and the passage of the Bill of \n     Rights, giving to the government at the Federal and State \n     level the ability to control political speech in this \n     country. It is worth noting that would also apply to the \n     media.\n\n  Now you see the scare tactics. Wait a minute. After 230 years of \nhistory, and all of sudden we are going to monkey around, we are going \nto tamper with, and we are going to amend the first amendment for the \nfirst time since the founding of our country and the passage of the \nBill of Rights--we are going to amend the first amendment.\n\n  I note the Senator from Kentucky is a brilliant individual. He knows \nbetter. But he knows the art of defamation and debate. If he can scare \nthose who have not paid attention to the debate last week and this \nweek, and those who will not pay attention, then he'll prevail. There \nis nobody here but us chickens for the simple reason that they said \nlast week I had to go on Monday. I had other engagements already \nbecause I am like all the other Senators, I have things to do. I can \nplan ahead, knowing that I can get out and raise money on Monday. Then \nthey said, if you can't get back on Monday, you just stay here on \nFriday. I also, like all the other Senators--we voted at 9 o'clock and, \nboy, we broke out of that door. If you stood there at those double \ndoors after that vote at 9:15 to 9:30, you would have been run over \nbecause we had to go. We have to collect that $3,000 that Friday, that \n$22,000 that week, that $7 million over the 6-year period. And so it is \nthat he knows and I know they are not hearing this.\n  We all do revere the Constitution. And we all revere the first \namendment. But the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, watching those \nOscars last night, he ought to get an Oscar for this one. Here it is:\n\n       . . . I think under the consent agreement, will probably at \n     the end of the debate offer a constitutional amendment so the \n     Federal and all 50 State governments can have the unfettered \n     latitude to regulate, restrict, and even prohibit any \n     expenditures ``by, in support of, or in opposition to a \n     candidate for public office.'' It would carve and etch out of \n     the First Amendment, for the first time since the founding of \n     our country and the passage of the Bill of Rights, giving to \n     the government at the Federal and State level the ability to \n     control political speech in this country.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, not so. He gets the Oscar because those who not \nlistening heard that last week, when I couldn't get the floor and award \nhim that particular Oscar. Because he knows from the debate of 1907 of \nthe Tillman Act, under President Teddy Roosevelt, where the Federal \nGovernment controls the speech of corporations. And then in 1947, Harry \nTruman, in the Taft-Hartley Act, that is another one of ``the first \ntime since the founding of our country and the passage of the Bill of \nRights.'' That was the second time that I know of back in 1947 under \nTaft-Hartley.\n  Poor Harry did it. They want to give him awards now. Everybody is \ntrying to mimic Teddy Roosevelt over there on the Republican side. But \nthey forget that ``for the first time'' Teddy did it back in 1907. We \nknow about the shouting of fire in the theater, the clear and present \ndanger ruling; that is another time that the first amendment was \namended. We know, with respect to the prohibition against fighting \nwords, that is another time that the first amendment was amended.\n  Congress, since I have been here, gave the authority, in the Pacifica \ncase that finally was determined. But we passed the enactment to tell \nthe FCC to regulate obscenity over the airwaves. That deals with the \nfirst amendment. There were those seven dirty words in the Pacifica \ncase.\n  So it is that we have, about seven or eight times since the founding \nof our country ``etched out of the First Amendment.'' We took an \nexception with respect to slander. I cannot slander you; you cannot \nslander me. That is defamation. That is another time. There is false \nand deceptive advertising. Has the distinguished Senator never heard of \nthe Federal Trade Commission? That is under the authority of the \nFederal Trade Commission: false and deceptive advertising. We regulate \nor amend, as he would say, carving and etching out, for the first time \nin our history since the founding of the Republic, an amendment to the \nfirst amendment.\n\n  We all go to classified briefings, particularly up on the fourth \nfloor in the Capitol. That is another restriction we have on the first \namendment.\n  Of course, we can go right on down to the 24th amendment--well, the \nHatch Act. I do not want to leave that out. We amended it in 1993. But \nyou still can't run for these partisan political offices. You can't \nsolicit contributions\n\n[[Page S2856]]\n\nor receive contributions. You can't politic on a Federal facility. We \nwould be forbidden under the Hatch Act to campaign in this Federal \nfacility, except for us. All we do is campaign here. We have to take \ncare of ourselves here. We understand what the game is. Nobody is here. \nBut I am here. And we have a constitutional amendment.\n  And then, of course, the 24th amendment, the poll tax. Isn't that a \nwonderful thing? They said: Look, there should be no financial burden \non the right to vote. Now, with Buckley v. Valeo there is a financial \nburden with respect to campaigning.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from my State says at the end of \nnext year he is not going to run for reelection. They have already, in \na sense, crowned a Republican nominee according to my local news. \nEverybody has come out for him. Two or three Democrats have been up to \nsee me. Each time I said: Now, wait a minute. You have to get $7 \nmillion. You have to be prepared. Because I can tell you, here and now, \nI spent $5.5 million myself in 1998, and this will be 4 years hence by \n2002. So you have to get that $7 million. It has all but prohibited the \npoor from campaigning. It has all but prohibited the middle class from \ncampaigning, or at least in relation to the Senate.\n  I can tell you right now, we ought to have an amendment restoring \nevery mother's son's right. I can see Russell Long standing right here \nat this desk. He put in the checkoff system so every mother's son could \nrun for President. So we had to check off on the income tax to bill up \nthe money. With respect to Buckley v. Valeo, let's amend that \nparticular amendment to the first amendment; namely, the restriction \nthey put on political speech of the poor and middle class in America.\n  I have already had to discourage--I didn't mean to do it but you need \nto be realistic--and I am confident I have discouraged three candidates \nfrom running because unless and until they can get up in the political \npolls, our Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee cannot afford to \ngive them any financial assistance. So they have to prove themselves. \nAnd in order to prove themselves in this game, you have to have money.\n  Finally, of course, as I have already referred to, I would like to \nask consent to have printed in the Record S.J. Res. 166 from the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky. How could he stand in the well and \nsay, ``It would carve and etch out of the First Amendment, for the \nfirst time since the founding of our country and the passage of the \nBill of Rights'' wherein he, in S. Res. 166, tried that himself in \n1987? I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             S.J. Res. 166\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following article is proposed as an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to \n     all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when \n     ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several \n     States within seven years from the date of its submission to \n     the States by the Congress:\n\n                               Article--\n\n       ``Section 1. The Congress may enact laws regulating the \n     amounts of expenditures a candidate may make from his \n     personal funds or the personal funds of his immediate family \n     or may incur with personal loans, and Congress may enact laws \n     regulating the amounts of independent expenditures by any \n     person, other than by a political committee of a political \n     party, which can be made to expressly advocate the election \n     or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for Federal \n     office.\n       ``Section 2. The several States may enact laws regulating \n     the amounts of expenditures a candidate may make from his \n     personal funds or the personal funds of his immediate family \n     or may incur with personal loans, and such States may enact \n     laws regulating the amounts of independent expenditures by \n     any person, other than by a political committee of a \n     political party, which can be made to expressly advocate the \n     election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for \n     State and local offices.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, there we are: Five of the last six \namendments have dealt with just that, with elections. Certainly, the \nHollings-Specter amendment--and I want to note at this time the \nwonderful support of the distinguished Senator. He not only cosponsored \nit, he has been at the hearings and on the floor. He has given it warm \nsupport.\n  We have other cosponsors. I thank them also: Mr. Reid of Nevada; Mr. \nBiden of Delaware; Mr. Miller of Georgia, and several others; Mr. \nCleland; also the distinguished former majority leader, the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, has been a stalwart with respect to the \nConstitution. The Senator from West Virginia understands better than \nany that this particular initiative is certainly as important as the \npoll tax, the 24th amendment. It is certainly as important as the 27th \namendment, Senatorial pay. Come on. Here we have corrupted the entire \nprocess. We can't get any work done. We can't get regular Americans to \nrun for public office. We can't give the people the time they deserve \nworking at the job of being a U.S. Senator because we have to work at \nthe job of staying a U.S. Senator. It certainly is just as important as \nSenatorial pay with respect to its significance and importance.\n  The last five or six amendments dealt with elections. This would be \nthe 25th amendment and would be immediately, I am led to believe, \nratified by the several States.\n  I have touched on the corruption. There are other points we want to \nmake for the Record.\n  I yield the floor, retain the balance of my time, and grant our \ndistinguished friend from West Virginia such time as he may consume.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Mr. Hollings, for yielding to me. I thank him for being \nthe author and chief sponsor of this amendment. I thank him for his \nsteadfast and clear-sighted approach to a very serious and growing \nproblem facing our Republic. I thank him for allowing me to join him in \ncosponsoring this amendment.\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson, in an oration delivered on August 31, 1867, \nsaid:\n\n       This time, like all times, is a very good one, if we but \n     know what to do with it.\n\n  As the Senate considers the proposed constitutional amendment offered \nby our distinguished colleague from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, it is \nmy fervent hope that each of us will take heed of Emerson's apt words. \nWe have the opportunity to take an important step in the direction of \nrestoring the people's faith and in our ability to rise above \npartisanship and really do something about our present sorry system of \nfinancing Federal campaigns.\n  If 55 years ago, when I started out in politics, we had had the \ncurrent system of funding campaigns, somebody else would be standing at \nthis desk. It wouldn't be I. I came from the very bottom of the ladder. \nThere were no lower rungs in my ladder. There weren't any bottom rungs \nin my ladder. I came out of a coal camp. What did I have?\n  If I might, for a moment, tinker with grammar, ``I didn't have \nnothing,'' as they would say. ``I ain't got nothing.'' All I had was \nmyself and my belief in our system. I believed in a system, then, in \nwhich a person who didn't have anything, a person who was poor, a \nperson who came from lowly beginnings but who could pay his filing fee, \ncould run for office.\n  I graduated from high school in 1934 in the midst of the Depression. \nI married 64 years ago the month after next. I married a coal miner's \ndaughter. We didn't have anything. We only had two rooms in which to \nlive in the coal company house. I started out making $50 a month. When \nI married I was making the huge sum of $70 a month. All I had was a \nhigh school education. I didn't have a college education. That was all \nI had.\n\n  The man who raised me, my uncle, was not a banker. He was not a big \npolitician. He was not a former judge. He was not a former \nofficeholder. He was a coal miner, a lowly coal miner. He was honest.\n  What did I have? Who was I to run for office? Who was I to offer \nmyself to the people with just a high school education. That was all. \nThat coal miner was the only dad I ever knew so I felt good about being \nhis son. I didn't have anything. There I was, a coal miner's son, \nstarting to find my way up the ladder of a political career.\n  Could I do it today? I would go to Senator Hollings and say: I would \nlike to run for the House of Delegates in West Virginia. I would like \nto run for the House of Representatives in Washington. What advice do \nyou have for\n\n[[Page S2857]]\n\nme? He would say to me today, as he said to others: Who are you? What \nis your background? That is not so important. But have you got any \nmoney? How much money are you willing to spend on this? I would have \nbeen out, if it had depended upon money. I would have been out at the \nbeginning. I would never have gotten to first base.\n  The current system is rotten, it is putrid, it stinks. The people of \nthis country ought really to know what this system is giving to them \nand what it is taking from them. This system corrupts political \ndiscourse. It makes us slaves, makes us beholden to the almighty dollar \nrather than be the servants of the people we all aspire to serve.\n  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has given this kind of campaign \nsystem first amendment protection.\n  In Buckley v. Valeo, the Court made it extraordinarily difficult for \nthe public to have what it wants: reasonable regulations of campaign \nexpenditures which do not either directly or indirectly limit the ideas \nthat may be expressed in the public realm. I submit that such \nregulations will actually broaden the public debate on a number of \nissues by freeing it from the narrow confines dictated by special \ninterest money.\n  We may be able to fool ourselves, but the time is long past for all \nof us to stop trying to fool the American people. They are more than \naware that both political parties--both political parties--abuse the \ncurrent system and that both political parties fear to change that \nsystem. Each party wants to preserve its advantages under the system, \nbut the insidious system of campaign fundraising will eventually \nundermine the very foundation of this Republic.\n  What I am saying is, that this system of funding our political \ncampaigns is going to undermine the Republic. For our own sakes and for \nthe sake of the people, we must find a way to stop this political \nminuet. We must come to grips with the fact that the campaign finance \nsystem in its current form is simply, simply, simply unworthy of \npreservation.\n  I have spoken on this floor many times before about the exponential \nincrease in campaign expenditures since I first ran for the Senate in \n1958. Jennings Randolph and I ran for the Senate in 1958. There was a \nsituation in West Virginia in which the late Senator M.M. Neely died \nand left 2 years of his Senate tenure open, which meant we had two \nSenate seats in West Virginia to fill in the same election. Senator \nRandolph ran for the 2-year term, I ran for the 6-year term, and we \ndecided to team up and run together. There were several other Democrats \nrunning for both seats. But we teamed up and we ran that campaign--two \nSenators--for $50,000. That is all we had, $50,000. We didn't have \ntelevision in those days. Oh, there were a few black and white sets \naround. But we didn't have these expensive campaign consultants. We \ndidn't know anything about these kinds of negative campaigns. We just \nwent around from courthouse to courthouse and spoke in the courthouse \nyards. I played my fiddle --drew a good crowd. But we didn't have these \nexpensive campaigns. Otherwise, we could not have run.\n  I was running against an incumbent Republican Senator, Senator \nChapman Revercomb. We could not have done it. That was in 1958. We had \n$50,000, two Senators.\n  I recently heard one of the richest men in America say that political \naccess is ``undervalued'' in the campaign finance market. Campaign \ncontributions will continue to increase until a ``market valuation'' is \nachieved, thus causing the cost of a reasonably effective campaign to \ncontinue to skyrocket. We haven't hit the top yet, by any means. It \nalready costs tens of millions of dollars to run an effective campaign \nfor the Senate in many States.\n  What do we tell a poor kid from the hollows? What do we tell a poor \nkid from the coal camps? Forget it. Yet, that person may have the \ncapacity and the drive to be a good Senator. A campaign for the Senate \nwill be beyond his or her personal means and beyond the means of \nfriends and associates.\n  We must act to put the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the \nPresidency within the reach of anyone with the brains, with the spirit, \nwith the spine, and with the desire to go for it. And the proposed \nconstitutional amendment before us today is a necessary step on the way \nto accomplishing that goal. Yes, it amends the First Amendment.\n  One of the great ironies of the current campaign financing system is \nthat it puts more distance between candidates and the people they hope \nto represent. Campaigns of today are technologically sophisticated. \nThey rely increasingly on mass media. The whole point of current \ncampaigns has become raising enough money to pay to more people, more \ntimes, over the airwaves.\n  There is no argument that there is an efficiency consideration here. \nPeople's lives today are complicated. They have to run from pillar to \npost, to work, to school, to the grocery store, to the dry cleaner, \ncook dinner, put the kids to bed, and so on and on and on, over and \nover again. Families do not have the time or the inclination to attend \ncommunity functions as they used to years ago. Even if they did, there \nis this crazy ``boob tube'' in the home. I don't listen to it a great \ndeal. I long ago learned that is almost a complete waste of time to \nlisten. I so listen every Saturday night to that British show, \n``Keeping Up Appearances.'' I recommend that anybody and everybody \nwatch that show. You won't hear any profanity in it, you won't see any \nviolence in it, and it is not a story about sex. So, listen to \n``Keeping Up Appearances'' on Channel 26 and Channel 22, public \ntelevision.\n  May I say to my friend from South Carolina and my equally good friend \nfrom Connecticut, I have been in Washington 49 years. I have been to \none movie, and I did not stay through that one. Yul Brynner was playing \nin it. It bored me to death, and I left about halfway through. But I \nhave seen some good movies on Channel 26, Channel 22--public \ntelevision. I like Masterpiece Theater. It gives us some good, clean, \nwholesome movies to watch. Otherwise, do not waste your time watching \nTV.\n  I have had some recent campaign events in some of West Virginia's \ncommunities where people still come out to hear candidates, but in our \nNation today, such events are the exception, not the rule. So to \ninfluence voters, we pay high-priced consultants, and many times, I say \nto my friend from South Carolina, we probably know a good bit more \nabout politicking and what needs to be seen and said than they do, but \nthey sure know how to spend your money; they sure know how to take your \nmoney. These TV people just rack it up.\n  I must say that TV is the greatest medium that was ever invented, I \nsuppose. At least it will hold its own with the printed media. But I \nthink it is helping to ruin these political campaigns.\n  To influence voters, we pay high-priced consultants to produce slick, \nhigh-priced ads and to buy high-priced television and radio time to air \nthem. Our opponents do the same, which leads our expensive consultants \nto encourage us to tape more ads--tape more ads--and buy more \nadvertising time. It is a vicious circle that requires candidates to \nspend more and more time raising money and less and less time listening \nto the people and working for the people, once they are elected, whom \nthey wish to represent.\n  I have been majority leader in this Senate, and I have been minority \nleader, and I can tell Senators that this money chase is a real \nheadache for the leaders in this Senate. It used to be, when I was the \nleader, I was continually being importuned by colleagues--Senators on \nmy side of the aisle--to not have votes on this afternoon, not have \nvotes on tomorrow, not have votes on Fridays, not have votes on \nMondays, not have votes on Tuesdays until after the weekly conference \nluncheon.\n  When I first came to the Senate, we did not have weekly Democratic \nconferences. Mostly, the Republicans had conferences, but we did not \nnecessarily have a conference every week. It was after I became leader \nthat we started to have regular conferences every week. It was I, as \nthe leader, who had the first so-called retreat with our Democratic \ncolleagues. We went over to Canaan Valley in West Virginia, and we also \nwent up to Shepherdstown on another occasion.\n  We did not have any retreats prior to my being leader. We did not \nhave all\n\n[[Page S2858]]\n\nthese campaign financing problems. We did not have to raise so much \nmoney for campaigns until, for the most part, I was leader for the \nsecond time in the 100th Congress.\n  It was in the 100th Congress that I offered a cloture motion eight \ntimes--eight times--to try to have the Senate act on campaign financing \nlegislation--eight times. That is the highest number of cloture motions \never offered by a leader in this Senate on any matter; eight times, and \nI failed eight times. I was never able to get more than a half \ndozen members of the Republican Party to vote for cloture on campaign \nfinancing legislation.\n\n  The result of the campaign financing system we now have is that today \nthere are fewer rallies, there is less knocking on doors, less face-to-\nface time with the voters, less handshaking by the candidate. No wonder \nthe people think we are out of touch. We do not see the people.\n  For the most part, we go to those meetings that are held by special \ninterest groups. They are good people to see--I am not saying that. We \ndo not generally see the general run of people. Those old-time rallies \nand meetings do not occur so much anymore. Through the creative use of \nfilm and audiotape, we have made ourselves intangible.\n  While I am very reluctant to amend the Constitution, I am not opposed \nto amendments in all circumstances. The Constitution contains a \nprovision, as we all know, for amendments, and it is there for a \npurpose. Whereas, as in Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court creates a \nsignificant obstacle to democratic self-government, it is certainly \nappropriate for us to approve a constitutional amendment. Otherwise, I \nregard the prospects as slim for comprehensive reform legislation that \nwould both free the Congress from the iron grip of the special \ninterests and put Federal office within the reach of every able and \nwilling American.\n  By equating campaign expenditures with free speech, the Supreme Court \nhas made it all but impossible for us to control the ever-spiraling \nmoney chase. Under current constitutional jurisprudence, any \nlegislation intended to control the cancerous effects of money in \npolitics may necessarily be complicated and convoluted. The \ncomplications we are forced to resort to, in turn, may create new \nopportunities for abuse.\n  Some argue that money will find a way to control the process, \nregardless of what we do. I respond that a simple and straightforward \nlimit on campaign expenditures is much more difficult to circumvent \nthan the maze of regulations to which we have had to resort. I wonder, \ntoo, whether these opponents of campaign finance reform are willing to \npermit money to buy anything on the grounds that it is difficult to \ncontrol.\n  Even without a constitutional amendment, we can, of course, tinker \naround the edges, but we cannot enact comprehensive legislation that \nwill get to the heart of the problem. I wish we could. But the fact is \nwe cannot get the kind of legislation we really need unless we first \nadopt an amendment to the Constitution. I have come to that conclusion.\n  We see it every year. The money chase gets tighter, takes more and \nmore money, and the love of money is the root of all evil. We learned \nthat at our mother's knee and from the Bible. The love of money is the \nroot of all evil. Just look at what it has done in politics, and one \nwill see what it has meant.\n  Our campaign financing system clouds our judgments. Fear of losing \nadvantage is what has driven both parties to be reluctant to enact \nmeaningful expenditure reform.\n\n  I understand this is the system we are in. As long as this is the \nsystem, if I am running, I do what the system allows me, and I do what \nthe system requires. I try to raise money. It is the most demeaning \nthing I as a Senator have to experience. Demeaning. I don't like going \naround asking for money. I abhor it. That is the way it is.\n  The fixation with maintaining advantage is blinding us to the dangers \nto our credibility. Credibility is a precious commodity. More important \nto a politician than--yes, more important--than money. When we lose our \ncredibility, no amount of money will enable us to buy it back.\n  People out there who are watching: Do you know what campaign \nfinancing does to your interests as we, the legislators, pass laws, \nvote on amendments? Do you, the people, know that you, not organized, \ndo not wield the influence, man for man and woman for woman, that is \nwielded by the special interest groups? This is not to say that they \ndon't have the best interests of the country in mind. They have the \nbest interests of the country in mind as they see those best interests. \nWe are beholden, we in this body, and in the other body, and at the \nWhite House, are beholden to the people who help us to win by giving us \ncontributions. You people who are not organized come in second.\n  When we lose our credibility, no amount of money will enable us to \nbuy it back. Already, many of our citizens don't vote. They don't think \ntheir vote counts. They don't feel we are influenced by their votes, so \nthey don't vote. Let us fear the further erosion of our Republic.\n  I am sorry that it has come to this. I am sorry that it has come to \nthe point that, if we are going to deal with this Frankenstein monster \nthat is in our midst--this campaign financing system--we have to amend \nthe Constitution of the United States. I am sorry for that.\n  They say, well, this is the first time, this will be the first \noccasion in which we would amend the first amendment to the \nConstitution. What is worse? What is worse? Keeping the first amendment \nintact or saving our country, saving our Republic, from its eventual \ncomplete destruction because the people in whom the power and the \nsovereignty resides are no longer the main focus of the attention of \nlegislators and Presidents?\n  I think to continue down this road is to destroy this Republic and \nthe things for which that flag stands. If there is only one way to save \nit, and that is to amend the first amendment to the Constitution, then \nlet's amend it.\n  It is sad. To one who started out in politics with nothing --I didn't \nhave, as I say, a father who could lift me up, who could go to the \nbanks in the city and say, this is my son, help him; who could go to \nthe civic clubs and say, invite my son to speak, help him; who could \nlook to the lawyers in the community and say, I'm a lawyer, I'm a \njudge, I want you to help my son--I didn't have that kind of father to \nlift me up and help me in politics. I could hardly put two nickels \ntogether.\n  Now what do we see? We see a situation in which that coal miner's son \ncould never come to the Senate. No coal miner's son could ever lift \nhimself up by the ladder that has no rungs at the bottom and come to \nthe Senate. That could not be one of his or her dreams.\n  I compliment the distinguished Senator from South Carolina who is a \nleader in this effort. This is a good time, as Ralph Waldo Emerson \nsaid, if only we know what to do with it. Let us not squander an \nopportunity to begin to fix this thoroughly rotten campaign finance \nsystem once and for all. Let us not continue to disappointment the \nAmerican people.\n  Yes, I am ready to amend the first amendment to the Constitution. \nWhat good is it if we have a first amendment to the Constitution if we \ndestroy the Republic in the meantime? I see this flawed campaign \nfinancing system as a real dagger at the heart of our constitutional \nRepublic. What good is a Constitution without a Republic?\n  As I see it, take your choice: Keep the first amendment, unamended, \nor continue down this path of destruction of the Republic and \neverything it stands for.\n  Let us take a stand and support this proposed amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  In Atlanta, there is a monument to the memory of the late Benjamin \nHill. Inscribed on that monument are these words:\n\n       Who saves his country saves himself, saves all things, and \n     all things saved do bless him. Who lets his country die, lets \n     all things die, dies himself ignobly, and all things, dying, \n     curse him.\n\n  I say to Senators, let us save our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I hope everyone had an opportunity to \nhear that and those who did not have\n\n[[Page S2859]]\n\nan opportunity to see the speech of the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia in the Congressional Record. He talks from a 50-year or more \nexperience here in the Senate, and, assiduous as he is to protect the \nConstitution, to go with this particular amendment means that we are in \nthe extreme, that it is absolutely necessary.\n  I feel the same way. I don't like to amend the Constitution. But I \ntake the position that it was the Court itself, in Buckley v. Valeo, \nthat amended the Constitution with this distorted bifurcation, equating \nmoney with speech and then controlling some but not other moneys. As a \nresult, we end with this duplicitous situation of the money chase.\n  Let me yield, before I have some other comments, to our distinguished \nfloor leader, Senator Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I hope as well Members who are not here will \nread the remarks of our colleague from West Virginia. It is about as \nconcise and thorough a description of the current status of affairs as \nanything you are going to hear or have heard over the last week or so \nas we have discussed campaign finance reform or, I suspect, that you \nare going to hear for the remainder of this week or into next week, if \nwe have to take additional time to debate the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation.\n  There is not a great deal I could add to it. He captures my thoughts, \nmy sentiments, far more eloquently than anything I have ever said about \nthe subject matter, and I have spoken on it on numerous occasions. His \nlanguage is graphic in a couple of instances, but it is appropriate \nlanguage to describe the current state of affairs, the current \ncircumstances in which we find ourselves in this beloved Nation of \nours.\n  There is nothing more fundamental. I know there are other subject \nmatters this body wants to address, issues of budget and taxes and \neducation, environment, health care. They are all very important \nsubject matters. They certainly have a more contemporaneous appeal than \nthe subject of campaign finance reform. Certainly every poll that is \ndone in the country indicates that this subject matter ranks near the \nbottom of issues about which the public cares.\n  I think I understand why, at least in part. In part, it is because \npeople have become so disgusted with it and have little hope things are \ngoing to change and are just so accepting, unfortunately, of the \npresent state of circumstances with no likelihood it is going to \nchange.\n  While I think these other subject matters have value and importance, \nin my view nothing we will debate or discuss in the coming Congress or \ncoming Congresses will exceed in value or importance the subject matter \nwhich we will decide later today, and during the remainder of the week \nif the Hollings proposal is rejected, as I suspect it will be based on \nearlier votes we have had. I say that with a deep sense of regret \nbecause he is addressing the issue in a way that, unfortunately, it can \nonly be addressed.\n  I am very respectful of the U.S. Supreme Court. As someone who is a \ngraduate of law school, an attorney, licensed in my State, I was \ntrained to revere the Supreme Court of the United States and respect \nall of its decisions. But the decision in Buckley v. Valeo, reached \nmore than a quarter of a century ago, that equates money with speech, \ncould not be more flawed, in my view. That is to suggest that the \nmicrophone which I am using here today is equal to speech, or that the \nsound system in here is equal to speech, or some other form of currency \nthat may exist is equal to speech. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. Justice Stevens had it right: Money is property, just as this \nmicrophone is property, just as the sound systems are property. It is \nnot speech, it is merely a vehicle by which we enhance the volume of \nour voice.\n\n  A columnist and reporter in my State of Connecticut got it right. \nOnly in American politics would we equate free speech with the present \nset of circumstances. It is an oxymoron, she said. There is nothing \nfree about it. Speech only belongs, in American politics, to those who \ncan afford to buy it. It is not speech at all. But because the Court \narrived at that decision, we have found ourselves, over the last \nquarter of a century, grappling with how we can regulate to some degree \nthis excessive--to put it mildly--explosion in the cost of running for \npublic office. Not just the Senate; in the House of Representatives and \nlocal offices in our respective States, the cost has risen \ndramatically.\n  I fear, as the Senator from West Virginia has so eloquently stated, \nif we do not do something meaningful about this, that we do put our \ndemocracy in peril. That is not an exaggeration. That is not hyperbole. \nWhen we have reached the situation in this country where the maximum \ncontribution you can give is $1,000--in effect, $2,000--and we are \nabout to raise that to possibly $3,000 or $6,000, for a couple to \n$12,000--and an annual calendar year level of contributions by \nindividuals to $75,000 or a couple to $150,000, and we are told that is \nbarely enough to finance the campaign system in this country, that we \nare going to have to index it so we can have incremental increases as \nthe cost-of-living goes up--I always thought cost-of-living adjustments \nwere done for the poor, people on Social Security, people who could not \nmake ends meet, buy groceries, pay the rent, clothe themselves, so we \nbuilt in a cost-of-living adjustment to assist those people. A cost-of-\nliving adjustment for less than 1 percent of the American public who \ncan afford to write a $1,000 check to finance a Federal office--they \nneed a cost-of-living adjustment so they can buy more influence? That \nis incredible to me, that we would even entertain such a thought as \npart of the campaign finance reform mechanisms.\n  I served for 2 years as the general chairman of the Democratic Party, \na position I was proud to hold. I did not seek it. I was asked to do \nit. I filled a similar role to that held by the former majority leader \nof the Senate, Bob Dole, former colleague Paul Laxalt, and others over \nthe years who had been asked to fill those roles, particularly during a \nnational campaign. I got to see firsthand what could happen when the \nmoney chase gets out of hand. It got out of hand in both parties.\n\n  My great fear is that if we don't learn these lessons, if we don't \nunderstand how disgusted the American public is and how narrow the pool \nof likely candidates for public office is becoming, and how that \njeopardizes the institutions which we are responsible for preserving \nfor future generations to be able to inherit and sit at these desks and \nchairs, and debate the issues of their day, that we are naive at best \nand border on corruption at its worst. It is getting to that.\n  Two-hundred years ago in order to seek public office you had to be a \nwhite male who owned property. We changed the laws in this country. It \nis no longer the case. But we have established a de facto set of \nbarriers that are almost as pernicious. That barrier has become money; \nunless you have wealth or access to it or are willing to make \ncompromises, a coal miner's son or daughter, as the Senator from West \nVirginia said, or anyone else of modest means, for that matter, is \ngoing to be de facto excluded from seeking public office.\n  I noted this morning in the New York Times a story by John Cushman, \nentitled ``After Silent Spring Industry Put Spin on All It Brewed.'' \nThe subject matter of the article concerns the chemical industry and \nhow it is particularly involved in this. But I suspect they are not \nunique, and that this happens across the board.\n  It is interesting to read one paragraph. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe entire article be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        After `Silent Spring' Industry Put Spin on All It Brewed\n\n                        (By John H. Cushman Jr.)\n\n       Washington, March 25.--The year was 1963, the publication \n     of Rachel Carson's ``Silent Spring'' had just opened the \n     modern environmental movement, and the chemical industry \n     reckoned it had a public relations emergency on its hands.\n       Already that year, the industry's trade association had \n     spent $75,000 scraped together for a ``crash program'' to \n     counter the book's environmental message. It needed an \n     additional $66,000 to expand the public relations campaign. \n     Several companies quickly pledged more money to challenge the \n     book's\n\n[[Page S2860]]\n\n     arguments, according to the association's internal documents.\n       That chain of events would be repeated time and again, at \n     ever increasing expense, as the industry's lobbying arm in \n     Washington, now known as the American Chemistry Council, \n     confronted the environmental age in the corridors of power \n     and in the arena of public opinion.\n       Now the industry's practices over the decades are facing \n     unusual and unwanted exposure, as its documents, turned up by \n     trial lawyers in lawsuits against the industry, are being \n     published by environmental advocates on the Web and explored \n     in a PBS documentary on Monday. Many of the documents were \n     disclosed in 1998 in a series of articles in The Houston \n     Chronicle, but until now they have not received much wider \n     attention.\n       The adverse publicity is nothing new for the chemical \n     industry.\n       ``I seem, perhaps like Halley's comet, to float \n     periodically into the orbit of your board,'' an industry \n     lobbyist, Glen Perry, said to the chemical group's board in \n     1966, ``generally with my hand outstretched in a plea for \n     financial support of efforts to avert, or avoid the \n     consequences of, some frightful catastrophe. Like Rachel \n     Carson.''\n       Or Bhopal. Or Love Canal. Or state ballot initiatives \n     unfriendly to the industry, or legislation tightening \n     regulations on toxic wastes. Or even the industry's growing \n     perception that no matter how much money it spent on public \n     relations--amounts that grew from a few thousand dollars a \n     year to a few million a year as the decades passed--it was \n     losing its war for public opinion.\n       The industry used many weapons in its campaigns to \n     influence state and federal laws; public relations was just \n     one of them.\n       Giving money to candidates, of course, played an important \n     role in the industry's strategy, according to a 1980 document \n     discussing ``political muscle, how much we've got, and how we \n     can get more.''\n       Spending by political action committees helped its \n     lobbyists gain access to members of Congress, the document \n     said. ``But over the long term, the more important function \n     of the PAC's is to upgrade the Congress,'' it said.\n       Just as important, said a 1984 document, were carefully \n     orchestrated ``grass roots efforts'' like the industry's \n     establishment of a pressure group with the benign name \n     Citizens for Effective Environmental Action Now.\n       The industry spent more than $150,000 that year to make \n     25,000 phone calls and send 42,000 pieces of direct mail. \n     Adopting new computer technology for the first time, the \n     group documented more than 7,000 calls and telegrams to seven \n     important Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, \n     which was drafting the Superfund legislation governing toxic \n     waste dumps.\n       ``Grass roots delivered three congressmen who were ready to \n     take action during committee writing of legislation,'' the \n     document said. But the ``industry lobby was unable to respond \n     quickly to their offer of help,'' the industry association's \n     assessment noted. ``We must be prepared to provide the \n     congressmen with a simple action plan and legislative \n     language.''\n       But Congress was responding to broader public concerns, and \n     for decades the industry was painfully conscious of how hard \n     it was to sway public opinion.\n       ``The Public Relations Committee realizes that public fear \n     of chemicals is a disease which will never be completely \n     eradicated,'' a committee member, Cleveland Lane, reported in \n     1964. ``It may lie dormant or appear from time to time as a \n     minor rash, but it can flare up at any time as a major and \n     debilitating fever for our industry as a result of a few, or \n     even one instance, such as the Mississippi fish kill, or the \n     publication by some highly readable alarmist, or as an issue \n     seized upon by some politician in need of building a \n     crusading image.''\n       At the same time, Mr. Lane acknowledged that only deeds, \n     not words, could salvage the industry's reputation--a credo \n     that industry lobbyists repeat to this day.\n       ``No public relations operation, no matter how effective, \n     can cover up acts of carelessness or neglect which do harm to \n     the citizens,'' said Mr. Lane, who worked for Goodrich-Gulf \n     Chemicals Inc. ``As long as we produce products or conduct \n     operations which can cause health hazards, public discomfort \n     or property damage, we must do all we can to prevent these \n     situations.''\n       In recent years, the industry has increasingly tailored its \n     publicity campaigns to emphasize its efforts to follow strict \n     safety standards, set forth in a voluntary effort it calls \n     Responsible Care. The effort is intended to control the risks \n     of chemical pollution and help convince a skeptical public \n     that the industry is made up of good corporate citizens.\n       Among those not convinced of the industry's good faith is \n     Bill Moyers, whose documentary for PBS focuses on the dangers \n     of exposure to vinyl chloride, the subject of litigation by a \n     chemical industry worker's widow that uncovered the \n     documents. The report relies heavily on them to assert that \n     the companies and their trade association covered up the \n     dangers of the chemical, used for making plastic products.\n       Even before the documentary was broadcast, the industry \n     group charged Mr. Moyers last week with ``journalistic \n     malpractice'' for not including interviews with its spokesmen \n     or allowing them to preview the program. Instead, Mr. Moyers \n     has invited them to react to his documentary in a half-hour \n     discussion to be broadcast immediately afterward.\n       ``I consider myself in good company to be attacked by the \n     industry that tried to smear Rachel Carson,'' Mr. Moyers said \n     on Friday.\n       The Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization \n     in Washington, plans to publish on its Web site on Tuesday \n     tens of thousands of pages of internal industry documents \n     produced in lawsuits. The group plans to expand the Web site, \n     www.ewg.org, into a wide-ranging archive of industry \n     documents.\n       The documents cover not just vinyl chloride and public \n     relations crusades but every facet of the industry \n     association's work, from lobbying on taxes and price controls \n     to transportation safety and the growing array of laws and \n     regulations that have taken effect since the 1960's.\n       In 1979, the industry began a multi-million-dollar \n     advertising effort to counter ``growing evidence that the \n     public image of the chemical industry is unfavorable, and \n     this has negative results on sales and profits,'' one \n     document explained.\n       Then in 1984, disaster struck with the explosion of a \n     chemical plant in Bhopal, India, which killed and injured \n     thousands of people.\n       The industry found in surveys later that ``we are perceived \n     as the No. 1 environmental risk to society,'' an industry \n     association official told the group's board in 1986.\n       Despite continued spending to improve its image, little had \n     changed by 1990, association officials fond.\n       ``There is a rising tide of environmental awareness in the \n     country,'' a document reported that year. ``Favorable public \n     opinion about the industry continues to decline.'' In a \n     decade, the percentage of the public that considered the \n     industry under-regulated grew to 74 percent from 56 percent.\n       So as the environmental groups, with membership expanding \n     by hundreds of thousands of people a year, laid plans for a \n     20th celebration of Earth Day, in 1990, the industry worked \n     to make its voice heard, too.\n       For the first time, it began to advertise its Responsible \n     Care program, setting aside a $5 million, five-year budget to \n     make its approach known to the public. ``The public must see \n     an entire industry on the move,'' one document said.\n       ``The term `public relations' is morally bankrupt,'' a \n     memorandum cautioned, ``and yet, done properly, is exactly \n     what is needed to make Responsible Care work.''\n       And in interviews last week, the group's lobbyists said \n     that Responsible Care was steadily improving the industry's \n     environmental performance--and that its latest polling \n     suggested this approach now seemed to be winning over the \n     public.\n       ``The evolution of an industry is a journey,'' said Charles \n     W. Van Vlack, the American Chemistry Council's chief \n     operating officer. ``It is a fascinating evolution in terms \n     of attitude and in terms of performance. We went through the \n     process of the public coming to terms with our industry \n     before most, if not all, other industries. It was in our \n     face--we had to deal with it.''\n\n  Mr. DODD. As is my colleague from West Virginia, I am most reluctant \nto amend the Constitution. I have resisted almost every single effort \nexcept this one during my 20 years as a Member of the Senate. I cherish \nand carry with me every day a copy of the Constitution given to me by \nthe Senator from West Virginia, my seatmate. In fact, it is inscribed \nby him to me. I cherish it.\n  To illustrate the point, I will bring it out of my pocket. I carry it \nevery day--Senator Byrd carries his with him as well--to remind me of \nthe important role we fill here as Members of this body, and how we \nshould cherish and protect that document. But I know of no other means \nby which we can effectuate a fundamental change in these laws.\n  I think we have made some decent progress on the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation. I am a supporter of it because it is the only means by \nwhich we are going to be able to bring some possible discipline to the \nprocess. It will slow down the exponential growth of the cost of these \ncampaigns.\n  But the real answer is what the Senator from South Carolina has \noffered. That is the real answer. It is the only answer.\n  Someday we may adopt this, if the situation continues to run out of \nhand. The Senator from South Carolina, myself and the Senator from West \nVirginia may no longer be Members of this body. I am sorry to say that, \nbut that may be the case.\n  Others may look back to this debate and the debate we had in 1997, or \nother debates over the years, in which the Senator from South Carolina \nhas raised this proposal on the issue of campaign finance reform that \ncame to the floor of the Senate, and rue that we did not in earlier \ntimes take the steps that the Senator has suggested as a way of \nproviding us with a more simple and clear-cut manner by which to \nregulate the condition of our Federal elections.\n\n[[Page S2861]]\n\n  As the Senator from South Carolina has pointed out, we have now run \nPresidential elections for 25 years with public financing. No less a \nconservative than Ronald Reagan accepted public money, as had George \nBush. As a condition of accepting Federal dollars, of course, they were \nlimited in the amount they could spend.\n  Public financing has even less of a chance of being adopted by this \nCongress than the proposal offered by the Senator from South Carolina. \nI am sorry that is the case as well--not because I particularly like \nthe idea of public financing. But in the absence of that, and given the \nBuckley v. Valeo decision, it is very difficult for us to craft \nlegislation that is going to survive constitutional scrutiny in light \nof the Buckley v. Valeo decision, hence the value of the importance of \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina.\n  I noted this morning that William Safire had a column called \n``Working Its Will,'' in which he endorses the McCain-Feingold \napproach, as I read it. But I was struck by the story told at the \noutset of the column, which I will share with my colleague. He said:\n       The story is told of the corrupt Albany judge who called \n     opposing trial lawyers into his chambers.\n       ``You offered me a $5,000 campaign contribution to throw \n     this case to the plaintiff,'' said the fair-minded judge, \n     ``and defendant's lawyer here just offered me $10,000 to find \n     for his client. Now how about plaintiff giving me $5,000 \n     more, evening things up--and we try the case on the merits?''\n\n  It almost seems like that is what happened here. Money talks, but \nmoney is not speech. That is the essence of the offense and defense of \ncampaign finance reform.\n  William Safire goes on in this column.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that column be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                            Working Its Will\n\n                          (By William Safire)\n\n       The story is told of the corrupt Albany judge who called \n     opposing trial lawyers into his chambers.\n       ``You offered me a $5,000 campaign contribution to throw \n     this case to the plaintiff,'' said the fair-minded judge, \n     ``and defendant's lawyer here just offered me $10,000 to find \n     for his client. Now how about plaintiff giving me $5,000 \n     more, evening things up--and we try the case on the merits?''\n       Whether the bidding war that is now American politics will \n     continue in this fashion is to be decided in the Senate this \n     week. Every senator knows the subject cold and need not rely \n     on staff expertise or party discipline for guidance. Rarely \n     do voters see such a revealing free-for-all.\n       Money talks, but money is not speech. That, in essence, is \n     the offense and defense of campaign finance reformers.\n       That heavy political contributions influence officeholders \n     is beyond dispute. Money for ``access'' rarely qualifies as \n     prosecutable bribery, but the biggest givers are usually the \n     biggest receivers. The pros know that a quo has a way of \n     following a quid and the public is not stupid.\n       The purchase of a pardon by Marc Rich haunts the Senate \n     this week. The stain spreads; now we learn that the fugitive \n     billionaire, with $250,000 to the Anti-Defamation League, \n     induced its national director to lobby President Bill Clinton \n     for forgiveness and thereby bring glee to the hearts of anti-\n     Semites. (Abe Foxman should resign to demonstrate that \n     ethical blindness has consequences.)\n       But the hurdle that Senators John McCain and Russell \n     Feingold must jump is this: does the restriction of money in \n     campaigns deny anyone freedom of speech?\n       Of course it does. But we abridge free speech all the time, \n     in protecting copyright, in ensuring defendants' rights to \n     fair trials, in guarding privacy, in forbidding malicious \n     defamation and incitement to riot. Because no single one of \n     our rights is absolute, we restrain one when it treads too \n     heavily on another.\n       That's why our courts have held repeatedly in the past \n     century that the Constitution permits restrictions on \n     political contributions. Just as antitrust laws encouraged \n     competition in business, anti-contribution laws have enhanced \n     competition in politics. Freedom of speech is diminished when \n     one voice who can afford to buy the time and space is allowed \n     to drown out the other side.\n       Washington opponents of campaign finance reform offer less \n     lofty arguments, too.\n       1. ``Holding down the number of paid political spots will \n     increase the power of the media at the expense of the \n     political parties.'' And what do my ideological soulmates \n     fine so terrible about that? The wheezing liberal voices of \n     the Bosnywash corridor are as often as not clobbered by the \n     intellectual firepower of conservative columnists, Wall \n     Street Journal editorialists and good-looking talking heads. \n     Wake up and smell the right-wing cappuccino, fellas.\n       2. ``If we close the soft-money loop-hole, money will soon \n     find another way to reach politicians.'' Fine; that will \n     provide a campaign platform for the next generation's great \n     white hat. The tree of liberty must constantly be refreshed \n     by the figurative blood of tyrannous fund-raisers, as \n     Jefferson almost said.\n       3. ``If this goo-goo abomination passes with all its \n     amendments, and any one item is struck down by the courts, \n     then the whole thing must go up in smoke.'' Do Republicans \n     really want to hold that unseverability gun to the head of \n     the Rehnquist court? Why, if you're so hot for freedom of \n     speech, tempt the high court to weaken the First Amendment by \n     letting a questionable part of an all-or-nothing law through?\n       Tomorrow the senators seeking to keep in place the Clinton-\n     McAuliffe fund-raising abuses that so polluted the 90's will \n     offer the Hagel substitute for the McCain-Feingold bill. It's \n     sabotage, plain and simple, ``limiting'' soft-money gifts to \n     a half-million dollars per fat-cat family per election cycle.\n       Senators, fresh from offending billionaire candidates and \n     from thumbing the eye of the powerful broadcasters' lobby, \n     should cherry-pick a few items from the Hagel substitute, up \n     the hard-money limit to $2,500 and take their chances on a \n     sore-loser filibuster by voting down the all-or-nothing \n     trick.\n       If that's the will the Senate works, I think President Bush \n     would tut-tut and sign McCain-Feingold. That's because I'm an \n     optimist and believe in the two-party system.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there is a column that addresses a situation \nin my own State of Connecticut but also talks about the subject matter \nof campaign financing across the country, written by Michele Jacklin of \nthe Hartford Courant.\n  I ask unanimous consent that her column be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Courant, March 25, 2001]\n\n               Campaign Finance Bill Levels Playing Field\n\n                          (By Michele Jacklin)\n\n       Warren Buffett, the third richest person in America and \n     someone who could buy any politician he wants, weighed in on \n     the campaign finance reform debate last Sunday.\n       Characterizing the existing fund-raising system as ``a \n     shakedown of sorts,'' Buffett said politicians offer a \n     product for sale ``and the product is access and influence.''\n       ``It's not buying votes, but it's getting in the door. And \n     the people with the most money are going to get in the door \n     the most frequently,'' Buffett said on ABC's ``This Week.''\n       Mind you, Buffett is so rich he could walk through any door \n     unimpeded. But the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and a \n     growing number of people in all walks of life have come to \n     realize that the pay-to-play system is unfair. Thanks to \n     outdated laws and wrong-headed judicial decisions, this \n     nation has become a plutocracy in which only the voices of \n     the wealthy are heard above the din.\n       The word ``voices'' is especially crucial in the debate \n     about campaign finance reform that is raging in Washington \n     and in Hartford. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that \n     campaign spending is speech and cannot be constrained under \n     the First Amendment. But do you think the nine jurists on the \n     court, most of whom are millionaires themselves, intended \n     that the voices of the rich should be louder and stronger \n     than the voices of the less privileged?\n       To be sure, President Bush and a majority of Republican \n     officeholders think so. They oppose congressional efforts to \n     ban the use of unregulated, unlimited ``soft money'' in \n     federal campaigns. Just the other day, with Democratic help, \n     the Senate approved an amendment to the McCain-Feingold bill \n     that would allow federal candidates to raise substantially \n     larger amounts of money from individuals when they run \n     against wealthy candidates who bankroll their own \n     candidacies.\n       As a result, the National Voting Rights Institute switched \n     from supporting the soft-money legislation to opposing it, \n     saying: ``For the vast majority of Americans who cannot \n     afford to make a $1,000 contribution, the amended McCain-\n     Feingold bill now makes matters worse.''\n       And Doris Haddock, a 91-year-old woman who walked across \n     America to raise awareness of the issue, said of the \n     amendment: ``It creates a fairer fight between the rich and \n     the super-rich, but it still leaves out the man on the \n     street. What's the point of a level playing field when the \n     field is on the moon?''\n       Here in Connecticut, Democratic legislators are wrestling \n     with ways to not only make the playing field a little more \n     even--at least in terms of statewide races--but to keep it on \n     planet Earth.\n       You'll hear two major complaints about the public financing \n     bill passed Wednesday by the Government Administration and \n     Elections Committee. First, that taxpayers shouldn't be \n     forced to pay for political campaigns and second, that the \n     legislation isn't perfect.\n       The first objection is absurd. In fact, taxpayers wouldn't \n     be forced to do anything;\n\n[[Page S2862]]\n\n     they would be able to choose whether to contribute $5 via \n     checkoff on their state income tax forms. Also, an \n     individual's taxes pay for many things that he or she might \n     not like. I don't want my federal taxes used to build Osprey \n     tilt-wing aircraft, whose only purpose I can figure is to \n     kill American military personnel. Guess what? Tough noogies.\n       As for it not being a perfect bill, OK. It's not. Sen. \n     Andrew W. Roraback of Goshen, using some contorted logic, \n     urged his colleagues to vote for Gov. John G. Rowland's \n     alternative plan ``in the belief that doing something is \n     better than doing nothing.''\n       But if Rowland's minimalist--and constitutionally suspect--\n     plan (which was rejected by the elections panel) is better \n     than nothing, why not take the next step and rid the system, \n     to as great an extent as possible, of special-interest money? \n     But Roraback and his fellow Republicans, with the exception \n     of freshman Rep. Diana S. Urban of North Stonington, opposed \n     the public financing bill.\n       Under the proposal, candidates for governor and other \n     statewide offices would be eligible for public financing if \n     they first raised a set amount of money (90 percent of it \n     from Connecticut residents) to establish their legitimacy and \n     voluntarily agreed to spending limits. Candidates would be \n     prohibited from accepting money from political committees.\n       The bill is a huge improvement over last year's version, \n     which Rowland vetoed, in that it applies to the entire \n     campaign cycle, not just to the months following the parties' \n     nominating conventions.\n       But there is an imperfect part. The bill doesn't go far \n     enough in limiting the influence of special interests in \n     legislative campaigns. The financing plan is modeled on one \n     used in Nebraska: A candidate would voluntarily agree to \n     spending limits. If his or her opponent violated those \n     limits, the candidate would be eligible for some public \n     money. PACs and lobbyists would face restrictions on what \n     they could give.\n       Rep. Alex Knopp of Norwalk, the chief architect of the \n     bill, acknowledged its flaws, but said there wouldn't be \n     enough state money, at least not right away, to offer public \n     financing to everyone.\n       Should the bill reach his desk, Rowland will probably \n     strike it down again. In the name of free speech, special \n     interests will be allowed to continue to unduly influence our \n     elected leaders.\n       Make no mistake, those who hide behind the shield of free \n     speech have turned it into an oxymoron. In the context of \n     American politics, speech isn't free. It belongs only to \n     those who can afford it.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, she makes the point, and I will quote her. I \nshould give her credit for this. She says:\n\n       Make no mistake, those who hide behind the shield of free \n     speech have turned it into an oxymoron. In the context of \n     American politics, speech isn't free. It belongs only to \n     those who can afford it.\n\n  That says it about as well and as concisely as anything I have seen \nin print.\n  We will vote on this matter later today. We had 33 votes or \nthereabouts the last time, and I am hopeful we may get a few more of \nthose who will want to join us in what I consider to be a noble cause.\n  I thank my colleague from South Carolina for his efforts. As he has \npointed out on numerous occasions, there are other examples where we \nlimit speech. Speech is not a right without its limitations. And there \nare countless examples of where, in fact, we limit speech because of \ncircumstances that we have discerned to be more valuable and more \nimportant than unfettered speech.\n  Certainly, in my view, nothing can be more serious than the debate \nabout campaign finance reform and trying to put the brakes on slowing \ndown the money chase, trying to make seeking public office more \navailable to more people, people with good ideas and creativity and \nimagination and energy who serve in public life but who, because of the \nrising costs of these campaigns, will be excluded from that \npossibility.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has come up with the only workable \nsolution that I can think of at this juncture. In the absence of it \nbeing adopted, of course, I will continue to support McCain-Feingold \nbecause I know of no other way in the absence of that than trying to do \nsomething about it.\n  A better way of dealing with this is to adopt the amendment being \noffered by the Senator from South Carolina. I am pleased to be a \nsupporter of it. I thank him for doing so.\n  I regret there are not more Members here to engage in this debate \ntoday. I realize it is Monday. As the Senator from West Virginia said, \npeople are probably out holding fundraisers all across the country. As \none of our colleagues pointed out the other day, you have to raise \n$100,000 a week now to compete effectively in one of the largest States \nin this country. In my State, one of the smallest States in the \ncountry, you have to raise over $1,000 a day, every day; in fact, more \nthan that in order to compete in a contested matter in the small State \nof Connecticut. I have watched a statewide race go from $400,000 in the \nmid-1970s to $5, $6, $7 million today in Connecticut.\n  That is obscene. There is no other way to describe it. It is obscene. \nAnd anyone who has looked at it agrees. The idea, as some have said, \nthat the problem is not that there is too much money in politics but \nthat there is too little really just runs smack into what most \nAmericans, the overwhelming majority of Americans, believe. They \nunderstand it. I think we know that they understand it.\n  I think it is regrettable that we are not going to do something more \nabout it, particularly the idea that is being suggested this afternoon \nby the Senator from South Carolina.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Again, the distinguished Senator from Connecticut \npassionately speaks common sense. It is the most moving speech I have \nheard with respect to this particular initiative. I wish everyone could \nhave been here to hear that. I hope they look at his remarks in the \nRecord so they can understand just exactly what is behind this \nparticular initiative.\n  Mr. President, Senator Specter and I have a constitutional amendment \nwhich states that Congress is hereby authorized to regulate or control \nexpenditures in Federal elections. Senator Specter and I have been here \nbefore to argue for this same amendment and we are pleased to have this \nopportunity again, this time with the support of Senators Byrd, \nCleland, Miller, Biden and Reid. But Mr. President, this is perhaps the \nmost timely debate for this Constitutional Amendment because critics \nhere in this body and commentators have spent much time discussing the \nconstitutionality of McCain-Feingold and the various proposed \namendments to this bill.\n  I want to state clearly, here at the outset, that this amendment does \nnot frustrate, oppose, support, or endorse any particular plan of \nreform. Rather, it is the first step toward meaningful reform, \nregardless of the approach. To that end, I hoped to debate this at the \nconclusion of McCain-Feingold so that it could not be used as a sword \nagainst that measure.\n  We had our first fit of conscience when we passed the 1974 Federal \nElection Campaign Act. This act came about due to the untoward activity \nin the 1967 and 1971 Presidential races. I want to remind everyone that \nthis was a deliberate, bipartisan effort. It set spending limits on \ncampaigns, limited candidates' personal spending, limited expenditures \nby independent persons or groups for or against candidates, set \nvoluntary spending limits as a condition for receiving public funding, \nset disclosure requirements for campaign spending and receipts, set \nlimits on contributions for individuals and political committees, and \ncreated the Federal Election Commission. This was a comprehensive \nproposal, with each part complementing the other.\n  However, the Supreme Court supplanted this regime with its views on \ncampaign finance in the now infamous decision, Buckley v. Valeo. The \nresulting system put a premium on fund raising and encouraged covert \nmoney donations. Don't take my word for it, look at Justice Kennedy's \ndissenting opinion in the recent Court decision, Nixon v. Shrink \nMissouri Government PAC:\n\n       The plain fact is that the compromise the Court invented in \n     Buckley set the stage for a new kind of speech to enter the \n     political system. It is covert speech. The Court has forced a \n     substantial amount of political speech underground, as \n     contributors and candidates devise even more elaborate \n     methods of avoiding contribution limits, limits which take no \n     account of rising campaign costs. The preferred method has \n     been to conceal the real purpose of the speech. Soft money \n     may be contributed to political parties in unlimited amounts \n     . . . Issue advocacy, like soft money, is unrestricted . . . \n     while straightforward speech in the form of financial \n     contributions paid to a candidate, speech subject to full \n     disclosure and prompt evaluation by the public, is not. The \n     current system would be unfortunate, and suspect under the \n     First Amendment, had it evolved from a deliberate legislative \n     choice; but its unhappy origins are in our earlier decree in\n\n[[Page S2863]]\n\n     Buckley, which by accepting half of what Congress did \n     (limiting contributions) but rejecting the other (limiting \n     expenditures) created a misshapen system, one which distorts \n     the meaning of speech.\n\n  Forgive me for the length of the above quote, but I feel Justice \nKennedy hit the nail on the head. Now, we must excise this cancer from \nour political system. But it is an exercise in futility to address any \nparticular campaign reform plan without first enacting a constitutional \namendment because Buckley is still the law of the land.\n  One critical flaw in the Buckley decision is that the Court equated \nmoney with speech. Justice Stevens, however, correctly noted in his \nconcurring opinion in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, ``Money \nis property; it is not speech.'' Justice Stevens explains that while \nthe Constitution protects an individual's decision about how to use his \nor her property, ``[t]hese property rights, however, are not entitled \nto the same protection as the right to say what one pleases.'' An \nindividual's right to get up on a stump and speak on behalf of or in \nopposition to a candidate is markedly different from ``speaking'' with \nmoney. Justice Kennedy, also in Shrink, observes that there is a \ndifference between inspiring volunteers through speech and hiring \nvolunteers with money. The first activity deserves the utmost \nprotection. Unfortunately, those are minority views of the Court.\n  For the sake of argument, assume money is speech as my colleague from \nKentucky asserts. At the start of the debate we heard the Senator from \nKentucky provide me the compliment of saying that ``I understand the \nnub of the issue.'' Of course after that fleeting moment he argues why \nwe should not accept this measure. Of course there was a time when he \nsaw the value of this approach. In 1987, my colleague offered a \nconstitutional amendment to restrict the amount of money wealthy \nindividuals could spend on their election. The important point is not \nthat he once advocated that position, but rather, it recognizes that \nspeech is not completely unfettered when there are significant \ninterests that require its limitation. The following are a few examples \nof where speech is limited: If it creates a clear and present danger of \nimminent lawless action; if it constitutes fighting words; if it is \nobscene; [The Supreme Court ruled in 1978 in FCC v. Pacifica that the \nFederal Communications Commission could limit what they considered \noffensive language on the airwaves]; if it constitutes defamation; if \nit amounts to false and deceptive advertisement.\n  Let me also point out a couple of speech restrictions perhaps more \nclosely related to the current debate. The Hatch Act limits federal \nemployee involvement in campaigns. Admittedly, the ``Hatch Act \nAmendments of 1993'' removed most of the restrictions on voluntary, \nfree-time activities by federal employees; however the following are a \nsample of the restrictions that still apply:\n  Federal employees are generally restricted from soliciting, accepting \nor receiving political contributions from any person; they may not run \nfor office in most partisan elections; they are generally prohibited \nfrom engaging in partisan campaign activity on federal property, on \nofficial duty time, while wearing a uniform or insignia identifying \nthem as federal officials or employees, or while using a government \nvehicle.\n  Finally, as Justice Breyer, in Nixon v. Shrink, notes ``The \nConstitution often permits restrictions on speech of some form in order \nto prevent a few from drowning out the many--in Congress, for example, \nwhere constitutionally protected debate, Art. I, Sec. 6, is limited to \nprovide every Member an equal opportunity to express his or her views. \nOr in elections, where the Constitution tolerates numerous restrictions \non ballot access, limiting the political rights of some so as to make \neffective the political rights of the entire electorate.'' This is an \nimportant point Mr. President. I have long maintained that it is ill-\nadvised to allow one who possesses more money to drown out the speech \nof another with less money. Essentially what we are saying now is if \nyou have money, speak, if you don't, you have the right to keep your \nmouth shut. It is from this line of arguments that I really draw my \nconclusion that I am the one promoting speech.\n  So there is precedent for limiting speech where there are equally \nimportant interests at stake. Our campaign system is of sufficient \nimportance and has sufficient problems to warrant limited restrictions. \nJust consider the affect of the cost of running for office. The \nexorbitant costs of campaigns today are a real hurdle, preventing many \npeople from throwing their hat into the arena. The average amount spent \non a campaign for the United States Senate in the year 2000 was \napproximately $7 million. Can you imagine that. That means you have to \nraise on average $22,000 each week for the six years you are in the \nSenate in order to get ready for your next election. Or stated another \nway, you have to raise over $3000.00 per day. Yes that's per day. \nSaturday and Sunday, you need to raise $3000.00. Something is wrong \nwhen you have to raise more on Sunday than your church.\n  Sadly this has really become a money chase. Rampant fund raising \nthreatens the very fabric of democracy because it causes people to lose \nfaith in the political system. They see their candidates motivated by \ncontributions and not by important issues in their community. It often \nseems to the voting public that its voice is being drowned out by the \nhum of cash registers. That of course was not always the case. When I \nfirst ran for office, much of my campaign work was accomplished through \nvolunteers. It was more enjoyable to campaign because you could really \nfocus on the individual citizen rather than on raising money. You can't \nafford to go door to door anymore.\n  By extension, while politicians are out courting money they are \nobviously not in Washington addressing the concerns of their \nconstituents. There is no doubt that our current campaign finance \nsystem has bred absenteeism in the Senate chamber. We no longer arrive \nto work at 9 o'clock in the morning on Monday and struggle to close \nshop by 5 o'clock in the afternoon on Friday like we once did. Now on \nMonday and on Tuesday morning, there is no real floor debate because so \nmany people are out raising money. On Wednesdays and Thursdays, we \nrequest time windows so that we can do more fund raising. And then as \nsoon as Friday rolls around, we bolt from the starting blocks for \nanother leg in the money race. If curing this sickly system isn't in \nthe governmental interest, then I don't know what is.\n  We realize these problems and are now faced with the present dilemma \nof deciding how to reform this broken system under the misguided \nframework laid out in Buckley. The Senator from Arizona and the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin are to be commended. They are dedicated and have \nsuccessfully drawn attention to this issue. But their critics assert \nthe same two arguments: 1. their proposal does not go far enough, or 2. \ntheir proposal goes too far and runs afoul to the Constitution. This \nwill be the case with any serious proposal because of Buckley.\n  The unconstitutionality of the Snowe-Jeffords portion of the McCain-\nFeingold bill which addresses issue advocacy has been talked about, and \nwritten about. Recently, Charles Lane wrote an article for the \nWashington Post titled, ``Court Challenge Likely if McCain-Feingold \nBill Passes.'' The reason for this is that in Buckley, the Supreme \nCourt held that campaign finance limitations apply only to express \ncommunications, such as ``vote for,'' ``elect,'' ``support,'' ``cast \nyour ballot for,'' and ``Smith for Congress,'' that advocate the \nelection or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office \nin express terms. If express words such as these are not present, then \nit is issue advocacy and cannot be regulated. The circuit courts, \nfollowing the Buckley precedent, have drawn a bright line by requiring \nthese express words and rejecting intermediate tests to determine \nwhether something constitutes express advocacy or issue advocacy. Maine \nRight to Life Committee v. FEC, Oct. 6, 1997, the First Circuit \naffirmed the district court's opinion that the ``reasonable person'' \nstandard in its definition of ``express advocacy'' infringed upon issue \nadvocacy, an area protected by the First Amendment. The Fourth Circuit \nreached a similar conclusion in FEC v. Christian Action Network, 92 \nF.3d 1178, 4th Cir. 1997. The Second Circuit, in Vermont Right to \nLife Committee v.\n\n[[Page S2864]]\n\nSorrell, determined state campaign regulations were unconstitutional \nbecause they regulated express and implicit advocacy. It is evident \nthat when the government seeks to regulate anything more than express \nor explicit advocacy, which is what they try to do in McCain-Feingold, \nthe courts strike it down.\n\n  Mr. President, the soft money ban of McCain-Feingold also faces \nconstitutional challenges. The Supreme Court made it clear in Buckley \nthat any restriction on First Amendment rights must be narrowly \ntailored to further a substantial governmental interest such as the \nprevention of corruption or the appearance of corruption. In Federal \nElection Commission v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee, \nColorado I., the Court raised doubts about the risk of corruption \nbetween parties and candidates. On remand to the district court, \nColorado II, the court examined whether section 441a(d) of the FECA may \nconstitutionally impose coordinated expenditure limits upon parties. \nThe lower court found that ``contributor-to-party-to-candidate \npressure'' is an ``unlikely avenue of corruption'' and that party \npressure over candidates does not result in corruption. The court \nreasoned that political parties serve to promote political ideas and by \ndeciding whether or not to support a candidate that subscribes to these \nideas does not equal corrupting influence. This case was again appealed \nto the Tenth Circuit. In its May 5, 2000 decision, the circuit court \naffirmed the district court and echoed its reasoning. Allow me to read \nthe following quotes from the circuit court's decision:\n  ``Political parties today represent a broad-based coalition of \ninterests, and there is nothing pernicious about this coalition shaping \nthe views of its candidates;''\n  ``However, the premise of this theory, namely that, political parties \ncan corrupt the electoral system by influencing their candidates' \npositions, gravely misunderstands the role of political parties in our \ndemocracy,'' and finally;\n  ``The opportunity for corruption or its appearance of corruption is \ngreatest when the political spending is motivated by economic gain. As \ndiscussed below, political parties are diverse entities, one step \nremoved from the candidate, and they exist for noneconomic reasons.''\n  Based on these cases, the ban on soft money is unconstitutional as \nwell. James Bopp is general counsel to the James Madison Center for \nFree Speech and served as counsel in more than 60 election-related \ncases, including the Maine Right to Life v. FEC and the Vermont Right \nto Life v. FEC cases mentioned earlier. Mr. Bopp is certainly an expert \nin this area. That is why I found his analysis of McCain-Feingold \nparticularly persuasive. According to Bopp:\n\n       Because McCain-Feingold 2001 prohibits the raising of \n     ``soft money'' by national political parties, they have no \n     such money available for issue advocacy, legislative, and \n     organizational activities. It treats political parties as if \n     they were federal-candidate election machines . . . Yet these \n     restrictions fail constitutional muster. Political parties \n     enjoy the same unfettered right to issue advocacy as other \n     entities, which is especially appropriate because advancing a \n     broad range of issues is their raison d'etre. ``Reforms'' \n     banning political parties from receiving and spending so-\n     called ``soft money'' cannot be justified as preventing \n     corruption, since the Supreme Court has already held that \n     interest insufficient for restricting issue advocacy in \n     Buckley.\n\n  According to Bopp, if there is not the threat of corruption or the \nappearance of corruption when we speak of political parties, then you \ncan't restrict how they raise their money. Thus, the soft money \nregulations in McCain-Feingold are also likely to be found \nunconstitutional.\n  In light of the above, a constitutional amendment is a necessary \nfirst step to real reform. Until we do this we are merely trying to \npatch a leaky dam with Bandaids. Certainly, amending the constitution \nis not something we should do lightly. But, campaign finance goes right \nto the heart of our democracy. That is likely the reason that of the \nnine most recent amendments, seven relate to our electoral process: The \n19th amendment gave women the right to vote; the 20th set the beginning \nof Presidential and Congressional terms and provided for succession of \nthe President and Vice President, (i.e., this amendment established \nprocedure to replace the President or Vice President elect upon their \ndeath or incapacitation); the 22nd amendment provided Presidential term \nlimits; the 23rd amendment provided the D.C. electoral votes in \nPresidential elections; the 24th amendment eliminated the Poll tax; the \n25th amendment established the procedure for Presidential succession \nwhether by death or incapacitation; the 26th amendment changed the \nvoting age to 18.\n  Surprisingly, the average length of time it took for passage of \nAmendments 20-26 was a little over 17 months. What's even more \ncompelling is the fact that the 24th amendment already recognizes the \ninfluence of money on the freedom of political speech. It says that it \nis unconstitutional to place a financial burden on voters in order for \nthem to voice their political opinions at the polls. In other words, it \ngives us ``one man, one vote.'' The poorest of the poor can cancel out \nthe richest of the rich. This is the same spirit that's driving \ncampaign finance reform today.\n  Mr. President, it isn't that the people do not trust us. I think they \nare bored with us. When you talk about campaigns and everything else \nlike that, today's model is, you hire a consultant, and he gets the \npoll, and you get seven or eight hot-button items or issues, and you \ncounsel: Do not take too strong a position pro or con--for or against--\nbut, on the contrary, say you are concerned: ``I'm troubled.'' \nEverybody who comes to this blooming place is troubled, and they are \nconcerned. But I can't find them taking a position on anything. And \nthat goes for Republicans and for Democrats--all the candidates.\n  So unless you get a unique individual, such as the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, who had no poll, obviously, to get around to this \ncampaign finance--and certainly it was not boring. He kept them on \nfire, and kept them going, and kept them interested--and keeps them \ninterested. That is why we are having this debate. But the truth of the \nmatter is that politics has been taken out of campaigning.\n  Let me emphasize what the Senator from West Virginia was talking \nabout regarding campaigns. No. 1, we used to have nothing but \nvolunteers. I ran for the State house of representatives for $100 back \nin 1948--over 50 years ago. There were 24 candidates. I led the ticket. \nBut I worked, and I saw people. I talked and listened to people. There \nweren't fundraisers to go to.\n  Now, in contrast, there are only fundraisers to go to. In fact, on \nthe recent campaign, I was going around not just thanking but talking \nto old friends, and many said: Why are you coming around now? You have \nalready won a wonderful race by a good majority. Why are you coming \naround now?\n  I said: I didn't get to see you. I didn't get to talk to you. I could \nonly go to fundraisers.\n  Mind you me, if you have run, as I have, for the legislature, for \nLieutenant Governor, Governor, and the U.S. Senate--I have been elected \nseven times--at the country store at the crossroads outside of Honea \nPath on the way into Anderson, they want to know why I didn't come by. \nSo I go by that shift at a mill in Edmund, SC. If I don't get to that 3 \no'clock shift, I have ``Potomac fever,'' I have forgotten about the \npeople.\n  So I know what it is to campaign without money. It is much better \nthan this money chase and the TV squibs about how I am against crime, \nhow I am for education. That crowd over there, they come out for \neducation. They did their best to abolish the Department under \nPresident Reagan, under President Bush, under President Clinton. They \nhad the Contract in the mid-1990s, a few years ago, and wanted to \nabolish the Department of Education. But that is canned now. They are \nall for education. They are not for it, but they have to identify with \nit because the company consultants have said so. That is what is going \non.\n  So the people really are bored with all the campaigning because there \nis nothing to it. You can't get them to take a stand other than they \nare just for this or that popular thing. They finally found out it was \nunpopular to try to veto, but they tried for 20 years to abolish the \nDepartment of Education. I can tell you because I was here and helped \ndefend it over those 20 years.\n  But the people have been taken out of the campaign themselves. That \nis all\n\n[[Page S2865]]\n\nyou have, time to go on the money chase. Obviously, those making the \ncontributions have already made up their mind or they wouldn't have \ncome to the event in the first instance. And you wouldn't have gone to \nthe event except for the money involved.\n\n  So there it is. I think that at this particular time, other than \nciting a dozen variations of the first amendment--or you might say \namendments to that first amendment--I think it ought to be emphasized \njust exactly what has occurred in the words of Justice Kennedy in the \nNixon v. Shrink Missouri case. I quote from him:\n\n       The plain fact is that the compromise the Court invented in \n     Buckley set the stage for a new kind of speech to enter the \n     political system. It is covert speech. The Court has forced a \n     substantial amount of political speech underground, as \n     contributors and candidates devise even more elaborate \n     methods of avoiding contribution limits, limits which take no \n     account of rising campaign costs. The preferred method has \n     been to conceal the real purpose of the speech. Soft money \n     may be contributed to political parties in unlimited amounts. \n     . . . Issue advocacy, like soft money, is unrestricted. . \n     .while straightforward speech in the form of financial \n     contributions paid to a candidate, speech subject to full \n     disclosure and prompt evaluation by the public is not. The \n     current system would be unfortunate, and suspect under the \n     First Amendment, had it evolved from a deliberate legislative \n     choice; but its unhappy origins are in our earlier decree in \n     Buckley, which by accepting half of what Congress did \n     (limiting contributions) but rejecting the other (limiting \n     expenditures) created a misshapen system, one which distorts \n     the meaning of speech.\n\n  Let me add my comment: And distorts the freedom of speech.\n  The constitutional amendment will give the opportunity to the U.S. \nCongress to restore that freedom of speech to all Americans.\n  We have used over three-quarters of our time, Mr. President, and I \nhave some speakers coming who want to speak when they arrive here at 5 \no'clock. So let me suggest the absence of a quorum. I would like to \nspeak to the distinguished leader on the other side to see if I could \ncharge it to him, or certainly not just run the time out in a quorum \ncall and then have 2 hours and no chance to respond. But I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for about 10 minutes or less and that the time be \ncounted against the opponents of the legislation. I am told, talking to \nstaff, that is not objectionable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dodd are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, before we have the quorum, the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania is the principal cosponsor. We have 20 minutes \nremaining. We have some other speakers coming. I will try to borrow \nsome time from Senator McConnell when he regains the floor. I ask \nunanimous consent that the quorum call then be charged to both sides.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have just arrived from Pennsylvania. I \nam going to take about 3 minutes to prepare a statement. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, again, I join my distinguished colleague \nfrom South Carolina, Senator Hollings, in offering a constitutional \namendment which, simply stated, would allow the Federal Government, \nthrough its Congress, signed by the President, or overriding the \nPresidential veto, and the State legislatures, in due form according to \nState law, to enact legislation to limit expenditures and contributions \non campaign matters.\n  In so doing, I would not in any way suggest changing the language of \nthe first amendment, which I consider sacrosanct and have personal \nreverence for. But in moving for a constitutional amendment on this \nissue to overturn Buckley v. Valeo, there is no reference here to \nchanging any language of the first amendment, but only to changing the \ninterpretation of the Supreme Court of the United States in Buckley v. \nValeo. That decision was extraordinarily complicated. The main portion, \nwhich I hold in my hand, runs 145 pages. That is not considering the \ndissents which were brought. Chief Justice Burger concurred in part and \ndissented in part, and Justice White concurred in part and dissented in \npart. Justice Marshall dissented in part. Justice Rehnquist concurred \nin part and dissented in part. By the time you finish reading the \nopinion in Buckley v. Valeo, what you find is a constitutional \nquagmire--a constitutional quagmire which, in the past 25 years, has \nled to extraordinary litigation and some of the most absurd results in \nconstitutional history.\n  For example, the controversy has arisen as to what is an advocacy ad \nand what is an issue ad. The Supreme Court of the United States, in one \nsmall paragraph in this lengthy opinion, said that in order to uphold \nthe statute so that it would not be considered vague and therefore \nviolative of the due process clause of the fifth amendment, \nunconstitutional on grounds of vagueness, that the statute would \nrequire specific language, such as ``vote for'' or ``vote against,'' \n``support,'' or ``defeat.'' That has brought about the dichotomy on \nwhat is an advocacy ad, which the Supreme Court designed as ``vote \nfor,'' or ``vote against,'' et cetera, or what is an issue ad.\n  Look at what has happened. In the 1996 campaign, President Clinton \nput on the following ad, which was deemed to be an issue ad, not an \nadvocacy ad. What I am about to read to you has been interpreted to be \njust on issues and not urging the election of President Clinton or the \ndefeat of Senator Dole. This is the ad:\n\n       America's values: Head Start, student loans, toxic cleanup, \n     extra police, protected in the budget agreement. The \n     President stood firm. Dole-Gingrich's latest plan includes \n     tax hikes on working families, up to 18 million children \n     facing health care cuts, Medicare slashed $167 billion. Then \n     Dole resigns, leaving behind him the gridlock he and Gingrich \n     created. The President's plan: Politics must wait. Balance \n     the budget. Reform welfare. Protect our values.\n\n  It would be hard to conceive an advertisement which was any more \nemphatic to reelect President Clinton and to defeat Senator Dole. But \nthe exact same pattern was followed by the other side, the Republican \nNational Committee. Listen to the following ad:\n\n       Three years ago, Bill Clinton gave us the largest tax \n     increase in history, including a four-cents-a-gallon increase \n     on gasoline. Bill Clinton said he felt bad about it.\n\n  Then there is a videotape of Clinton saying, ``People in this room \nstill get mad at me over the budget process because you think I raised \nyour taxes too much. It might surprise you to know that I think I \nraised them too much.'' Then President Clinton's face fades out and the \nannouncer comes back on and says, ``OK, Mr. President, we are \nsurprised. So now surprise us again. Support Senator Dole's plan to \nrepeal your gasoline tax and learn that actions do speak louder than \nwords.'' Now how that ad could possibly be interpreted as dealing only \nwith issues and not with the advocacy of Senator Dole's election and \nthe defeat of President Clinton's bid for reelection--I don't like the \nexpression ``boggles the mind,'' but it boggles the mind. But that is \nthe consequence of Buckley v. Valeo.\n  And, then, referring to a single ad in the election for the year 2000 \nPresidential--this is a brief statement because of limited time. We \ncould go into many advertisements that are the same, advocating the \nelection of one candidate and the defeat of the other, but because of \nBuckley v. Valeo are held to be issue ads. This is an unusual one, even \nin the context of issue ads. This is in the election for the year 2000. \nThis is an advertisement paid for by the Democratic National Committee:\n\n       George W. Bush chose Dick Cheney to help lead the \n     Republican Party. What does Cheney's record say about their \n     plans? Cheney was only one of eight Members of Congress to \n     oppose the Clean Water Act, one of few to\n\n[[Page S2866]]\n\n     vote against Head Start, and he voted against the school \n     lunch program and against health insurance for people who \n     lost their jobs. Cheney, an oil company CEO, said it was good \n     for OPEC to cut production of oil and gas so prices can rise. \n     What are their plans for working families?\n\n  It is obvious that the language just read urges defeat of the \ncandidate, Vice President Cheney. But how ludicrous is it to say that \nthis could remotely be considered an issue ad when it takes up the \nClean Water Act? There has been no debate about the Clean Water Act. It \ncould not possibly be an issue on the American political scene. It \ntalks about the Head Start Program, which has been accepted in America \nfor more than a decade--hardly a matter that relates to an issue--or \nthe school lunch program. Again, it is absolutely ludicrous to say that \nthose matters relate to issue advertisements.\n  All of this has happened because of the progeny of Buckley v. Valeo. \nThe decision in Buckley is inordinately complicated. As I say, there \nare 145 pages in the main text before coming to the dissents and \nconcurrences by Chief Justice Burger, Justice White, Justice Marshall, \nand Justice Rehnquist. And then within the doctrines of their \nconcurring and dissenting opinions, Mr. Justice White concurred in part \nand dissented in part. This is the start of his opinion:\n\n       I concur in the Court's answers to certified questions 1, \n     2, 3(b), 3(c), 3(e), 3(f), 3(h), 6, 7, 7(a), 7(b), 7(c), \n     7(d), 8, 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), 8(d), 8(f).\n       I dissent from the answers to certify questions 3(a), 3(d), \n     4(a), and I also join in part three of the court's opinion \n     adding much of parts 1/B II and IV.\n\n  It takes a complicated crossword puzzle analysis to go through the \nopinions and to figure out who agrees with what and who dissents from \nwhat and what is the conclusion. If there ever was a constitutional \nquagmire, this is it.\n  Regrettably, Justice Stevens did not participate in the decision in \nBuckley v. Valeo. Justice Stevens has since participated in the \ndecisions on the issue and has articulated the view that the Supreme \nCourt was wrong in Buckley in equating money and speech.\n  It seems to me to be a non sequitur on its face, to be diplomatic and \nnot to call it absurd, ridiculous, or preposterous, that money equals \nspeech. Yet in a society which comprises democratic rule, one person \none vote, where do you end up with the ability of people to spend \nunlimited sums of money to carry their political point of view? Freedom \nof speech means that someone can advocate, state, articulate, argue, \nbut it hardly means, in my opinion, that somebody should be weightier \nin speech because his bank account is weightier. I come to this issue \nwith a little bit of a personal bias, if I may state briefly my own \npersonal experience with Buckley v. Valeo.\n  In January of 1976, when Buckley v. Valeo was decided, I was in a \nprimary contest with Congressman John Heinz for the Republican \nnomination for the U.S. Senate. In late January 1976, the Supreme Court \nof the United States said that Congressman Heinz could spend millions, \nwhich he did, and that my brother, Morton Specter--he could not have \nmet the highest financing, but he could have done quite well--was \nlimited to $1,000. I petitioned for leave to intervene in Buckley v. \nValeo and to file a brief in Buckley v. Valeo. So I am no Johnny-come-\nlately to this issue.\n  When Senator Hollings said to me years ago: Arlen, why don't we take \non Buckley v. Valeo, I understood Fritz, barely, and we have been \nfighting this constitutional amendment for years. Senator Hollings, if \nhe were understood totally, would have carried the day a long time ago \nwhen he ran for President in 1984. I am pretty sure I have the year \nright. When the campaign was over, Senator Hollings approached me in \nthe steam room one day and said: My Presidential campaign went nowhere. \nEverybody thought Fritz Hollings was a German moving company. Fritz \nHollings.\n  We have been at this for a long time, and we have not gotten very \nfar. We have not gotten very far because there is a coalition of people \nwho articulate the sanctity of freedom of speech, and there are the \npeople who would like to keep the current finance system in effect to \nbenefit those who can raise the most money or those who have the most \nmoney.\n  While I do not like to repeat myself, it is worth repeating that I \nwould not dream of changing the language of the first amendment, but I \nwould actively argue that because a majority of Supreme Court Justices \nhave interpreted the first amendment as they have in Buckley v. Valeo, \ntheir interpretations are not sacrosanct. There are many, many, many \nSupreme Court decisions which are 5-4. One vote decides some of the \nmost important questions touching the lives of Americans every day. \nThose are interpretations of the Constitution. They are not holy writ. \nThey do not come from Mount Olympus. They do not come from Mount Sinai. \nWhile their opinions may be better than mine, they are not better than \nSenator Hollings, a very distinguished lawyer and constitutional \nscholar.\n  I think we have standing to say: Let's take another look at Buckley \nv. Valeo. Let's see where it leaves us.\n  We have had very extended debate during the course of the past week, \nand now we are starting the second week on campaign finance reform. \nContinually the issue is raised: What you are proposing is \nunconstitutional. No matter what it is, which side, the argument is \nraised that it is unconstitutional.\n  On Thursday afternoon we had an extensive debate with the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, the \nSenator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, and I, and we were \npontificating--I was pontificating; they were giving legal arguments--\nabout what was constitutional and what was not constitutional; what is \na bright line to satisfy Buckley v. Valeo. We could all be right or we \ncould all be wrong because the reality is you cannot figure out what \nBuckley v. Valeo means.\n  There have been a plethora of decisions I have gone through preparing \nfor these discussions, and this is only a small part of it. It is \nbeyond peradventure a constitutional quagmire.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has said the obvious in \nBuckley, that there is the authority to regulate speech where you have \ncorruption or the appearance of corruption. The appearance of \ncorruption is rank in America today.\n  We passed a bankruptcy bill the week before last. I thought it was a \ngood bill, and I voted for it. I voted for it because there are many \npeople who are avoiding their debts who can afford to pay their debts. \nThe bankruptcy law has sufficient flexibility so the bankruptcy judge \ncan schedule payments that somebody can afford.\n  The Senate took a shellacking in the media because of contributions \nand what was characterized as the appearance of corruption, that \nSenators votes were bought.\n  A series of books are cited in the amendment which I offered last \nweek: ``The Best Congress Money Can Buy,'' ``Party Finance and \nPolitical Corruption.'' I ask unanimous consent that this list be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       (A) Backroom Politics: How Your Local Politicians Work, Why \n     Your Government Doesn't, and What You Can Do About It, by \n     Bill and Nancy Boyarsky (1974);\n       (B) The Pressure Boys: The Inside Story of Lobbying in \n     America, by Kenneth Crawford (1974);\n       (C) The American Way of Graft: A Study of Corruption in \n     State and Local Government, How it Happens and What Can Be \n     Done About it, by George Amick (1976);\n       (D) Politics and Money: The New Road to Corruption, by \n     Elizabeth Drew (1983);\n       (E) The Threat From Within: Unethical Politics and \n     Politicians, by Michael Kroenwetter (1986);\n       (F) The Best Congress Money Can Buy, by Philip M.

There is no doubt that the public is concerned about the \nappearance of corruption. It is my hope that there will be a close look \nat this issue by those who are interested in campaign finance reform. \nIf someone is not interested in campaign finance reform, then I can \nunderstand a vote against this constitutional amendment.\n  Let's not clear the underbrush of Buckley v. Valeo if someone does \nnot want to have campaign finance reform, but if someone wants to have \ncampaign finance reform--and there are many people who oppose this \nconstitutional amendment on the ground that it is a change of the first \namendment--they are simply wrong.\n  There is no change in the first amendment. There is a change in a \nmajority of the nine people on the Supreme Court who have interpreted \nthe first amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my distinguished colleague from South \nCarolina, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the proposal of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina to eviscerate the first amendment is as refreshing as it \nis frightful.\n  It is a blunt instrument, this proposed amendment to the \nConstitution. It consists of a simple paragraph repeated twice so that \nthe State governments, as well as Congress, would be empowered to \nrestrict the heretofore sacrosanct, all contributions and spending \n``by, in support of, or in opposition to candidates for public \noffice.'' The whole political ballgame: citizen groups, individuals, \nparties and the candidates.\n\n  Unlike the McCain-Feingold, the Hollings constitutional amendment \ndoes not include a special exemption for the news and entertainment \nmedia.\n  And unlike the McCain-Feingold debate, the casual observer will not \nbe confused by the campaign finance vocabulary. ``Issue advocacy,'' \n``express advocacy,'' ``electioneering,'' ``soft money,'' ``hard \nmoney''--these terms of art in the McCain-Feingold debate are absent \nfrom the Hollings constitutional amendment, which reads simply: ``by, \nin support of, or in opposition to.''\n  Plain English. These eight words in the Hollings constitutional \namendment sum up the reformers' agenda for the past quarter-century as \nthey have sought to root out of American political life any speech or \nactivity which could conceivably affect an election or be of value to a \npolitician.\n  Except the media's speech, of course. McCain-Feingold takes care of \nthem with a special exemption on page 15 of their bill to foreclose \nprosecution of their ``electioneering'' in newspapers, on radio and \ntelevision.\n  The Hollings amendment reaches right in and rips the heart right out \nof the First Amendment.\n  No pretense. No artifice. No question about it. If you believe that \nthe government--federal and state--ought to be omnipotent in their \npower to restrict all contributions and spending ``by, in support of, \nor in opposition to'' candidates for public office . . . then the \nHollings amendment is for you.\n  If you believe that the United States Supreme Court should be taken \nout of the campaign finance equation, then the Hollings constitutional \namendment is for you.\n  If the Hollings amendment had been in place twenty-five years ago, \nthere would have been no Buckley v. Valeo decision. Congress would have \ngotten its way in the 1970s: independent expenditures would be capped \nat $1,000. Any issue advocacy that FEC bureaucrats deem capable of \ninfluencing an election would be capped at $1,000.\n  Citizen groups would have to disclose to the government their donor \nlists. Sierra Club members who live in small towns out west where \nenvironmentalists are not universally revered--and whose need for \nanonymity has been cited by Sierra Club officials as the reason they \nkeep donor names secret--would have their names publicly listed on a \ngovernment database, probably the Internet.\n  All of us politicians' campaigns would be constrained by mandatory \nspending limits. There would be no ``millionaire's loophole'' because \nmillionaires would be under the spending limits, too.\n  There would be no taxpayer financing. It would not be necessary, \nbecause spending limits would not have to be voluntary.\n  That's why the American Civil Liberties Union counsel, Joel Gora, who \nwas part of the legal team in the Buckley case has labeled the Hollings \nconstitutional amendment: a ``recipe for repression.''\n  The media--news and entertainment divisions--ought to take note. \nThere is no exemption for them in the Hollings constitutional \namendment. No media ``loophole.'' Under the Hollings constitutional \namendment, the federal and stage governments could regulate, restrict, \neven prohibit, the media's own issue advocacy, independent expenditures \nand contributions. Just so long as the restrictions were deemed \n``reasonable.''\n  I commend the Senator from South Carolina for offering this \namendment, insofar as he lays out on the table just what the stakes are \nin the campaign finance debate.\n  To do what the reformers say they want to do--limit ``special \ninterest'' influence--requires limiting the United States Constitution \nwhich gives ``special interest''--that is, all Americans--the freedom \nto speak, the freedom to associate with others in a cause, and the \nfreedom to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\n  You have to gut the first amendment. You have to throw out on the \ntrash heap that freedom which the U.S. Supreme Court said six decades \nago, is ``the matrix, the indispensable condition of nearly every other \nform of freedom.''\n  If you believe McCain-Feingold is constitutional, as its advocates \nclaim it is, then you do not need the Hollings constitutional \namendment. In fact, Senator Feingold is against the constitutional \namendment.\n  If you vote for the Hollings constitutional amendment, then you have \naffirmed what so many of us in and outside of the Senate have been \nsaying: that to do what McCain Feingold's proponents want to do--\nrestrict all spending by, in support of and in opposition to \ncandidates, then you need to get rid of the first amendment. That is \nthe core of the problem.\n  If you really want to reduce special interest influence on American \npolitics, you need to get rid of the first amendment.\n  Fortunately, Madam President, this amendment, which Senator Hollings \nhas certainly persevered in offering over the years, continues to lose \nsupport. The first time I was involved in this debate back in 1988, it \nactually passed--bearing in mind it requires 67, a majority, for this \namendment--52-42. That rough majority persisted in a second vote in \n1988 and then a sense of the Senate vote in 1993.\n  Then in 1995 the support for it dropped from 52 down to 45 and in \n1997 from 45 down to 38, and last year, March 28, 2000, this proposal \nwas defeated 67-33. Only 33 Senators a year ago believed it was \nappropriate to amend the Constitution for the first time in history to \ngive the Government this kind of power.\n  One of the reasons this constitutional amendment is growing in \nunpopularity is that it has a lot of opponents. Common Cause is opposed \nto it. I ask unanimous consent two letters from Common Cause on the \nsubject be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Common Cause,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: The Senate is expected to vote later this \n     week on a proposed constitutional amendment to provide \n     Congress with the ability to impose mandatory limits on \n     campaign spending, thus overriding a portion of the Supreme \n     Court's 1976 decision in Buckley v. Valeo.\n       Common Cause opposes the constitutional amendment because \n     it will serve as a diversionary tactic that could prevent \n     Congress from passing campaign finance reform this year. We \n     believe that a constitutional amendment is not necessary in \n     order to achieve meaningful and comprehensive reform.\n       Under existing Supreme Court doctrine, Congress has \n     significant scope to enact tough and effective campaign \n     finance reform consistent with the Court's interpretation of \n     the First Amendment in Buckley.\n       The McCain-Feingold bill, S.25, provides for significant \n     reform within the framework\n\n[[Page S2868]]\n\n     of the Buckley decision. The legislation would:\n       Ban soft money;\n       Provide reduced postage rates and free or reduced cost \n     television time as incentives for congressional candidates to \n     agree to restrain their spending;\n       Close loopholes related to independent expenditures and \n     campaign ads that masquerade as ``issue advocacy'';\n       Reduce the influence of special-interest political action \n     committee (PAC) money;\n       Strengthen disclosure and enforcement.\n       A recent letter to Senators McCain and Feingold from \n     constitutional scholar Burt Neuborne, the Legal Director of \n     the Brennan Center for Justice and a past National Legal \n     Director of the ACLU, sets forth the case that the McCain-\n     Feingold bill is constitutional, Professor Neuborne finds \n     that the key provisions of the bill are within the Court's \n     existing interpretation of the First Amendment, and he thus \n     demonstrates that a constitutional amendment is not necessary \n     to enact reform.\n       Professor Neuborne concludes that the voluntary spending \n     limits in the McCain-Feingold bill are consistent with the \n     Supreme Court's ruling in Buckley. He further concludes that \n     ``Congress possesses clear power to close the soft money \n     loophole by restricting the source and size of contributions \n     to political parties. . . .'' He also concludes that efforts \n     to close loopholes relating to independent expenditures and \n     so-called ``issue ads'' are also within Congress existing \n     authority.\n       It is, therefore, not necessary to amend the Constitution \n     in order to enact meaningful campaign finance reform. \n     Congress has the power, consistent with the First Amendment, \n     to enact comprehensive reform by statute.\n       A constitutional amendment for campaign finance reform \n     should not be used as a way to delay reform legislation. \n     Typically, amending the Constitution takes years. After both \n     Houses of Congress adopt an amendment by a two-thirds vote, \n     it has to be approved by three-quarters of the state \n     legislatures. Even then, the Congress would still have to \n     take up enacting legislation. This is a lengthy and arduous \n     process.\n       Congress needs to act now to address the growing scandal in \n     the campaign finance system. Congress can act now--and \n     consitutionally--to adopt major reforms. Congress need not \n     and should not start a reform process that will take years to \n     complete by pursing campaign finance reform through a \n     constitutional amendment. Instead, the Senate should focus \n     its efforts on enacting S.25, comprehensive bipartisan \n     legislation that represents real reform. It is balanced, \n     fair, and should be enacted this year to ensure meaningful \n     reform of the way congressional elections are financed.\n           Sincerely.\n                                                      Ann McBride,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Common Cause,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 1988.\n       Dear Senator: The Senate is expected to consider shortly \n     S.J. Res. 21, a proposed amendment to the Constitution to \n     give Congress the power to enact mandatory limits on \n     expenditures in campaigns. Common Cause urges you not to \n     support S.J. Res. 21.\n       The fundamental problems caused by the massive growth in \n     spending for congressional elections and by special interest \n     PAC giving demand effective and expeditious solution. The \n     Senate recently came within a handful of votes of achieving \n     this goal. For the first time since the Watergate period, a \n     majority of Senators went on record in support of \n     comprehensive campaign finance reform legislation, including \n     a system of spending limits for Senate races. It took an \n     obstructionist filibuster by a minority of Senators to block \n     the bill from going forward.\n       The Senate now stands within striking distance of enacting \n     comprehensive legislation to deal with the urgent problems \n     that confront the congressional campaign finance system. The \n     Senate should not walk from or delay effort. But that is what \n     will happen if the Senate chooses to pursue a constitutional \n     amendment, an inherently lengthy and time-consuming process.\n       S.J. Res. 21, the proposed constitutional amendment, would \n     not establish expenditure limits in campaigns; it would only \n     empower the Congress to do so. Thus even if two-thirds of the \n     Senate and the House should pass S.J. Res. 21 and three-\n     quarters of the states were to ratify the amendment, it would \n     then still be necessary for the Senate and the House to pass \n     legislation to establish spending limits in congressional \n     campaigns.\n       Yet it is this very issue of whether there should be \n     spending limits in congressional campaigns that has been at \n     the heart of the recent legislative battle in the Senate. \n     Opponents of S. 2, the Senatorial Election Campaign Act, made \n     very clear that their principal objection was the \n     establishment of any spending limits in campaigns.\n       So even assuming a constitutional amendment were to be \n     ratified, after years of delay the Senate would find itself \n     right back where it is today--in a battle over whether there \n     should be spending limits in congressional campaigns. In the \n     interim, it is almost certain that nothing would have been \n     done to deal with the scandalous congressional campaign \n     finance system.\n       There are other serious questions that need to be \n     considered and addressed by anyone who is presently \n     considering supporting S.J. Res. 21.\n       For example, what are the implications if S.J. Res. 21 \n     takes away from the federal courts any ability to determine \n     that particular expenditure limits enacted by Congress \n     discriminate against our otherwise violate the constitutional \n     rights of challengers?\n       What are the implications, if any, of narrowing by \n     constitutional amendment the First Amendment rights of \n     individuals as interpreted by the Supreme Court?\n       We believe that campaign finance reform legislation must \n     continue to be a top priority for the Senate as it has been \n     in the 100th Congress. If legislation is not passed this \n     year, it should be scheduled for early action in the Senate \n     and the House in 1989.\n       In conclusion, Common Cause strongly urges the Senate to \n     face up to its institutional responsibilities to reform the \n     disgraceful congressional campaign finance system. The Senate \n     should enact comprehensive legislation to establish a system \n     of campaign spending limits and aggregate PAC limits, instead \n     of pursuing a constitutional amendment that will delay \n     solving this fundamental problem for years and then still \n     leave Congress faced with the need to pass legislation to \n     limit campaign spending.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Fred Wertheimer,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Washington Post is against it, and I ask unanimous \nconsent their editorial opposing it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 6, 1988]\n\n                            Campaign Spinach\n\n       Sen. Ernest Hollings was not an admirer of S. 2, the sturdy \n     bill his fellow Democrats tried to pass to limit \n     congressional campaign spending by setting up a system of \n     partial public finance. He agreed to vote for cloture, to \n     break a Republican filibuster, only after Majority Leader \n     Robert Byrd agreed to bring up a Hollings constitutional \n     amendment if cloture failed. Mr. Byrd, having lost on S. 2, \n     is now about to do that.\n       Right now Congress can't just limit spending and be done \n     with it; the Supreme Court says such legislation would \n     violate the First Amendment. Limits can only be imposed \n     indirectly--for example, as a condition for receipt of public \n     campaign funds. The Hollings amendment would cut through this \n     thick spinach by authorizing Congress to impose limits \n     straightaway. The limits are enticing, but the constitutional \n     amendment is a bad idea. It would be an exception to the free \n     speech clause, and once that clause is breached for one \n     purpose, who is to say how many others may follow? As the \n     American Civil Liberties Union observed in opposing the \n     measure, about the last thing the country needs is ``a second \n     First Amendment.''\n       The free speech issue arises in almost any effort to \n     regulate campaigns, the fundamental area of free expression \n     on which all others depend. There has long been the feeling \n     in and out of Congress--which we emphatically share--that \n     congressional campaign spending is out of hand. Congress \n     tried in one of the Watergate reforms to limit both the \n     giving and the spending of campaign funds. The Supreme Court \n     in its Buckley v. Valeo decision in 1976 drew a rather \n     strained distinction between these two sides of the campaign \n     ledger. In a decision that let it keep a foot in both camps--\n     civil liberties and reform--it said Congress could limit \n     giving but not spending (except in the context of a system of \n     public finance). In the first case the court found that ``the \n     governmental interest in preventing corruption and the \n     appearance of corruption'' outweighed the free speech \n     considerations, while in the second case it did not.\n       Mr. Hollings would simplify the matter, but at considerable \n     cost. His amendment said, in a recent formulation: ``The \n     Congress may enact laws regulating the amounts of \n     contributions and expenditures intended to affect elections \n     to federal offices.'' But that's much too vague, and so are \n     rival amendments that have been proposed. Ask yourself what \n     expenditures of a certain kind in an election year are not \n     ``intended to affect'' the outcome? At a certain point in the \n     process, just about any public utterance is.\n       Nor would the Hollings amendment be a political solution to \n     the problem. Congress would still have to vote the limits, \n     and that is what the Senate balked at this time around.\n       As Buckley v. Valeo demonstrates, this is a messy area of \n     law. The competing values are important; they require a \n     balancing act. The Hollings amendment, in trying instead to \n     brush the problem aside, is less a solution than a dangerous \n     show. The Senate should vote it down.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No surprisingly, George Will is opposed to it, and I \nask unanimous consent two editorials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 13, 1997]\n\n                             Government Gag\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       ``To promote the fair and effective functioning of the \n     democratic process, Congress, with respect to elections for \n     federal office, and States, for all other elections, \n     including initiatives and referenda, may adopt reasonable \n     regulations of funds expended, including\n\n[[Page S2869]]\n\n     contributions, to influence the outcome of elections, \n     provided that such regulations do not impair the right of the \n     public to a full and free discussion of all issues and do not \n     prevent any candidate for elected office from amassing the \n     resources necessary for effective advocacy.\n       ``Such governments may reasonably define which expenditures \n     are deemed to be for the purpose of influencing elections, so \n     long as such definition does not interfere with the right of \n     the people fully to debate issues.\n       ``No regulation adopted under this authority may regulate \n     the content of any expression of opinion or \n     communication.''--Proposed amendment to the Constitution\n       Like the imperturbable Sir Francis Drake, who did not allow \n     the Spanish Armada's arrival off England to interrupt a game \n     of bowling, supposed friends of the First Amendment are \n     showing notable sang-froid in the face of ominous \n     developments. Freedom of speech is today under more serious \n     attack than at any time in at least the last 199 years--since \n     enactment of the Alien and Sedition Acts. Actually, today's \n     threat, launched in the name of political hygiene, is graver \n     than that posed by those acts, for three reasons.\n       First, the 1798 acts, by which Federalists attempted to \n     suppress criticism of the government they then controlled, \n     were bound to perish with fluctuations in the balance of \n     partisan forces. Today's attack on free speech advances under \n     a bland bipartisan banner of cleanliness.\n       Second, the 1798 acts restricted certain categories of \n     political speech and activities, defined, albeit quite \n     broadly, by content and objectives. Today's enemies of the \n     First Amendment aim to abridge the right of free political \n     speech generally. It is not any particular content but the \n     quantity of political speech they find objectionable,\n       Third, the 1798 acts had expiration dates and were allowed \n     to expire. However, if today's speech-restrictors put in \n     place their structure of restriction (see above), its anti-\n     constitutional premise and program probably will be \n     permanent.\n       Its premise is that Americans engage in too much \n     communication of political advocacy, and that government--\n     that is, incumbents in elective offices--should be trusted to \n     decide and enforce the correct amount. This attempt to put \n     the exercise of the most elemental civil right under \n     government regulation is the most frontal assault ever \n     mounted on the most fundamental principle of the nation's \n     Founders.\n       The principle is that limited government must be limited \n     especially severely concerning regulation of the rights most \n     essential to an open society. Thus the First Amendment says \n     ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of \n     speech,'' not ``Congress may abridge the freedom of speech \n     with such laws as Congress considers reasonable.''\n       The text of the proposed amendment comes from Rep. Richard \n     Gephardt, House minority leader, who has the courage of his \n     alarming convictions when he says: ``What we have is two \n     important values in conflict: freedom of speech and our \n     desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy. You \n     can't have both.''\n       However, he also says: ``I know this is a serious step to \n     amend the First Amendment. . . . But . . . this is not an \n     effort to diminish free speech.'' Nonsense. Otherwise \n     Gephardt would not acknowledge that the First Amendment is an \n     impediment.\n       The reformers' problem is the Supreme Court, which has \n     affirmed the obvious: Restrictions on the means of making \n     speech heard, including spending for the dissemination of \n     political advocacy, are restrictions on speech. It would be \n     absurd to say, for example: ``Congress shall make no law \n     abridging the right to place one's views before the public in \n     advertisements or on billboards but Congress can abridge--\n     reasonably, of course--the right to spend for such things.\n       Insincerity oozes from the text of the proposed amendment. \n     When Congress, emancipated from the First Amendment's \n     restrictions, weaves its web of restraints on political \n     communication, it will do so to promote its understanding of \n     what is the ``fair'' and ``effective'' functioning of \n     democracy, and ``effective'' advocacy. Yet all this \n     regulation will be consistent with ``the right of the people \n     fully to debate issues,'' and with ``full and free discussion \n     of all issues''--as the political class chooses to define \n     ``full'' and ``free'' and the ``issues.''\n       In 1588 England was saved not just by Drake but by luck--\n     the ``Protestant wind'' that dispersed the Armada. Perhaps \n     today the strangely silent friends of freedom--why are not \n     editorial pages erupting against the proposed vandalism \n     against the Bill of Rights?--are counting on some similar \n     intervention to forestall today's ``reformers,'' who aim not \n     just to water the wine of freedom but to regulate the \n     consumption of free speech.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 2, 2000]\n\n                      Improving the Bill of Rights\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       Last week Washington was a sight to behold. Two sights, \n     actually, both involving hardy perennials. The city was a \n     riot of cherry blossoms. And senators were again attacking \n     the First Amendment.\n       Thirty-three senators--30 Democrats and three Republicans--\n     voted to amend the First Amendment to vitiate its core \n     function, which is to prevent government regulation of \n     political communication. The media generally ignored this: \n     Evidently assaults on the First Amendment are now too routine \n     to be newsworthy. Besides, most of the media favor what last \n     week's attack was intended to facilitate, the empowerment of \n     government to regulate political advocacy by every individual \n     and group except the media.\n       The attempt to improve Mr. Madison's Bill of Rights came \n     from Fritz Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat, who \n     proposed amending the First Amendment to say Congress or any \n     state ``shall have power to set reasonable limits on the \n     amount of contributions that may be accepted, and the amount \n     of expenditures that may be made by, in support of, or in \n     opposition to, a candidate for nomination for election to, or \n     for election to, federal office.''\n       So, this license for politicians to set limits on \n     communication about politicians requires that the limits be, \n     in the judgment of the politicians, ``reasonable.'' Are you \n     reassured? Hollings, whose candor is as refreshing as his \n     amendment is ominous, says, correctly, that unless the First \n     Amendment is hollowed out as he proposes, the McCain-Feingold \n     speech-regulation bill is unconstitutional.\n       Fuss Feingold, the Wisconsin Democrat who is John McCain's \n     co-perpetrator, voted against Hollings in order to avoid \n     affirming that McCain-Feingold is unconstitutional. McCain \n     voted with Hollings.\n       The standard rationale for regulating the giving and \n     spending that is indispensable for political communication is \n     to avoid ``corruption'' or the appearance thereof. Hollings, \n     who has been a senator for 33 years, offered a novel notion \n     of corruption. He said the Senate under Montana's Mike \n     Mansfield (who was majority leader 1961-76) used to work five \n     days a week. But now, says Hollings, because of the \n     imperatives of fund-raising, ``Mondays and Fridays are gone'' \n     and ``we start on the half day on Tuesdays,'' and there are \n     more and longer recesses. All of which, says Hollings, \n     constitutes corruption.\n       Well. The 94th Congress (1975-76), Mansfield's last as \n     leader, was in session 320 days and passed 1,038 bills. The \n     105th Congress (1997-98) was in session 296 days and passed \n     586 bills. The fact that 22 years after Mansfield's departure \n     there was a 7.5 percent reduction in the length of the \n     session but a 43.5 percent reduction in legislative output is \n     interesting. But it is peculiar to think that passing 586 \n     bills in two years--almost two bills every day in session--is \n     insufficient. Is the decline in output deplorable, let alone \n     a form of corruption, and hence a reason for erecting a \n     speech-rationing regime?\n       The Framers of the First Amendment were not concerned with \n     preventing government from abridging their freedom to speak \n     about crops and cockfighting, or with protecting the \n     expressive activity of topless dancers, which of late has \n     found some shelter under the First Amendment. Rather, the \n     Framers cherished unabridged freedom of political \n     communication. Last week's 33 votes in favor of letting \n     government slip Mr. Madison's leash and regulate political \n     talk were 34 fewer than the required two-thirds, and five \n     fewer than Holling's amendment got in 1997. Still, every time \n     at least one-third of the Senate stands up against Mr. \n     Madison, it is, you might think, newsworthy.\n       Last week's campaign reform follies included a proposal so \n     bizarre it could have come only from a normal person in jest, \n     or from Al Gore in earnest. He proposes to finance all \n     congressional and Senate races from an ``endowment'' funded \n     with $7.1 billion (the .1 is an exquisite Gore flourish) in \n     tax deductible contributions from individuals and \n     corporations.\n       An unintended consequence of Gore's brainstorm would be to \n     produce, in congressional races across the country, \n     spectacles like that in the Reform Party today--federal money \n     up for grabs, and the likes of Pat Buchanan rushing to grab \n     it. But would money flow into the endowment?\n       With the scary serenity of a liberal orbiting reality, Gore \n     says: ``The views of the donor will have absolutely no \n     influence on the views of the recipient.'' Indeed, but the \n     views of particular recipients also would be unknown to \n     particular donors because all money pour into and out of one \n     pool. So what would be the motive to contribute?\n       Still, Gore has dreamt up a new entitlement (for \n     politicians) to be administered by a new bureaucracy--a good \n     day's work for Gore.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The ACLU, of course, is opposed to it. I ask their \nletter in opposition be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: The American Civil Liberties Union strongly \n     opposes S.J. Res. 6, the proposed constitutional amendment \n     that permits Congress and the states to enact laws regulating \n     federal campaign expenditures and contributions.\n       Whatever one's position may be on campaign finance reform \n     and how best to achieve it, a constitutional amendment of the \n     kind here proposed is not the solution. Amending the First \n     Amendment for the first time in our history in the way that \n     S.J. Res. 6 proposes would challenge all pre-existing First \n     Amendment jurisprudence and would give to Congress and the \n     states unprecedented,\n\n[[Page S2870]]\n\n     sweeping and undefined authority to restrict speech protected \n     by the First Amendment since 1791.\n       Because it is vague and over-broad, S.J. Res. 6 would give \n     Congress a virtual ``blank check'' to enact any legislation \n     that may abridge a vast array of free speech and free \n     association rights that we now enjoy. In addition, this \n     measure should be opposed because it provides no guarantee \n     that Congress or the states will have the political will, \n     after the amendment's adoption, to enact legislation that \n     will correct the problems in our current electoral system. \n     This amendment misleads the American people because it tells \n     them that only if they sacrifice their First Amendment \n     rights, will Congress correct the problems in our system. Not \n     only is this too high a price to demand in the name of \n     reform, it is unwise to promise the American people such an \n     unlikely outcome.\n       Rather than assuring that the electoral processes will be \n     improved, a constitutional amendment merely places new state \n     and federal campaign finance law beyond the reach of First \n     Amendment jurisprudence. All Congress and the states would \n     have to demonstrate is that its laws were ``reasonable.'' \n     ``Reasonable'' laws do not necessarily solve the problems of \n     those who are harmed by or locked out of the electoral \n     process on the basis of their third party status, lack of \n     wealth or non-incumbency. The First Amendment properly \n     prevents the government from being arbitrary when making \n     these distinctions, but S.J. Res. 6 would enable the Congress \n     to set limitations on expenditures and contributions \n     notwithstanding current constitutional understandings.\n       Once S.J. Res. 6 is adopted, Congress and local governments \n     could easily further distort the political process in \n     numerous ways. Congress and state governments could pass new \n     laws that operate to the detriment of dark horse and third \n     party candidates. For example, with the intention of creating \n     a ``level playing field'' Congress could establish equal \n     contribution and expenditure limits that would ultimately \n     operate to the benefit of incumbents who generally have \n     higher name recognition, greater access to their party \n     apparatus and more funds than their opponents. Thus, \n     rather than assure fair and free elections, the proposal \n     would enable those in power to perpetuate their own power \n     and incumbency advantage to the disadvantage of those who \n     would challenge the status quo.\n       S.J. Res. 6 would also give Congress and every state \n     legislature the power, heretofore denied by the First \n     Amendment, to regulate the most protected function of the \n     press--editorializing. Print outlets such as newspapers and \n     magazines, broadcasters, Internet publishers and cable \n     operators would be vulnerable to severe regulation of \n     editorial content by the government. A candidate-centered \n     editorial, as well as op-ed articles or commentary printed at \n     the publisher's expense are most certainly expenditures in \n     support of or in opposition to particular political \n     candidates. The amendment, as its words make apparent, would \n     authorize Congress to set reasonable limits on the \n     expenditures by the media during campaigns, when not strictly \n     reporting the news. Such a result would be intolerable in a \n     society that cherishes the free press.\n       Even if the Congress exempted the press from the amendment, \n     what rational basis would it use to distinguish between \n     certain kinds of speech? For example, why would it be \n     justified for Congress to allow a newspaper publisher to run \n     unlimited editorials on behalf of a candidate, but to make it \n     unlawful for a wealthy individual to purchase a unlimited \n     number of billboards for the same candidate? Likewise, why \n     would it be permissible for a major weekly newsmagazine to \n     run an unlimited number of editorials opposing a candidate, \n     but impermissible for the candidate or his supporters to \n     raise or spend enough money to purchase advertisements in the \n     same publication? At what point is a journal or magazine that \n     is published by an advocacy group different from a major \n     daily newspaper, when it comes to the endorsement of \n     candidates for federal office? Should one type of media \n     outlet be given broader free expression privileges than the \n     other? Should national media outlets have to abide for fifty \n     different state and local standards for expenditures? These \n     are questions that Congress has not adequately addressed or \n     answered.\n       Moreover, the proposed amendment appears to reach not only \n     expenditures by candidates or their agents but also the truly \n     independent expenditures by individual citizens and groups--\n     the very speech that the First Amendment was designed to \n     protect.\n       If Congress or the states want to change our campaign \n     finance system, then it need not throw out the First \n     Amendment in order to do so. Congress can adopt meaningful \n     federal campaign finance reform measures without abrogating \n     the First Amendment and without contravening the Supreme \n     Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo. Some of these reform \n     measures include:\n       Public financing for all legally qualified candidates--\n     financing that serves as a floor, not a ceiling for campaign \n     expenditures;\n       Extending the franking privilege to all legally qualified \n     candidates;\n       Providing assistance to candidates for broadcasting \n     advertising;\n       Improving the resources for the FEC so that it can provide \n     timely disclosure of contributions and expenditures;\n       Providing resources for candidate travel.\n       Rather than argue for these proposals, many members of \n     Congress continue to propose unconstitutional measures, such \n     as the McCain/Feingold bill that are limit-driven methods of \n     campaign finance reform that place campaign regulation on a \n     collision course with the First Amendment. Before Senators \n     vote to eliminate certain First Amendment rights, the ACLU \n     urges the Congress to consider other legislative options, and \n     to give these alternatives its considered review through the \n     hearing and mark-up processes.\n       The ACLU urges Senators to oppose S.J. Res. 6. As Joel \n     Gora, Professor of Law of the Brooklyn Law School recently \n     stated, ``This constitutional amendment is a recipe for \n     repression.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Laura W. Murphy.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Cato Institute is opposed. I ask unanimous consent \nits letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           The Cato Institute,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 2000.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Chairman, Committee on Rules and Administration, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McConnell: Your office has invited my brief \n     thoughts on S.J. Res. 6, offered by Senator Hollings for \n     himself and Senators Specter, McCain, and Bryan, which \n     proposes an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States that would grant power to the Congress and the States \n     ``to set reasonable limits on the amount of contributions \n     that may be accepted by, and the amount of expenditures that \n     may be made by, in support of, or in opposition to, a \n     candidate for nomination for election to, or for election \n     to,'' any federal, state, or local office.\n       It is my understanding that on Monday next, Senator \n     Hollings is planning to offer this resolution as an amendment \n     to the flag-burning amendment now before the Senate. For my \n     thoughts on the proposed flag-burning amendment, please see \n     the testimony I have given on the issue, as posted at the \n     website of the American Civil Liberties Union, and the op-ed \n     I wrote for the Washington Post, copies of which are \n     attached.\n       Regarding the proposed campaign finance amendment, I am \n     heartened to learn that those who want to ``reform'' our \n     campaign finance law are admitting that a constitutional \n     amendment is necessary. But that very admission speaks \n     volumes about the present unconstitutionality of most of the \n     proposals now in the air. It is not for nothing that the \n     Founders of this nation provided explicitly for unrestrained \n     freedom of political expression and association--which \n     includes, the Court has said, the right to make political \n     contributions and expenditures. They realized that \n     governments and government officials tend to serve their own \n     interests, for which the natural antidote is unfettered \n     political opposition--in speech and in the electoral process.\n       In the name of countering that tendency this amendment \n     would restrict its antidote. It is a ruse--an unvarnished, \n     transparent effort to restrict our political freedom and, by \n     implication, the further freedoms that freedom ensures. That \n     it is dressed in the gossamer clothing of ``reform'' only \n     compounds the evil--even as it exposes its true character. If \n     the true aim of this amendment is incumbency protection, then \n     let those who propose it come clean. Otherwise, they must be \n     challenged to show why the experience of previous ``reforms'' \n     will not be repeated in this case too. Given the evidence, \n     that will not be an enviable task.\n       Fortunately, candor is still possible in this nation. This \n     is an occasion for it. I urge you to resist this amendment \n     with the forces that candor commands.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                      Roger Pilon.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Other countries tried to do what the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina seeks to do, other countries unfettered by \nthe first amendment. They don't have the problem we have in trying to \nrestrict the speech of their citizens. A quick glance around the world \nmakes clear that more government control of speech in the places where \nit is allowed is not the answer.\n  The first amendment distinguishes us from the rest of the world. The \nfirst amendment allows the citizens--not the government; the citizens, \nnot the government--to control speech. Consequently, much of the rest \nof the world has restricted political speech far more than we have in \nthe United States. Reformers abroad, as those at home, seek to reduce \ncynicism about the government and increase voter participation. With no \nfirst amendment in these other countries to get in the way, the \nreformers have been able to enact sweeping reforms.\n  Let me share with my colleagues some of the other countries' \nexperience. Canada, our neighbor to the north, has passed many of the \ntypes of regulations supported by those supporting McCain-Feingold. \nCanada has\n\n[[Page S2871]]\n\nadopted the following regulations of political speech: A spending limit \nthat all national candidates must abide by to be eligible to receive \ntaxpayer matching funds. Candidates can spend $2 per voter for the \nfirst 15,000 votes they get, and $1 per voter for all the votes up to \n25,000, and 50 cents per voter beyond 25,000 voters.\n  There are spending limits on parties that restrict parties to \nspending a product of a multiple used to account for the cost of living \ntimes the number of registered voters in each electoral district in \nwhich the party has a candidate running for office. It comes out now to \nabout $1 a voter.\n  The Canadian Government requires that radio and television stations \nprovide all parties with a specified amount of free time during the \nmonth prior to the election. The Government also provides subsidies to \ndefray the cost of political publishing and gives tax credits to \nindividuals and corporations which donate to candidates and/or parties.\n  The most recent political science studies of Canada demonstrate, \ndespite all of this regulation of political speech by candidates and \nparties, the number of Canadians who believe the Government doesn't \ncare what people such as I think has grown from roughly 45 percent to \napproximately 67 percent. Confidence in the national legislature has \ndeclined from 49 percent to 21 percent, and the number of Canadians \nsatisfied with their system of government has declined from 51 percent \nto 34 percent.\n  If you think the Canadians have gotten a handle on speech, let me \ntell you about the Japanese. In order to try to squeeze all that \nopinion out of politics, the Japanese Government limits the number of \ndays you can campaign, the number of speeches you can give, the types \nof places you can speak, the number of handbills and bumper stickers \nyou can print, and even the number of megaphones you can buy. They \nallow each candidate to have one megaphone. So I think we can pretty \nsafely say that over in Japan, unfettered buying, anything like the \nfirst amendment, they have squeezed all that money right out of \npolitics.\n\n  What has been the result? The number of Japanese citizens who have \n``no confidence in legislators'' has risen to 70 percent and voter \nturnout has continued to decline.\n  Let's take a look at another country that has passed these kinds of \nsweeping restraints on citizens' speech--France. In France, they have \ngovernment funding of candidates, government funding of parties, free \nradio and television time, reimbursement for printing posters and for \ncampaign-related transportation. They ban contributions to candidates \nby any entity except parties and political action committees. \nIndividual contributions to parties are limited, and there are strict \nexpenditure limits set for each electoral district and frequent \ncandidate auditing.\n  Despite these regulations, the latest political science studies in \nFrance indicate that the French people's confidence in their government \nand political institutions has continued to decline and voter turnout \nhas continued to decline.\n  Let's take a look at Sweden. Sweden has imposed the following \nregulations on political speech. In Sweden, there is no fundraising or \nspending at all for individual candidates. Citizens merely vote for \nparties which assign seats on the proportion of the votes they receive. \nThe government subsidizes print ads by parties. Despite the fact that \nSweden has no fundraising or spending for individual candidates since \nthese requirements have been in force, the number of Swedes disagreeing \nwith the statement that ``parties are only interested in people's \nvotes, not in their opinions'' has declined from 51 percent to 28 \npercent. The number of people expressing confidence in the Swedish \nParliament has declined from 51 percent to 19 percent.\n  So my point is this: There are some countries that are unfettered, \nunburdened, if you will, by the free speech requirements of the first \namendment, and they have gone right at the heart of this problem in a \nway that would warm the heart of the most aggressive reformer. They \nhave squeezed all this money and all this speech right out of the \nsystem. All it has done is driven the cynicism up and the turnout down.\n  Even if all of these restrictions had been a good idea someplace in \nthe world, they clearly are not a good idea here. I hope the trend on \nthe Hollings constitutional amendment will continue. It is a downward \ntrend. Last March only 33 Members of the Senate supported this \nconstitutional amendment, and I hope that will be the high-water mark.\n  I believe Senator Hatch is here. He is controlling the time on this \nissue. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to address, as I \nhave in prior years, the Constitutional Amendment to limit campaign \ncontributions and expenditures that my colleague from South Carolina \nhas once again brought to the Senate floor.\n  Two election cycles have come and gone since this amendment was first \ndebated in this chamber. And, unfortunately, these last two elections \nhave shown that money remains as big--or an even bigger--part of our \ncampaigns as it was when this Amendment was first introduced.\n  I know that most in this body deplore the role of money in the \nelectoral process. And, Mr. President, I believe that the debate in \nthis chamber over the last week has plainly shown that each of us would \nvote in favor of a solution that would, in a fair, even-handed, and \nconstitutional way, reduce the role of money in campaigns.\n  But as I noted in the debate over this same amendment in 1997, there \nis a right way of reforming our system of campaign finance. And, there \nare wrong ways.\n  While I certainly sympathize with the sentiments that have motivated \nmy colleagues to introduce this proposal, I submit that circumscribing \nthe First Amendment of our Constitution is simply the wrong way to \naddress campaign finance reform. I also think the McCain-Feingold bill \nin fringes upon the First Amendment, and that is what the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina is trying to resolve with his amendment, \nwhich would be the only way, it seems to me, of resolving this matter \nin a way that ultimately the people who are supporting the McCain-\nFeingold bill would like to do.\n  The proposal we are debating today would amend the Constitution to \nallow Congress and the States to set any ``reasonable'' limits on (1) \ncampaign contributions made to a candidate and (2) expenditures in \nsupport or opposition to a candidate made by the candidate or on behalf \nof the candidate.\n  Why do I oppose this amendment?\n  For the first time in the history of this Republic this amendment \nwould put an express limitation on one of the bulwark protections that \nhas defined and strengthened this great nation for over two centuries--\nthe First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n  And perversely, we would not be seeking to limit this important \nsafeguard of our liberty in order to eliminate speech that is on the \nmargin of the First Amendment protection.\n  We would not be seeking to eliminate speech that deeply offends the \nmajority of our citizens, such as the so-called speech involved in the \ndesecration of our national symbols.\n  We would not be seeking to eliminate speech that malevolently \ncapitalizes on the unhealthy historical divisions within our society, \nsuch as racially motivated ``hate speech.''\n  We would not be seeking to eliminate speech that insidiously corrupts \nthe morals of our children, such as pornography.\n  No. Ironically, the first category of speech singled out for \nregulation by this proposal is the category of speech that is \nuniversally recognized as being at the core of the First Amendment \nprotection: the right to engage in unfettered debate about political \nissues.\n  What the supporters of today's proposal often fail to emphasize is \nthat the money involved in electoral campaigns does not end up in the \npockets of the candidates. And it is not thrown into some black hole.\n  The money spent by campaigns, or by third parties in an effort to \ninfluence campaigns, is directed toward one simple aim: to express a \nparticular message.\n  Money may be spent by a candidate to take out a newspaper \nadvertisement setting forth his or her positions on the issues.\n\n[[Page S2872]]\n\n  Money may be spent by an interest group on a television advertisement \nto publicize the voting record of an incumbent.\n  Money may be spent by a concerned individual to fund a study on how \ncertain legislation would affect similarly situated people. In each \ncase, the goal is the same: to educate and/or influence the electorate \nwith respect to political issues.\n  Supporters of today's proposal believe that there is too much of this \npolitical debate. As a result, supporters of this proposal would \ncurtail the First Amendment to allow Congress and the state \nlegislatures to place limits on the amount of political debate that \nwill be allowed in connection with an election.\n  If this amendment passes, will a person still be allowed to say, \n``Vote against Senator X''? Yes, they will.\n  Will that person be able to print a handbill that says ``Vote against \nSenator X''? Only if the government decides that such an expenditure is \n``reasonable.''\n  Will that person be able to take out an advertisement in a local \nnewspaper that says, ``Vote against Senator X''? Only if the Government \ndecides that such an expenditure is reasonable.\n  How is Congress to decide whether such expenditures are reasonable? \nThe proposal we are debating today is silent on that subject. I would \nnote, however, that Senator X would be one of the lawmakers responsible \nfor deciding whether, and under what circumstances, such expenditures \nwould be allowed.\n  In effect, today's proposal would allow Congress and the state \nlegislatures to censor speech for just about any reason, as long as \nthey could establish that their censorship was ``reasonable.'' The free \nspeech rights of all Americans would be subject to the vagaries and \npassions of fleeting majorities. If there was anything our Founding \nFathers really were concerned about and alarmed about, that is a pure \nmajoritarian type of rule in the country.\n  The Hollings Amendment would change the very nature of our \nconstitutional democratic form of government. By limiting robust \npolitical debate, the amendment would tilt the scales sharply in favor \nof incumbents, who benefit from limitations on debate because of their \nhigher name recognition and their ability to direct governmental \nbenefits to their home districts. Such advantages would only be \nmagnified by permitting incumbents to decide what type of political \nspeech is ``reasonable'' in connection with the efforts by challengers \nto unseat them.\n  I would like to take a couple of minutes to explain in greater depth \nwhat the dangers of this Constitutional amendment are:\n  Let me start with the importance of the first amendment to free \nelections.\n  The very purpose of the First Amendment's free speech clause is to \nensure that the people's elected officials effectively and genuinely \nrepresent the public. The Founders of our country certainly understood \nthe link between free elections and liberty. Representative \ngovernment--with the consent of the people registered in periodic \nelections--was--to these leaders of our new nation--the primary \nprotection of natural or fundamental rights. As Thomas Jefferson put it \nin the Declaration of Independence, to secure rights ``Governments are \ninstituted among Men'' and must derive ``their just Powers from the \nConsent of the Governed.''\n  The nexus between free elections and free speech was equally \nunderstood. As Jefferson said:\n\n       Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a \n     government without newspapers, or newspapers without \n     government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the \n     latter.\n\n  [Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Edward Carrington (January 16, \n1787), reprinted in 5 The Founder's Constitution 122 (P. Kurland & R. \nLerner ed., 1987)].\n  Without free speech, there can be no government based on consent \nbecause such consent can never be truly informed. Obviously, we would \nhave no democracy at all if the government were allowed to silence \npeople's voices during an election. It is especially important to our \ndemocracy that we protect a person's right to speak freely during an \nelectoral campaign--because it is through elections that the \nfundamental issues of our democracy are most thoroughly debated, and it \nis through our elections that the leaders of our democracy are put in \nplace to carry out the people's will.\n\n  No. 2, the amendment will overturn the Buckley case.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States recognized this fundamental \nprinciple of democracy in the 1976 case of Buckley v. Valeo. In that \ncase, the Court held:\n\n       Discussion of public issues and debate on the \n     qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of \n     the system of government established by our Constitution. The \n     First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such \n     political expression in order to assure the unfettered \n     interchange of ideas. . . [Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. at 14].\n\n  Moreover, the Court in Buckley recognized that free speech is \nmeaningless unless it is effective. During a campaign, not only does a \nperson have the right to speak out on candidates and issues, a person \nalso has the right to speak out in a manner that will be heard. The \nright to speak would have little meaning if the government could place \ncrippling controls on the means by which a person was permitted to \ncommunicate his message. For instance, the right to speak would have \nlittle meaning if a person was required to speak in an empty room with \nno one listening.\n  And in today's society, the right to speak would have little meaning \nif a person were required to forego television, radio, and other forms \nof mass media, and was instead forced to go door to door to impart his \nmessage solely by word of mouth. Accordingly, the Supreme Court in \nBuckley v. Valeo, and in a string of subsequent cases, has consistently \nruled that campaign contributions and expenditures are constitutionally \nprotected forms of speech, and that regulation of campaign \ncontributions and expenditures must be restrained by the prohibitions \nof the First Amendment.\n  The Buckley Court made a distinction between campaign contributions \nand campaign expenditures. The Court found that the free speech \nconcerns inherent in campaign contributions are less than in campaign \nexpenditures because contributions convey only a generalized expression \nof support. But expenditures are another matter. These are given higher \nFirst Amendment protection because they are direct expressions of \nspeech.\n  In the words of the Buckley Court:\n\n       A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can \n     spend necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by \n     restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of \n     their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This \n     is because virtually every means of communicating in today's \n     mass society requires the expenditure of money. [424 U.S. at \n     19-20].\n\n  The Hollings Amendment's allowance of restrictions on expenditures by \nCongress and state legislatures would impose direct and substantial \nrestraints on the quantity of political speech. It would permit \nsignificant limitations on both individuals and groups from spending \nmoney to disseminate their own ideas as to which candidate should be \nsupported and what cause is just. The Supreme Court noted that such \nrestrictions on expenditures, even if ``neutral as to the ideas \nexpressed, limit political expression at the core of our electoral \nprocess and of the First Amendment freedoms.'' [Buckley at 39].\n  Indeed, under the Hollings proposal, even candidates could be \nrestricted from engaging in protected First Amendment expression. \nJustice Brandeis observed, in Whitney v. California, [274 U.S. 357, 375 \n(1927)], that in our republic, ``public discussion is a political \nduty,'' and that duty will be circumscribed where a candidate is \nprevented from spending his or her own money to spread the electoral \nmessage. That a candidate has a First Amendment right to engage in \npublic issues and advocate particular positions was considered by the \nBuckley Court to be of:\n\n       particular importance . . . candidates [must] have the \n     unfettered opportunity to make their views known so that the \n     electorate may intelligently evaluate the candidates' \n     personal qualities and their positions on vital public issues \n     before choosing among them on election day. 424 U.S. at 53.\n\n  Campaign finance reform should not be at the expense of free speech. \nThis amendment--in trying to reduce the costs of political campaigns--\ncould cost us so much more. It could cost us our heritage of political \nliberty.\n\n[[Page S2873]]\n\n  Groups as diverse as the ACLU and the Heritage Foundation have united \nin their opposition to this constitutional amendment. The ACLU calls \nthe amendment a ``recipe for repression'' and the Heritage Foundation \ncharacterizes it as an abridgement of our ``fundamental liberty.''\n  Mr. President, there are some who may believe that the First \nAmendment is inconsistent with campaign finance reform. I strongly \ndisagree.\n  In fact, just the opposite is true. It is impossible to have healthy \ncampaigns in a healthy democracy without freedom of speech as it is \ncurrently protected by our First Amendment. That is why I oppose the \nHollings Amendment.\n  No. 3, the amendment will blur the distinction between express and \nissue advocacy.\n  This proposed constitutional amendment is so broad that it would also \nblur the distinction between express advocacy and issue advocacy.\n  The Supreme Court in Buckley held that any campaign finance \nlimitations apply only to ``communications that in express terms \nadvocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for \nfederal office.'' [Buckley, 424 U.S. at 44]. Communications without \nthese electoral advocacy terms have subsequently been classified by \ncourts as ``issue advocacy'' entitled to full First Amendment strict \nscrutiny protection.\n  This constitutional amendment is drafted in a such a manner that pure \nissue advocacy will be swept up in regulation. In fact, the Amendment \nis so broad that it would allow regulation of political speech, even if \nsuch speech doesn't refer to a particular candidate. If a statement \nimplies that a candidate is for or against an issue, that speech could \nfall under expenditure limits authorized by this provision.\n  This is a compete reversal of the ``bright line'' test established by \nthe Supreme Court that protects issue advocacy from regulation unless \nit uses words that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a \nclearly identified candidate. It is also a complete reversal of the \nview now encompassed in law that government has no real interest in \nrestricting the free flow of speech and ideas.\n  Now, supporters of this constitutional amendment may tell us that \nthey are all for ending the distinction imposed by Buckley between \nexpress advocacy and issue advocacy and that it is in practice \nunworkable. Well, they are in part right. Sometimes it is a hard line \nto draw. But this ``bright line'' test does have the great benefit that \nif error exists, it falls on the side of free speech.\n  Look, nothing in this world is perfect, particularly in the world of \ncampaigns and politics. So if we err, if we make mistakes, doesn't make \nsense to create a system where the mistake results in the over-\nprotection of a fundamental constitutional right?\n  If we believe that the distinction between issue and express advocacy \nis unworkable, then the solution is to protect both under the strictest \nof safeguards. Each, in my view, should have the highest First \nAmendment protection--and I believe that this is the direction that the \nSupreme Court will eventually take.\n  I believe the adoption of this constitutional amendment is wrong.\n  Amending the Constitution should not be done lightly. And amending \nthe First Amendment should only be done for the most compelling, \nexigent reasons. These reasons are not present.\n  If S.J. Res. 4 were ratified, pre-existing first amendment \njurisprudence would be overturned and Congress and the States would \nhave unprecedented, sweeping and undefined authority to restrict speech \ncurrently protected by the first amendment.\n  This constitutional amendment places State and Federal campaign \nfinance law beyond the reach of first amendment jurisprudence. All that \nCongress and the States would have to demonstrate to the Court is that \ntheir laws restricting political speech were ``reasonable.'' No longer \nwould Congress have to demonstrate a ``compelling interest'' in order \nto infringe on our citizens first amendment liberties.\n  If S.J. Res. 4 is adopted, Congress and State legislatures could \neasily distort the political process. Indeed, the ACLU, not an \ninstitution that I always agree with, in reflecting on a nearly \nidentical proposed constitutional amendment in 1997, noted that \nincumbents could pass laws virtually guaranteeing their reelection. I \nquote:\n\n       Congress and state governments could pass new laws that \n     operate to the detriment of dark-horse and third party \n     candidates. For example, with the intention of creating a \n     ``level playing field'' Congress could establish equal \n     contribution and expenditure limits that would ultimately \n     operate to the benefit of incumbents who generally have a \n     higher name recognition than their opponents, and who are \n     often able to do more with less funding. Thus, rather than \n     assure fair and free elections, the proposal would enable \n     those in power to perpetuate their own power and incumbency \n     advantage to the disadvantage of those who would challenge \n     the status quo.\n\n  Moreover, ratification of this constitutional amendment could very \nwell destroy the freedom of the press. Let me quote the ACLU again:\n\n       [The Amendment] would also give Congress and every state \n     legislature the power, heretofore denied by the First \n     Amendment, to regulate the most protected function of the \n     press--editorializing. Print outlets such as newspapers and \n     magazines, broadcasters, Internet publishers and cable \n     operators would be vulnerable to severe regulation of \n     editorial content by the government. A candidate-centered \n     editorial, as well as op-ed articles or commentary printed at \n     the publisher's expense are most certainly expenditures in \n     support of or in opposition to particular political \n     candidates. The amendment, as its words make apparent, would \n     authorize Congress to set reasonable limits on the \n     expenditures by the media during campaigns, when not strictly \n     reporting the news. Such a result would be intolerable in a \n     society that cherishes the free press.\n\n  Let me point out again that the proposed amendment appears to reach \nnot only expenditures by candidates but also independent expenditures \nby individual citizens and groups. These independent expenditures are \nthe very type of speech that the first amendment was designed to \nprotect.\n  Madam President, I am sure the authors of this amendment are very \nsincere and that they mean well by the amendment. I have no doubt about \nthat. I know my colleague from South Carolina, and he is a good man and \na fine Senator. I think he probably believes that no Congress of the \nUnited States would go beyond certain reasonable limits and neither \nwould any State legislature.\n  But what guarantees do we have, should this amendment pass, that a \nbunch of radicals would not be able to take control of the House and \nSenate or respective State legislatures? And if they do, how are we \ngoing to be assured that the Supreme Court will set things right if \nthis amendment passes and becomes part of the Constitution?\n  I would hope that people elected to the Congress would never act \ninappropriately. I would hope that people elected to State legislatures \nwould never act inappropriately or that they would not act so as to \ntake away basic fundamental rights of people. But if this amendment \npasses, there is no guarantee that we will not someday have that type \nof radicalness that will take over in some States first and then \nultimately perhaps even in the Congress.\n  There is a wide disparity of beliefs sometimes between the far left \nand the far right over what are fundamental rights. I have to tell you, \nif either of them really got control, under this amendment it could be \na real mess.\n  Plus, this amendment basically, it seems to me, makes it very \ndifficult for those who are challenging incumbents to be able to make a \nchallenge that really the first amendment anticipates they should be \npermitted to make.\n  I have talked long enough. For reasons I have set forth this \nafternoon, it is my view that adoption and ratification of this \namendment would fundamentally change our constitutional Republic. The \ncensorship power of government would inalterably be enlarged. Free \nspeech and free elections would be endangered. As sincerely brought as \nthis amendment is, I still believe it is a very dangerous amendment in \nthe overall scope of things. Perhaps if we had 100 people exactly like \nthe distinguished Senator from South Carolina, this amendment would \nwork just as well as could be. But I do not think we can always rely on \nthat. I am concerned about that. Plus, I do not think that you should \ntake away rights that really are speech rights when it comes to \nelections.\n  In contrast, of course, I am the author of the constitutional \namendment to permit Congress to ban the physical desecration of our \nflag. A number of\n\n[[Page S2874]]\n\ntimes this Congress has passed legislation, with overwhelming support, \nto stop that, but each time it has been declared unconstitutional.\n  Frankly, I do not believe that urinating on our flag or desecrating \nour flag by somebody defecating on it or by burning it, that that is \nwhat you would call speech, but that is what the Supreme Court has \nsaid. In that case, we do need a constitutional amendment.\n  Unlike the Hollings amendment, the flag amendment would not affect \nthe first amendment.\n  Some have suggested that my opposition to the Hollings amendment is \ninconsistent with my strong support for the flag protection amendment. \nNothing could be further from the truth.\n  Unlike the Hollings amendment, the flag protection amendment simply \nrestores the first amendment to what it meant before two recent 5-to-4 \nSupreme Court decisions. Before the 1989 Texas v. Johnson case and the \n1990 United States v. Eichman decision, the U.S. Supreme Court and \nnumerous state supreme courts had upheld laws punishing flag \ndesecration as compatible with both the letter and the spirit of the \nfirst amendment. Such laws had been on the books for most of this \ncountry's 200-year history.\n  The flag protection amendment respects the difference between pure \npolitical speech and physical acts. It is extremely narrow, allowing \nCongress only the power ``to prohibit the physical desecration of the \nflag of the United States.'' Any law passed pursuant to the amendment \ncould extend no further than a ban on acts of physical desecration, and \nwould not affect anyone's ability to participate in the political \nprocess.\n  Unlike political contributions, the physical ruination of a flag adds \nnothing to political discourse. Whether good or bad, the reality of \nmodern American politics is that money is essential to advocacy. \nBroadcasting a message--whether in print, on television or radio, or \neven over the Internet--costs money. A constitutional amendment \nprohibiting political donations would undeniably restrict people's \nability to convince others of their point of view. But lighting fire to \nthe flag is different. It is not an essential part of any message. In \nfact, often the audience for such demonstrations does not understand \nwhat policy or idea that motivated the burner to burn. The flag \nprotection amendment leaves untouched everyone's right to articulate--\nand advocate publicly for--their point of view.\n  In sum, passage of the flag amendment would overturn two Supreme \nCourt decisions: Johnson and Eichman. It would leave the Constitution \nexactly intact as it was understood prior to 1989. It would do nothing \nelse. In contrast, the Hollings amendment would be a radical alteration \nof Americans' fundamental right to participate in the democratic \nprocess.\n  Let me end with this. The McCain-Feingold bill is defective inasmuch \nas it does provide a means whereby you can limit the free speech rights \nof people with regard to soft money. I do think probably the Supreme \nCourt would uphold the Hagel approach to it, although I question \nwhether even a cap on soft money to the tune of $60,000 per individual \nwould be upheld by the Supreme Court; but it could be.\n  Probably my friend from South Carolina feels the same way, that \nwithout a constitutional amendment change, it is just a matter of time \nuntil McCain-Feingold will be overturned. I believe it will be \noverturned, should it pass in its current form. And one reason it will \nbe overturned is because of the limitation of real speech rights.\n  Frankly, Buckley v. Valeo, I don't think is wrong. With that, I hope \nmy colleagues will vote against this amendment, as well intentioned as \nit is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield whatever time the Senator needs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee. Once again, he has gone right to the heart of \nthe matter. I hope the people were listening to his comments at the \nconclusion of his remarks in which he summed up, very succinctly, the \nissues with which we are wrestling.\n  Yes, we wish money were not such a significant part of being able to \nget out your message in America. I do not have any personal wealth I \ncan put into getting out my message, but it is a way to get out that \nmessage. As Senator Hatch said, this deals with real speech.\n  This proposed constitutional amendment is breathtaking in its reach. \nIt flat out says that Congress and State legislatures--incumbent \npoliticians--can pass laws that would limit their opposition's right to \nraise money and to speak out during an election cycle. That is what we \nare talking about. That is what McCain-Feingold does without proposing \na constitutional amendment.\n  What Senator Hollings has wrestled with over the years is a \nconstitutional amendment that he believes would allow the Congress \nconstitutionally to be able to restrict the right of people to come \ntogether to assemble, to print out press beliefs that they have, or to \nproject them and amplify them over radio and television. They say this \nis not an infringement on the most historic freedom, the cornerstone of \nAmerican freedoms: the right to speak out.\n  I think this, if passed, would be a colossal blunder of historic \nproportions. I think this proposed amendment, if passed, would reflect \nthe greatest constitutionally proposed threat to liberty and freedom \nthat I have known in my lifetime, maybe since the founding of this \ncountry, of speech and the press and assembly.\n  We should not do this. If we say this Congress can stop the current \nconstitutional right of free Americans to come together, raise money, \nand buy and amplify their speech on radio or TV, Internet, and so \nforth, to advocate their views, we will have made a major move away \nfrom freedom in this country.\n  Senator Hatch said in his remarks that without a doubt the censorship \npower of the Government will have been enlarged. I remain stunned, \nreally, that persons whom I admire as champions of liberty, such as the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina, can miss this. Maybe I am \nmissing it. I don't know. I can't see that I am missing it. I don't \nthink I am missing it. Maybe I am. I don't think this is an itty-bitty \nissue. I think it is a historic and defining issue.\n  I am wondering: Where are our liberal friends? Where is the free \nspeech crowd? What about our law school deans and professors, are they \nreading this? The ACLU has picked it up. They call it a recipe for \nrepression. They see it for what it is. I respect them for that. They \ngenerally can be fully counted on in free speech issues. They believe \ndepiction of child pornography is free speech and should be protected. \nI don't know that that is speech.\n  I know the Founding Fathers fundamentally wanted to protect political \nspeech. This amendment sets up a construction that would allow the \nconstraint of political speech during an election of all times.\n  I didn't want to be too involved in all this debate. I try not to get \ninvolved in everything that goes on on the floor. This is an issue in \nwhich I am interested, but I have spoken once already on a particular \nissue. I just want to be on record, I want it recorded on this floor \nfor my constituents and my children, that I was standing here and being \ncounted on this one. I want it on the record that this Senator will not \nsupport a constitutional amendment to restrict the right of people to \nassemble, raise money, and speak out during an election cycle. That is \njust fundamental to what America is about. It is important. I believe \nit is an issue on which I have an obligation to speak.\n  It has been suggested, that this is not an amendment to the first \namendment. Well, I suggest it is an amendment to the first amendment. \nThey say: Well, it is going to be amendment No. 20 something; it is not \ngoing to be written right up there on the first amendment. You are not \ngoing to strike out any words in the first amendment. Well, it is going \nto be in the Constitution. It is going to be given equal play with the \nfirst amendment. And since it passed subsequent to it, it will be \ndefined by the courts that if it is in any way contrary to the first \namendment, then the Hollings amendment will be given precedence because \nit was designed to modify the problems that have arisen\n\n[[Page S2875]]\n\nwhich courts have concluded that certain campaign finance laws people \nare so determined to pass infringe on the first amendment.\n  That is what Buckley says. Buckley was based on the first amendment. \nThat is why the Court ruled the way they did. They didn't conjure it \nout of thin air.\n  It is not just the Buckley case that would be reversed. There are a \nplethora of cases, Buckley progeny, that have upheld Buckley and gone \nfurther than Buckley. All of them would be undermined or overruled by \nthis law if it were to become a part of our Constitution.\n  They say that rich people have more rights because they can afford to \nbuy time and they have special interests. Let's be frank about it; \neverybody has a special interest. That is what we all are. As human \nbeings, we have interests; we have beliefs. We want to see those made \nlaw. Whether it is dealing with low taxes, or abortion, or gun \nownership, or redistribution of wealth, or the military, or drug laws, \nor health care, or education, we all have beliefs for which we want to \nfight. Everything is a special interest of a sort.\n\n  I note in passing that some elite groups, some wealthy entities, \napparently will not be covered--at least it is said they will not be, \nalthough the ACLU thinks they might. I suggest that some of those \ngroups, such as NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox, New York Times, Washington Post, \nthe Los Angeles Times, all the Gannett chain, all the big newspaper \nchains, they can go on and run full-page ads day after day, full-page \neditorials slamming the Senator from Alabama and saying he is a \nterrible person. Apparently, if your money wasn't consistent with the \nway the Congress says, a group of people couldn't go into that \nnewspaper and buy a full-page ad to respond to their full-page \neditorial.\n  Throughout the history of this country, newspapers have gone off on \ntangents for one thing or another they steadily believed in, biased \ntheir news articles, editorialized every day on things in which they \nbelieved. It has been protected by the first amendment. These wealthy \ngroups of elite intellectuals and power interests have a right to \npropagate, I suppose, right up to election day. Surely, under this \nproposed amendment, they wouldn't say they couldn't do that, their \nnewspaper couldn't run an editorial on the day of the election to say \nwho to vote for, but they apparently are saying that another \ncorporation, no less noble or no less venal than the New York Times, \ncan't publish an editorial or buy an ad in the newspaper to rebut that \narticle.\n  This freedom to speak out is particularly valuable in times of \npersecution or oppression and discrimination against an unpopular \nminority. Is not the ability of a minority group that might be \nsubjected to oppression sometime in the future--isn't their ability to \ndefend themselves, to get their message out, undermined if they can't \nassemble and raise money and speak out against a candidate they believe \nthreatens their very existence?\n  I have mentioned that when I ran for office, my opponent was a \nskilled trial lawyer. One of my lawyer friends said: Jeff, I think you \nthreaten our business. You don't believe in lawsuits like we do.\n  I said: Well, I guess I don't.\n  They spent over $1 million raising money to beat up on me. What is \nwrong with that? They thought I threatened the way they wanted to do \nbusiness as lawyers. They thought changes on tort reform that I might \nfavor threatened their business, and they wanted to defend themselves. \nApparently, under this rule, they could be constricted substantially in \ntheir ability to complain during an election cycle about a politician \nwho threatens them. That is just a group. That didn't deal with actual \nrepression, but it could be a matter in the future of actual \nrepression.\n  We ought not to pass a constitutional amendment that would limit the \nrights of persons in the future to defend themselves against actual \noppression. It constrains not only the ability to raise money but the \nexpenditures of money. It says the legislature and the Congress can \npass reasonable laws that would control expenditures ``in support of or \nin opposition to a candidate.'' That is a serious matter, saying \nindependent, free Americans cannot come together and assemble and speak \nout during an election in opposition to or in favor of a candidate. \nThat is really a change. It does affect the first amendment because the \nfirst amendment has constrained Congress from doing that, and that is \nwhy this amendment has been placed here, to allow Congress to do that \nvery thing.\n  I know the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, the Judiciary Committee \nchairman, mentioned the flag burning amendment. We have Members of this \nbody who believe the physical act of burning a flag or desecrating a \nflag is speech. They object to any amendment that would protect the \nflag. I will just say that I think Chief Justice Rehnquist is right \nthat if it is speech to burn or desecrate a flag, it is at best a grunt \nor a roar.\n  But the amendment before us today and, in fact, in large part the \nMcCain-Feingold bill is a bill that goes to the heart of political \nspeech. And when do they want to control it? During the election cycle. \nThat is when they want to control it. Oh, it is all right to have \nviolent, pornographic videos and images. They say that is speech and it \nmust be defended to the death. But you can't have a group of people get \ntogether in this country and propose that the Senator from Alabama is \ndead wrong and ought to be thrown out of office. If Richard Nixon \nproposed a law and Congress passed the law, when we were having \nprotests during the Vietnam war, when I was in college and law school \nand all these professors, the great constitutional scholars that they \nwere--I wonder what they would have said if Nixon had proposed an \namendment that would keep people from raising money and speaking out. I \nthink they would have been upset. I wonder where they are today.\n  I was shocked that, in 1997, 38 Senators in this body voted for this \namendment. Last year, I was pleased to note that the number had dropped \nto 33. I hope that number will continue to fall.\n  Madam President, freedom is scary. It allows things to get a bit out \nof control, when people are free to just go and say what they want to. \nAnd you can't quite manage it as we in Congress like to manage things, \nbecause we want to have it just right so there will be no spoilage, and \nwe don't want any corruption here or any unfair threat to us. We just \nwant to control this thing. But we are a nation of freedom, of liberty, \nof independence, free to speak out and say what we want, especially in \nan election cycle.\n  But over the long haul of our Nation, this free debate, this \nchallenging of everybody's positions and issues, and debate has been \nhealthy for us. It strengthens us as a nation. We must not turn back \nthe clock by adopting an amendment, or some of the language in McCain-\nFeingold, that I believe likewise constrains freedom unjustifiably.\n  So the censorship power of our Government would be greatly enlarged \nif this amendment were to pass. It would allow the constriction of \ndebate on the core issues of America, political, philosophical issues \nof intellectual power and breadth that affect the future of our \ncountry. That debate would be restricted significantly.\n  I think it would be wrong to pass the Hollings constitutional \namendment. As written, McCain-Feingold, without this amendment, has a \nslim chance of being sustained. I think it will have to be either \ndefeated or amended.\n  I thank the Chair for the time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). There are 55 minutes under \nthe control of the Senator from Utah, 24 seconds for the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  Mr. HATCH. Senator Biden would like to speak in favor of the \namendment. As a courtesy, I am certainly going to yield some time to \nthe Senator. Senator Reed, who also wants to speak in favor, I will \nyield him 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that following that, Senator \nFeingold be given the floor and I will give him 5 minutes as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n[[Page S2876]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to begin today by praising my \ndistinguished colleague from South Carolina for the leadership and \ndetermination that he has brought to this debate.\n  I would also like to apologize to him. Apologize that he has to come \nto this floor yet again to cut through all the rhetoric, and high-\nminded talk, to get to the single most important fact in this debate. \nAnd that is, nothing will change in our campaign finance system until \nwe have the Constitutional ability to limit spending in congressional \ncampaigns.\n  And the only way that we can do that other than through voluntary \nlimits is by standing with Senator Hollings to pass this Constitutional \namendment.\n  We've been down this road many times, Mr. President. As the Senator \nfrom South Carolina will tell you, he and I have stood on this floor \nurging the Senate to take this first fundamental step by passing his \namendment. We have recited fact after fact to illustrate how the \nspending in last election cycle was far worse than the previous cycle. \nAnd each time that we stand here, the story get's worse and worse.\n  The truth is, unless we adopt Senator Hollings' amendment and pass \nthe McCain-Feingold bill, we will back here in 2 years--reciting a new \nround of statistics to illustrate how bad the system got in 2002.\n  Mr. President, our system is spiraling out of control. And it will \ncontinue this spiral, unabated, until we pass needed reforms. But \nnothing can fundamentally change the way in which our process works \nuntil we have the ability under the law to limit the amount of money \nthat is spent on campaigns.\n  Twenty-five years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that spending money \nwas the same thing as speech. The Court said that writing a check for a \ncandidate was speech, but writing a check to a candidate is not speech.\n  The Supreme Court made a supremely bad and, I believe, supremely \nwrong decision. By saying that Congress shall make no law abridging the \nfreedom to write a check, the Court is saying that Congress cannot take \nthe responsible step of limiting how much money politicians can spend \nin trying to get elected. We have to start putting limits on spending, \nMr. President, because money is beginning to overtake the system.\n  In the twenty-five years since the Supreme Court's ruling, the \ngeneral cost of living has tripled, but the total spending on \nCongressional campaigns has gone up eightfold. Think about it: eight \ntimes!\n  For the winning candidates, the average House race went from $87,000 \nto $816,000 in 2000. And here on the Senate side, winners spent an \naverage of $609,000 in 1976, but last year that average shot up to $7 \nmillion.\n  And the Federal Election Commission estimates that last year more \nthan $1.8 billion dollars in federally regulated money was spent on \nfederal campaigns alone, and that doesn't even count the huge amount of \nsoft money that was used in an attempt to influence federal elections.\n  Yes, these numbers are staggering. But even more so, is the thought \nthat they will continue rise unless something is done. And I belive \nthat the single most important thing that we can do from a purely \npractical sense is to amend the Constitution and give us the right to \nlimit the amount of money that candidates are able to spend.\n  I don't approach this lightly, Mr. President. Amending our \nConstitution is not a trivial matter. We have seldom done it in our \nhistory, and we have only done so when it was truly needed. \nReluctantly, I have reached the conclusion that it is needed, now. For \nif we do not take this opportunity to seize control of our system, we \nwill be right back here merely debating the problem, instead of solving \nit. And when we return 2, 4, maybe 6 years from now, the problem will \nbe even worse than it is today, and as a result, much harder to solve.\n  Mr. President, the sooner we take action, the sooner we will be able \nto restore the public's faith in our democracy. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to stand with the distinguished Senator from South Carolina \nand adopt this Constitutional amendment as a first, and fundamental, \nstep toward reclaiming our political system for the American people.\n  Mr. President, let's get something straight here. The first amendment \nis not absolute. No amendment is absolute. When there is a Government \ninterest, in this case of curbing corruption, there is a Government \nrationale to be able to deal with what the Court refers to as speech. I \nthink Justice Stevens got it right in a case decided 24 years after \nBuckley v. Valeo, I say to my friend from Alabama. He said money is not \nspeech, money is property. Money is property. We are talking about \nspeech.\n  All the folks sitting up here in the gallery are in fact interested \nin free speech. But it does not go unnoticed that their ability to \nspeak freely and be listened to depends upon how much money they have. \nYou can be as free-speaking as you want. You can stand in a corner or \nin a park with a megaphone and go on and on about what you think should \nbe done. You can seek free press. But you are unable to go into the \nPhiladelphia media market and pay $30,000 for a 30-second ad to say my \ngood friend from Alabama is a chicken thief or is a war hero. You are \nnot able to do that. That takes money. Money talks. Money talks. Money \nis property. Money is not speech, money is property.\n  The fact of the matter is, in this context, if you look at my friend \nfrom Alabama, and others, the Court, in the progeny of Buckley, has \nallowed us to regulate campaign contributions under certain \ncircumstances. So this notion that it is absolute is absolutely \ninaccurate. I will not go into further detail because of the time \nconstraints here.\n  Let me say again that I thank my friend from South Carolina because, \nwhen all is said and done, this is the only deal in town. It is \nfascinating. If you look at what happened here, we can pass the McCain-\nFeingold bill--and I am for it--but I promise you, we are going to be \nback here in a year or two, or three, on a simple proposition. The \nsimple proposition is that the cost of campaigning has gone up \neightfold in the same time that we have been in a system where the cost \nof inflation has gone up significantly less than that. Since 25 years \nago, at the time of the Supreme Court ruling, the general cost of \nliving has tripled, the cost of running a campaign has gone up \neightfold. Now, for a winning candidate, the average of a House race 25 \nyears ago was $87,000. This time around, it is $816,000, average.\n  Let me tell you, if you have a lot of money, you can speak a lot \nlouder, your voice is heard more. If you don't have a lot of money, you \nare not heard. I didn't think that is what the founders had in mind \nwhen they talked about speech. They didn't sit down and say, by the \nway, landowners with a lot of money should be able to be heard more \nthan the guy who is the shoemaker in the village, or the village \ncobbler. They didn't say that. Money is property. Money is property. It \nis not speech.\n  On the Senate side, let's take a look at what happened. When I ran in \n1972--and I won't even go back that far--I spent $286,000 in the \nelection. The Senate race in Delaware combined cost over $13 million--\nnot my race; I am not up until this time.\n  Let's get something else straight. One of the reasons our friends \naren't so crazy about this amendment is all of us who hold public \noffice now are in pretty good shape without this amendment.\n  It is not merely what the other guy can do to you. You sit there and \nsay: That interest does not like me, so they will spend a lot of money. \nIf you are popular enough in your home State, guess what. They are \nworried what you will do to them.\n  I am not going to have any trouble raising money as long as I stay \nrelatively popular. Right now I am relatively popular. Guess what. I \nwould hate to be getting starting now to try to run in Delaware. I do \nnot know how they do it. How do they do it? How do they raise a minimum \nof 2 million bucks or probably, if it is a race, $5 million, in a \nlittle State with only 400,000 registered voters? Heck, we could go out \nand pay everybody. We could go out and give them all a bonus, increase \ntheir standard of living if we took that $13 million and spread it \namong 400,000 voters.\n  This is getting obscene. What is going to control? What is the deal \nhere? I know this amendment is not going to pass this time, but I want \nto\n\n[[Page S2877]]\n\nbe on the side of right on this one, like I have from the very \nbeginning when my friend from South Carolina proposed this. If, in \nfact, the average cost of a Senate election--catch this--in 1976, the \naverage cost of a State election was $609,000. Do you know what it was \nthis last cycle? Seven million dollars. Did you hear what I said? Seven \nmillion dollars. Give me a break--free speech, whoa.\n  You better have won the genetic pool, as the distinguished financier \nfrom the great State of Nebraska says. You better have won the genetic \npool and inherited a whole lot of money, or you better have an awful \nlot of very rich friends, people with a lot of money, otherwise how do \nyou get in the game? How could I possibly--maybe this is a good reason \nnot to have the amendment--but how could I as a 29-year-old guy, coming \nfrom a family with no money--I am the first U.S. Senator I ever knew in \neffect--how could I have gotten elected? How could I do it now? I have \nbeen here now for 28 years. Obviously, the people of Delaware do not \nthink I have done a real bad job. How could I have gotten here if, in \nfact, I had to go out and raise $2 million, $3 million, $4 million, $5 \nmillion, or $9 million? I will tell you what happens.\n  You engage in an incredible exercise of rationalization. You go out \nthere and say: I am going to stick to my principles. I will give a \nspecific example.\n  When I ran the first time, at the very end--and my friend from South \nCarolina knows because he headed up the campaign committee and he is \nmore responsible for my being here than anyone in the Senate because he \nhelped me. We narrowed the race down to a percentage point with 10, 11 \ndays to go. My brother Jim, 24 years old, was raising my money and \nsaid: Joe--we had no TV ads--the radio station called and the ads come \noff the air on Friday--this is 10 days before the election and my ads \nwere working. You need $20,000. We have no money.\n  He set up a meeting with a bunch of good people, decent, honorable \nmen my age, maybe a little older, very wealthy people in my State who \nwere, like me, opposed to the war in Vietnam, pro-environmental \nmovement, and thought women's rights should be expanded. They were \nbasically Republicans, but they were moderate Republicans.\n  I drove out to a place called Greenville, DE. I walked in to this \ninvestment banking operation in a beautiful area, one of the wealthiest \nareas in America. My friend knows it well. I sat down with six or eight \nfine men. They offered me a drink. I sat there and had a Coke. We \ntalked about my position on promoting the rights of women, the equal \nrights amendment because they were for it. I talked about the \nenvironmental questions. I talked about the war in Vietnam, et cetera. \nThen one guy said: Joe, what is your position on capital gains? No one \nhere will remember except my friend from South Carolina, but at that \ntime it was a big issue in the 1972 campaign. Nixon either wanted to \neliminate it or drastically reduce it, I cannot remember.\n\n  Guess what. I knew all I had to say was: You know, gentlemen, I \nreally think we should have a cut in capital gains. But because I was \nyoung enough and stupid enough not to think, I immediately said: No, I \noppose a cut in the capital gains tax.\n  No one said anything except: Joe, lots of luck in your senior year. \nGood talking to you. So long.\n  I will never forget riding down the pike with my brother Jim. My \nbrother turned to me and said: I hope you really feel strongly about \ncapital gains because you just blew an election.\n  I truly believed--and only someone who has run for office can really \nunderstand this--I truly believed everything I had worked for I had \njust blown by telling the truth. I almost wanted to turn the car around \nand go back.\n  I think of myself as a principled man, but I started to rationalize. \nI started to say: Isn't it better for me to get elected with 95 percent \nof my values intact, a guy who will fight to stop the war, promote the \nrights of women, fight for civil rights, a guy who will blah, blah, \nblah? Capital gains is not that big a deal.\n  That is how insidious this process is. No one buys us. No one goes \nout and pays and says: If you do this, I will pay you. But it is \ninsidious. It is insidious, and the only people who have a lot of money \nto be involved in campaigns, whether they are people I support such as \nlabor unions or big business are people who have an interest.\n  I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 more minutes. My friend is \nnot here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I conclude by pointing out the following: \nLast year, we spent $1.8 billion--$1.8 billion--on the elections. You \ntell me, take soft money, hard money, no money, up money, down money, \nany money--if you take it out, you take a piece of it out and you do \nnot limit the amount we can spend, I promise you--I will bet my \ncareer--2 years from now, we are going to be standing here, and I am \ngoing to say: We just spent $1.9 billion, and the average cost of an \nelection has gone to $7.1 million.\n  Average people have no shot of getting in the deal. They have no shot \nof getting in the deal.\n  Money is property. Money is not speech. I cannot believe the Founders \nsat there and said: You know, if I win the genetic pool, I am entitled \nto have a greater influence in my country and in the electoral process \nthan if I am not in that genetic pool; I was born into land wealth or \nmercantile wealth. I cannot believe they believed that. I cannot \nbelieve that was the case.\n  I conclude by saying we have the ability under a controlling \ngovernment interest to deal with corruption in our electoral process. I \ndefy anyone to look me straight in the eye and say they believe all \nthis additional money in the electoral process is not polluting and \ncorrupting the process. It puts honorable young women and men in the \nRepublican and Democratic Parties who are getting into the process in \nthe position of shaving their views very nicely before they get there. \nNo one is going to pay them off, but they are not stupid. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nUtah for graciously yielding me this time.\n  I rise in strong support of the Hollings amendment. Senator Hollings \nrecognizes that in the early seventies, in the wake of Watergate, this \nCongress passed what they thought was a comprehensive system of \ncampaign finance reform. The two principal pillars of that reform were \na limit on contributions by individuals to candidates and a limit on \nexpenditures in the campaign by candidates. Just before the system even \nstarted, the Supreme Court struck down a major pillar in that \nstructure, and this system has collapsed and has been falling apart \nsince then.\n  The evidence is clear. Every election we see a huge explosion in \nspending because there are no limits on campaign expenditures. For \ncandidates, it is almost akin to the nuclear arms race: You can never \nhave enough money. You can never have enough because your opponent \nmight get a little more, and unless we stop this race for dollars, we \nwill not have true campaign finance reform in this country. We will not \nhave a system of campaign finance reform.\n  Every time we pass legislation--and I commend wholeheartedly Senator \nMcCain and Senator Feingold for their effort, and their effort is \nimportant, but we need this amendment to ensure we can create a system \nof campaign finance reform that will truly work.\n  As I said, and my colleague pointed out, there has been a huge \nexplosion in spending. What has this done? Again, as Senator Biden \npointed out, it certainly has put out of reach for so many Americans \nthe idea of actually running for public office, at not just the Federal \nlevel but all levels.\n  It has done something else, something insidious: Questioning, in the \nminds of the American public, the legitimacy of what we do and for whom \nwe do it. The idea of our Government is that we are servants of the \npeople. Yet in the minds of so many Americans they see us as servants \nof special interests.\n  I was particularly struck by a poll taken by Princeton Survey \nResearch Associates immediately after the election in 1996. Special \ninterest groups in\n\n[[Page S2878]]\n\npolitics were rated a major threat to the future of this country. It \nwas second only to international terrorism. In the minds of so many \nAmericans, special interest politics is just as threatening to the \nfuture of this country as international terrorism.\n  We have to do something. We have to, I believe, support Senator \nHollings in this amendment. He recognized that until we have the \nability to truly create a system of campaign finance, we will always \nhave this escalation of spending, this escalation of continued distrust \nby the American public of their political system.\n  The Court, in Buckley v. Valeo, made the presumption or the \nassumption that speech equals money or money equals speech. Frankly, \nthat is not always the strain of constitutional theory that the Court \nhas presented. For example, in 1966, in Harper v. Virginia Board of \nElections, the Court struck down a poll tax of $1.50 in Virginia, \ndeclaring, ``Voter qualifications have no relation to wealth. . . .''\n  Later, in 1972, in Bullock v. Carter, they struck down candidate \nfiling fees ranging from $150 to $8,900 for local office in Texas \nbecause the theory was that one should not have to pay to be a \ncandidate, one should not have to have his or her test of \nqualification, even to vote or to run, based upon money.\n  The reality today is that to be a candidate, you have to have money. \nWe spend a great deal of time trying to get that money.\n  The Court in Buckley v. Valeo erred dramatically. I do not think--and \nI am shared in this view by my colleague from Delaware--that money \nequals speech. In fact, I am a bit confused on constitutional theory \nwhy a contribution to a candidate can be limited, even though I might \nbe making that my form of speech, yet we cannot limit the overall \nspending of a candidate in an election.\n  The Court in Buckley v. Valeo was wrong. The only way we get out is \nto pass the Hollings amendment and give them a way clear so they will, \nunder the Constitution, recognize that not only should we but we can \ncraft a comprehensive system of campaign finance reform.\n  This view is not particularly radical. In the 25 years since Buckley, \nmore and more people have come to the conclusion that it was wrongly \ndecided and that, in fact, we can and should impose limits on \nexpenditures. Constitutional scholars, public officials at every level, \nState attorneys general, secretaries of state, all have suggested we \ncan and should put a limit on expenditures. The States have acted. They \nhave created legislatively a limit on expenditures. It was challenged \nin court, but for the first time a judge looked seriously at the \nrecord, a district court judge, and conditioned that perhaps there was \na justification for this limit but, being a district court judge bound \nby the opinion in Buckley v. Valeo, struck down the provision.\n\n  Similar provisions are being litigated and have been litigated in \nOhio, and they are being litigated today in the context of an \nAlbuquerque, NM, city ordinance which provides for a limit.\n  We can give our colleagues and the Court the benefit of this \namendment. We can give them the rationale to go ahead and do what I \nthink should be done, to be able to limit expenditures so that every \ncandidate has the right to spend a certain amount, but the spending \nwill not overwhelm the true test of a race, which is the quality of \ntheir ideas and positions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I know we are not debating the \nbankruptcy bill when I am in agreement with the Senator from Utah and \nthe Senator from Alabama. We clearly moved not only to campaign finance \nreform but today to a very worthy discussion about the advisability of \nadopting an amendment to the U.S. Constitution concerning campaign \nfinancing.\n  I oppose Senate Joint Resolution 4, but I do so with some reluctance, \ngiven the tremendous respect I have for the Senator from South \nCarolina. I appreciate the sincerity in which he offers this \nresolution. But more importantly, he has been passionate on the issue \nof campaign finance reform for a very long time--long before I came to \nthis body--and I have always looked up to him on this issue.\n  I understand the frustration and realities he is looking at that lead \nhim to propose a constitutional amendment, and I know both the Senator \nfrom South Carolina and the Senator from Pennsylvania, who also \nsupports this resolution, are strong supporters of campaign finance \nreform. I thank them for that, and I thank them specifically for their \nhelp on this bill, and I appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, who, of course, is concerned about what the U.S. \nSupreme Court will do with the McCain-Feingold bill if they get it but \nwho at least left open the possibility that they may look upon it \nfavorably.\n  There are just two reasons I am uncomfortable voting for this \nconstitutional amendment. The first has to do with my belief that it \ndoes actually amend the Bill of Rights for the first time in our \nNation's history. I understand the arguments that this is such a \nserious problem it is justified. When I first came to the Senate, I \nactually voted for the Hollings amendment the first time. Then in 1994, \na group of Congressmen and Senators were elected in what was known as \nthe Contract With America Congress, and they proposed so many \namendments to the U.S. Constitution, it made your head spin. In fact, a \nlot of them were going to amend the Bill of Rights.\n\n  I disagree with the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nwho says the flag amendment does not amend the first amendment but this \ndoes. Both of them do. Both would be the first changes to our \nfundamental doctrine of the Bill of Rights in our Nation's history. I \nam uncomfortable with this approach. I understand how people get to the \npoint where they don't believe we can ever deal with the problems of \nour campaign financing system and they want to do it. My belief is that \nit is better not to tamper with the Bill of Rights and to solve the \nproblem legislatively.\n  That leads to my second point. I am more optimistic, more sanguine \nabout the possibility that we will prevail; that McCain-Feingold, if it \ngets to the U.S. Supreme Court, will be held constitutional. In fact, I \ncan't really believe anyone on the floor is seriously arguing anymore \nthat the most important provision of the McCain-Feingold bill, the ban \non party soft money, will be held unconstitutional. It is not credible.\n  In the Missouri Shrink PAC case in January of 2000, the Court ruled \n6-3 that even a $1,000 contribution in Missouri today is a sufficient \nfigure to justify the possibility of the appearance of corruption. \nSurely a $100,000, $200,000, $500,000, or $1 million contribution would \nbe regarded the same by that very strong, 6-3 majority in that Court.\n  I believe, although certainly our bill doesn't solve a lot of the \nproblems that have been discussed today, at least regarding the abuse \nof soft money in our society, that the U.S. Supreme Court--this U.S. \nSupreme Court--would see it our way. I believe this bill can solve some \nof the problems that have been identified in the system. For those \nreasons, I will oppose this constitutional amendment. I do not think we \nneed to amend the Constitution in order to have effective campaign \nfinance reform.\n  Our colleague Senator Hollings has been calling for meaningful \ncampaign finance reform but perhaps longer than any other Member of the \nSenate. I disagree with this particular approach. But I want to pay \ntribute to his sincerity and commitment to reform.\n  This resolution was a constitutional amendment is a serious proposal, \nnot casually offered, and not offered in hopes of sabotaging our bill, \nas some amendments have been. But I must oppose it.\n  Back in 1993, Senator Hollings offered a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment to take up a constitutional amendment similar to the one \nbefore us today. After a short debate, I voted with the Senator from \nSouth Carolina on that day. I did so because I believed that other than \nbalancing the Federal budget, there was no more fundamental issue \nfacing our country than the need to reform our campaign finance laws.\n  And I was frustrated at that time with the failure of the Congress to \npass meaningful campaign finance reform.\n  But I immediately realized, even as I was walking back to my office \nafter\n\n[[Page S2879]]\n\nvoting, that I had made a mistake. I started rethinking right away \nwhether I really wanted the Senate to consider amending the first \namendment.\n  Later, I was privileged to join the Senate Judiciary Committee, and \nthen the 104th Congress became a teeming petri dish of proposed \namendments to the Constitution. On the Judiciary Committee, I had a \ngood seat to witness first hand the radical surgery that some wanted to \nperform on the basic governing document of our country, the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  It started with a balanced budget constitutional amendment, and soon \na term limits constitutional amendment, a flag desecration amendment, a \nschool prayer amendment, a super majority tax increase amendment, and a \nvictims rights amendment, and on it went. In all, over 100 \nconstitutional amendments were introduced in the 104th Congress. This \ncasual proliferation of amendments has tapered off somewhat, but \npersists to this day.\n  As I saw Members of Congress suggest that all sorts of social, \neconomic, and political problems, great and small, be solved with a \nsimple constitutional amendment, I chose to oppose this serious and \nearnestly considered constitutional amendment from Senator Hollings, \nalong with others that have casually and sometimes recklessly \nthreatened to undermine our most treasured founding principles.\n\n  The Constitution of this country was not a rough draft. We have \nsometimes lately been treating it as such, and Senator Hollings' worthy \neffort appears in that context, so I believe we should oppose it, lest \nwe encourage less serious efforts.\n  Even if we were to adopt this constitutional amendment, and the \nstates were to ratify it, which we all know is not gong to happen, it \nwill not deliver effective campaign finance reform. It would empower \nthe Congress to set mandatory spending limits on congressional \ncandidates that were struck down in the landmark Buckley v. Valeo \ndecision.\n  And if this constitutional amendment were to pass the Congress and be \nratified by the States, would campaign finance reformers have the \nnecessary 51 votes--or more likely the necessary 60 votes--to pass \nlegislation that includes mandatory spending limits?\n  Probably not--let's remember that it took us years to get to 60 votes \non the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  But this week we have before us a bipartisan campaign finance \nproposal that has been meticulously drafted within the guidelines \nestablished by the Supreme Court. We are confident that the McCain-\nFeingold bill is constitutional and will be upheld by the courts.\n  Our original proposal, unlike the law that was considered in Buckely \nv. Valeo, included voluntary spending limits, but the centerpiece of \nour bill is a ban on soft money, the unlimited contributions from \ncorporations, unions and wealthy individuals to the political parties. \nThere is near unanimity among constitutional scholars that the \nConstitution allows us to ban soft money. The Supreme Court's decision \nin the Shrink Missouri case makes it abundantly clear that the Court \nwill uphold a soft money ban. We don't need to amend the Constitution \nto do what needs to be done.\n  Until this year, the desire of a majority of Senators to bring a \ncampaign finance reform bill to a final vote has been frustrated by a \nfilibuster. So the notion that this constitutional amendment will pave \nthe way for legislation that includes mandatory spending limits simply \nignores the reality of the opposition that campaign finance reformers \nwould face here in the Senate if they tried to enact those limits.\n\n  This proposed constitutional amendment would change the scope of the \nfirst amendment. I find nothing more sacred and treasured in our \nNation's history than the first amendment. It is the bedrock of the \nBill of Rights. It has as its underpinning the notion that every \ncitizen has a fundamental right to disagree with his or her government. \nI want to leave the first amendment undisturbed.\n  Nothing in this constitutional amendment before the Senate today \nwould prevent the sort of abuses we have witnessed in recent elections \nAllegations of illegality and improprieties, accusations of abuse, and \ncharges of selling access to high-ranking Government officials would \ncontinue no matter what the outcome of the vote on this constitutional \namendment. Only the enactment of legislation that bans soft money \ncontributions will make a meaningful difference.\n  The Senate will have another opportunity to address this issue. We \nhave had many debates on campaign finance reform, and if we pass the \nMcCain-Feingold bill, the general issue of campaign finance will \nreappear from time to time. But, today, in March 2001, the way to \naddress the campaign finance problem is to pass constitutional \nlegislation, not a constitutional amendment. We are poised to give the \npeople real reform this year, not seven or more years from now.\n  I urge the Members of the Senate to vote against the resolution for a \nconstitutional amendment of the Senator from South Carolina. It is not \nnecessary to amend the Constitution to accomplish campaign finance \nreform. I greatly admire the sincerity and commitment of the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, but ultimately I do not think his amendment will \nbring us any closer to achieving viable, real reform in the way that \npolitical campaigns are financed in the United States.\n  I conclude by thanking the Senator from South Carolina for his \nleadership and knowledge on this subject.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/26/senate-section/article/S2879-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2879-S2882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                     bipartisan campaign reform act\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, for a week now we have been debating \ncampaign finance reform. It has been a healthy debate, and a debate I \nam glad we are having. Some want dramatic changes by overhauling the \nwhole system. Others want simple reforms around the edges. Some want to \nlimit soft money. Some want to ban it. Some want full disclosure. \nOthers want none. Some want to raise the ceiling on hard money given by \nindividuals. Others want to leave hard money limits alone. Some want to \nprotect paychecks of union members from having their dues used for \npolitical activities. Some do not want to ensure that protection at \nall.\n  But let's all agree on one thing. We all think our present campaign \nfinance system needs reforming. However, the underlying McCain-Feingold \nbill, S. 27, is an attack on the rights of average citizens to \nparticipate in the democratic process. Attacking these rights only \nenhances the power of wealthy individuals, millionaire candidates, and \nlarge news corporations.\n  McCain-Feingold hurts the average citizen's participation in the \nprocess because it targets and imposes restrictions on two key citizen \ngroups: issue advocacy groups and political parties. These two groups \nserve as the only effective way through which average citizens across \nAmerica can pool their $10, $20, $100 donations to express themselves \neffectively. One individual alone in the public arena can accomplish \nlittle with his or her small donation. But the small donations of \nthousands of like-minded individuals can accomplish a lot when they \nwork together.\n  The right to associate is fundamental in our democratic Republic, and \nthe ability of the average citizen across America to effect public \npolicy is very important. It is so important that the U.S. Supreme \nCourt has recognized it as a fundamental right with constitutional \nprotections. If McCain-Feingold succeeds as it is now, the influence of \naverage citizens would be drastically reduced. Associations with like-\nminded individuals is essential to engaging in the debate of public \npolicy, but under McCain-Feingold the average citizen would be buried \nin the tomb of nonparticipation and the rich and powerful would run \npolitics.\n  Under McCain-Feingold, the power of the giant news media corporations \nis not eliminated. Their editorial content and news coverage are \nprotected by the first amendment. And the wealthy multimillionaires \nwill not be prohibited from spending their money to self-finance their \ncampaigns or express their views on public policy issues. The media and \nthe wealthy have all the power and money they need to pay for \ncommunications about issues. Therefore, the campaign finance reform as \nproposed by McCain-Feingold strips power from the average citizen and \nallows the wealthy and powerful to retain their influence.\n\n[[Page S2880]]\n\n  Although well intended by the bill's sponsors, the underlying bill \ndoes not present us with a clear and level playing field for all \nAmericans. There are winners and there are losers. The losers are the \ncitizens of average means, citizens' groups, advocacy organizations, \nlabor unions, and political parties. The winners are the wealthy, major \nnews corporations, and incumbent politicians.\n  Think about who supports this bill. The wealthiest of America's \nfoundations and individuals are supporting this bill. The mainstream \nmedia is the prime cheerleader of this bill, and many incumbent \npoliticians are attracted to this bill. The majority of average \ncitizens e-mailing my office, calling me and writing me, overwhelmingly \noppose this bill.\n\n  To try to level the playing field in elections with superwealthy \ncandidates, I cosponsored an amendment with Senators Domenici and \nDeWine and others. That amendment, known as the wealthy candidate \namendment, would have allowed a candidate running against a wealthy \ncandidate who self-financed his or her campaign to increase the \ncontribution limits from individuals and PACs.\n  This amendment, thankfully, passed. It is a great improvement to the \nbase bill and helps to level the playing field and take advantage away \nfrom the superwealthy candidate who sometimes pours tens of millions of \ndollars into their own campaign to win a House or Senate seat.\n  This amendment helps those candidates who are not millionaires, or \nwealthy, to have the limits raised on what they can accept from \nindividuals and PACs. I think it is a commonsense and bipartisan reform \nprovision, and that it will do much to create freer elections and \nconfidence of the public in those elections where the superwealthy \nspend millions and millions of dollars.\n  There are other campaign reform measures that should be enacted as \nwell to enhance and not stifle the voice of citizens. The hard dollar \nindividual contributions have not been raised since 1974. This limit \nneeds to be raised and indexed for inflation. One thousand dollars just \ndoes not buy what it used to in 1974. This limit must be raised \nsubstantially, especially if soft money to the parties is going to be \nreduced. The limit should be raised to $3,000 from the current $1,000. \nRaising this limit would enable more individual citizens to run for \noffice, enable all candidates to concentrate more on the job at hand \nand less on fundraising. It may also remove some of the incentive for \ninterest groups to make independent and issue advocacy expenditures. \nWhile a $1,000 contribution may have been high in 1974 when it was \nimposed, it would be worth about $3,000 today.\n  In addition, the aggregate hard money individual contribution limit \nshould be raised higher than it is already in the bill. McCain-Feingold \nraises current law from a $25,000 limit to $30,000, but, like the hard \ndollar limits for individuals, this limit should be raised higher and \nindexed for inflation.\n  The Hagel-Landrieu bill raises this amount from $25,000 in current \nlaw to $75,000. I would feel much better about supporting a measure \nwhich raises these two amounts to strengthen the voice of the \nindividual citizen.\n  Finally, the heart of campaign finance reform must be disclosure. We \nhave seen in recent years TV blitzes and ad wars in campaigns. Many \npeople wonder who puts out these ads and commercials, and how much \nmoney is spent on ad blitzes, and who in the world is paying for them. \nFor American citizens to make a better informed decision in their \nvoting, they deserve to know who is sponsoring these ads and especially \nwho is paying for them and how much they cost. We have the ability to \nmake this information available over the Internet instantly.\n  The Federal Election Commission can and should make this information \navailable on the Internet as soon as possible but no later than 24 \nhours after the information is received by the FEC. Full disclosure \nwill instill better confidence in our citizenry.\n  This provision is something many of us have advocated in the past, \nand it is part of the Hagel-Landrieu proposal, which I hope becomes \npart of this underlying bill.\n  We have spent a week on campaign finance reform, and we have another \nweek to go. I hope we can make some real effort and progress in \nstrengthening the voice of the average citizen.\n  I fear that so far we still have an unequal playing field, and that \nthe underlying bill still favors the wealthy incumbents and the media.\n  We need to enhance, not squelch, the voice of the people in their \nelections. Free political speech is the best campaign finance reform. \nIt is the very core of what James Madison drafted and the Framers \nadopted when they guaranteed to the people that ``Congress shall make \nno law abridging the freedom of speech.''\n  If we are going to pass campaign finance reform, then we need to \nensure that average citizens are not absolutely out of the system. We \nmust pass a bill that does not restrict the freedom of speech of any \nAmerican.\n  I urge my colleagues to make sure that happens when we pass this \nbill. If it doesn't have those features in it, I suggest that we vote \nagainst McCain-Feingold. If it has those features, then I suggest that \nwe vote for the underlying bill.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \ngenerosity and courtesy.\n  Right to the point with respect to the big bugaboo about the first \ntime in our history that we are amending the first amendment, we are \nnot amending any first amendment on speech. I will emphasize that in \njust a second. But if we were, it would not be the first time. And the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky and others understand that. They \ncontinue to raise that bugaboo to intimidate the Senators about the \nseriousness of this by saying it is the first time that we carved and \netched out of the first amendment since the founding of our country and \nthe passage of the Bill of Rights.\n  I know that the Senator from Kentucky and others who use that \nexpression know about the limits, about the Tillman Act in 1907, about \nTeddy Roosevelt, or the Taft-Hartley Act, and limits on speech by union \nactivity. They also know about the limits with respect to the obscene, \nthe seven dirty words in the specific case where we gave the FEC the \npower to control these kind of words, and about speech on the airwaves \nwith respect to false and deceptive advertising. Everybody believes in \nthe Federal Trade Commission.\n  I have given a dozen examples of where there is already limited \nspeech. But our particular resolution, S.J. Res. 4, is not an \namendment, as the Senator from Alabama would infer. He says, of all \nthings, that even during campaign times this amends the right to speak. \nIt doesn't amend anything. It is merely a joint resolution, and not \neven signed by the President but referred to the States for \nratification to give Congress the power to legislate. It legislates \nnothing. It doesn't approve of McCain-Feingold. It doesn't disapprove \nof it. It doesn't approve of any particular legislation. It only gives \nthe power back to us to stop this money chase, and the corruption of \nthe system.\n  You can see it here this afternoon already. We have had a pretty good \ndebate, relatively speaking. But everybody has been out, and they are \nallowed to stay out until 6 o'clock in order to chase the money. We \nused to vote all day Monday when I first got here, and all day Friday. \nThose two days are gone. Tuesday morning is gone. Usually it is after \nlunch on Tuesday when we really start. Then we have a window on \nWednesday and a window on Thursday, both at lunch and in the evening.\n  The entire time is not spent on doing the job of a U.S. Senator, but \nof keeping the job. You have to raise $7 million over six years; $3,000 \nevery day for six years, including Sunday and Christmas Day. That is \nobscene.\n  This gives the Congress the power to deal with that particular \nproblem for the first time. Those who would oppose this amendment have \nno idea of controlling that spending.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my distinguished colleague from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S2881]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I always enjoy listening to my colleague \nfrom South Carolina. I disagree with him that all we do in the Senate \nis go out and raise money. I think Senators work very hard. I have to \nadmit that we generally don't have to vote on Monday until after 5 \no'clock in the evening. There is a reason for that, because Senators \nare returning. Not all of us live in close proximity to the District of \nColumbia. I know this. When I go to Utah, my time isn't spent raising \nmoney. Most of my time is spent going to town meetings, meeting with \npeople in my offices, and working with staff and others who do the job \nthat we have to do. I think most Senators around here, including the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina, spend inordinate hours here \nduring the week. I generally get to the office around 6 a.m. I don't \nknow many days when I am home before 7 or 8 o'clock at night. The days \nare completely filled meeting with people.\n  Yes, you have to raise money. But everybody has to do that. That is \npart of the process. It is not a bad part of the process. There are \njust a few who do it illegally. If that is the sole thing that you do, \nthen you are selling your vote for money. But I don't know of one \nSenator in this body who has ever sold his or her vote for money. I \nbelieve there is no question that money does talk in the sense that \ngroups support you and support Senators around here. Generally the \ngroups that have donated to my campaigns do that because they agree \nwith my position. Certainly, I am happy to have their help, because you \ndo have to raise enough money to run.\n  But the Senator is right in one respect; that is, it is costing a \nfortune to run for the U.S. Senate now. The average Senate race is at \nleast $4 million. That makes it very difficult for incumbents. But if \nwe pass the McCain-Feingold bill, it makes it even worse in some \nrespects, especially if you do not increase the limits. Those limits \nwere set back in 1974, I believe, and just by the rate of inflation, \nthe limits should be raised no less than three times, and probably as \nmuch as five or six times.\n  The cost of elections have gone up dramatically. Back in 1976, a \ncouple of years after the rules were set, when I ran for Senate, I have \nto say that my opponent spent in hard dollars somewhere around \n$570,000. I raised in hard dollars about $569,000, if I recall it \ncorrectly. It cost me more money to raise it than it did to spend it, \nbecause I had to use direct mail because nobody knew who I was. I had \nto win that race by out-working and out-performing the incumbent. But \ntoday, if I was to try to do the same thing, I wouldn't even consider \nit, because I would have to start at least $1 million, or $2 million. I \nwould have to have a lot more support than I have today. It is going up \nevery year.\n  It is not a bad thing to have to raise money. I am a perfect \nillustration that it isn't money that always talks because I bet that I \ndid not spend over $100,000 in real terms in that race back in 1976. My \nopponent, who I think took me for granted, and made a terrible mistake \nin doing that, he had at least $600,000, it seemed to me, in actual \ndollars to spend, plus he had the support of all kinds of soft money \ngroups that came into the State and assisted him as well. So it was \nreally a lot more money than that.\n  The worst race I had was in 1982, when the mayor of Salt Lake, who is \na wonderful person, and a good man, ran against me. It was a very tight \nrace. I raised close to $4 million in that race. He admitted he raised \nprobably at least $2.3 million, if I recall it correctly. But that was \nonly part of the story. The trade union money came into that State. \nAccording to sources, they had as many as 100 dues-paid political \noperatives operating there in Utah, who spent all kinds of money trying \nto assist my opponent in defeating me, something that Republicans just \ndo not have on their side.\n  When we get out the vote, we have to raise the money ourselves, we \nhave to spend it ourselves. We do not have outside groups doing it for \nus. In the case of Democrats, at least in that race--and I think in \nmany other races--the get-out-the-vote money, the advertising money, a \nlot of other things come from the trade unions. I think that is their \nright. They believed in my opponent. He had voted virtually a straight \nunion line for them, and they supported him. I can't say I disagreed \nwith their right to do that.\n  In our worries about having to raise all this money, we don't want to \nthrow out the baby with the bath water. We don't want to infringe upon \nfirst amendment rights or freedoms.\n  In relation to this particular constitutional amendment, however, let \nme conclude with this simple observation. Free speech and free \nelections are one and the same. This constitutional amendment involves \nspeech no matter how you write it, because Buckley v. Valeo said that \nmoney in politics is a form of speech. This constitutional amendment \nwould hurt free speech by giving Congress--535 Members of Congress--and \nthe respective State legislatures--they call it ``the States'' but it \nis really, in effect, the State legislatures--too much power to change \nthe Supreme Court cases that protect free speech.\n  Make no mistake about it, this amendment, if it would pass, would do \naway with Buckley v. Valeo and would send us down that road of allowing \nState legislatures to determine just what can or cannot be spent in \npolitical campaigns, and allow the Congress of the United States to \ndetermine what can or cannot be spent in political campaigns.\n  I suspect that is going to create a system that is a lot worse than \nour current system. Because if you ban soft money for the two parties--\nwhere you would want the money to be spent; where it is accountable; \nwhere they have to be accountable--they have to explain what they are \ndoing--you can look at it and see whether you want to support the \nparties or not--if you take the soft money away from them, and leave it \nin the hands of everybody else in society, then basically what you are \ndoing is, I think, stultifying the electoral process and certainly the \nparty process, which all of us ought to be encouraging. Because under \nour current rules, the parties have to disclose the moneys that they \nreceive. Under our current rules, many of the outside groups do not \nhave to disclose the soft moneys they use in political campaigns. \nAnd some of them use them in reprehensible ways.\n\n  This amendment says that\n\n       Congress shall have power to set reasonable limits on the \n     amount of contributions that may be accepted by, and the \n     amount of expenditures that may be made by, in support of, or \n     in opposition to, a candidate for nomination for election to, \n     or for election to, Federal office.\n\n  The same language for the State legislatures.\n  In essence, this would overrule Buckley v. Valeo. If you got the \nwrong people in Congress, this could mess up the whole process. But if \nyou do not think Congress is capable of doing it, think of what the \nState legislatures might be willing to do in certain States that have \ncompletely different viewpoints from say my State of Utah.\n  So one of the things our Founding Fathers were most concerned about \nwas absolute majoritarian control of our country. They were absolutely \nconcerned that a straight majority control could lead to mob control \nsimilar to what happened in the French Revolution that occurred later. \nThey were concerned about that.\n  So they set up checks and balances. They set up the Senate as a check \nand balance, in a sense, because in the Senate every State has equal \nrights with suffrage. It is not proportional. Every State, no matter \nhow large or small, has two Senators. Wyoming with 700,000 citizens has \nthe same number of Senators as California with now approaching 33, 34 \nmillion citizens. They did that to have these checks and balances so \nthat there would be no way that one side or majoritarian group would \nrun away with the process. This amendment would allow them to do so.\n  We have 5 minutes left. I see the distinguished chairman here. I \nyield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for his fine work on \nthis amendment again this year. We have had this debate a few times, I \nsay to my friend from Utah.\n\n[[Page S2882]]\n\n  Let me just sum it up. This is a unique opportunity for a large \nmajority of the Senate to vote against a proposal and be in concert \nwith the Washington Post, Common Cause, Senator Feingold, and Senator \nMcConnell. That is truly a unique opportunity in the course of this \ndebate.\n  I commend the Senator from South Carolina. His intentions are clear \nand honorable. He understands that in order to do what is sought in \nMcCain-Feingold you need to amend the first amendment for the first \ntime in over 200 years, or the first time ever--carve a niche out of it \nto give both the Congress and State legislatures an opportunity to get \ncomplete control of all of this pernicious speech that is going on out \nthere that offends us. That is at the core of this debate.\n  This is a constitutional amendment. It should be overwhelmingly \ndefeated, as it was last year when we had the same vote. There were 67 \nSenators who voted against it and only 33 Senators who voted for it. I \nthought the 67 Senators exercised extraordinarily good judgment. I hope \nthat will be the case again when the roll is called at 6 o'clock.\n  I do not know if anyone else wishes to speak.\n  Mr. President, is all the time used on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2\\1/2\\ minutes under the control of \nSenator Hatch.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the joint resolution.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading \nand was read the third time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum having been suggested, \nthe clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask that we proceed with the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the \nthird time, the question is, Shall the joint resolution pass? The yeas \nand nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Under the previous order, there are 15 minutes \nof debate on the Wellstone amendment. The time is to be divided between \nthe sponsor and Mr. Feingold of Wisconsin.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think we are in a critical time \nregarding the direction and prospects for this bill. This is an \nimportant piece of legislation. It started out weaker than it once was. \nIt is still a very important effort.\n  The question is whether or not reformers will support amendments that \nare proreform that will improve the bill or whether we will go in the \ndirection, for example, of taking the caps off hard money and having \nyet more big money in politics.\n  This amendment improves this bill. This amendment says when you have \nthe prohibition on soft money in parties and then you have a very \nimportant effort by Senator Snowe and Senator Jeffords to also apply \nthat prohibition of soft money to the sham issue ads when it comes to \nlabor and corporations, in the Shays-Meehan bill, that prohibition on \nsoft money applies to all the groups and organizations. In the other \nMcCain-Feingold bill, it applied to all of these organizations.\n  If you don't have that prohibition of soft money, you will take the \nsoft money from parties and it will all shift to a proliferation of the \ngroups and organizations that are going to carpet bomb our States with \nall these sham issue ads. This is a loophole that must be plugged.\n  My amendment is what is in the Shays-Meehan bill.\n  Third, colleagues, I want to be very clear. I have written this \namendment in such a way that severability applies. Even if a Supreme \nCourt in the future were to say this amendment is not constitutional, \nthere is complete severability here and it would not apply to any other \nprovisions, including the Jeffords-Snowe provision.\n  Also, looking over at my colleague from the State of Tennessee, \nSenator Thompson, we accepted the millionaire amendment which will in \nall likelihood be challenged by the courts. That is why I am so clear \nthere is severability of principle that applies to this amendment.\n  Finally, if we are going to pass this bill and we are going to try to \nget some of the big money out of the politics, please let's not, when \nwe have a chance to fix a problem, not fix it. Don't let the soft money \nno longer apply to parties and all shifts to these sham ads. Let's be \nconsistent.\n  I do not believe that an effort to improve this bill is an effort to \nkill this bill. The argument that if the majority of Senators vote for \nthis amendment and improve the bill, then later on the majority of \nSenators who voted for this amendment will vote against the bill that \nthe majority just voted for on the amendment, doesn't make any sense. I \nhave heard this argument too many times. We ought to fix this problem.\n  I hope I will have your support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reluctantly, I move to table this amendment, both for \nconcerns of its constitutionality and also the practical considerations \nof what it will take to get our piece of legislation through this \nSenate and maintain the bipartisan spirit and reality that it has had.\n  With regard to the issues of constitutionality, I yield 5 minutes to \nthe Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n[[Page S2883]]\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Let me also add to what Senator Feingold said. I agree \nwith Senator Wellstone, that what he is trying to do makes a great deal \nof sense in terms of basic equity and fairness. The problem is that \n501(c)(4) corporations, at which his amendment is aimed, have not been \ntreated the same by the U.S. Supreme Court as unions and for-profit \ncorporations.\n  Snowe-Jeffords is very carefully crafted to meet the constitutional \ntest of Buckley v. Valeo. Basically, it meets the two fundamental \nrequirements of Buckley:\n  First, that there can be a compelling State interest. The Buckley \nCourt found that exactly what is being done with Snowe-Jeffords \nconstituted a compelling State interest.\n  Second, it be narrowly tailored. Snowe-Jeffords is limited to the 60 \ndays before the election. It is narrowly tailored, limited to broadcast \nadvertising.\n  It also requires the likeness or name of the candidate to be used.\n  What has been done with Snowe-Jeffords is a very careful effort to \nmake sure the constitutional requirements of Buckley v. Valeo have been \nmet. In fact, they have been met. It is not vague; it establishes a \nvery clear bright-line test so we don't have a vagueness constitutional \nproblem. We also don't have a problem of substantial overbreadth \nbecause all of the empirical evidence shows 99 percent of ads that meet \nthe test are, in fact, election campaign ads and constitute \nelectioneering.\n  Snowe-Jeffords has been very carefully crafted. It is narrow. It \nspecifically meets the requirements of Buckley v. Valeo, the \nconstitutional requirement.\n  The problem with what Senator Wellstone is attempting to do is there \nis a U.S. Supreme Court case, the FEC v. The Massachusetts Citizens for \nLife, that is directly on point, saying that these 501(c)(4)s have a \nlimited constitutional right to engage in electioneering to do campaign \nads. There are some limits, but unfortunately if you lump them in with \nunions and for-profit corporations, you create a very serious \nconstitutional problem because the U.S. Supreme Court has already \nspecifically addressed that issue.\n  So the reason Senator Feingold and Senator McCain are opposing this \namendment is the same reason that I oppose this amendment: It raises \nvery serious constitutional problems. The U.S. Supreme Court, in fact, \nin 1984 specifically ruled on this question.\n  What we urge the Members of the Senate to do is not support this \namendment, to vote for tabling. Those people who are in favor of real \nand meaningful campaign finance reform we hope will support Snowe-\nJeffords, support McCain-Feingold, and vote to table the Wellstone \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this is a situation that is very similar \nto what happened in the other body when they sought to pass the Shays-\nMeehan bill. There were times that amendments that were very attractive \nhad to be defeated to maintain a coalition to pass the bill. They were \ntough votes. Members of the House on both sides of the aisle stuck \ntogether and made sure the most important consideration was that the \nreform package pass.\n  We also face a political test with this amendment. Those who remember \nthe debate we had a few years ago will remember that Senators Snowe and \nJeffords developed their provision and then joined the reform effort \nwhile under enormous pressure to kill reform by voting for the so-\ncalled paycheck protection proposal. They agreed to work with us and to \nvote with us to defeat those unfair proposals once the Democratic \ncaucus agreed to the Snowe-Jeffords language. And our entire caucus \nvoted to add this provision to the McCain-Feingold bill in place of the \nprevious provision that would have treated 501(c)(4) advocacy groups \nthe same as for-profit corporations, similar to the approach and effect \nof the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota.\n\n  I think we saw last week that the Senators from Maine and Vermont, \nalong with other Republican supporters of reform, have been true to \ntheir word. If we adopt this amendment, in a way, we will be going back \non our word. I have worked for years with the Senator from Maine and \nthe Senator from Vermont on this bill. I know how sincerely they want \nto pass it. So I stand with them to defend the Snowe-Jeffords provision \nwhich I have come to believe is our best chance of making a significant \ndifference on this issue of phony issue ads and also the best chance we \nhave, as the Senator from North Carolina has so well expressed, to \nactually have this provision approved by the U.S. Supreme Court in the \ninevitable court challenge that will ensue if we manage to get this \nbill all the way over there.\n  Once this bill has been enacted and upheld by the courts, and once we \nsee whether and how the Snowe-Jeffords provision works, I would have no \nobjection to revisiting the issue with the Senator from Minnesota and \nothers to see if there is a way we can constitutionally expand this to \ninclude these other groups that have traditionally been treated by the \ncourts differently from the corporations and the unions.\n  For now, I think we should stick with the provision that is in our \nbill and vote against this well-intentioned amendment.\n  I understand under the unanimous consent agreement it is only \nappropriate to have an up-or-down vote on this amendment; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement did not specify. It simply said \na vote would occur in stacked sequence.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The amendment was offered in good faith. I see no \nreason to avoid the request, and instead of moving to table at the \nappropriate time, I will simply ask my colleagues to vote no on the \nWellstone amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 19 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Louisiana, 1 \nminute to the Senator from Illinois, and reserve the remainder of my \ntime for myself and Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. One of the most popular misconceptions of the underlying \nbill is we are eliminating soft money in Federal elections. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. The Senator from Minnesota is \nabsolutely correct in what he is attempting to do.\n  There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of organizations, \nsingle interest, special interest organizations, which will be able to \ncontinue to raise unlimited amounts of soft dollars to argue their \ncause after this underlying bill would be passed.\n  You all remember the Flo ads, Citizens For Better Medicare. There is \nnothing in the underlying bill, without the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, that would prohibit Flo and all of our citizens for \nMedicare from doing exactly what they did, attack Members across the \nboard time after time after time. There are literally thousands of \ngroups that are not affected without the amendment of the Senator, that \nwould continue to use soft money to affect elections, unrestricted. We \nare not going to be able to do anything with that unless the amendment \nof the Senator from Minnesota is adopted.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  The Senator from Illinois?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is naive to believe we can eliminate \nsoft money from candidates and political parties and that that money \nwill disappear. That money will find its venue in these issue ads that \nwe will then face. Believe me, the voters of your home State will not \nbe able to distinguish where the soft money is being spent. It is going \nto be soft money spent for the purpose of influencing political \ncampaigns.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has adopted the Snowe-Jeffords standard in \nterms of these ads. It is not changing it in any respect. I say, with \nall due respect to my colleague from North Carolina, the Senator from \nMinnesota has included a severability clause. If we are wrong, if this \nis unconstitutional, it can be stricken without having any damage to \nthe rest of this McCain-Feingold bill as written.\n  In 1974, when the Senate and House presented to the Supreme Court our \nversion of campaign finance reform, they decided spending limitations \nwere unconstitutional but, in terms of contribution limitations, they \nwere constitutional. When it comes down to it,\n\n[[Page S2884]]\n\nthey can make that same decision on this provision.\n  I hope if it is in the bill they will leave it there because then we \nwill clearly takeout all soft money. Unfortunately, the Senator from \nMinnesota is not part of the bargain today. What he has brought before \nus is not something that has been bargained for by those who have \nwritten this bill. But his is a good-faith and valuable addition to \nthis, and I hope my colleagues will vote for it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 54 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me be clear. When the Senator from Illinois argues \nthat there is a severability clause, the fact is there is going to be \nan effort on this floor to make this entire bill nonseverable. That \nraises the stakes to the point of threatening the entire piece of \nlegislation because if any one piece of this bill--if we lose on \nnonseverability--is determined to be unconstitutional, the whole bill \nfalls. I think we are going to win on the severability issue, but if we \ndo not, this amendment raises the very distinct prospect, which I \nbelieve all of us fear, that the entire effort will fall if the U.S. \nSupreme Court finds one defect. This is a critical amendment in that \nregard.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is not true. Does the Senator have any time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much do I still have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 43 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to get campaign finance reform, \nbut I am not going to be bum-rushed down a path where you forgo all \nanalytical abilities. This severability issue is an important issue. In \n1974, we passed campaign finance legislation and the Supreme Court \nthrew out a number of very important provisions in that legislation and \ntotally changed the scheme. Much of what we are suffering today is a \nconsequence of that Court's decision.\n  Now we are being told you can't have nonseverability; you have to \nstick with this thing through thick or thin. I am told, suppose the \nCourt throws out a minor provision. You want the whole bill to go down?\n  The answer to that is no. But then the question is, Suppose the Court \nthrows out a major provision. Suppose the Court throws out a major \nprovision. Do you want the whole bill to go down there?\n  The Senator from Minnesota has made an exceedingly good-faith effort \nbecause he has included the provision if the Court throws out this \namendment, the rest of the bill will stand. I do not understand these \narguments on the constitutionality, given that provision of the \nSenator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This is a reform. The soft money, it doesn't let it \nchannel into all these sham ads. It makes the bill stronger, I say to \nmy colleagues.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the remaining time to the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I say in response to what the Senators \nfrom Maryland and Illinois said, without regard to severability, we \nalso have a responsibility not to pass an amendment that the U.S. \nSupreme Court has already ruled is unconstitutional, black and white, \nin 1984. That is the issue.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will my colleague yield? That amendment applied to \nbroadcasting. The Senator knows that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 145. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I thought maybe my colleague might want to \ninform our Members as to what the program is tonight and tomorrow.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I inform all of our colleagues that the next amendment \nto be dealt with is the Hagel-Breaux amendment which will be laid down \nshortly. It is my understanding that it is agreeable on both sides to \nhave very limited debate on that amendment tonight, with the remainder \nof the debate coming in the morning and a vote before the noon policy \nluncheons tomorrow. I say to my friend from Connecticut, is that his \nunderstanding as well?\n  Mr. DODD. It is, Mr. President. We may have additional requests. I \nthink 10 minutes is what Senator Hagel wanted. We may have a request \nfor 15 or 20 minutes over here tonight because people want to be heard. \nAfter the Hagel amendment, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts has been \nwaiting. We would be prepared to offer his amendment after the \nconsideration of the Hagel amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, that is where we stand for the evening. \nI believe the Senator from Illinois would like to dispose of his \namendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, may I ask what the parliamentary procedure \nwill be?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Arizona, what I \nthought I would do is give the Senator from Illinois a chance to \nwithdraw his amendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I would like consent to withdraw it \nand resubmit it. I am still working on getting it so that it \ntechnically complies with all I want to achieve.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Arizona, what I had hoped was \nto enter into an agreement where there would be 10 minutes on the side \nof the Hagel amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Fifteen minutes is what I need.\n\n[[Page S2885]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Fifteen minutes opposed to the Hagel amendment, with \nthe remainder of the time being reserved. We would go into session at 9 \no'clock in the morning; is that correct?\n  After consultation with the leader, the thought was that we would \ncome in at 9:15 and resume debate on the Hagel amendment, with the \nremainder of the time on each side reserved for the morning. Is my \nfriend from Arizona comfortable with that arrangement?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \nthe amendment I introduced on Friday, to be resubmitted later in the \nweek, as there are now some technical glitches.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that tonight \nthere be 10 minutes of debate on the proponents' side of the Hagel-\nBreaux amendment and 15 minutes on the side of the opponents of the \nHagel-Breaux amendment. I see Senator Hagel is present.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator from Kentucky: \nSenator Breaux, I believe, wanted to speak. He may need 5 minutes. We \nmay not use all of the time, but is that agreeable for an additional 5 \nminutes?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the Senator from Nebraska, he may carve up \nthat 10 minutes any way he would like.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 146\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to provide \nmeaningful campaign finance reform through requiring better reporting, \n     decreasing the role of soft money, and increasing individual \n              contribution limits, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Hagel] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 146.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of Friday, March \n23, 2001, under ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, in this final week of debate on campaign \nfinance reform, we have an opportunity to achieve something relevant \nand important. Our hope has always been to get a bipartisan bill \napproved by the Senate that brings reform to the system, is \nconstitutional, does not weaken political parties, and that our \nPresident Bush will sign.\n  It is in that spirit that we offer our amendment, my colleagues and \nI, Senators Breaux, Ben Nelson, Landrieu, DeWine, Kay Bailey Hutchison, \nGordon Smith, Thomas, Enzi, Hutchinson, Roberts, Allard, Brownback, \nCraig, and Voinovich.\n  Whatever we do this week to reform our campaign finance system, we \nmust look to expand, not constrict, opportunities for people to \nparticipate in our democratic process.\n  The amendment we offer today is very similar to the legislation we \nfirst offered in the fall of 1999. It will improve the way Federal \ncampaigns are finance and has three main components.\n  First, hard money limits:\n  This is just a matter of fairness and common sense. Today's hard \nmoney contribution limits are worth less than one-third of their value \nwhen the 1974 act was passed. They haven't been adjusted in more than \n26 years. Hard money is the most accountable method of political \nfinancing. Every dollar contributed and every dollar spent is fully \nreported to the Federal Elections Commission. The individual limit of \n$1,000 in 1974 now equates to $3,300 in today's purchasing power. Our \namendment raises this limit to $3,000 and indexes it for inflation.\n  Second, our amendment focuses on disclosure. This is the heart of \nreal campaign finance reform. We start from a fundamental premise that \nthe problems in the system do not lie with political parties or \ncandidates' campaigns but with unaccountable, unlimited outside monies \nand influence that flows into the system where there is either little \nor no disclosure.\n  In recent years, we have seen an explosion of multimillion dollar \nadvertising buys by outside organizations and individuals. These groups \nand wealthy individuals come into an election, spend unlimited sums of \nmoney and leave without anyone knowing who they were or how much they \nspent or why.\n  Our amendment increases disclosure requirements for candidates, \nparties, independent groups, and individuals. We ensure that the name \nof the individual, or the organization, its officers, address, phone \nnumbers, and the amount of money spent are made public.\n  It is a very relevant question. Why do we want to ban soft money only \nto political parties--that funding which is accountable and reportable \nnow? This ban would weaken the parties and put more control in the \nhands of wealthy individuals and independent groups that are \naccountable to no one.\n  Our amendment caps soft money contributions to political parties to \n$60,000 per year--far below the unlimited millions that are now poured \ninto the system. This is a very real and very significant limit. The \nWall Street Journal recently reported that nearly two-thirds of the \nsoft money contributions in the last election cycle came from those who \ngave more than the $120,000 election cycle soft money ban that would be \nin our bill. Two-thirds of the soft money contributions, or a total of \nnearly $300 million, in the last election cycle would have been \nprohibited by this cap.\n  Regarding the State parties, our amendment codifies a defined list of \nactivities that State parties must pay for with a percentage of hard \ndollars. For activities that promote candidates in Federal elections, \nState parties would follow a funding formula determined by the number \nof Federal candidates. For example, if 50 percent of the candidates \npromoted are Federal candidates, then 50 percent of the funding must \ncome from Federal, or hard dollars. We agree with curbing the abuse of \nsoft money.\n  Finally, we believe our campaign finance reform proposal would pass \nconstitutional muster. As Senator Sarbanes said on the floor of the \nSenate a half hour ago, what good does it do to pass legislation we \nknow will be struck down by the courts?\n  I look forward to debating the merits of our proposal with my Senate \ncolleagues.\n  Now I turn to my friend and colleague from Louisiana, who was an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill in October of 1999, Senator John \nBreaux.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska for his contribution in working so diligently to try to bring \na degree of reform to our system and yet at the same time recognizing \nthe practicalities of what we do in the real world. One of the most \npopular misconceptions that members of the press, as well as many \nMembers of this body, the other body, and many people in the general \npublic have of the underlying bill, the McCain-Feingold bill, is that \nsomehow it takes the so-called soft money out of Federal elections.\n  It simply does not do that. It only does it, as the distinguish \nSenator has pointed out, to probably the two most responsible \norganizations out there involved in Federal elections, and that is the \nDemocratic Party, of which I am a member, and the Republican Party, of \nwhich the Senator from Nebraska is a member.\n  It takes the so-called soft money out of the party operations, but it \nleaves it available to every other group in the United States, all of \nthe so-called 501(c)(4) organizations and the 527 organizations, which \nunder the McCain-Feingold bill would continue to be able\n\n[[Page S2886]]\n\nto raise large sums of money--that is, unrestricted as to the amounts--\nto be used in Federal elections and, in most cases, against Federal \ncandidates. I do not know how anybody writing about what we are doing \nin this body tonight can say that this type of a bill, which leaves all \nof those areas unrestricted, somehow eliminates soft money in Federal \nelections. If you look at the list of groups that are single issue \ngroups, special interest groups, that have been running ads since \nJanuary of 1999--just that group--I have two columns of print that is \nso small I can hardly read it without putting it as far away from my \neyes as I possibly can. But every group on this list would be untouched \nby the McCain-Feingold amendment--at least outside of 60 days before \nthe election--with the adoption of the Wellstone amendment.\n  It is very clear that most of the damage these groups do is not \nwithin 60 days of an election; it is the year before the election. It \nis the 2 years before the election. As in my State of Louisiana, when \nthe election is not until the next November, one of these groups is \nalready on the air running television advertisements, using soft \ndollars, unrestricted--unrestricted today and after if the McCain-\nFeingold bill were to be adopted. They would do the same thing right up \nuntil the election. At that time, they don't need to do it anymore. The \ndamage is done, and the impression is created about a particular \ncandidate, whether he or she is good or bad. Sixty days means nothing \nto them because they have already accomplished their purpose for the 2 \nyears prior to that time when they did the damage, armed with all of \nthe soft money they would want. That is one of the reasons why I am \nconcerned.\n  I will mention very briefly the type of ads that will still be \nallowed under McCain-Feingold and the damage they can do. If they are \nunanswered by our State parties and the Republican Party and the \nDemocratic Party, they will do serious damage to the integrity of our \nelections.\n  Rather than say we are taking ourselves away from the shackles of \nspecial interests, I daresay that candidates will be more prone to \nlisten to all of these special interests, single interest \norganizations, which will continue to use all of the money that they \nneed.\n  Now pick your poison because they have them from both sides. But \nthese groups would continue to be able to do anything they want with \nsoft dollars up until 60 days. Here are the National Abortion Rights \nLeague and the National Right To Life. Which side would you want \nattacking you in your State? Do you remember the TV ads with Harry and \nLouise on the Clinton health plan? Some of the folks on that side of \nthe aisle thought they were great but not this side. Harry and Louise \nrepresented the Health Insurance Association of America. They would do \nexactly what they did 2 years ago and 4 years ago. Somebody said \ncandidates would not be able to help them raise money. Does anybody \nthink they need candidates to help them raise money--the Health \nInsurance Association of America? They will have more money than they \nknow what to do with.\n\n  Do you remember Flo? She did a terrific job. On my side of the aisle, \nthey didn't like what Flo had to say. Citizens For Better Medicare was \nFlo. It is a 501(c)(4) organization. They will continue to raise \nunlimited amounts of money and do exactly what they did several years \nago.\n  Therefore, I think the Hagel-Breaux approach--we will call it that \nfor the purpose of our discussion tonight--is a balanced and proper \napproach and one that makes a great deal of sense. It is real reform, \nand it is something that should merit our support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment proposed by the Senator from Nebraska. The Hagel amendment is \nvery simply antireform. Over the course of this debate, many Members of \nthis body have proposed thoughtful, and even provocative, amendments \nthat have made important contributions to the substance of the McCain-\nFeingold bill. I thank my colleagues sincerely for their efforts.\n  But this amendment clearly does not contribute to the strength of the \nbill. On the contrary, the Hagel amendment would weaken McCain-Feingold \nbeyond recognition. My colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, has said he \ncan't imagine a system worse than the one we have today. I think we \nhave found it today in the Hagel amendment.\n  I am sorry to say that because I know my friend Senator Hagel is \nsincere in his attempt to improve the campaign finance system. As many \ncolleagues know, the centerpiece of the McCain-Feingold bill is a ban \non soft money. The ban on soft money defines the legislation. Banning \nsoft money is the most vital reform we can enact and, without it, all \nthe effort that the Senate has put into the bill would be meaningless.\n  Make no mistake, as we vote on this amendment, the Hagel amendment \nsimply guts the soft money ban. Under Hagel, the soft money that is so \noutrageous to the public, and that so few Members of this body are even \nwilling to defend at this point, is suddenly, permanently, forever \nwritten into our law. That is unacceptable, and it is certainly not \nreform.\n  We can't be credible to the American people if we are going to \ncharacterize as reform changes in the law that give even more power to \nthe wealthiest people in our country.\n  We are not here to sanction or institutionalize the soft money \nsystem. We are here to stop it. We did not fight for 6 years to get to \nthe place where we are today, within a few days of passing a bill to \nban soft money from our system, only then to step back at the last \nminute and say: Never mind; soft money creates a dangerous appearance \nproblem for Members of this body.\n  It is sad to say--you know it, Mr. President, and I know it--we pick \nup the phone to raise soft money with one hand and we vote with the \nother hand. Is the answer for the Congress to officially sanction this \nsystem, to say it is OK forever for Members of Congress to ask for \n$50,000 checks from corporations and unions, and make it live forever? \nThat is what this amendment will allow. I think most of my colleagues \nunderstand that for this body to have any credibility with the American \npeople, the answer to that question must be a resounding no.\n  When this body succeeded in stopping the appearance of corruption in \nthe past, we did not do it with half-hearted measures that sanctioned \nour own behavior. When the Senate responded to concerns about the \nhonoraria system, the Senate banned honoraria. It did not say we would \njust take a little less in speaking fees than we did before.\n  When the Senate responded to the public's concern about Members \nreceiving lavish gifts from outside interests, we enacted the gift ban. \nWe did not say the system that was in place was OK and open a new and \npermanent loophole.\n  We did not take the easy way out in those circumstances because we \nknew the American people would see through any attempt to dodge the \nreforms that needed to be made.\n  Those were important moments where the Senate acted to renew the \npeople's faith in us and the work we do. We sent the message with those \nreforms that we understood that just because something is standard \npractice around here does not make it right. We understood that our \ninaction fostered the appearance of corruption, and so on those \noccasions we took decisive action to change the system.\n  I say to my colleagues, we are only going to get credit where credit \nis due. The American people may not be following every nuance of this \ndebate and every detail of each amendment, but they know phony reform \nwhen they see it. If we simply engrave soft money into law and allow \nsoft money to continue to flow unchecked to State parties, we are not \nfixing the system; we are perpetuating it. We are continuing to allow, \nin effect, two sets of books: The hard money system and the soft money \nsystem; if you will, a second secret-secret fund that involves enormous \namounts of money.\n  That is not why we are here. I for one cannot go home to Wisconsin to \none of my listening sessions and town meetings and say to a \nconstituent: We just passed campaign finance reform in the Senate; \nisn't that great?\n  It used to be legal for a couple to give up to $100,000 in an \nelection cycle to candidates, parties, and PACs, and now it is $540,000 \nper cycle. That is what the Hagel bill does. That is what the Hagel\n\n[[Page S2887]]\n\namendment does. It allows every couple in America to give $540,000 \nevery 2 years of hard and soft money combined.\n  I do not know about the other States--actually, I think I do. It \nwould seem ridiculous to the people of any State to suggest you could \nhave a campaign finance reform bill that allowed any couple in America \nto give $540,000 every 2 years. I could not say it with a straight \nface, and I think every other Member of this body would be in the same \nboat.\n\n  My friend from Nebraska says this amendment at least limits the \namount of soft money. I am sorry to say that just is not the case. \nWhile it is true the Hagel amendment caps what a corporation or union \nor wealthy individual can give to the national parties in soft money, \nthat same soft money can still be raised and spent by the State \nparties--by the State parties--on Federal elections. It leaves a \ngaping, complete loophole for wealthy donors to funnel unlimited money \nto the States.\n  In contrast, the State loophole is sealed shut in the McCain-Feingold \nbill, and it is not even addressed by the Hagel bill. McCain-Feingold \ndoes not prohibit States from spending their money on campaigns as long \nas it does not relate to Federal elections, but when it comes to States \nspending money on Federal elections, soft money is strictly prohibited.\n  I know this provision in our bill has led to a new argument, a new \ncharge that I have had some fun debating with the Senator from \nNebraska. The new charge is that our bill ``federalizes\" State election \nlaw.\n  Let's put this matter to rest right now. We only address State \nspending on Federal elections--on Federal elections. Federal elections \nshould be conducted under Federal rules, and that is what McCain-\nFeingold ensures. You cannot leave open loopholes that we already know \nexist, as the Hagel amendment does, and somehow purport to be doing \nsomething about or limiting soft money. It just is not true. That is \njust a roadmap. The Hagel amendment is just a roadmap to the parties to \njust restructure their operations and continue what they have been \ndoing.\n  I ask my colleagues whether they think the donors on this chart might \nsend soft money donations to the States under the Hagel amendment. What \ndo they think? Look at the growth under each of these amounts. For \ndonors of $200,000 or more, $400,000 or more, or $500,000 or more, one \ncan see the enormous growth from 9 people who gave $500,000 or more to \n167 people giving $500,000 or more. Do we really think these donors \nwill just reduce their contributions to $60,000 per year if the Hagel \namendment becomes the law? Of course they will not, and they will not \nhave to because the Hagel amendment tells them exactly how to get the \nrest of that cash to whom they want it to get to just running it \nthrough the State parties that can spend it freely on Federal \nelections, every dime under the Hagel amendment.\n  It is a roadmap for continuing to exert influence over the Congress \nand the administration by contributing all that money to the State \nparties and then having it spent on the Federal elections.\n  I thought this category of donor deserved its own chart because this \nis phenomenal. Since the 1992 election cycle, the number of $1 million \ndonors--I say to the Senator from Connecticut, when I came here, I \ncould not even imagine--and I came here only 8 years ago--the idea of a \n$1 million donor. I did not think it possible to even give $25,000. \nMillion-dollar donors have developed in the last few years, and it has \ngone through the roof.\n  This chart shows the astronomical growth of these mega-donors. There \nwas only one in 1992. I did not know about it when I got here. It sure \ndid not help me. In 1996, it rose to seven--seven $1 million donors. In \nthe year 2000 cycle, it was really moving: 50 different groups, \ninterests, corporations, unions, or individuals gave over $1 million-- \n50.\n\n  I have a feeling that some of these donors would be very happy to \nexploit the State loophole under the Hagel amendment. Members of \nCongress will, unbelievably, still be able to ask for these \ncontributions.\n  Members of this body are allowed under the Hagel amendment to call \nsomebody up, to call a CEO, or the president of a labor union or an \nindividual and say: We need a million-dollar check from you. That is \nwhat the Hagel amendment would permit; it just has to be done through \nthe State laws. They will still be able to ask for them because, unlike \nthe McCain-Feingold bill, the Hagel amendment does not contain any \nrestriction on Federal officials or officeholders raising soft money, \nand to me that is the very worst thing about this whole system, that \npeople elected to this institution are allowed not only to do this, but \nthey are pressured into asking for those contributions every day by \ntheir political parties and by their political leaders.\n  Finally, I think some of these donors would certainly be giving soft \nmoney to the States under the Hagel amendment. I think this chart shows \nbetter than any how savvy soft money donors are. They can have it both \nways because they can give unlimited amounts to both parties. They pay \ntribute to both of the parties and exert influence on the entire \nCongress. These are the kinds of donors who will choose to take the \nState soft money route mapped out for them under the Hagel amendment--\nFederal Express, Verizon, AT, Freddie Mac, Philip Morris--all giving \nto both parties, covering their bets. Believe me, they will proceed \nthrough the loophole in the Hagel bill with every dime they want to \ncontribute.\n  We can hardly be naive enough to think that just because the soft \nmoney to the national parties would be capped, soft money donors would \nnot give heavily to State parties, as plenty of soft money donors \nalready do.\n  As I mentioned, there is another crucial difference between McCain-\nFeingold and the Hagel proposal. We prohibit officeholders and \ncandidates from raising this soft money. The Hagel amendment does \nnothing to address this problem. Under the Hagel bill, for the first \ntime in American history, we would legitimize soft money, having \npoliticians call up every CEO and every corporate head, saying ``I need \nyour $60,000.'' That is what you can give. That is the price of \nadmission.\n\n  It has been the wisdom of the Nation for 100 years, starting with \nTeddy Roosevelt, that we should not do that. Under the Hagel amendment, \nit becomes the norm; it becomes standard procedure. Call up the union \nand say it is time for your $60,000. Call up a corporation and say it \nis time for your $60,000. I hope we do not go down that road.\n  I have been asked whether I think the Hagel bill is better than \nnothing at all. With all due respect to my colleague from Nebraska, \nthat is exactly how I feel. The Hagel amendment doesn't pass the \ncommonsense test. If there is one thing Americans have plenty of, it is \ncommon sense. We can't support the Hagel amendment and call the bill \nreform. If anybody wants to go home to their State to tell people that \nour answer to the soft money problem was to sanction soft money and \nensure that it lives forever, good luck. You will need it.\n  The Hagel bill also triples the hard money limits from the current \n$2,000 a donor can give a candidate per cycle. To most Americans, \n$2,000 is still a large sum of money; $2,000 is what an individual can \ngive to a single candidate in an election year under the current law. \nThey can give $1,000 in the primary and another $1,000 in the general \nelection. This bill is about closing loopholes that allow the \nwealthiest interests in our country to exert undue influence in our \npolitical system.\n  As I said before, it is only a first step to cleaning up the system. \nThere are many provisions we can consider down the road that affect our \ncampaigns. I know some in this body would like to increase the amounts \nthat donors can give to our campaigns. But a tripling of the hard money \nlimits, combined with a codification of the soft money system, is \nsimply beyond the pale. There is no way a bill that contains those two \nprovisions can be called reform.\n  Finally, what is most troubling about the Hagel amendment is that it \nallows corporations and unions to give directly to parties. That is \nwhat writing soft money into the law would achieve. It actually sends \nthe campaign finance laws back in time to the very beginning of the \n20th century before the Tillman Act banned direct corporate donations \nto the parties and before Taft-Hartley banned direct labor\n\n[[Page S2888]]\n\ncontributions to the parties. I know this is understood with the Hagel \namendment. People don't seem to give it a second thought.\n  I think it is worth pausing to consider just what a throwback the \nHagel amendment really is. How often do lawmaking bodies consciously \ndismantle reforms that have stood for nearly 100 years. The Hagel \namendment isn't just a codification of the soft money status quo; it is \nactually a step backward in time. Teddy Roosevelt signed the Tillman \nAct in 1907, in the days when the public was so concerned about the \npower of certain corporate interests, the power of railroads and the \ntrusts. It was a landmark reform that has helped to shape everything \nthat has come after it. It wrote into law the understanding, the most \nimportant part about this whole bill, that direct corporate \ncontributions to the parties create enormous potential for corruption. \nWith the stroke of a pen, Teddy Roosevelt wrote that into law and now \nwe are considering whether to write it out of the law.\n  I say to my colleagues, that would be a grave mistake and an \nembarrassment for this Senate. I hope my colleagues will take a careful \nlook at the amendment, and I hope the Senate will soundly reject it. \nThe Hagel amendment undermines McCain-Feingold in every conceivable \nway. McCain-Feingold bans soft money while Hagel makes sure we can have \nit forever, unlimited amounts through a loophole to the State parties.\n  Hagel combines the codification of soft money with a tripling of the \nhard money limits, allowing a couple to give $540,000 in donations to a \ngiven cycle. I almost can't say it without laughing at that amount of \nmoney.\n  Finally, the Hagel proposal would undue the ban on corporate and \nunion contributions to the parties that are at the very foundation of \nthe campaign finance reforms of the last 100 years.\n  There are some reform proposals in the Hagel bill that deserve some \nconsideration, but a vote for the Hagel amendment is simply a vote to \nunravel the most basic reforms of the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  The Hagel amendment would remove the ban on corporate and union \ncontributions to the parties, replacing it with a soft money system \nthat would have the Senate's stamp of approval. I urge my colleagues to \nthink about what it means to turn back the clock on the laws that \nprotect the integrity of this government.\n  This campaign finance debate is about moving forward, not going back. \nWe must defeat this amendment and bring this debate to a conclusion. It \nis time to pass real reform. The Hagel amendment must not be adopted.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As the manager of the bill on this side and a \nsupporter of the Hagel-Breaux amendment, I ask unanimous consent the \nlast 5 minutes prior to the vote be under my control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the Senate continues consideration of \ncampaign finance reform this week, I want to commend Senator Lott and \nSenator Daschle for their leadership in bringing this important issue \nbefore the Senate for a full and open debate. And I thank Senator \nMcCain and Senator Feingold for their commitment and hard work in \ncrafting meaningful, bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation.\n  The enormous amounts of special interest money that flood our \npolitical system have become a cancer in our democracy. The voices of \naverage citizens can barely be heard. Year after year, lobbyists and \nlarge corporations contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to \npolitical campaigns and dominate the airwaves with radio and TV ads \npromoting the causes of big business.\n  During the 2000 election cycle alone, according to Federal Election \nCommission records, businesses contributed a total of $1.2 billion to \npolitical campaigns. A recent Wall Street Journal article reported that \n$296 million, almost two-thirds of all ``soft money'' contributions \ngiven in the last election, came from just over 800 people each of whom \ngave an average of $120,000. With sums of money like this pouring into \nour political system, it's no surprise that the average American family \nearning $50,000 a year feels alienated from the system and questions \nwho's fighting for their interests.\n  The first step in cleaning-up our system is to close the gaping \nloophole that allows special interests to bypass existing contribution \nlimits and give huge sums of money directly to candidates and parties. \nThese so-called ``soft-money'' contributions have become increasingly \ninfluential in elections. From 1984 to 2000, soft money contributions \nhave sky-rocketed from $22 million to $463 million an increase of over \n2000%. We cannot restore accountability to our political system, until \nwe bring an end to soft money. McCain-Feingold does just that.\n  Another vital component of meaningful reform is ending special \ninterest gimmickry in campaign advertising. Today, corporations, \nwealthy individuals, and others can spend unlimited amounts of money \nrunning political ads as long as they do not ask people to vote for or \nagainst a candidate. These phony issue ads--which are often confusing \nand misleading--have become the weapon of choice in the escalating war \nof negative campaigning. The limits McCain-Feingold places on these ads \nwill help clean-up the system and make it more accountable to the \nAmerican people.\n  So far, all the Republican leadership in Congress and the President \nhave proposed is reforming the system to allow more money in politics, \nnot less. Increasing hard money contribution limits across-the-board \nand legalizing soft-money will not restore the public's confidence in \nour political system. Instead, it will only enhance the influence of \nbig corporations and other special interests.\n  What is even more troubling are Republican efforts to use campaign \nfinance reform as an excuse to silence working families and to prevent \ntheir unions from speaking up on the issues they care about. In the \n2000 election, corporations outspent labor unions 14-1, yet Republicans \nwould have us believe that muzzling unions--the voice for working \nfamilies is real campaign finance reform.\n  The reality is that the Republican amendments offered last week to \nregulate union dues are not reform, but revenge for the extraordinary \ngrassroots effort that the labor movement exerted in the last three \nPresidential campaigns. Fortunately, the Senate stood up for working \nfamilies by defeating these anti-union amendments.\n  For the first time in over two decades, the Senate has a real chance \nto meaningfully reform our campaign finance laws. We will learn a lot \nduring the debate this week about who is committed to real reform and \nwho is committed to maintaining the status quo.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I happen to be one who, along with Senator \nScott and Senator Stafford in 1974, offered public financing for House, \nSenate, and Presidential campaigns. That was in the wake of the \nWatergate financial scandals. The Senate took a good deal of time \ndebating those issues. We were successful in passing it. So we would \nhave had public financing for primaries for the House of \nRepresentatives, the Senate, and the Presidency.\n  In the course of those negotiations with the House of \nRepresentatives, we were unable to get movement in the House of \nRepresentatives. As a result, we eliminated the public financing for \nthe House and Senate and took a partial public financing for the \nPresidential elections, which is the basis of a good deal of the \nchallenge we are trying to face today.\n  I personally believe we are not going to get real reform until we \nhave a public financing program. Many people say--and I have heard it \nhere on the floor--if we do that, we are using the public's money in \npolitics and somehow this is evil and wrong. They say politics should \nnot include the public's money.\n  The tragic fact of the matter is that the public is paying for \ncampaigns, and they are paying for them every day with the large \nloopholes that are being written into our Tax Code day after day, year \nafter year, that are favoring many of the special interests that are \nmaking the largest campaign contributions.\n  We would save the American public, I believe, a good deal in terms of \ntheir taxes, should we move toward a public finance kind of system. \nThat is not the issue that is before the Senate now, but\n\n[[Page S2889]]\n\nI do believe that the steps that were included in the proposed \nlegislation before us provide for some progress. I intend to support \nit. I do believe that ultimately we are going to have to come to some \nform of system for public financing. I hope this will not require that \nwe have a change in the Constitution. There will be those who will \ndebate this issue this afternoon who think that is absolutely \nessential.\n  At this point, I do not support those changes, but we need to take \nthe necessary steps to address the larger issues, which I think will \ninclude public financing, in order to get a handle on this situation.\n  I am a strong believer that public officials ought to be accountable \nto the people, not to financial interests. We ought to have the debates \non the floor of the Senate and the House of Representatives with people \nwho are representing their own best judgment and the interest of their \nStates rather than--which I am afraid is too much the case--the \ninterests driven by special interests and the largest contributors.\n  Until we return to that kind of integrity in the financing of our \nelection system, we are going to have difficulty assuring the American \nelectorate that we are really meeting our responsibilities and have an \ninstitution that is of the people, by the people, and for the people, \nand responsive only to the people.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to refer to an article by \nDavid Tell which recently appeared in the March 26, 2001 edition of The \nWeekly Standard entitled ``Shut Up, They Explained.'' In it, Mr. Tell \nexplains the tenth amendment problems that would result from McCain-\nFeingold's federalization of State and local campaign activities, and \nhe notes the first amendment problems with the bill's restrictions on \noutside groups. This article begins:\n\n       This week and next, the U.S. Senate will consider \n     amendments to a piece of omnibus campaign finance reform \n     legislation--and then approve or reject the result by a \n     majority vote.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The substantive pretext for a soft-money prohibition has \n     always been deeply flawed. To pay for an expensive campaign \n     of nationwide image advertising, the 1996 Clinton-Gore \n     reelection effort organized an unprecedented harvest of soft-\n     money contributions to the Democratic National committee. \n     Eventually publicized, the scheme became infamous for its \n     abuses, responsibility for which the Democratic party was \n     thereafter eager to evade. The problem, they told us over and \n     over, was bipartisan: ``the system.'' And McCain-Feingold was \n     the reform that would make it go away. Except that all the \n     misdeeds charged to Clinton and Gore in 1996 were illegal \n     under existing law. And it was the irrationality of a \n     previous ``reform''--the suffocating donation and expenditure \n     limits imposed on publicly financed presidential campaigns--\n     that inspired those misdeeds in the first place. Soft money \n     per se had nothing to do with it.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Democratic and Republican parties exist to do more than \n     elect members of the House and Senate. They are national \n     organizations with major responsibilities, financial and \n     otherwise, to state and local affiliates that act on behalf \n     of candidates for literally thousands of non-federal \n     offices--in campaigns conducted according to non-federal \n     laws, most of which still permit direct party contributions \n     by businesses and unions. The McCain-Feingold soft-money ban \n     would criminalize those contributions by requiring that \n     virtually all state-party expenditures, during any election \n     in which even a single candidate for federal office appears \n     on the ballot, be made with money raised in strictly limited \n     increments, and only from individual donors. By unilaterally \n     federalizing all American electioneering practices, in other \n     words, the McCain-Feingold bill would violate our \n     Constitution's Tenth Amendment.\n       Even so stalwart a Democratic interest group as the AFL-CIO \n     has lately adopted some form of this argument. Since it \n     happens to be true, it would be nice to hear it echoed more \n     broadly.\n       As it would be nice to hear more widespread warnings about \n     a still more pernicious feature of the McCain-Feingold bill \n     as presently constituted: its harsh assault on independent \n     political activity by business, union, and non-profit issue \n     groups. Some sympathy is certainly due to congressmen and \n     senators who find themselves, late in a reelection campaign, \n     subjected to a televised barrage of soft-money-funded \n     criticism from such groups. Constrained by hard-money rules, \n     most incumbents are never able to respond at equal volume. \n     Nevertheless, this problem, real as it is, cannot possibly \n     justify the elaborate and draconian restrictions McCain-\n     Feingold seeks to impose on private citizens who might so \n     dare to criticize their elected officials: rules about whom \n     the critics are allowed to consult or hire before they open \n     their mouths in public, for example, and other rules about \n     what they can say, and with whose money, when they do.\n       An unbroken, quarter-century-long line of Supreme Court \n     jurisprudence makes clear: Under the First Amendment, all \n     this stuff is unconstitutional.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to refer to an article from November 15, \n1999 from The New Republic written by Professor John Mueller entitled \n``Well Off. Good riddance, McCain-Feingold.'' In it, Professor Mueller \nnotes that the influence of ``special interests'' in the democratic \nprocess is not ``a perversion of democracy,'' but ``it's the whole \npoint of it.'' He also notes that ``campaign finance reform'' will not \nbe able to stifle the special interests; if certain forms of political \nspeech are suppressed, citizens groups will simply use other methods.\n  The article begins:\n\n       Once upon a time, carping about campaign finance abuse was \n     mainly the province of Democrats.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       But it is the defenders of money in politics, the ones so \n     widely reviled in the elite press, who speak the truth about \n     campaign finance reform. In a democratic system of \n     government, there will always be some inequality of \n     influence. Yet that is not necessarily a flaw, and it is \n     rarely as debilitating to good government as reformers would \n     have you believe. When you dig beneath the rhetoric of \n     campaign finance reform, you discover that the ``reforms'' \n     being proposed would, in practice, constitute anything but an \n     improvement.\n       The essential complaint of reformers is that the present \n     system gives too much influence to so-called special interest \n     groups. This is also the most popular complaint. Who, after \n     all, supports special interests? Actually, we all should. \n     Democracy is distinguished from autocracy not as much by the \n     freedom of individual speech--many authoritarian governments \n     effectively allow individuals to petition for redress of \n     grievances and to complain to one another, which is some-\n     times called ``freedom of conversation''--as by the fact that \n     democracies allow people to organize in order to pursue their \n     political interests. So the undisciplined, chaotic, and \n     essentially unequal interplay of special interest groups that \n     reformers decry is not a perversion of democracy--it's the \n     whole point of it.\n       Nor is campaign finance reform likely to subdue special \n     interests. People and groups who seek to influence public \n     policy do so not for their own enjoyment but because they \n     really care about certain issues and programs. If reformers \n     somehow manage to reduce the impact of such groups in \n     election campaigns, these groups are very likely to find \n     other ways to seek favor and redress, no matter how clever \n     the laws that seek to inconvenience them are. For example, if \n     Congress prohibited soft money donations to political \n     parties--which is what the ill-fated McCain-Feingold bill \n     promised to do--special interests would merely spend more \n     money on their own advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts, \n     which are known in the political business as ``independent \n     expenditures.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       What makes the philosophy of campaign finance reform so \n     ironic is that the laws have such a poor track record of \n     rooting out the alleged abuses they are intended to \n     eliminate. In fact, many of the ills reformers now seek to \n     address are the byproducts of earlier attempts to clean up \n     the system.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Reformers of all stripes argue that political campaigns \n     cost too much. But the real question is, compared with what? \n     The entire cost of the 1996 elections was about 25 percent of \n     what Procter & Gamble routinely spends each year to market \n     its products. In what sense is this amount too much? Some \n     people do weary of the constant barrage of advertising at \n     election time, but democracy leaves them entirely free to \n     flip to another channel, the same method used so effectively \n     by anyone who would rather not learn about the purported \n     virtues of Crest toothpaste.\n       There is also the related gripe that the ever-increasing \n     need for donations means that politicians spend too much of \n     their time raising money. But much of this problem arises \n     from the absurdly low limit the reformers have placed on \n     direct campaign contributions. If anything, rather than \n     restricting soft money (as the McCain-Feingold bill would \n     have), it's time to raise or eliminate altogether the $1,000 \n     limit on individual contributions to candidates. Politicians \n     seem to find it politically incorrect to advocate this \n     sensible change, even though it would probably reduce the \n     amount of time they spend campaigning or campaign funds. \n     Getting rid of special interest influence by other means--\n     say, by regulating independent groups' expenditures--would \n     only work if reformers successfully dispensed with the right \n     to free speech. Since the advocacy of special interests is \n     the very stuff of the democratic process, the unintended goal \n     of the campaign reformers ultimately seems to be the repeal \n     of democracy itself.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to refer to an excerpt from an article by \nWashington Post columnist David Broder\n\n[[Page S2890]]\n\nthat ran on February 21 of this year entitled ``Campaign Reform: Labor \nTurns Leery.'' In it, Mr. Broder notes that Big Labor has echoed my \nconcerns about the unconstitutionality of the McCain-Feingold bill. \nSpecifically, Mr. Broder writes that:\n\n       Last week the AFL-CIO, which in the past had endorsed a ban \n     on soft money contributions, announced that it has serious \n     misgivings about other provisions of the McCain-Feingold \n     bill. Limiting ``issue ads'' that criticize candidates by \n     name--even if not calling specifically for their defeat--in \n     the period before an election would inhibit its ability to \n     communicate freely with union members, the memo said. Other \n     sections would make it impossible for labor to coordinate its \n     voter-turnout efforts with those candidates it supports. None \n     of these concerns is trivial. But they point up some of the \n     very same constitutional objections Mr. McConnell and other \n     opponents--including a variety of conservative groups and, \n     yes, the American Civil Liberties Union--have made for years.\n\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I would like to refer to another article by \nProfessor Kathleen Sullivan, professor of constitutional law and dean \nof Stanford Law School. This article is entitled ``Sleazy Ads? Or \nFlawed Rules?'' and appeared on March 8, 2000 in the New York Times. In \nthis article, Professor Sullivan notes the controversy that surrounded \nthe running of television ads last year by supporters of then-candidate \nGeorge W. Bush. She explains why the real problem with today's campaign \nfinance system is the quarter-century-old contribution limits, and that \nreal reform would be to raise these limits, bringing them into the 21st \ncentury. Specifically, Professor Sullivan notes:\n\n       Many have professed to be shocked, shocked that recent \n     television commercials attacking Senator John McCain's \n     environmental record turned out to be placed by Sam Wyly, a \n     wealthy Texas investor who has been a strong supporter of \n     Gov. George W. Bush.\n       Predictably, many have called for more campaign finance \n     reform to stop such stealth politics, and Senator McCain \n     filed a formal complaint on Monday with the Federal Election \n     Commission, alleging that the ads, though purportedly \n     independent, were in reality a contribution to the Bush \n     campaign that exceeded federal contribution limits.\n       Such calls for greater regulation of campaign donations, \n     however, ignore the real culprit in the story: the campaign \n     finance laws we already have. Why, after all, would any Bush \n     supporter go the trouble of running independent ads rather \n     than donating the money directly to the Bush campaign? And \n     why label the ads as paid for by Republicans for Clean Air, \n     rather than Friends of George W. Bush?\n       The answer is the contribution limits that Congress imposed \n     in the wake of Watergate and that the Supreme Court has \n     upheld ever since. The court held that the First Amendment \n     forbids limits on political expenditures by candidates or \n     their independent supporters, but upheld limits on the amount \n     anyone may contribute to a political campaign.\n       The result: political money tries to find a way not to look \n     like a contribution to a political campaign. Unregulated \n     money to the parties--so-called soft money--and deceptive \n     independent ads are the unintended consequence of campaign \n     finance reform itself.\n       This result is not only unintended but undemocratic. \n     Contribution limits drive political money away from the \n     candidates, who are accountable to the people at the voting \n     booth toward the parties and independent organizations, which \n     are not.\n       If Governor Bush places sleazy ads misleading the voters \n     about Senator McCain's record on clean air, voters can \n     express their outrage through their votes. No similar \n     retribution can be visited on private billionaires who decide \n     to place ads themselves.\n       The answer is not to enlist the election commission to \n     sniff out any possible ``coordination'' between the \n     advertisers and the official campaign, or to calculate \n     whether the ads implicitly supported Mr. Bush.\n       It is unseemly in a democracy for government bureaucrats to \n     police the degrees of separation between politicians and \n     their supporters. And it is contrary to free-speech \n     principles for unelected censors to decide when an \n     advertisement might actually incite voters to vote. What \n     else, after all, is political speech supposed to do?\n       The solution is simple: removal of contribution limits, \n     full disclosure and more speech. If it had been clear from \n     the outset that the dirty ads on dirty air had come from Mr. \n     Wyly, a principal bankroller of the Bush campaign, the voters \n     could have discounted them immediately--with vigorous help \n     from the vigilant press and the McCain campaign. A \n     requirement that political ads state their sources clearly is \n     far less offensive to free-speech principles than a rule that \n     the ad may not run at all.\n       Better yet, the removal of contribution limits would \n     eliminate the need for stealth advertising in the first \n     place. If Mr.. Wyly could have given the money he spent on \n     the television spots directly to the Bush campaign, the \n     campaign alone would have been held responsible for any \n     misleading information that might have been put out. And such \n     accountability would have made it less likely that such ads \n     would have run at all.\n       As it turned out, Senator McCain was able to use the Wyly \n     commercials to attack Governor Bush's campaign tactics. So, \n     in the end, who gained more from the flap? All Mr. McCain \n     really needed to preserve his competitive edge was the First \n     Amendment, which protects his right to swing freely in the \n     political ring. The people are far more discerning than \n     campaign finance reformers often give then credit for; they \n     can sift out the truth from the cacophony.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to indicate that if I were present \nlast Friday, March 23, I would have voted ``yes'' on the motion to \ntable amendment No. 141, to the campaign finance reform bill, offered \nby Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina.\n  I was unable to participate in Friday's session because I flew home \nto Seattle to attend the funeral services for Grace Cole. Grace served \non the Shoreline School Board for 13 years and represented North \nSeattle in the Washington House of Representatives for 15 years.\n  Grace was my mentor and led the way for advocates like me to follow \nher from the local school board to the Washington State legislature. \nGrace made a difference for thousands of families throughout our State \nby standing up for education, the environment and social justice.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to announce that I was unable \nto cast a vote on rollcall vote No. 47, due to unavoidable airline \ndelays.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue that came to \nlight at the close of business last week in an article that appeared in \nthe New York Times by Robert Pear, ``Bush's Budget Would Cut Three \nPrograms to Aid Children.'' It goes on to describe child care, child \nabuse programs, early learning programs, and children's hospitals that \nwould receive significant cuts in the President's budget proposal when \nthat proposal arrives.\n  We haven't seen the budget yet. My hope is that maybe the \nadministration might reconsider these numbers that we are told are \naccurate. I tried to corroborate this story with several sources, and \nwhile no one wants to step up and be heard publicly on it, no one has \nalso said that the numbers are wrong. I suspect they are correct.\n  The President campaigned on the promise to leave no child behind. If \nwe heard it once, we heard that campaign slogan dozens and dozens of \ntimes all across the country. I don't recall seeing the President \ncampaigning when he didn't have that banner behind him saying: Leave no \nchild behind.\n  Those of us who took the President at his word were shocked, to say \nthe very least, by the news on Friday that the President intends to cut \nfunding for critical children's programs, programs that address basic \nsurvival needs of these young people and their families.\n  Certainly his actions beg the question, when he pledged to leave no \nchild behind, which children did he mean? Apparently not abused and \nneglected children, since he would cut funding for child abuse \nprevention and treatment by almost 20 percent.\n  Almost 900,000 children are victims of child abuse each year in \nAmerica. Is the President going to ask those children to choose amongst \nthemselves which 20 percent of them shouldn't have their abuse \ninvestigated? Is he going to ask them to decide which 20 percent are \ngoing to have their abusers brought to justice?\n  When the President promised to leave no child behind, he must not \nhave meant sick children. The President would cut funding for \nchildren's hospitals by some unspecified ``large'' amount. I am quoting \nfrom the story. This funding, which supports the training of doctors \nwho care for the most seriously ill children in our country, had\n\n[[Page S2891]]\n\ntremendous bipartisan support when it was first appropriated last year. \nA cut in this program of any size would be a huge step back for \nchronically ill children and their families.\n  When the President promised to leave no child behind, he must not \nhave meant the thousands of children who are warehoused every year in \nunsafe child care settings. He is proposing to cut child care funding \nby $200 million and to cut all $20 million for the funding of the new \nearly learning program sponsored by Senator Stevens of Alaska and \nSenator Kennedy of Massachusetts. If the President's proposed cuts \nprevail, 60,000 families with babies and toddlers will be denied child \ncare assistance. At a time when our goal is to give low-income working \nfamilies the support they need to stay off welfare, such a proposal is \nunfathomable in my mind.\n  The President justifies these cuts by saying that instead families \nwill get tax breaks. Allow me to point out a few reasons why I find \nthis justification wrongheaded.\n  First, this answer conveniently ignores the fact that 43 percent of \nthe tax cut, as we all know, goes to the top 1 percent of the \nwealthiest families in America, not usually the families who have the \nbiggest problem finding affordable child care or getting good health \ncare when their children are sick.\n\n  Secondly, while tax cuts when done in a fair and responsible way can \nbe helpful, they are not the panacea for children's needs. The last \ntime I checked, tax cuts didn't prevent child abuse or make child care \nsafer or make sick children well. The last time I checked, there were \nproven programs in place, enacted with bipartisan support in this body \nand the other Chamber, that were addressing those very problems. Yet \nthese are the very programs the President has decided apparently to \ncut.\n  The President described himself as a compassionate conservative. Yet \nevery day, with every action over the past 2 months, the evidence seems \nto be mounting that while he is long on conservatism, he seems a little \nshort on compassion at this point.\n  Next week the Senate will take up the budget resolution, our \nblueprint for spending for next year. It is my fervent hope and my \nintention that these are the kinds of issues we will air and that, with \nthe choices I will be asking us to make, we will have a chance to \nrestore some of this funding when those proposals come up. If they are \npresently included at the levels that have been suggested, I will be \noffering appropriate language to address them.\n  I can't help but notice the presence of my friend from Pennsylvania \non the floor, who I know is here to address the matter before the \nSenate, the Hollings proposal. I thanked him in his absence, and I \nthank him publicly. It was the Senator from Pennsylvania who last year, \nwhen the child care funding levels were going to be raised to full \nfunding of $2 billion, made that happen.\n  He and I have worked on these issues for 20 years together, from the \ndays when we first identified the issue and then crafted the \nlegislation. In fact, Senator Hatch, who will be coming to the floor \nshortly, was the original cosponsor with me of the child care \ndevelopment block grant program.\n  When I express my disappointment, I don't do so in a partisan way \nbecause I have worked closely over the years with Members who \nunderstand the value of decent child care and the value of children's \nhospitals, the value of early learning, as Senator Stevens of Alaska \nhas, as champion of that particular issue.\n  My hope is that the administration, in the days remaining before they \nsubmit the budget to Congress, will listen to some of us who urge them \nto take a second look at these issues before sending us a budget \nproposal that sets the clock back at a time when we need to be doing \nmore for families who are struggling to hold their families together to \nmake ends meet.\n  I didn't mean to raise the name of the Senator from Pennsylvania \nparticularly, but I saw him and I wanted to thank him for the \ntremendous work he has done on these issues over the years.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an editorial entitled \n``The Mask Comes Off,'' by Bob Herbert.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 26, 2001]\n\n                           The Mask Comes Off\n\n                            (By Bob Herbert)\n\n       Is this what the electorate wanted?\n       Did Americans really want a president who would smile in \n     the faces of poor children even as he was scheming to cut \n     their benefits? Did they want a man who would fight like \n     crazy for enormous tax cuts for the wealthy while cutting \n     funds for programs to help abused and neglected kids?\n       Is that who George W. Bush turned out to be?\n       An article by The Times's Robert Pear disclosed last week \n     that President Bush will propose cuts in the already modest \n     funding for child care assistance for low-income families. \n     And he will propose cuts in funding for programs designed to \n     investigate and combat child abuse. And he wants cuts in an \n     important new program to train pediatricians and other \n     doctors at children's hospitals across the U.S.\n       The cuts are indefensible, unconscionable. If implemented, \n     they will hurt many children.\n       The president also plans to cut off all of the money \n     provided by Congress for an ``early learning'' trust fund, \n     which is an effort to improve the quality of child care and \n     education for children under 5.\n       What's going on?\n       That snickering you hear is the sound of Mr. Bush recalling \n     the great fun he had playing his little joke on the public \n     during the presidential campaign. He presented himself as a \n     different kind of Republican, a friend to the downtrodden, \n     especially children. He hijacked the copyrighted solgagn of \n     the liberal Children's Defense Fund, and then repeated the \n     slogan like a mantra, telling anyone who would listen that \n     his administration would ``leave no child behind.''\n       Mr. Bush has only been president two months and already \n     he's leaving the children behind.\n       There are many important reasons to try to expand the \n     accessibility of child care. One is that stable child care \n     for low-income families has become a cornerstone of \n     successful efforts to move people from welfare to work.\n       Members of Congress had that in mind when they allocated $2 \n     billion last year for the Child Care and Development Block \n     Grant. That was an increase of $817 million, enabling states \n     to provide day care to 241,000 additional children.\n       Now comes Mr. Bush with a proposal to cut the program by \n     $200 million.\n       Is that his idea of compassion?\n       The simple truth is that the oversized tax cuts and Mr. \n     Bush's devotion to the ideologues and the well-heeled special \n     interests that backed his campaign are playing havoc with the \n     real-world interests not just of children, but of most \n     ordinary Americans.\n       Mr. Bush is presiding over a right-wing juggernaut that has \n     already reneged on his campaign pledge to regulate carbon \n     dioxide emissions (an important step in the fight against \n     global warming); that has repealed a set of workplace safety \n     rules that were designed to protect tens of millions of \n     Americans but were opposed as too onerous by business groups; \n     that has withdrawn new regulations requiring a substantial \n     reduction in the permissible levels of arsenic, a known \n     carcinogen, in drinking water; and that has (to the loud \n     cheers of the most conservative elements in the G.O.P.) ended \n     the American Bar Association's half-century-old advisory role \n     in the selection of federal judges, thus making it easier to \n     appoint judges with extreme right-wing sensibilities.\n       The administration of George W. Bush, in the words of the \n     delighted Edwin J. Feulner, president of the conservative \n     Heritage Foundation, is ``more Reaganite than the Reagan \n     administration.''\n       Grover Norquist, a leading conservative strategist, said \n     quite frankly, ``There isn't an us and them with this \n     administration. They is us. We is them.''\n       Mr. Bush misled the public during his campaign. He eagerly \n     donned the costume of the compassionate conservative and \n     deliberately gave the impression that if elected we would \n     lead a moderate administration that would govern, as much as \n     possible, in a bipartisan manner.\n       Last October, in the second presidential debate, Mr. Bush \n     declared, ``I'm really strongly committed to clean water and \n     clean air and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges, like \n     global warming.''\n       And he said, as usual, ``No child should be left behind in \n     America.''\n       He said all the right things. He just didn't mean them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/26/senate-section/article/S2891-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2891-S2892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     ADMINISTRATION DECISION REGARDING THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am disturbed by the Bush Administration's \nannouncement last week that he will eliminate the American Bar \nAssociation's essential role in reviewing and providing advice on the \nqualifications of potential judges before those nominations are sent to \nthe Senate for confirmation.\n  For the past 53 years the American Bar Association has played a \ncritical role in the judicial nominations process by evaluating \npotential candidates,\n\n[[Page S2892]]\n\nfirst for the Senate in 1948, and then in 1952 for President Dwight D. \nEisenhower and his eight successors, Democrat and Republican. The ABA's \n15-member Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary has examined the \ncandidates' experience and legal writings and then confidentially \ninterviewed judges and lawyers who have worked with the candidates in \norder to assess their professional reputation.\n  President Eisenhower's motivation for seeking the ABA's \nrecommendations is precisely the reason I am disturbed by the Bush \nAdministration's move to skewer the ABA's role in screening new judges: \nPresident Eisenhower sought to insulate the judicial nomination process \nfrom political pressures by inviting the American Bar Association to \ngive him ratings of candidates' professional qualifications. Over the \nyears the ABA's assessments of judicial nominees have been invaluable, \nand I for one do not support the Bush Administration's retreat from \ninjecting more, not less, information about the competency, \ntemperament, and integrity of the potential judges into the nominations \nprocess.\n  Until this year, the bar association has been given advance word from \nthe administration on potential judges. The ABA's special team of \nlawyers has been able to analyze the candidates' career, assess their \nprofessional reputation, and rate the prospective nominees as \nqualified, well qualified, or not qualified. This process is totally \nconfidential and enables the colleagues of nominees to answer the \nquestions fairly and honestly.\n  The White House's decision not to release the names of potential \njudges to the ABA before they are announced to the public is a tragedy. \nThe nomination process will be severely impaired by President Bush's \ndecision. With this move, the President has lost the opportunity to \nlearn as much as possible about nominees early on in the nominations \nprocess.\n  What I fear most and what I believe will happen is that public \nconfidence in the judicial nominations process will fade. And I'd point \nout, that confidence in the judicial system and in the objectivity of \nthe court is imperative in the wake of the 5-4 Supreme Court ruling \nthat determined the outcome of the last Presidential election. I would \nexpect President Bush to work diligently to disabuse the country of the \nnotion that the law is a subset of politics, not serve to reinforce \nthat impression.\n  It is my belief that President Bush's decision signals a retreat from \nimpartiality in the judicial nomination process. No longer will the \nPresident be troubled with the objective recommendations of the ABA, \nbut will be free to nominate whichever candidates pass political \nmuster. The ABA vetting process is important to reassure the public \nthat selecting judges for the federal bench is not just the work of a \nsmall inner-circle of politicians and advisors who are looking for a \nperson of a certain political persuasion.\n  The White House legal team has already interviewed nearly 60 lawyers \nfor new judgeships and has done so without consulting the ABA. Most of \nthe interviews undertaken so far have been for the 29 vacancies on the \ncourts of appeal, which as you know Mr. President, is the level just \nbelow the Supreme Court. I don't want to return to the days before the \nABA was brought into the process to make it more fair and objective, \nbut I fear that's exactly where we have ended up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/26/senate-section/article/S2892-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

BARRY AND JERRY O'CONNOR\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I congratulate Ed Hill, the new \npresident of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, IBEW, \non his election, and thank the outgoing president, J.J. ``Jack'' Barry, \nfor his years of dedicated service to IBEW.\n  When I think about all the hard work and long hours presidents Hill \nand Barry have put in over the years, I am reminded of a story that one \nof my heroes, the great Hubert H. Humphrey liked to tell.\n  It was Humphrey's 65th birthday, and he was celebrating with his \ngrandchildren. One of the grandkids looked up and said, ``Grandpa, how \nlong have you been a Democrat?''\n  Humphrey thought about that for a moment, and replied, ``Well, I've \nbeen a Democrat for 70 years.''\n  His grandson said, ``Grandpa, how could you have been a Democrat for \n70 years when you're only 65 years old?''\n  ``Easy,'' Humphrey answered, ``I've put in a lot of overtime.''\n  Well, these men have put in a lot of overtime on behalf of the IBEW \nand on behalf of all Americans.\n  You know, I like to tell people, you go to any town in America, rural \nor urban, big or small, and you'll see the IBEW's work on display. \nWhether it's lighting our homes, or heating our schools, or bringing \nthe Internet to our libraries, it's clear that the IBEW's work is \ncritical to our families and our economy.\n  I welcome the new leadership and express my gratitude to the outgoing \nleadership.\n  Ed Hill hails from Beaver County, PA, and he has a long history with \nthe IBEW. Ed joined IBEW Local 712 in his hometown back in 1956 and \nworked his way up to business manager in 1970. He became part of the \nIBEW staff in 1982, and, by 1994, he was a Vice President in charge of \noperations in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Delaware.\n  In 1997, Ed became the IBEW's second highest-ranking officer, and he \nworked hard to bring the latest technology to IBEW's operations. He \nalso spent long hours building the membership of IBEW-COPE to record \nlevels and making new strides in grassroots activism and \ncommunications.\n  Ed is a talented leader, and he has a strong foundation to build on. \nIBEW's outgoing president, J.J. Barry, had a long, impressive tenure at \nthe IBEW. Jack is from Syracuse, NY and joined Local 43 in Syracuse in \n1943. He served on the executive board and became business manager in \n1962. In 1968, he began serving as International Representative and \nthen, in 1976, became International vice president of the third \ndistrict which includes New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and \nDelaware.\n  Jack was a virtuoso organizer, and during his tenure, he began a \nnumber of important, new initiatives in education and training for IBEW \nmembers. He was widely respected and honored throughout this country \nand around the world for his outstanding work. While I will miss him in \nhis position as president, I look forward to working with him in a new \ncapacity in the coming years.\n  I also recognize Jerry O'Connor who was appointed to take Ed's place \nas IBEW secretary-treasurer. Jerry has been on the IBEW staff since \n1987 and has served as International vice president of the IBEW's sixth \ndistrict covering Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin \nsince 1995. He was initiated into IBEW Local 701 in Wheaton, IL in \n1959, and he served his local as business manager-financial secretary \nfrom 1978 until he joined the IBEW staff. I look forward to working \nwith him in his new position.\n  For over 100 years, the IBEW has been a leader in the union movement \nin America. Whether they were providing energy to our war efforts \nduring World War II, creating one of the best apprenticeship programs \naround, or providing workers with the cutting edge skills they need to \nkeep up with current electricity needs, IBEW was always ahead of the \ntimes.\n  I know that the newest generation of IBEW leadership will continue \nthis\n\n[[Page S2893]]\n\nproud tradition. I thank them for their dedication and commitment, and \nI look forward to working with them in the coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/26/senate-section/article/S2893-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE LATE LT. GEN JAMES T. CALLAGHAN\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, on my last trip to Indiana, I \nreceived news that a trusted friend and a great American, Jim \nCallaghan, had died. I was pleased to have had the time to call at the \nfuneral home and spend some time with the Callaghan family and would \nlike to take a moment here, with my friend Senator Bayh to pay tribute \nto Lieutenant General James T. Callaghan.\n  I came to know the General after he retired from the Air Force and \nsettled in Indianapolis in 1993. He was a valuable member of my Service \nAcademy Merit Selection Committee for the last several years and \nthrough those efforts I gained a great respect for this man who had \ngiven so much for his country, and yet wanted to give more of himself \nand ensure that the armed services that he had served so loyally for 34 \nyears continued to flourish with the best officer candidates Indiana \ncould produce.\n  I think to gain a full appreciation of this man's dedication and \nservice to the United States of America and the United States Air \nForce, I have to describe a litany of duty stations, qualifications, \nand awards. I quote liberally from his active duty Air Force bio:\n  General Callaghan was born in Chicago in 1938 and grew up there. He \ngraduated from the University of Detroit in 1959 where he was also \ncommissioned through the ROTC program. He received a masters from The \nGeorge Washington University in 1971 and was further educated at the \nNaval War College the National War College and the University of \nHouston.\n  Following pilot training and follow-on instructor duty at Laredo AFB, \nTX and duty with the 6th Fighter Squadron at Eglin AFB. The air force \npilot set off for Vietnam in 1966, flying in more than 425 combat \nmissions in Southeast Asia. He returned from Vietnam in October 1967, \nto staff assignments in Washington DC.\n  F-4's were next, and in 1975 he joined the 50th Tactical Fighter Wing \nat Hahn Air Base, West Germany, eventually rising to command the 86th \nTactical Fighter Group based at Ramstein. In 1979, after War College, \nhe joined the Joint Staff's Operations Directorate and in June 1981 \nbecame deputy director for regional plans and policy and director of \nthe Ground-Launched Cruise Missile Planning Group in the Directorate of \nPlans, Air Force headquarters.\n  From 1983 to 1986 General Callaghan was commandant of the Air Force \nInstitute of Technology and of the Defense Institute of Security \nAssistance Management, both located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, \nOH. His next assignments were in Korea, including chief of staff of the \nU.N. Command and of the Republic of Korea/U.S. Combined Forces Command, \nSeoul.\n  In July 1988, the general was transferred back to Germany, and \nassumed the duties of director, plans and policy, Headquarters U.S. \nEuropean Command, in Stuttgart. His last active duty assignment was as \ncommander, Allied Air Forces Southern Europe, and deputy commander in \nchief, U.S. Air Forces in Europe for the Southern Area, with \nheadquarters in Naples, Italy from December 1990 until his retirement \nin January 1993, which put him in command of the northern area of \noperations in Operation Desert Shield and Storm and subsequently \nNorthern Watch.\n  The general, a command pilot with more than 4,500 flying hours was \ndecorated with the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, Distinguished \nService Medal, Silver Star, Defense Superior Service Medal with oak \nleaf cluster, Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, Distinguished \nFlying Cross, Bronze Star Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with oak \nleaf cluster, Air Medal with 16 oak leaf clusters, Air Force \nCommendation Medal and Army Commendation Medal. General Callaghan also \nwears the Parachutist Badge with bronze star. The bronze star was \nawarded for his combat jump in Vietnam in February 1967 while serving \nas air liaison officer to the 173rd Airborne Brigade.\n  Over the last 8 years, Jim served in a number of civic organizations, \nthe American Legion, the Air Force Association, the Order of \nDaedalians, and the Indy 500 Festival Memorial Service Committee. He is \nsurvived by his wife, Ann, his sons James T. the third, and D. \nChristian; his daughter Elizabeth Cooke; his mother Ruth Callaghan; his \nbrothers John, William, Michael and Patrick and his sister Ruth \nTushkowski. He and Ann have six grandchildren.\n  In closing, let me add that the while the works of men like General \nCallaghan often go unheralded, it is because they do not seek the \nlimelight. As I speak these words today, I think the General would want \nme to make mention of the men and women with whom he served and who \nworked for him during his 34 years of service, those still on active \nduty and the many veterans and retirees who have served, to whom we owe \na great debt of thanks for the peace and freedoms we enjoy today. So, \nas I salute General Callaghan today, on his behalf I salute his \nservice, the United States Air Force and all those who have worn the \nuniform of the United States Armed Forces.\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today along with my senior \ncolleague, Senator Richard Lugar, to honor the life of a fellow Hoosier \nand distinguished veteran of the United States Air Force, Lieutenant \nGeneral James T. Callaghan, who recently passed away.\n  As those who knew Lt. Gen. Callaghan can attest, his strong \ncommitment to his country is reflected in his long and distinguished \nservice in the Air Force. Over his career, which spanned more than \nthree decades, he served with valor in the Vietnam and Gulf Wars. \nDuring his service he received many combat awards, including the Silver \nStar, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Bronze Star.\n  In the late 1980s, Lt. Gen. Callaghan commanded U.S. air troops in \nKorea and later during the Gulf War, he served as the southern \ncommander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Allied Air \nForces. Lt. Gen. Callaghan exhibited extraordinary bravery and \nexceptional leadership on the eve of the Gulf war. He personally flew a \ntest combat mission that night in an effort to assess the situation \nbefore committing his young troops to battle.\n  In addition to his combat service, Lt. Gen. Callaghan aided the U.S. \nArmed Forces in many other capacities. He served as president of the \nAir Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, \nas director of plans and policy for the U.S./European Command, and also \nheld several high-ranking positions at the Pentagon.\n  After retiring from the Air Force in 1993, Lt. Gen. Callaghan \ncontinued his service to his country and fellow citizens. He worked \nwith many organizations in the Indianapolis area, most notably the \nIndianapolis 500 Festival Memorial Service Committee and Senator \nLugar's Military Academy Merit Selection Board.\n  Lt. Gen. James T. Callaghan was a true hero that the State of Indiana \nand nation will miss tremendously. Senator Lugar and I commend the late \nLt. Gen. James T. Callaghan for his lifelong service to our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/26/senate-section/article/S2893-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2893-S2894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNITION OF FT.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \noutstanding achievement of three of North Carolina's military bases.\n  On Friday, Secretary Rumsfield announced the winners of the 2001 \nCommander in Chief's Awards for Installation Excellence. Of the five \nawards, three went to bases in North Carolina.\n  Ft.

The men and \nwomen who live and work at North Carolina's military installations put \ntheir country's interest ahead of their own each and everyday. These \nbases\n\n[[Page S2894]]\n\nhave also worked hard to forge strong relationships with their \ncommunities.

KENNELLY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievements of the E.B. Kennelly School, a public elementary school in \nHartford, CT. I recently visited the Kennelly School and was truly \nimpressed with the progress the school has made in improving the \neducational standards in recent years.\n  The Hartford School System has faced some difficult challenges in the \npast decade, including declining test scores, low parental involvement, \nand high poverty rates among its student population. In recent years, \nthe faculty and staff of the Kennelly School, led by principal Dr. Zoe \nAthanson, have brought the school up to such high standards that it has \ncompleted a voluntary accreditation process for elementary schools \nthrough the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. This has \nmade the Kennelly School one of two Hartford schools to become the \nfirst fully accredited elementary schools in a large city in the State \nof Connecticut. Through hard work, dedication, and an unwavering \ncommitment to the students, the Kennelly School has demonstrated that \ncity schools are able to achieve the same academic standards as their \nsuburban counterparts, often against greater odds. The achievements of \nthe Kennelly School serve as a model for troubled school systems \nthroughout the country. With a commitment to excellence, anything is \npossible.\n  The people of Connecticut applaud the E.B. Kennelly School for its \naccomplishments. As the Kennelly School approaches its 100th \nAnniversary, we wish them much continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/26/senate-section/article/S2894-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated on March 22, 2001:\n\n       EC-1123.

A bill to close loopholes in the firearms laws which allow \nthe unregulated manufacture, assembly, shipment, or transportation of \nfirearms or firearm parts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Gun Parts \nTrafficking Act.\n  For years, I have fought along with many of my colleagues against the \ngun violence that has plagued America. We have sought to keep firearms \nfrom the hands of children and those who would use them to do harm. \nAfter long debate, we succeeded in enacting a ban on assault weapons, \nas well as the Brady bill requiring a criminal background at the time \nof a firearms purchase, positive steps in the effort to protect our \ncommunities from gun violence.\n  Gun violence, however, continues to have a devastating impact on our \nNation. The statistics have been well documented, but bear repeating. \nIn 1997 alone, more than 32,000 Americans were shot and killed. \nFourteen children die\n\n[[Page S2896]]\n\nfrom gunfire every day. The economic toll of firearms deaths and \ninjuries on our country, $33 billion each year, is astronomical.\n  In light of these staggering figures it seems obvious that we must do \nmore, including regulating guns like any other consumer product. But \nwhile we look forward, we must also be mindful of attempts by some to \nsubvert the progress we have made.\n  Some gun dealers are exploiting a loophole in current law that allows \nthem to sell, through the U.S. mail, gun kits containing virtually \nevery single item needed to build an automatic weapon. When we enacted \na ban on these deadly automatic weapons, we exempted automatic weapons \nlegally owned prior to the ban. We also allowed replacement parts to be \nlegally sold so that these grand-fathered weapons could be repaired by \ntheir owners, and we allowed these parts to be shipped through the \nmail.\n  These provisions, however, have been exploited and replacement part \nkits that can convert a legally owned firearm into an illegal automatic \nweapon are readily available and heavily advertised in numerous \npublications. Some of these kits even go so far as to provide a \ntemplate that shows how to make this conversion. This is a flagrant \neffort to evade the laws of the United States. This activity must be \nstopped in order to maintain the integrity of our ban on assault \nweapons and protect our communities from gun violence.\n  To that end, I am reintroducing the Gun Parts Trafficking Act, \nlegislation that I first introduced in the 106th Congress. This bill is \ndesigned to close the loopholes in existing law and end the sale of \nkits designed to convert legally owned firearms into illegal automatic \nweapons. It will expand the definition of ``firearm'' to include the \nmain components of the weapon and will prohibit the manufacture or \nassembly of guns by an individual who does not have a license to do so.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the ``Gun Parts \nTrafficking Act'' and ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 609\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide grants to law enforcement agencies to \npurchase firearms needed to perform law enforcement duties; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President today I introduce a bill that will \nreduce the number of firearms on the street and help keep guns out of \nthe hands of criminals. In the wake of the tragic shooting this year \noutside of San Diego, we are reminded of what happens when the wrong \npeople have access to guns. Such tragic shootings become even more \ntroubling when they involve a former police gun or firearms previously \ninvolved in a crime.\n  It is vital that law enforcement agencies have the very best \nequipment available to ensure their safety and to protect America's \ncommunities, but purchasing new weapons can be expensive, particularly \nfor smaller cash-strapped municipalities. Thus, to offset the costs of \npurchasing new weapons, law enforcement agencies have often in the last \ntwo decades either sold their old guns to dealers or auctioned them off \nto the public. However, this practice has led to an unintended result, \nincreased risk that these guns would end up back on the streets and in \nthe hands of criminals.\n  In the past 10 years, firearms once used by law enforcement agencies \nhave been involved in more than 3,000 crimes throughout the United \nStates, including 293 homicides, 301 assaults, and 279 drug-related \ncrimes. In 1999, Bufford Furrow, a white supremacist, used a Glock \npistol that was decommissioned and sold by a police agency in the State \nof Washington to terrorize and shoot children at a Jewish community \ncenter in Los Angeles and then kill a postal worker. Members of the \nLatin Kings, a violent Chicago street gang, used guns formerly owned by \nthe Miami-Dade Police Department in Florida to commit violent crimes in \nIllinois. And a 1996 investigation by the New York State inspector \ngeneral found that weapons used by New York law enforcement officers \nhad been used in crimes in at least two other States.\n  It is time that we help our law enforcement agencies do what they are \ntrying to do--get out of the business of selling guns. With the help of \nthe bill I am introducing, law enforcement agencies will no longer be \nforced to resell their old guns or guns seized from criminals to help \nthem obtain the new weapons that are necessary to carry out their \nduties. Instead, this bill would provide grants to State or local law \nenforcement agencies to assist them in purchasing new firearms. In \norder to receive these grants, the law enforcement agencies must simply \nagree to either destroy their decommissioned guns or not sell them to \nthe public.\n  A growing number of States and cities have already decided to ban the \npractice of pouring old police guns into the consumer market. They \nrecognize that the extra money gained from selling old police guns is \nnot worth the possibility that those guns would contribute to \nadditional suffering or loss of life. It is simply bad public policy \nfor governments to be suppliers of guns and potentially add to the \nproblem of gun violence in America. Regardless of where one stands on \ngun control, logic, common sense, and decency demand that we also \nrecognize this simple truth and unite behind moving this bill to \npassage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 610\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Police Gun Buyback \n     Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Buford Furrow, a white supremacist, used a Glock pistol \n     decommissioned and sold by a law enforcement agency in the \n     State of Washington, to shoot children at a Jewish community \n     center in Los Angeles and kill a postal worker.\n       (2) Twelve firearms were recently stolen during shipment \n     from the Miami-Dade Police Department to Chicago, Illinois. \n     Four of these firearms have been traced to crimes in Chicago, \n     Illinois, including a shooting near a playground.\n       (3) In the past 9 years, decommissioned firearms once used \n     by law enforcement agencies have been involved in more than \n     3,000 crimes, including 293 homicides, 301 assaults, and 279 \n     drug-related crimes.\n       (4) Many State and local law enforcement departments also \n     engage in the practice of reselling firearms that were \n     involved in the commission of a crime and confiscated. Often \n     these firearms are assault weapons that were in circulation \n     prior to the restrictions imposed by the Violent Crime \n     Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.\n\n[[Page S2897]]\n\n       (5) Law enforcement departments in the States of New York \n     and Georgia, the City of Chicago, and other localities have \n     adopted the practice of destroying decommissioned firearms.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to reduce the \n     number of firearms on the streets by assisting State and \n     local law enforcement agencies in eliminating the practice of \n     transferring decommissioned firearms to any person.\n\n      SEC. 3. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n       (a) Grants.--The Attorney General may make grants to States \n     or units of local government--\n       (1) to assist States and units of local government in \n     purchasing new firearms without transferring decommissioned \n     firearms to any person; and\n       (2) to destroy decommissioned firearms.\n       (b) Eligibility.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), to be \n     eligible to receive a grant under this Act, a State or unit \n     of local government shall certify that it has in effect a law \n     or official policy that--\n       (A) eliminates the practice of transferring any \n     decommissioned firearm to any person; and\n       (B) provides for the destruction of a decommissioned \n     firearm.\n       (2) Exception.--A State or unit of local government may \n     transfer a decommissioned firearm to a law enforcement \n     agency.\n       (c) Use of Funds.--A State or unit of local government that \n     receives a grant under this Act shall only use that grant to \n     purchase new firearms.\n\n      SEC. 4. APPLICATIONS.\n\n       (a) State Applications.--To request a grant under this Act, \n     the chief executive of a State shall submit an application, \n     signed by the Attorney General of the State requesting the \n     grant, to the Attorney General in such form and containing \n     such information as the Attorney General may reasonably \n     require.\n       (b) Local Applications.--To request a grant under this Act, \n     the chief executive of a unit of local government shall \n     submit an application, signed by the chief law enforcement \n     officer in the unit of local government requesting the grant, \n     to the Attorney General in such form and containing such \n     information as the Attorney General may reasonably require.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide that the reduction in social security benefits which are \nrequired in the case of spouses and surviving spouses who are also \nreceiving certain Government pensions shall be equal to the amount by \nwhich two-thirds of the total amount of the combined monthly benefit \n(before reduction) and monthly pension exceeds $1,200, adjusted for \ninflation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue that \nis very important to me, very important to my constituents in Maryland \nand very important to government workers and retirees across the \nNation. I am reintroducing a bill to modify a cruel rule of government \nthat is unfair and prevents current workers from enjoying the benefits \nof their hard work during retirement.\n  Under current law, a Social Security spousal benefit is reduced or \nentirely eliminated if the surviving spouse is eligible for a pension \nfrom a local, State or Federal Government job that was not covered by \nSocial Security. This policy is known as the Government Pension Offset.\n  This is how the current law works. Consider a surviving spouse who \nretires from government service and receives a government pension of \n$600 a month. She also qualifies for a Social Security spousal benefit \nof $645 a month. Because of the Pension Offset law (which reduces her \nSocial Security benefit by 2/3 of her government pension), her spousal \nbenefit is reduced to $245 a month. So instead of $1245, she will \nreceive only $845 a month. That is $400 a month less to pay the rent, \npurchase a prescription medication, or buy groceries. I think that is \nwrong.\n  My bill does not repeal the government pension offset entirely, but \nit will allow retirees to keep more of what they deserve. It guarantees \nthat those subject to the offset can keep at least $1200 a month in \ncombined retirement income. With my modification, the 2/3 offset would \napply only to the combined benefit that exceeds $1200 a month. So, in \nthe example above, the surviving spouse would face only a $30 offset, \nallowing her to keep $1215 in monthly income.\n  Unfortunately, the current law disproportionately affects women. \nWomen are more likely to receive Social Security spousal benefits and \nto have worked in low-paying or short-term government positions while \nthey were raising families. It is also true that women receive smaller \ngovernment pensions because of their lower earnings, and rely on Social \nSecurity benefits to a greater degree. My modification will allow these \nwomen who have contributed years of important government service and \nfamily service to rely on a larger amount of retirement income.\n  In the last Congress, the Senate unanimously voted for and passed \nH.R. 5, The Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act of 1999. This \nlegislation ensured that senior citizens who choose to work or who must \nwork can earn income after retirement without losing a portion of their \nSocial Security benefit. That law helps senior citizens who earn above \n$17,000 per year. In contrast, my bill specifically targets those with \nmuch lower retirement incomes, around $13,000 per year and less. I \nbelieve that we must work to ensure a safety net for all of our \nseniors, including those retired federal employees who every day are \nforced to make difficult choices between rent, food, and prescription \ndrugs due to the drastic effects of the government pension offset.\n  Why do we punish people who have committed a significant portion of \ntheir lives to government service? We are talking about workers who \nprovide some of the most important services to our community, teachers, \nfirefighters, and many others. Some have already retired. Others are \ncurrently working and looking forward to a deserved retirement. These \nindividuals deserve better than the reduced monthly benefits that the \nPension Offset currently requires.\n  Government employees work hard in service to our Nation, and I work \nhard for them. I do not want to see them penalized simply because they \nhave chosen to work in the public sector, rather than for a private \nemployer, and often at lower salaries and sometimes fewer benefits. If \na retired worker in the private sector received a pension, and also \nreceived a spousal Social Security benefit, they would not be subject \nto the Offset. I think we should be looking for ways to reward \ngovernment service, not the other way around. I believe that people who \nwork hard and play by the rules should not be penalized by arcane, \nlegislative technicalities.\n  Frankly, I would like to repeal the offset all together. But, I \nrealize that budget considerations make that unlikely. As a compromise, \nI hope we can agree that retirees who have worked hard all their lives \nshould not have this offset applied until their combined monthly \nbenefit, both government pension and Social Security spousal benefit, \nexceeds $1,200.\n  I also strongly believe that we should ensure that retirees buying \npower keeps up with the cost of living. That's why I have also included \na provision in\n\n[[Page S2898]]\n\nthis legislation to index the $1,200 amount to inflation so retirees \nwill see their minimum benefits increase along with the cost of living.\n  The Social Security Administration recently estimated that enacting \nthe provisions contained in my bill will have a negligible long-term \nimpact on the Social Security Trust Fund, about 0.005 percent of \ntaxable payroll. Additionally, my bill is bipartisan and is strongly \nsupported by CARE, the Coalition to Assure Retirement Equity with 43 \nmember organizations including the National Association of Retired \nFederal Employees, NARFE, the American Federation of Federal State \nCounty and Municipal Employees, AFSCME, the National Education \nAssociation, NEA, and the National Treasury Employees Union, NTEU.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort and support my \nlegislation to modify the Government Pension Offset.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FIENGOLD (for himself and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 612. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to require the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to develop and implement an annual plan \nfor outreach regarding veterans benefits, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a measure that \nwill help ensure that all of our nation's veterans who earned benefits \nthrough their service receive those benefits. I am pleased to be joined \ntoday by the senior Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond. As chairman of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, he has long been a strong advocate for our veterans.\n  Late last year the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs (WDVA) \nlaunched a statewide program called I Owe You. Under the direction of \nSecretary Ray Boland, the I Owe You program encourages veterans to \napply, or re-apply, for benefits that they earned from their service to \nthe United States.\n  As part of this program, WDVA held an outreach event in Milwaukee \nwhere veterans could apply for benefits--more than 1,500 veterans and \nfamily members attended the event and many started the process of \nreceiving the benefits owed to them. This was only the first of their \n``supermarkets of veterans benefits'' that they plan to hold across the \nState.\n  The State of Wisconsin is performing a service that is clearly the \nobligation of the Department of Veterans Affairs. These are federal \nbenefits that we owe our veterans and it is the Federal Government's \nobligation to make sure that they receive them. Obviously, we must make \na greater effort if more than 1,500 people in the Milwaukee area alone \nattended this event.\n  This bill calls upon the Department of Veterans Affairs to take on \nthe responsibility of better informing our veterans about the benefits \nand services they have earned. Under the National I Owe You Act, the \nSecretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs will develop and \nimplement a plan to encourage veterans to apply for their benefits, \nidentify those entitled to benefits who aren't currently receiving \nthem, and notify veterans of any modifications to veterans benefits \nprograms.\n  The American people are indebted to our nation's veterans. As a \nresult of their loyal service and sacrifice, we maintain our freedoms \nand rights. It's time that we do right by our veterans and honor the \ncommitment that we made to the men and women who served our country in \nthe Armed Forces.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the National I Owe You Act to ensure \nthat this commitment is honored.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 612\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National I Owe You Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ANNUAL PLAN FOR \n                   OUTREACH REGARDING VETERANS BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     includes acting as a principal advocate for veterans in order \n     to assure that veterans receive the benefits to which they \n     are entitled as a result of service to the nation.\n       (2) The Veterans Benefits Administration of the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs is responsible for the timely and \n     accurate distribution of benefits to veterans and their \n     dependents.\n       (3) Only 2,600,000 of the 24,000,000 living United States \n     veterans are receiving benefits through the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs.\n       (4) There may be veterans entitled to veterans benefits who \n     are not aware of their entitlement to such benefits.\n       (5) The Veterans Benefits Administration needs to take more \n     aggressive actions to ensure that all veterans are aware of \n     the veterans benefits to which they are entitled.\n       (6) The State of Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs \n     recently initiated a program that permits veterans to apply \n     at one location for benefits such as health care, disability \n     compensation, education, and job training.\n       (b) Annual Plan.--Subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 38, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 531. Annual plan for outreach regarding veterans \n       benefits\n\n       ``(a) Development.--The Secretary shall, on an annual \n     basis, develop a plan for the outreach activities of the \n     Department regarding veterans benefits during the year \n     covered by such plan.\n       ``(b) Plan Elements.--(1) Each plan under this section \n     shall include the following elements:\n       ``(A) A program to encourage veterans to apply for veterans \n     benefits.\n       ``(B) A program to identify veterans entitled to veterans \n     benefits who are not currently receiving such benefits.\n       ``(C) A program to notify veterans of any modifications to \n     veterans benefits programs.\n       ``(D) Such other programs or elements as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate.\n       ``(2) A plan under this section for a year may consist of \n     an update of the plan under this section for the previous \n     year, taking into account changes in circumstances over time.\n       ``(c) Consultation.--In developing a plan under subsection \n     (a), the Secretary shall consult with directors of the \n     veterans agencies of the States, appropriate representatives \n     of veterans service organizations and other veterans advocacy \n     groups, and such other persons as the Secretary considers \n     appropriate.\n       ``(d) Implementation.--The Secretary shall implement each \n     plan developed under this section.\n       ``(e) Veterans Benefits Defined.--In this section the term \n     `veterans benefits' means benefits for veterans under the \n     laws administered by the Secretary.''.\n       (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of chapter 5 of that title is amended by inserting \n     after the item relating to section 530 the following new \n     item:\n\n``531.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe alternative minimum tax on individuals, to raise the exemption for \nsmall businesses from such tax, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, today I am proud to join with the \nChairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, Senator Kit Bond, in \nintroducing the Real AMT Relief Act of 2001. This legislation is \nintended to provide the hard working taxpayers of America relief from \nthe onerous Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT.\n  The AMT, set up more than 30 years ago to help ensure that wealthy \ntaxpayers paid their fair share of taxes, is hitting middle-income \nfamilies the hardest. Most vulnerable are the hard working taxpayers \nwith several children, interest deductions from second mortgages, \ncapital gains, high state and local taxes, and incentive stock options.\n  While only 19,000 people paid the AMT in 1970, roughly 1,000,000 \ntaxpayers had to pay it in 1999. According to the Joint Tax Committee, \nit is estimated that by 2011, more than 16 million taxpayers will have \nto struggle with the AMT.\n  Another group of taxpayers being slammed by the AMT are America's \nsmall business owners. As my good friend Senator Bond has said, the \ncomplexity of the AMT forces many small businesses to spend valuable \nresources on tax professionals and high priced accountants to determine \nwhether or not the AMT applies to them. Many small business owners in \nArkansas have told me that instead of spending the time and the money \ntrying to comply with the AMT, they would rather use those resources to \nhire new workers and provide benefits to their workers.\n  The AMT has also had a dramatic impact on high tech communities all \nacross the country. The recent stock market collapse has left many high \ntech employees, from executives to the rank and file, facing enormous \nAMT bills based on long-gone paper profits. Some who exercised \nincentive options and owe the tax may have no choice but to plunder \n401(k)s, sell homes, borrow from parents, arrange IRS payment plans and \nconsider bankruptcy.\n  In this scenario, the AMT is based on paper profits on the day you \nexercise the option and buy stock even if the stock later crashes and \nyou lose the profits. It's triggered when you exercise an incentive \nstock option in one year and hold the stock into a later calendar year. \nOne thing is clear about stock options: Too many people know too little \nabout them. An Oppenheimer Funds survey last year indicated that 75 \npercent of stock-option holders weren't familiar with the Alternative \nMinimum Tax, and that 52 percent knew ``little'' or ``nothing at all'' \nabout the tax implications of exercising options.\n  The time to help these taxpayers is now. The Real AMT Relief Act of \n2001 provides badly needed relief to all taxpayers. Based on the \nrecommendations of the IRS National Taxpayer Advocate, the Real AMT \nRelief Act of 2001 completely repeals the individual AMT. Eliminating \n20 percent of the AMT each year until it is completely eliminated in \n2006. This helps lift the burden off both the individual as well as the \nsmall business taxpayer. We further help to completely protect the \nsmall business owner by expanding the small business exemption from $5 \nmillion to $10 million.\n  I look forward to helping provide this badly needed tax relief to \nAmerica's growing middle class. It is truly an honor to be joined in \nthis effort with the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee, Senator Bond. His knowledge and passion for this \nissue is second to none. I urge my colleagues to support passage of the \nReal AMT Relief Act of 2001.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 616\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nArkansas, Senator Hutchinson, in introducing the Real AMT Relief Act of \n2001. This bill focuses on an issue of growing concern to many \nindividual taxpayers and especially small business owners, the \nAlternative Minimum Tax, AMT.\n  The Real AMT Relief Act addresses the increasingly onerous \nconsequences of the individual AMT as well as the corporate AMT. \nAccording to the Joint Tax Committee, in 1998, the most recent taxpayer \ndata available, there were 853,000 individual tax returns that paid \nAMT. That number constituted 0.7 percent of all individual income tax \nreturns--a relatively small number of returns. In contrast, the Joint \nTax Committee estimates that by 2011, 11.2 percent of individual income \ntax returns will have AMT liability, that's more than 16 million \ntaxpayers who will have to grapple with this burdensome tax.\n  Sadly, many of these AMT taxpayers will be individuals in the middle \nincome brackets and not because they are taking advantage of special \ntax loopholes to avoid paying their share of taxes. No, these \nhardworking men and women will be hit with the AMT because they are \ntaking advantage of the tax benefits that Congress accorded them, such \nas the child tax credit, the adoption tax credit, the dependent care \ntax credit, and the HOPE Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credit, \nto name a few. So instead of receiving a few extra dollars to help \nraise their children, these taxpayers lose much of these benefits and \nget to deal with the complex AMT rules as a bonus prize.\n  For other taxpayers, the AMT will not increase their tax bill. But \nbecause the AMT is a separate tax system, they will have to calculate \ntheir taxes twice, once under the regular rules and a second time under \nthe AMT, just to make sure they do not owe additional taxes. With an \nalready complicated set of tax rules for the regular tax, the last \nthing these individuals need is a second set of calculations.\n  Another significant group of taxpayers who have largely been \nforgotten in the AMT debate are the small business owners. According to \nrecent IRS estimates, there were more than 20.7 million tax returns \nfiled by sole-proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations with \nreceipts of less than $1 million. In contrast, there were 2.75 million \nC corporations. As a result, a whopping 88 percent of these businesses, \nwith receipts under $1 million, are pass-through entities, businesses \nthat are taxed only at the individual owner level.\n  For these sole proprietors, partners, and S corporation shareholders, \nthe individual AMT increases their tax liability by, among other \nthings, reducing depreciation and depletion deductions, limiting net \noperating loss treatment, eliminating the deductibility of State and \nlocal taxes, and curtailing the expensing of research and \nexperimentation costs. In addition, because of its complexity, this tax \nforces small business owners to waste precious funds on tax \nprofessionals to determine whether the AMT even applies. Just think of \nthe economic growth and new jobs that could be created if we could \neliminate the compliance costs of the individual AMT.\n\n  The Real AMT Relief Act does just that. Based on the recommendation \nof the IRS National Taxpayer Advocate in his 2001 Report to Congress, \nthe bill provides for the complete repeal of the individual AMT. This \nwill be accomplished by eliminating 20 percent of the AMT each year \nuntil it is completely repealed in 2006. That's welcome relief for \nindividual taxpayers and an enormous burden lifted off the shoulders of \nAmerica's small businesses.\n  For small corporations, the AMT story is much the same, high \ncompliance costs and additional taxes draining away scarce capital from \ntheir businesses. In fact, the Committee on Small Business, which I \nchair, received testimony at a hearing in the last Congress that the \ncorporate AMT resulted in a $95,000 tax bill for one small business in \nKansas City, all because the company purchased life insurance on the \nfather, who was the primary owner of the business, to prevent the \nestate tax from closing the company down. That type of nonsense must \ncome to an end here and now.\n  In 1997, Congress established an exemption from the corporate AMT for \nsmall businesses that are organized as taxable corporations if they \nmeet certain gross receipt tests. Under that exemption, a corporation \ninitially qualifies if its average gross receipts were $5 million or \nless during its first three taxable years beginning after December 31, \n1993. Thereafter, a small corporation can continue to qualify for the \nAMT exemption for so long as its average gross receipts for the prior \nthree-year period do not exceed $7.5 million.\n  With the growth and success of small corporations, it is time to \nexpand that exemption and continue to provide these small enterprises \nwith relief from the corporate AMT. Accordingly, for small corporate \ntaxpayers, the Real AMT Relief Act increases the current exemption from \nthe corporate AMT. As a result, a small corporation will initially \nqualify for the exemption if its average gross receipts are $7.5 \nmillion or less during its first three taxable years. In subsequent \nyears, a small corporation will continue to qualify for as long as its \naverage gross receipts for the prior 3-year period do not exceed $10 \nmillion.\n  Mr. President, small businesses represent more than 99 percent of all \nemployers, employ 53 percent of the private work force, and create \nabout 75 percent of the new jobs in this country. In addition, these \nsmall firms contribute 57 percent of all sales in this country, and \nthey are responsible for 51 percent of the private gross domestic \nproduct. With that kind of performance, small businesses deserve tax \nrelief and simplification. The Real AMT Relief Act comes through on \nboth accounts. I applaud Senator Hutchinson for his leadership on this \nissue, and I am proud to be the chief co-sponsor of this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  S. 617. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to improve student and teacher performance and access to education \nin the critically challenged Lower Mississippi Delta region; to the \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S2901]]\n\non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Lower \nMississippi Delta Education Access and Improvement Act of 2001.\n  The character and fabric of our Nation have been significantly \nenhanced by the Mississippi Delta's unique blend of the talents that \ncreated blues music and Pulitzer Prize literature. But the problems \nfacing this region today overshadow the triumphs of the past and \nforetell a future without hope. These problems include: below average \nreading skills among elementary school children, low graduation rates \nand ACT scores among high school students, lower levels of \naccreditation among teachers, and poor scores from the State Department \nof Education Performance Based Accreditation System. Poverty is another \nissue facing the school districts, evidenced by the fact that 86 \npercent of the students are eligible for free lunch.\n  However, there is a sense of optimism among community leaders and \neducators about overcoming the difficulties that confront the \neducational system of the area. Universities, community based \norganizations, and schools are developing comprehensive initiatives to \nachieve new success in teacher training and retention, preschool \nlearning readiness, parental education, school-wide performance, birth \nto kindergarten preventative health care and immunization delivery. \nThese are the people who best know their problems, and more \nimportantly, how to solve them. In my opinion, these are efforts that \ndeserve federal support.\n  This bill will authorize grants to institutions of higher learning \nlocated in the Lower Mississippi Delta for the improvement of education \nand student and teacher performance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 617\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate certain lands in the Valley Forge \nNational Historical Park as the Valley Forge National Cemetery, to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I renew my efforts that began on \nSeptember 29, 1998, to authorize the creation of the Valley Forge \nNational Cemetery. I am introducing this bill to coincide with a news \nconference that Congressman Joseph Hoeffel is holding today in \nMontgomery County, PA, and I join with the entire Pennsylvania \ndelegation in the House, in announcing our joint intention to see this \nmatter resolved this year. Congressman Hoeffel will introduce a \ncompanion bill, and I am pleased to join him in this effort. I had \nhoped to be with Congressman Hoeffel at Valley Forge today, but was not \nable to join him due to a prior commitment. I nevertheless commend him, \nand the entire Pennsylvania delegation in the House, for their \nleadership in advancing this legislation. I am anxious to begin the \nfight for this worthy endeavor.\n  A national cemetery located at Valley forge would not only be a \nfitting final resting place for the Nation's veterans because of the \narea's historical significance, it would also provide the veterans of \nsoutheastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey with their only \nnational cemetery burial option within a reasonable distance from the \nhomes of their loved ones.\n  This legislation would designate 200 acres of land within the Valley \nForge National Historic Park for use by the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA, to create a national cemetery. The cemetery would fall \nunder the jurisdiction of VA's National Cemetery Administration, the \nagency charged with administering 119 national cemeteries nationwide.\n  The need for a national cemetery at or near Valley Forge first gained \nmy attention in 1998. Back then, I joined with then-Congressman Jon \nFox, and the entire Pennsylvania delegation in the House, in \nintroducing legislation, S. 2530, to create the Valley Forge National \nCemetery. Unfortunately, that measure was not acted on after its \nreferral to the Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee. It is my \nunderstanding that opposition to the legislation arouse due to \nconcerns, misplaced concerns, in my estimation, that the presence of a \nveterans' cemetery might somehow be inconsistent with the historic \nnature of the Valley Forge Park site.\n  I am advised that the National Park Service, NPS, the agency charged \nwith administering over 3,000 acres of federally owned land at the \nValley Forge National Historic Park, has expressed reservations about \ngiving up Valley Forge land for cemetery use. I am told that NPS is \nconcerned that a cemetery\n\n[[Page S2902]]\n\nwould denigrate the historical significance of the Park. While these \nconcerns may be held in good faith, I believe the presence of national \ncemeteries at other historical sites proves that the historical \nsignificance of an event or area is heightened not degraded, by the \npresence of a cemetery honoring those who served in the military.\n  Two NPS-administered cemeteries, Gettysburg National Cemetery and \nAndersonville National Cemetery, prove my point. Although Gettysburg is \nnot closed for new burials, it is the final resting place of veterans \nfrom all of the country's major wars; Andersonville is still open to \nnew burials. Does the presence of deceased veterans at these Civil War \nsites detract from their solemnity? I think not. In any case, the \nacreage that would be transferred to VA under my bill is not the site \nof the original 1777 encampment of General Washington and his men.\n  The need for a national cemetery in the Philadelphia area is \nparticularly acute. The three closest national cemeteries for \nPhiladelphians--the Philadelphia, Beverly, and Finns Point national \ncemeteries--have been closed to new burials since the 1960s. The \nclosest open national cemetery at Indiantown Gap, PA, is over 2 hours \naway and, at best, will only remain open for new burials until 2030.\n  Pennsylvania has the fifth largest 65-and-older veteran population in \nthe United States. Estimates from the VA indicate that WWII veterans \nare passing away at a rate of 1,000 a day, and that the number of \nannual veteran deaths will reach its peak in 2008. Since national \ncemeteries take, on average, 7 years to build, we must move quickly to \nprovide an appropriate burial option for Philadelphia-area veterans.\n  Our Nation's national cemeteries provide a lasting, dignified \nmemorial to the service so many veterans have given to our country. I \nhave received many letters from widows and family members of veterans \nexplaining how much having their loved ones; service honored by an \nappropriate burial can mean. Providing lasting tributes to this \ncountry's heroes sends several messages to all our citizens. It reminds \nthem that we uphold the virtues of serving in the military; we honor \nthe sacrifices veterans have made; and we will never forget that our \nfreedoms are linked with their sacrifices. It is time to move \nexpeditiously to provide Philadelphia area veterans with the \nopportunity to be so remembered and honored by authorizing a national \ncemetery at Valley Forge.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 618\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF LANDS AS VALLEY FORGE NATIONAL \n                   CEMETERY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not more than 200 acres of land located \n     within the Valley Forge National Historical Park on the day \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act are hereby \n     designated as the Valley Forge National Cemetery. \n     Administrative jurisdiction over such lands is hereby \n     transferred to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and such \n     lands shall be administered as a national cemetery in \n     accordance with chapter 24 of title 38, United States Code \n     (relating to national cemeteries and memorials).\n       (b) Adjustment of Park Boundaries.--Subsection (b) of \n     section 2 of the Act entitled ``An Act to authorize the \n     Secretary of the Interior to establish the Valley Forge \n     National Historical Park in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \n     and for other purposes'' (16 U.S.C. 410aa-1) is amended by \n     striking ``map entitled `Valley Forge National Historical \n     Park', dated June 1979, and numbered VF-91,001'' and \n     inserting ``map entitled `Valley Forge National Historical \n     Park', dated ____, and numbered ____''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWine (for himself, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Warner, Mr. \n        Allen, Mr. Helms, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Santorum, and \n        Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 619. A bill to establish a grant program that provides incentives \nfor States to enact mandatory minimum sentences for certain firearms \noffenses, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce Project Exile: \nThe Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act of 2001, along with my \ndistinguished colleagues Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas, and Senators \nWarner, Allen, Hagel, Helms, Grassley, and Santorum. I introduced this \nbill in the 106th Congress, and today, we again are taking a \ncommonsense step to reduce gun violence and help make our communities \nsafer and more secure.\n  Often, in the heat of the rhetoric, the real issue in gun control \ndebate has become lost in the flurry of words. We must not, however, \nlose sight of the real issue, that is the need to reduce gun violence. \nWhile gun control efforts are often controversial, there is nothing \ncontroversial about protecting our children, our families, our \ncommunities by keeping guns out of the wrong hands, not those of law-\nabiding citizens, but those of criminals and violent offenders.\n  Criminals with guns are killing our children. They are killing our \nfriends and our neighbors. I am very troubled by gun violence. However, \nI firmly believe that the Bush Administration will aggressively go \nafter those who commit crimes with a gun.\n  Right now, current law makes it a federal crime for a convicted felon \nto ever possess a firearm. It is also against federal law to use a gun \nto commit any crime, even a State crime. Under federal law, the \nsentences for these kinds of crimes are mandatory, no second chance, no \nparole.\n  In the late 1980s, President George Bush made enforcement of these \ngun laws a priority. His Justice Department told local sheriffs, chiefs \nof police, and prosecutors that if they caught someone committing a \ncrime in which a gun was used, or even caught a felon with a gun, the \nFederal Government would take the case, and put that criminal behind \nbars for at least five years, no exceptions. During the last 18 months \nof the Bush Administration, more than 2,000 criminals with guns were \nput behind bars.\n  Unfortunately, consistent, effective enforcement ended once the \nClinton administration took office. Between 1992 and 1998, for example, \nthe number of gun cases filed for prosecution dropped from 7,048 to \nabout 3,807, that's a 46 percent decrease. As a result, the number of \nfederal criminal convictions for firearms offenses has fallen \ndramatically.\n  For 6 years, the Clinton Justice Department refused to prosecute \nthose criminals who use a gun to commit State crimes, even though the \nuse of a gun to commit those crimes could be charged as a Federal \ncrime. The only cases they would prosecute were those in which a \nfederal crime had been committed and a gun was used in the commission \nof that crime.\n  Even worse, some federal gun laws were almost never enforced by the \nprior administration. For instance, while Brady law background checks \nhave stopped nearly 300,000 prohibited purchasers of firearms from \nbuying guns, less than .1 percent have actually been prosecuted.\n  I questioned Attorney General Ashcroft during his recent confirmation \nhearing, as well as in private, about the aggressive prosecution of gun \ncases. He shared our view that current law prohibits violent felons \nfrom possessing guns, and so we should aggressively enforce the laws \nthat take guns away from violent criminals. We should take those guns \naway before they use them to injure and kill people.\n  We have often heard that 6 percent of the criminals commit 70 percent \nof the crimes. Well, if you have a violent criminal who illegally \npossesses a gun, I can bet you that he is part of that 6 percent! He's \none of the bad guys, and we should put him away before he has a chance \nto use that gun again.\n  Our goal should be to take all of these armed criminals off the \nstreets. That is how we can reduce crime and save lives. And, we can do \nit now, before another student, or any American, becomes a victim of \ngun violence.\n  This bill offers the kind of practical solution we need to thwart gun \ncrimes, now. It would provide $100 million in grants over 5 years to \nthose States that agree to enact their own mandatory minimum five-year \njail sentences for armed criminals who use or possess an illegal gun. \nAs an alternative, a State also can qualify for the grants by turning \narmed criminals over for Federal prosecution under existing firearms \nlaws. This would be done in the same manner in which it was done in the \nprior Bush administration. In our bill,\n\n[[Page S2903]]\n\nhowever, a State wishing to participate in this program has the option \nof prosecuting armed felons in either State or federal court.\n\n  Qualifying States can use their grants for any variety of purposes \nthat would strengthen their criminal or juvenile justice systems' \nability to deal with violent criminals.\n  This approach works, as Senators Warner and Allen can tell you first-\nhand. In Virginia, for example, the State instituted a program in 1997, \nalso called ``Project Exile.'' Their program is based on one simple \nprinciple: Any criminal caught with a gun will serve a minimum \nmandatory sentence of 5 years in prison. Period. End of story. As a \nresult, gun-toting criminals are being prosecuted six times faster, and \nserving sentences up to four times longer than they otherwise would \nunder State law. Moreover, the homicide rate in Richmond already has \ndropped 50-percent!\n  Every State should have the opportunity to implement Project Exile in \ntheir high-crime communities. The bill that we have introduced will \nmake this proven, commonsense approach to reducing gun violence \navailable to every State.\n  It will take guns out of the hands of violent criminals. It will make \nour neighborhoods safer. It will save lives. I urge my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to support and pass this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 619\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am honored to rise today as an \noriginal cosponsor of Senator DeWine's legislation, Project Exile: the \nSafe Streets and Neighborhood Act 2001. This legislation will go a long \nway towards the goal of effectively reducing gun violence and saving \nlives.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I am extremely concerned about gun \nviolence. However, unlike many of my colleagues, I do not believe that \nmore gun control laws are needed to make our Nation safer. Rather, I \nagree with the thousands of Arkansans who have written asking me to \nsimply enforce the laws already in effect. I also point to the \nexperience of States and cities around the Nation which have seen \nreductions in violent crime when the existing gun laws were \naggressively enforced.\n  The Project Exile legislation will provide the additional resources \nneeded to expand this effort. It authorizes $100 million in block \ngrants over 5 years to those States that agree to enact and enforce \nlaws with mandatory minimum sentences for anyone who uses a firearm to \ncommit any violent or drug trafficking crime as well as for any person \nconvicted of a violent felony who is in possession of a firearm. If a \nState does not wish to change its laws, it can simply agree to ensure \nthat these offenders will be turned over to the appropriate United \nStates Attorney's office for prosecution under Federal firearms \nstatutes.\n  For some time now, I have been working to see Project Exile \nimplemented in Arkansas, and I support this legislation because it will \nauthorize the additional funding necessary to allow Arkansas and other \nstates to implement a program which has been proven to reduce gun \nviolence. Finally, I support this legislation because it is the right \napproach.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 620. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 regarding elementary school and secondary school counseling; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, you have heard the old saying that an \nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Today, I am introducing \nthe Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Improvement Act of 2001 \nto provide that ounce of prevention.\n  After the unspeakable act of violence at Columbine High in 1999, CNN \nand USA Today conducted a public opinion poll of Americans. They asked \nwhat would make a difference in preventing a future outbreak of \nviolence in our Nation's schools.\n  The leading response was to restrict access to firearms. The second \nmost popular response, a response selected by 60 percent of those \npolled, was to increase the number of counselors in our nation's \nschools.\n  Counseling programs, especially in our elementary schools are an \nounce of prevention. However, too many children do not have access to a \nwell-training counselor when they need one.\n  Experts tell us that to be effective, there should be at least one \ncounselor for every 250 students. Unfortunately, the current student: \ncounselor ratio is more than double the recommended level: 551:1. That \nmeans counselors are stretched to the limit and cannot devote the kind \nof attention to children that is needed.\n  Children today are subjected to unprecedented social stresses, \nincluding the fragmentation of the family, drug and alcohol abuse, \nviolence, child abuse and poverty. The legislation I am introducing \ntoday reauthorizes the Elementary School Counseling Demonstration Act \nand expands services to secondary schools.\n  The Elementary School Counseling Program is modeled on a successful \nprogram in the Des Moines school district. The counseling program, \nSmoother Sailing, operates on the simple premise that we must get to \nkids early to prevent problems rather than waiting for a crisis.\n  The schools participating in Smoother Sailing have seen a dramatic \nreduction in the number of students referred to the office for \ndisciplinary reasons. Teachers report fewer classroom disturbances and \nprincipals notice fewer fights in the cafeteria and on the playground. \nThe schools and classrooms have become more disciplined learning \nenvironments.\n  The legislation authorizes $100 million. However, since the counselor \nshortage is particularly acute in elementary schools, the legislation \nrequires that the first $60 million appropriated would go to provide \ngrants for elementary schools.\n  Earlier this month, the Nation was shocked to learn about a school \nshooting in Santee, California. We have a desperate need to improve \ncounseling services in our Nation's schools and this legislation will \nbe an important step in addressing this critical issue. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/26/senate-section/article/S2904-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2904-S2905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSTATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n                                  ____\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 64--CONGRATULATING THE CITY OF DETROIT AND ITS \n     RESIDENTS ON THE OCCASION OF THE TERCENTENNIAL OF ITS FOUNDING\n\n  Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Ms. Stabenow) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

TRANSMITTAL.\n\n       The Clerk of the House of Representatives shall transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the Mayor of Detroit and the \n     City Council of Detroit.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I and my colleague from Michigan, Senator \nStabenow, are introducing a resolution commemorating the tercentennial \nof the founding of Detroit, my hometown. Detroit has contributed \nmightily to American history and to the freedom and prosperity our \nNation enjoys.\n  The ``Spirit of Detroit'' statue, which sits prominently in downtown \nDetroit, embodies a spirit which is referred to by many Detroiters. It \nis this spirit of hard work and determination that has helped \nsuccessive generations of Detroiters realize the American Dream. From \nits earliest days as a frontier outpost, to its role in the epic \nstruggle to end slavery and preserve the union, to the era of the \nArsenal of Democracy, to the modern day struggle to build the Detroit \nof the 21st Century, this spirit has guided Detroit to greatness.\n  While the resolution names but a few of the events and a few of the \npeople who have made significant contributions to the Detroit story, \nthe list is long. Countless Detroiters have stepped forward to make a \ndifference in many facets of American life. And this year, as Detroit \nenters its fourth century, the city's pride in its history is only \nmatched by its confidence in its future.\n  As Detroit celebrates its 300th anniversary, we are proud to have the \nopportunity to take part in the festivities that mark this occasion and \nto share our pride with all of our colleagues.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, the city of Detroit celebrates its 300th \nanniversary this year. The citizens of Detroit will mark this milestone \nwith pride and celebration for a city not only rich in tradition and \nhistory, but also full of promise.\n  The French are credited with founding Detroit, and like so many \nAmericans, the city bears the remnants of its original French name--\nFort Pontchartain de' Etroit. But it is also important to remember the \nindigenous people who preceded the French in the region. The Native \nAmerican people have a rich history and culture, and this history is \nequally credited with the formation of Detroit.\n  This resolution recognizes the important role the city of Detroit and \nits people have played in the history and development of a strong and \nsecure America. From great sports teams and automobiles to music and \ncivil rights, each domain is synonymous with Detroit. Its rich musical \nheritage and artistry has left a lasting imprint on the sound of rhythm \n& blues, gospel, jazz, and Motown.\n  ``The Motor City'' is a moniker of pride for the city of Detroit and \nthe State of Michigan as a whole. The preeminent accomplishments of \nDetroit's automobile industry began with Henry Ford, a man whose \ningenuity and determination changed the landscape of American life. In \ndoing so, a dominant labor movement emerged as a force for equality in \nthe workplace. In addition, people of all ethnicities living and \nworking in Detroit know of the city's distinguished mark in the civil \nrights movement and understand the fight for equal rights in America is \nfar from over. I believe Detroit's best years lie ahead and am proud of \nthe past accomplishments that forever anchor this city in the history \nbooks of our country.\n  I wish Detroit and its residents a Happy Tercentennial and look \nforward to its anniversary celebrations this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/26/senate-section/article/S2905-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2905-S2907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 28--CALLING FOR A UNITED STATES EFFORT TO \n   END RESTRICTIONS ON THE FREEDOMS AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE ENCLAVED \n                 PEOPLE IN THE OCCUPIED AREA OF CYPRUS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 28\n\n       Whereas respect for fundamental freedoms and \n     internationally recognized human rights is a cornerstone of \n     United States foreign policy;\n       Whereas, since the tragic events of 1974, the number of the \n     enclaved people in the occupied area of Cyprus has been \n     reduced from 20,000 to 593 (428 Greek-Cypriots and 165 \n     Maronites);\n       Whereas the enclaved people continue to be subjected to \n     restrictions on their freedoms and human rights;\n       Whereas the representatives of the two communities in \n     Cyprus, who met in Vienna, Austria, in August 1975 under the \n     auspices of the Secretary General of the United Nations, \n     reached a humanitarian agreement, known as the Vienna III \n     Agreement, which, inter alia, states that, ``Greek-Cypriots \n     in the north of the island [of Cyprus] are free to stay and \n     they will be given every help to lead a normal life, \n     including facilities for education and for the practice of \n     their religion, as well as medical care by their own doctors \n     and freedom of movement in the north . . . [and] the United \n     Nations will have free and normal access to Greek-Cypriot \n     villages and habitations in the north'';\n       Whereas the Secretary General of the United Nations, in his \n     December 10, 1995, report on the United Nations operation in \n     Cyprus, set out the recommendations contained in the \n     humanitarian review of the the United Nations Peacekeeping \n     Force in Cyrus (in this concurrent resolution referred to as \n     ``UNFICYP''), as endorsed by United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1032(95), regarding the restrictions on the \n     freedoms and human rights of the enclaved people of Cyprus;\n       Whereas the Secretary General of the United Nations, in his \n     June 7, 1996 report on the United Nations Operation in \n     Cyprus, informed the Security Council that the Greek Cypriots \n     and Maronites living in the northern part of the island \n     ``were subjected to severe restrictions and limitations in \n     many basic freedoms, which had the effect of ensuring that \n     inexorably, with the passage of time, the communities would \n     cease to exist'';\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1062(96), inter alia, expressed regret that ``the Turkish-\n     Cypriot side has not responded more fully to the \n     recommendations made by UNFICYP and calls upon the Turkish-\n     Cypriot side to respect more fully the basic freedoms of the \n     Greek-Cypriots and Maronites living in the northern part of \n     the island and to intensify its efforts to improve their \n     daily lives'';\n       Whereas, on July 31, 1997, Cyprus President Glafcos \n     Clerides and Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash agreed to \n     further address this issue along with other humanitarian \n     issues;\n       Whereas those agreements and recommendations are still far \n     from being implemented, despite a number of measures \n     announced in May 2000 by the Turkish side to ease certain \n     restrictions imposed on movement between the two sides, which \n     restrictions largely remain in effect;\n       Whereas the measures against the UNFICYP instituted by the \n     Turkish side since June 2000 have further complicated the \n     situation;\n       Whereas, on January 22, 1990, Turkey recognized the \n     compulsory jurisdiction of the European Court of Human \n     Rights; and\n       Whereas the European Commission of Human Rights, in the \n     case of Cyprus vs. Turkey before the European Court of Human \n     Rights in 1999 found that ``taken as a whole, the daily life \n     of the Greek Cypriots in northern Cyprus is characterized by \n     a multitude of\n\n[[Page S2906]]\n\n     adverse circumstances. The absence of normal means of \n     communication, the unavailability in practice of the Greek \n     Cypriot press, the insufficient number of priests, the \n     difficult choice before which parents and school children are \n     put regarding secondary education, the restrictions and \n     formalities applied to freedom of movement, the impossibility \n     to preserve property rights upon departure or death and the \n     various other restrictions create a feeling among the persons \n     concerned of being compelled to live in a hostile environment \n     in which it is hardly possible to lead a normal private and \n     family life'' and ``are to a large extent the direct result \n     of the official policy conducted by the respondent government \n     [Turkey] and its subordinate local administration\": Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) strongly urges the President to undertake efforts to \n     end restrictions on the freedoms and human rights of the \n     enclaved people of Cyprus; and\n       (2) expresses its intention to remain actively interested \n     in the matter until the human rights and fundamental freedoms \n     of the enclaved people of Cyprus are restored, respected, and \n     safeguarded.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am submitting a concurrent \nresolution, also sponsored by Senator Mikulski, which calls for a \nUnited States effort to end the restrictions on the freedoms and \nviolations of the human rights of the enclaved people in the occupied \nportion of Cyprus. I have introduced this legislation in the past, and \nI regret that these concerns are still with us. In the 106th Congress, \nmy resolution garnered 36 cosponsors, more than one-third of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I am aware that developments on Cyprus are not known to most \nAmericans. Yet if I were to tell them that a small nation has had part \nof its land illegally occupied by a neighboring state for over a \nquarter of a century, I know they would share my outrage.\n  The 26 years since the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus have seen the \nend of the cold war, the collapse of the USSR, free elections in South \nAfrica and a reunited Germany. Yet while the line through the heart of \nBerlin is gone, the line through the heart of Cyprus remains.\n  Over a quarter of a century ago, Turkey's brutal invasion drove more \nthan 200,000 Cypriots from their homes. Turkey still controls about \none-third of the island of Cyprus and maintains about 30,000 troops \nthere. There remains, in northern Cyprus, a small remnant of 428 \nenclaved Greek-Cypriots and 165 Maronites. The reason they are referred \nto as the enclaved of Cyprus is that during the fighting in 1974 they \nmostly resided in remote enclaves and therefore were not able to flee \nthe fighting and thus were not immediately expelled.\n  I believe that this resolution is important in serving to bring to \nthe attention of the American people and the world community, the \nhardships and restrictions endured by these enclaved individuals.\n  In 1975, representatives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities \nagreed that the Greek-Cypriots in the northern part of the island were \nto be given every help to lead a normal life. Twenty-six years later \nthis is still not the case.\n  The presence of the Turkish-Cypriot police in the lives of the \nenclaved Greek-Cypriots is constant and represents an aggravated \ninterference with their right to respect their private and family life \nand for their home. Human rights violations and deprivations include: \nrestrictions and formalities on their freedom of movement; the \nimpossibility of preserving their property rights upon their departure \nor death; the unavailability of access to Greek Cypriot press; an \ninsufficient number of priests; and the difficulties in continuing \ntheir children's secondary education.\n  What I just cited are the 1999 findings of the European Commission of \nHuman Rights in the case of Cyprus against Turkey which is currently \nbefore the European Court of Human Rights. Overall, the Commission \nfound that the enclaved ``have been subjected to discrimination \namounting to degrading treatment.'' On January 22, 1990, Turkey \nrecognized the compulsory jurisdiction of the European Court of Human \nRights and although there has been no ruling, these findings by the \nCommission illustrate the dire situation which exists.\n\n  Going back to 1995, the situation was studied then too, with equally \ncompelling findings. This report on the conditions of the enclaved by \nthe UN Secretary General stated that, ``the Review confirmed that those \ncommunities were the objects of very severe restrictions, which \ncurtailed the exercise of many basic freedoms and had the effect on \nensuring that, inexorably with the passage of time, those communities \nwould cease to exist in the northern part of the island.'' The UN \nexpressed its concerns and made recommendations for remedial actions by \nthe Turkish-Cypriot regime.\n  As an example of the situation there, I will state what two of the \nrecommendations were. The simplicity of them speaks volumes. They are: \n(1) ``All restrictions on land travel within the northern part of \nCyprus should be lifted'', and (2) ``Restrictions on hand-carried mail \nand newspapers should be lifted'' These are basic rights to us, but \nsomething to be desired and wished for by the enclaved. In addition, \nthe State Department's Human Rights Report for 2000 recently released \nstates that the Turkish-Cypriot regime ``continued to restrict freedom \nof movement''.\n  As a result of this review, very minor relaxation of restrictions on \nthe freedom of movement of the enclaved were introduced in 1996, but \nall the other recommendations have not been implemented. Some new \ntelephone lines were also installed in the Karpas and Kormakiti areas \nbut the overseas charges imposed make it impossible to use for \ncommunication with relatives in the Government controlled area.\n  The numbers of the enclaved continue to decrease and education is one \nreason. No Greek language educational facilities for the Greek-Cypriot \nand Maronite children exist beyond the elementary level. Parents are \nforced to choose between keeping their children with them or sending \nthem to the south for further education. If a child is sent for further \neducation they are no longer permitted to return permanently to their \nhomes.\n  I am aware that on May 4, 2000, the Turkish occupation regime \nannounced measures to ease restrictions in order to improve the living \nconditions of the enclaved. For example, it was announced that Greek-\nCypriots and Maronites who wish to visit their relatives in the \noccupied areas will be allowed to stay for a reasonable length of time \nafter obtaining the necessary permit. What was instituted was that the \nrelatives of the enclaved when visiting can stay in the occupied areas \nfor three days and two nights instead of the two days and one night \nthat was the case in the past.\n  One restriction that was eased in may was that the enclaved may bring \ntheir spouses to reside with them and the Greek-Cypriot marriage \ncertificates will be recognized as proof of marriage. Amazingly, this \npreviously required special permission which was difficult to obtain.\n  This situation calls out for justice. By bringing these human rights \nviolations to the attention of the American people, it is my hope, that \nwe can bring the plight of these people to the World's attention. My \nresolution urges the President to undertake efforts to end the \nrestrictions on the freedoms and human rights of the enclaved people. I \nwill remain actively involved in this issue until their rights and \nfreedoms are restored.\n  This is the least we can do for these people. While this resolution \naddresses the plight of the enclaved people of Cyprus, work must not \ncease on efforts to bring about a withdrawal of Turkish forces and a \nrestoration of Cyprus' sovereignty over the entire island with the full \nrespect of the rights of all Cypriots.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Snowe in \nsubmitting a resolution calling for action to help the enclaved people \nin the occupied areas of Cyprus. This legislation puts the Congress on \nrecord in support of human rights and freedom for all the people of \nCyprus.\n  In 1974 Turkish troops invaded Cyprus and divided the island. For \ndecades, the people of Cyprus have lived under an immoral and illegal \noccupation. The enclaved people in the northern part of the island have \nsuffered most. Their travel is restricted. They may not attend the \nschools of their choice. Their access to the religious sites is \nrestricted. They are often harassed and discriminated against.\n\n[[Page S2907]]\n\n  The United Nations and the European Union have documented these human \nrights abuses and have called on the Turkish Cypriots to respect the \nbasic freedom of the Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the \nnorthern part of the island.\n  Our foreign policy must reflect our values. The legislation we are \nintroducing urges the President to work to end restrictions on the \nfreedom of the enclaved people in the occupied part of Cyprus. It \nstates that commitment of Congress to pursue this issue until the human \nrights and fundamental freedoms of the enclaved people of Cyprus are \nrestored, respected and safeguarded.\n  We all hope peace will come to Cyprus, ending the occupation which \ndivides it. But our efforts to improve human rights on the island \ncannot wait. I urge my colleagues to join me supporting this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/26/senate-section/article/S2907-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 145.

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 295) to provide emergency relief to small \n     businesses affected by significant increases in the prices of \n     heating oil, natural gas, propane, and kerosene, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nbill which had been reported from the Committee on Small Business, with \nan amendment to strike all after the enacting clause and inserting in \nlieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business and Farm \n     Energy Emergency Relief Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) a significant number of small businesses in the United \n     States, non-farm as well as agricultural producers, use \n     heating oil, natural gas, propane, kerosene, or electricity \n     to heat their facilities and for other purposes;\n       (2) a significant number of small businesses in the United \n     States sell, distribute, market, or otherwise engage in \n     commerce directly related to heating oil, natural gas, \n     propane, and kerosene; and\n       (3) sharp and significant increases in the price of heating \n     oil, natural gas, propane, or kerosene--\n       (A) disproportionately harm small businesses dependent on \n     those fuels or that use, sell, or distribute those fuels in \n     the ordinary course of their business, and can cause them \n     substantial economic injury;\n       (B) can negatively affect the national economy and regional \n     economies;\n       (C) have occurred in the winters of 1983-1984, 1988-1989, \n     1996-1997, and 1999-2000; and\n       (D) can be caused by a host of factors, including global or \n     regional supply difficulties, weather conditions, \n     insufficient inventories, refinery capacity, transportation, \n     and competitive structures in the markets, causes that are \n     often unforeseeable to those who own and operate small \n     businesses.\n\n     SEC. 3.

I ask unanimous consent the committee substitute, as \namended, be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on February 28, 2001, the Committee on Small \nBusiness considered and voted unanimously, 18-0, to report the ``Small \nBusiness and Farm Energy Emergency Relief Act of 2001'' (S. 295) to the \nfull Senate. This legislation is designed to assist small businesses \nand farms to recover from economic injuries resulting from sharp and \nsignificant increases in the price of heating oil, natural gas, \npropane, kerosene, or electricity. S. 295 would permit the Small \nBusiness Administration (SBA) to expand its Economic Injury Disaster \nLoan Program and the Department of Agriculture to expand its Emergency \nLoan Program so that small businesses and farms could apply for \neconomic injury loans when they are suffering from the significant \nincreases in energy prices.\n  At the time the Committee on Small Business filed the report on S. \n295 with the Senate, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had not \ncompleted its cost estimate on the legislation. Under rule \nXXVI(11)(A)(1) of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee is \nrequired to provide an estimate of the cost of the legislation. The CBO \ncost estimate dated March 21, 2001, provides the cost estimate for S. \n295.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the CBO cost \nestimate on S. 295 be considered part of the official record of the \nbill and the report with the transmittal letter dated March 21, 2001, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 21, 2001.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 295, the Small \n     Business and Farm Energy Emergency Relief Act of 2001.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Rachel \n     Milberg.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Barry B. Anderson\n                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n\n               congressional budget office cost estimate\n\n     S. 295--Small Business and Farm Energy Emergency Relief Act \n         of 2001\n       Summary: S. 295 would expand certain loan programs \n     administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA) and \n     the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Under current law, \n     SBA provides loans to small businesses that suffer the \n     effects of a natural disaster, and USDA provides similar \n     loans to family farms. S. 295 would expand these two programs \n     to authorize loans to small businesses and family farms to \n     recover from economic injuries resulting from sharp and \n     significant increases in the price of electricity, heating \n     oil, natural gas, propane, or kerosene. The bill would \n     authorize SBA and USDA to provide loans for this purpose for \n     two years.\n       CBO estimates that implementing S. 295 would cost $51 \n     million over the 2002-2006 period, subject to appropriation \n     of the necessary amounts. CBO estimates that enacting S. 295 \n     would not affect direct spending or\n\n[[Page S2911]]\n\n     receipts; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not \n     apply. S. 295 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 295 is shown in the following table. \n     The costs of this legislation fall within budget functions \n     450 (community and regional development) and 350 \n     (agriculture).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                               -----------------------------------------\n                                 2001   2002   2003   2004   2005   2006\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nBaseline Spending Under\n Current Law:\n  Estimated Authorization         190    197    201    207    212    219\n   Level \\1\\..................\n  Estimated Outlays...........    220    210    200    206    211    218\nProposed Changes:\n  Estimated Authorization           0     24     24      1      1      1\n   Level......................\n  Estimated Outlays...........      0      6     27     13      4      1\nSpending Under S. 295:\n  Estimated Authorization         190    221    225    208    213    220\n   Level......................\n  Estimated Outlays...........    220    216    227    219    215    219\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 2001 level is the amount appropriated for that year for SBA's\n  Disaster Loan Program and the USDA's Emergency Loan Program. The\n  amounts shown for 2002 through 2006 are CBO levels that reflect annual\n  increases for anticipated inflation.\n\n       Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that S. \n     295 will be enacted near the end of fiscal year 2001, and \n     that SBA and USDA would begin offering these kinds of loans \n     in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002. In addition to the \n     administrative costs of providing more loans, the cost of \n     implementing S. 295 would depend on two factors: (1) the \n     amount of money that the government would lend to small \n     businesses and family farms--the program level, and (2) the \n     riskiness of the loans provided--the subsidy rate.\n     Program level\n       In 2000, SBA provided over 28,000 disaster loans to \n     homeowners and small businesses. Of this total, about 4,000 \n     loans were to small businesses to recover from physical \n     damages caused by natural disasters, and about 1,000 of those \n     loans were to cover the cost of economic injuries suffered by \n     small businesses due to disasters. S. 295 would authorize an \n     indefinite number of additional loans to cover economic \n     injuries related to the prices of certain fuels. Based on \n     information from the SBA, CBO estimates that expanding the \n     SBA program to cover economic injuries to small businesses \n     that are caused by high energy prices would greatly increase \n     the number of SBA loans. We estimate the agency would make \n     an additional 10,000 new loans each year--about a one-\n     third increase over the present number of loans. Based on \n     information from USDA, CBO estimates that expanding the \n     USDA program to cover energy-related costs would add \n     another 5,000 loans per year.\n       Under current law, SBA loans to cover the cost of economic \n     injuries average about $5,000 per borrower, and we assume \n     that loans provided under S. 295 would be the same size. The \n     actual number of loans provided under the bill should be \n     either higher or lower than CBO's estimate. Similarly, the \n     average loan size could be either higher or lower than we \n     assume. But if there are fewer loans under the bill than we \n     estimate, it is likely that the average loan size would be \n     greater than $5,000 because many borrowers are likely to rely \n     on such loans to invest in physical assets that could help \n     cover the cost of energy bills.\n       In total, CBO estimates that SBA would provide about $50 \n     million in new loans in both 2002 and 2003, and USDA would \n     provide another $25 million in loans in each of these years. \n     These estimates are uncertain, and they are based on SBA's \n     anticipated demand for energy-related loans. The actual \n     number and value of loans made under the bill would depend on \n     the guidelines that SBA and USDA develop. These guidelines \n     would specify the qualification requirements for small \n     businesses applying for a loan, how the borrowed money could \n     be used, and the exact terms of the loans.\n     Subsidy rate\n       The Federal Credit Reform Act requires an upfront \n     appropriation for the subsidy costs of credit programs. The \n     subsidy cost of this proposed program would be the estimated \n     long term cost to the government of these loans, calculated \n     on a net present value basis, excluding administrative costs.\n       Under current law, the SBA program has an estimated subsidy \n     rate of about 17 percent. This rate includes loans to \n     homeowners to cover the cost of physical damages caused by \n     natural disasters, loans to business owners to cover the cost \n     of such physical damages, and loans to business owners to \n     cover the cost of economic injuries caused by natural \n     disasters. Those loans to small businesses have an estimated \n     subsidy rate of 20 percent. Of these three types of loans, \n     the economic injury loans involve the greatest amount of \n     risk. In addition, because business owners generally can \n     foresee higher energy prices better than natural disasters, \n     CBO expects that loans provided under S. 295 would entail \n     more risk than loans currently provided by SBA. CBO estimates \n     that loans provided by SBA to cover economic injuries related \n     to energy prices would involve a subsidy rate of about 20 \n     percent.\n       The USDA loan program currently has an estimated subsidy \n     rate of 25 percent, and CBO estimates that the loans provided \n     by USDA to cover economic injuries related to energy prices \n     would not affect this subsidy rate.\n     Administrative costs\n       Based on information from SBA, CBO estimates that the cost \n     of providing these loans over the authorized two-year period \n     would equal about 10 percent of the program level. CBO \n     estimates that it would cost an additional $1 million each \n     year to administer the existing loans after the two-year \n     authorization period ends, or a total of $11 million over the \n     2002-2006 period, subject to the availability of appropriated \n     funds.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 295 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA and would not affect the budgets of state, \n     local, or tribal governments.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Rachel Milberg. Impact \n     on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Shelley Finlayson. \n     Impact on the Private Sector: Lauren Marks.\n       Estimate approved by: Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today we are considering S. 295, the Small \nBusiness Energy Emergency Relief Act of 2001. I have waited weeks to \nbring this bill before the Senate, and so I am very pleased that we are \nvoting on this bill today.\n  I introduced this bill to address the significant price increases of \nheating fuels and electricity and the adverse impact those prices are \nhaving on our more than 24 million small businesses, small farmers \nincluded, and the self-employed. The support for this bill reflects how \nmuch small businesses in our States from Massachusetts on the east \ncoast to California on the west coast--are feeling the sting of high \nheating and electricity bills.\n  I thank my colleagues who are cosponsors. Senators Lieberman, Snowe, \nBingaman, Landrieu, Johnson, Domenici, Levin, Wellstone, Jeffords, \nHarkin, Schumer, Clinton, Kohl, Edwards, Leahy, Baucus, Collins, Dodd, \nBob Smith, Chafee, Bayh, Kennedy, Inouye, Daschle, Bond, Jack Reed, \nCorzine, Torricelli, Akaka, Cantwell, Murray, Cleland, Enzi, and \nSpecter. I also thank Congressman Tom Udall of New Mexico for \nintroducing the companion bill to this legislation, H.R. 1010, on March \n13th.\n  As so many of my colleagues know, in addition to electricity, many \nsmall businesses are dependent upon heating oil, propane, kerosene or \nnatural gas. They are dependent either because they sell or distribute \nthe product, because they use it to heat their facilities, or because \nthey use it as part of their business. The significant and unforseen \nrise in the price of these fuels over the past two years, compounded by \ncold snaps and slowed economic conditions this winter, threatens their \neconomic viability.\n  According to the Department of Energy, the cost of heating oil \nnationally climbed 72 percent from February 1999 to February 2000, the \ncost of natural gas climbed 27 percent from September 1999 to September \n2000 and 59 percent over the past year, and the cost of propane climbed \n54 percent from January 2000 to January 2001.\n  As I said when I introduced this bill on February 8, the financial \nfalter or failure of small businesses has the potential to extend far \nbeyond the businesses themselves, and we must do what we can to \nmitigate any damage. Jobs alone give us enough reason to get involved \nand minimize the number of small business disruptions or failures \nbecause they provide more than 50 percent of private-sector jobs.\n  My bill, the Small Business Energy Emergency Relief Act of 2001, \nwould provide emergency relief, through affordable, low-interest Small \nBusiness Administration Economic Injury Disaster Loans, EIDLs, and \nloans through the Department of Agriculture's Emergency Loan program, \nto small businesses and small farms that have suffered direct economic \ninjury, or are likely to suffer direct economic injury, from the \nsignificant increases in the prices of four heating fuels heating oil, \npropane, kerosene, and natural gas or electricity.\n  Initially, this legislation covered four heating fuels, addressing \nthe needs of both urban and rural small businesses. However, I listened \nto and worked closely with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \naddress their concerns. Consequently, we made the following changes, \nsome of which I completely support and consider real improvements to \nthe bill and good public policy, and some of which I don't entirely \nagree with but have accepted in the spirit of compromise. Let me go\n\n[[Page S2912]]\n\nthrough the changes. I have already mentioned some of them in \ndescribing the basic legislation.\n\n  I incorporated a proposal by Senators Boxer and Feinstein to include \nelectric energy in the scope of the bill. I agree with this. There are \nmore and more small businesses around the country being hurt by the \nspike in electricity prices, and I think they too should have access to \naffordable loans to help them through these difficult times.\n  I incorporated a proposal by Senators Kohl and Harkin to extend \nsimilar disaster loan assistance for these purposes to small farms and \nsmall agricultural producers through the Department of Agriculture's \nEmergency Loan program. I agree with this, and I am glad we found a way \nto help small farms.\n  I incorporated a proposal by Senator Levin to allow the loan proceeds \nfrom the SBA disaster loans to be used for small businesses to convert \ntheir systems from using heating fuels to using renewable or \nalternative energy sources. This assistance was also supposed to be \navailable to small farms and small agribusinesses through the USDA's \nemergency loans, but members of the Agricultural Committee objected. \nIt's unfortunate that this assistance won't be available to small farms \nbecause I think we should encourage all industries to use renewable \nenergy.\n  I incorporated a proposal by Senator Enzi to expand Senator Levin's \namendment by including ``co-generation'' in the list of renewable or \nalternative energy sources. The addition of ``co-generation'' is to \nallow small businesses to invest in co-generation capacity to enhance \nefficiency and, as a result, reduce fuel consumption, save money and \nreduce pollution. I have some concerns about the addition of ``co-\ngeneration.'' First, it changes the scope of the Levin amendment by \nadding an efficiency technology to a list of what are largely renewable \nenergy technologies. Second, ``co-generation'' is a broad term that can \ninclude different fuels, different technologies, and result in varying \nlevels of efficiency gains. Because the bill does not establish \nspecific performance standards for efficiency gains resulting from co-\ngeneration, I will watch closely over the coming two years to learn who \nparticipates and what kind of efficiency gains result, and to consider \nchanges to the provision. It is my expectation that the program will \nonly assist projects that will reduce energy consumption and pollution \nbelow business-as-usual levels. Third, while the bill is absolutely \nclear on this point, I want to reiterate that nothing in the bill \nexempts small businesses that participate in this program from \ncompliance with all local, state and Federal permitting requirements, \nand public health and environmental standards. Senator Enzi hopes that \nthis language will help facilities add co-generation capacity, increase \nefficiency, save fuel, save money and reduce pollution, and I can \nsupport that goal. I want to thank my friend from Wyoming for working \nwith me on his amendment, recognizing my concerns and finding \nacceptable language.\n  I also incorporated a proposal by Senator Bond to sunset the program \nafter two years, and a study of the program's usage to help Congress \nassess the merits of reauthorization. I preferred to establish a \npermanent program because, based on past experiences, I firmly believe \nour energy problems will persist for more than two years and the \nassistance should be available to small businesses when they really \nneed it rather than waiting for Congress to act again. However, Senator \nBond and I try very hard to work in a bi-partisan fashion, so I have \nagreed to the two-year sunset date with every intention of \nreauthorizing this program if it proves successful in helping small \nbusinesses. I would like to add that I expect the SBA, when it reports \nto our Committee on the program, to include as much information as \npossible about loans approved for small businesses to convert their \nenergy systems to use co-generation or urban waste. The purpose of \nSenator Levin's proposal was to encourage less pollution and less \nfossil fuel consumption, not more, which I fully support, and I plan to \nmonitor any relevant projects.\n\n  Lastly, I would like to comment on the Congressional Budget Office's \ncost estimate of this bill, which will be published today. While I \nunderstand that CBO uses very conservative assumptions in its estimates \nin general, I question its cost estimate of this particular bill. I do \nagree with CBO that this program is genuinely needed and that small \nbusinesses in many parts of the country will apply for these loans. \nHowever, I question the assumption that the number of economic injury \nloans SBA makes will jump from the current level of 1,000 per year to \n10,000 per year. If they do, it will only reinforce the need for this \nassistance, and not be an argument for opposing this program, but the \nprojection seems on the high side.\n  And I disagree with CBO's assertion that ``many borrowers are likely \nto rely on such loans to invest in physical assets that could help \ncover the cost of energy bills.'' The legislation does allow small \nbusinesses to use the proceeds of SBA economic injury disaster loans \nfor converting their systems to alternative or renewable energy \nsources, but they are not eligible for a loan unless they have also \nsuffered significant economic injury due to the significant increase in \nenergy prices and can't meet their financial obligations. While the \nloan proceeds may be used for such purposes if they convert to \nrenewable or alternative energy systems, I believe the primary use of \nthe loan proceeds will be to provide small businesses with working \ncapital to meet their increased financial obligations. CBO's \nassumption, which I believe to be misguided, drives up the cost \nestimate of this program.\n  I thank my colleagues for their input and cooperation. I believe it \nmade the Small Business and Farm Energy Relief Emergency Act a better \nbill for those who need the assistance. This legislation will help \nthose who have nowhere else to turn. We've got the tools at the SBA and \nUSDA to assist them, and I believe it's more than justified, if not \nobligatory, to use disaster loan programs to help these small \nbusinesses. Further, by providing assistance in the form of loans which \nare repaid to the Treasury, we help reduce the Federal emergency and \ndisaster costs, compared to other forms of disaster assistance, such as \ngrants.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. SBA's programs make \nrecovery affordable for small business owners, and with the right \nsupport, can help mitigate the cost of significant economic disruption \nin your states caused when affected small businesses falter or fail, \nleading to job lay-offs and unstable tax bases. I also ask our friends \nin the House to act quickly and to support this legislation. Again, I \nthank Congressman Tom Udall for his leadership on this issue in the \nHouse, and I thank his colleagues Congresswoman Sue Kelly, \nCongresswoman Grace Napolitano, and Congressman Mark Udall for their \nearly support of this legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read the third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 295), as amended, was read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                 S. 295\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business and Farm \n     Energy Emergency Relief Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) a significant number of small businesses in the United \n     States, non-farm as well as agricultural producers, use \n     heating oil, natural gas, propane, kerosene, or electricity \n     to heat their facilities and for other purposes;\n       (2) a significant number of small businesses in the United \n     States sell, distribute, market, or otherwise engage in \n     commerce directly related to heating oil, natural gas, \n     propane, and kerosene; and\n       (3) sharp and significant increases in the price of heating \n     oil, natural gas, propane, or kerosene--\n       (A) disproportionately harm small businesses dependent on \n     those fuels or that use, sell, or distribute those fuels in \n     the ordinary course of their business, and can cause them \n     substantial economic injury;\n       (B) can negatively affect the national economy and regional \n     economies;\n       (C) have occurred in the winters of 1983-1984, 1988-1989, \n     1996-1997, and 1999-2000; and\n       (D) can be caused by a host of factors, including global or \n     regional supply difficulties,\n\n[[Page S2913]]\n\n     weather conditions, insufficient inventories, refinery \n     capacity, transportation, and competitive structures in the \n     markets, causes that are often unforeseeable to those who own \n     and operate small businesses.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the Independent Office \nof Advocacy Act of 2001, S. 395. This bill is designed to build on the \nsuccess achieved by the Office of Advocacy over the past 24 years. It \nis intended to strengthen that foundation to make the Office of \nAdvocacy a stronger, more effective advocate for all small businesses \nthroughout the United States. This bill was approved unanimously by the \nSenate during the 106th Congress; however, it was not taken up in the \nHouse of Representatives prior to the adjournment last month. On \nFebruary 28, 2001, the Committee on Small Business voted 18-0 to \napprove and report this important legislation. It is my understanding \nthe House Committee on Small Business under its new Chairman, Don \nManzullo, is likely to act on similar legislation this year.\n  The Office of Advocacy is a unique office within the Federal \nGovernment. It is part of the Small Business Administration, and its \ndirector, the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, is nominated by the President \nand confirmed by the Senate. At the same time, the Office is also \nintended to be the independent voice for small business within the \nFederal Government. It is supposed to develop proposals for changing \ngovernment policies to help small businesses, and it is supposed to \nrepresent the views and interests of small businesses before other \nFederal agencies.\n  As the director of the Office of Advocacy, the Chief Counsel for \nAdvocacy has a dual responsibility. On the one hand, he is the \nindependent watchdog for small business. On the other hand, he is also \na part of the President's administration. As you can imagine, those are \nsometimes difficult roles to play simultaneously.\n  The Independent Office of Advocacy Act of 2001 would make the Office \nof Advocacy and the Chief Counsel for Advocacy a fully independent \nadvocate within the Executive Branch acting on behalf of the small \nbusiness community. The bill would establish a clear mandate that the \nOffice of Advocacy will fight on behalf of small businesses, regardless \nof the position taken on critical issues by the Presidents and his \nAdministration.\n  The Independent Office of Advocacy Act of 2001 would direct the Chief \nCounsel to submit an annual report on Federal agency compliance with \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act to the President and the Senate and \nHouse Committees on Small Business. The Reg Flex Act is a very \nimportant weapon in the war against the over-regulation of small \nbusinesses. When the Senate first approved this bill in the 106th \nCongress, I offered an amendment at the request of Senator Fred \nThompson, Chairman of the Government Affairs Committee, that would \ndirect the Chief Counsel for Advocacy to send a copy of the report to \nthe Senate Government Affairs Committee. In addition, my amendment also \nrequired that copies of the report be sent to the House Committee on \nGovernment Reform and the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary. \nI believe these changes make good sense for each of the committees to \nreceive this report on Reg Flex compliance, and I have included them in \nthe version of the bill being introduced and debated today.\n  The Office of Advocacy as envisioned by the Independent Office of \nAdvocacy Act 2001 would be unique within the Executive Branch. The \nChief Counsel for Advocacy would be a wide-ranging advocate, who would \nbe free to take positions contrary to the administration's policies and \nto advocate change in government programs and attitudes as they impact \nsmall businesses. During its consideration of the bill in 1999, the \nCommittee on Small Business adopted unanimously an amendment I offered, \nwhich was cosponsored by Senator John Kerry, the Committee's Ranking \nDemocrat, to require the Chief Counsel to be appointed ``from civilian \nlife.'' This qualification is intended to emphasize that the person \nnominated to serve in this important role should have a strong small \nbusiness background.\n\n  In 1976, Congress established the Office of Advocacy in the SBA to be \nthe eyes, ears and voice for small business within the Federal \nGovernment. Over time, it has been assumed that the Office of Advocacy \nis the ``independent'' voice for small business. While I strongly \nbelieve that the Office of Advocacy and the Chief Counsel should be \nindependent and free to advocate or support positions that might be \ncontrary to the administration's policies, I have come to find that the \noffice has not been as independent as necessary to do the job for small \nbusiness.\n  For example, funding for the Office of Advocacy comes from the \nSalaries and Expense Account of the SBA's budget. Staffing is allocated \nby the SBA Administrator to the Office of Advocacy from the overall \nstaff allocation for the Agency. In 1990, there were 70 full-time \nemployees working on behalf of small businesses in the Office of \nAdvocacy. Today's allocation of staff is 49, and fewer are actually on-\nboard as the result of the longstanding hiring freeze at the SBA. The \nindependence of the Office is diminished when the Office of Advocacy \nstaff is reduced to allow for increased staffing for new programs and \nadditional initiatives in other areas of SBA, at the discretion of the \nAdministrator.\n  In addition, the General Accounting Office undertook a report for me \non personnel practices at the SBA, GAO/GGD-99-68. I was alarmed by the \nGAO's finding that during the past 8 years, the Assistant Advocates and \nRegional Advocates hired by the Office of Advocacy shared many of the \nattributes of Schedule C political appointees. In fact, Regional \nAdvocates are frequently cleared by the White House personnel office--\nthe same procedure followed for approving Schedule C political \nappointees.\n  The facts discussed in the GAO Report cast the Office of Advocacy in \na whole new light. The report raised questions, concerns and suspicions \nregarding the independence of the Office of Advocacy. Has there been a \ntime when the office did not pursue a matter as vigorously as it might \nhave were it not for direct or indirect political influence? Prior to \nreceipt of the GAO Report, my response was a resounding ``No.'' But \nsince receipt of the GAO report, a question mark arises.\n  Let me take a moment and note that I will be unrelenting in my \nefforts to insure the complete independence of the Office of Advocacy \nin all matters, at all times, for the continued benefit of all small \nbusinesses. However, so long as the administration controls the budget \nallocated to the Office of Advocacy and controls who is hired, the \nindependence of the Office may be in jeopardy. We must correct this \nsituation, and the sooner we do it, the better it will be for the small \nbusiness community. As our Government is changing over to President \nBush's administration, this would be a opportune time to establish, \nonce and for all, the actual independence of the Office of Advocacy.\n  The Independent Office of Advocacy Act of 2001 builds a firewall to \nprevent the political intrusion into the management of day-to-day \noperations of the Office of Advocacy. The bill would require that the \nSBA's budget include a separate account for the Office of Advocacy. No \nlonger would its funds come from the general operating account of the \nAgency. The separate account would also provide for the number of full-\ntime employees who would work within the Office of Advocacy. No longer \nwould the Chief Counsel for Advocacy have to seek approval from the SBA \nAdministrator to hire staff for the Office of Advocacy.\n\n  The bill would leave unchanged current law which allows the Chief \nCounsel to hire individuals critical to the mission of the Office of \nAdvocacy without going through the normal competitive procedures \ndirected by Federal law and the Office of Personnel Management, OPM. I \nbelieve this special hiring authority, which is limited only to \nemployees within the Office of Advocacy, is beneficial because it \nallows the Chief Counsel to hire quickly those persons who can best \nassist the office in responding to changing issues and problems \nconfronting small businesses.\n  In addition, S. 395 makes no change in the current law which \nauthorizes and directs each Federal Government\n\n[[Page S2916]]\n\nagency to furnish the Chief Counsel with such reports and other \ninformation necessary in order to carry out the functions of the \nOfficer of Advocacy. This provision is very important for the Office to \nconduct its responsibilities on behalf of small businesses.\n  The Independent Office of Advocacy Act is a sound bill. It is the \nproduct of a great deal of thoughtful, objective review and \nconsideration by me, the staff of the Committee on Small Business, \nrepresentatives of the small business community, former Chief Counsels \nfor Advocacy and others. These individuals have also devoted much time \nand effort in actively participating in a Committee Roundtable \ndiscussion on the Office of Advocacy, which my Committee held on April \n21, 1999. Since that time, the Committee on Small Business approved \nthis bill twice by unanimous votes, and it was approved unanimously by \nthe Senate in 1999. Therefore, I strongly urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to vote in favor of the Independent Office of Advocacy Act of \n2001.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I speak today in strong support of S. 395, \nthe Independent Office of Advocacy Act. Chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business, Kit Bond, and I introduced this \nlegislation to help ensure the Small Business Administration's Office \nof Advocacy has the necessary autonomy to remain an independent voice \nfor America's small businesses. I would like to thank the Chairman and \nhis staff for working with me and my staff to make the necessary \nchanges to this legislation to garner bipartisan support in Committee, \nwhere it passed 18-0.\n  This legislation is similar to a bill introduced by Chairman Bond, \nwhich I supported, during the 106th Congress. While this legislation \nreceived strong support in the Senate Committee on Small Business and \non the floor of the Senate, the House did not take any action. I am \nhopeful that this legislation will be enacted during the 107th \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, the Independent Office of Advocacy Act rewrites the \nlaw that created the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy \nto allow for increased autonomy. It reaffirms the Office's statutory \nand financial independence by preventing the President from firing the \nadvocate without 30 days prior notice to Congress and by creating a \nseparate authorization for the office from that of SBAs. It also states \nthat the Chief Counsel shall be appointed without regard to political \naffiliation, and shall not have served in the Administration for a \nperiod of 5 years prior to the date of appointment.\n  The legislation also makes women-owned businesses an equal priority \nof the Office of Advocacy by adding women-owned business to the primary \nfunctions of the Office of Advocacy, wherever minority owned business \nappears. It also adds new reporting requirements and additional \nfunctions to the Office of Advocacy with regard to enforcement of the \nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act SBREFA. The \nprovisions regarding SBREFA are already a part of existing law in \nChapter 6 Title 5 of United States Code, and will now, rightly, be \nadded to the statute establishing the Office of Advocacy.\n  But at its heart, this legislation will allow the Office of Advocacy \nto better represent small business interests before Congress, Federal \nagencies, and the Federal Government without fear of reprisal for \ndisagreeing with the position of the current administration.\n  For those of my colleagues without an intimate knowledge of the \nimportant role the Office of Advocacy and its Chief Counsel play in \nprotecting and promoting America's small businesses, I will briefly \nelaborate its important functions and achievements. From studying the \nrole of small business in the U.S. economy, to promoting small business \nexports, to lightening the regulatory burden of small businesses \nthrough the Regulatory Flexibility Act, RFA, and the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, the Office of Advocacy has a wide \nscope of authority and responsibility.\n  The U.S. Congress created the Office of Advocacy, headed by a Chief \nCounsel to be appointed by the President from the private sector and \nconfirmed by the Senate, in June of 1976. The rationale was to give \nsmall businesses a louder voice in the councils of government.\n\n  Each year, the Office of Advocacy works to facilitate meetings for \nsmall business people with congressional staff and executive branch \nofficials, and convenes ad hoc issue-specific meetings to discuss small \nbusiness concerns. It has published numerous reports, compiled vast \namounts of data and successfully lightened the regulatory burden on \nAmerica's small businesses. In the area of contracting, the Office of \nAdvocacy developed PRO-Net, a database of small businesses used by \ncontracting officers to find small businesses interested in selling to \nthe Federal Government.\n  The U.S. Congress, the administration and, of course, small \nbusinesses, have all benefitted from the work of the Office of \nAdvocacy. For example, between 1998 and 2000, regulatory changes \nsupported by the Office of Advocacy saved small businesses around $20 \nbillion in annual and one-time compliance costs.\n  Small businesses remain the backbone of the U.S. economy, accounting \nfor 99 percent of all employees, providing 75 percent of all net new \njobs, and accounting for 51 percent of private-sector output. In fact, \nand this may surprise some of my colleagues, small businesses employ 38 \npercent of high-tech workers, an increasingly important sector in our \neconomy.\n  Small businesses have also taken the lead in moving people from \nwelfare to work and an increasing number of women and minorities are \nturning to small business ownership as a means to gain economic self-\nsufficiency. Put simply, small businesses represent what is best in the \nUnited States economy, providing innovation, competition and \nentrepreneurship.\n  Their interests are vast, their activities divergent, and the \ndifficulties they face to stay in business are numerous. To provide the \nnecessary support to help them, SBA's Office of Advocacy needs our \nsupport.\n  The responsibility and authority given the Office of Advocacy and the \nChief Counsel are crucial to their ability to be an effective \nindependent voice in the Federal Government for small businesses. When \nthe Senate Committee on Small Business held a Roundtable meeting about \nthe Office of Advocacy with small business concerns on April 21, 1999, \nevery person in the room was concerned about the present and future \nstate of affairs for the Office of Advocacy. These small businesses \nasked us to do everything we could to protect and strengthen this \nimportant office. I believe this legislation accomplishes this \nimportant goal.\n  I have always been a strong supporter of the Office of Advocacy and I \nurge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent the committee amendments be \nagreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 395), as amended, was read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                 S. 395\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Independent Office of \n     Advocacy Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) excessive regulations continue to burden United States \n     small business concerns;\n       (2) Federal agencies are reluctant to comply with the \n     requirements of chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code, and \n     continue to propose regulations that impose disproportionate \n     burdens on small business concerns;\n       (3) the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business \n     Administration (referred to in this Act as the ``Office'') is \n     an effective advocate for small business concerns that can \n     help to ensure that agencies are responsive to small business \n     concerns and that agencies comply with their statutory \n     obligations under chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code, \n     and under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness \n     Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-121; 106 Stat. 4249 et seq.);\n       (4) the independence of the Office is essential to ensure \n     that it can serve as an effective advocate for small business \n     concerns without being restricted by the views or policies of \n     the Small Business Administration or any other executive \n     branch agency;\n       (5) the Office needs sufficient resources to conduct the \n     research required to assess effectively the impact of \n     regulations on small business concerns; and\n\n[[Page S2917]]\n\n       (6) the research, information, and expertise of the Office \n     make it a valuable adviser to Congress as well as the \n     executive branch agencies with which the Office works on \n     behalf of small business concerns.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that the Office has the statutory \n     independence and adequate financial resources to advocate for \n     and on behalf of small business concerns;\n       (2) to require that the Office report to the Chairmen and \n     Ranking Members of the Committees on Small Business of the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives and the Administrator \n     of the Small Business Administration in order to keep them \n     fully and currently informed about issues and regulations \n     affecting small business concerns and the necessity for \n     corrective action by the regulatory agency or the Congress;\n       (3) to provide a separate authorization for appropriations \n     for the Office;\n       (4) to authorize the Office to report to the President and \n     to the Congress regarding agency compliance with chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code; and\n       (5) to enhance the role of the Office pursuant to chapter 6 \n     of title 5, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 4.

My colleague from Wisconsin is here, and my good friend \nfrom Nebraska is in the room. I oppose the Hagel amendment. I guess \npeople always concern themselves. Chuck Hagel happens to be a good \nfriend of mine, someone I admire immensely as a Member of this body. We \nhave worked together on issues on numerous occasions. So my opposition, \nwhile it will come as no great surprise, is not rooted in anything \npersonal at all; it is a substantive disagreement, and my admiration \nfor him is in no way diminished, even though we disagree.\n  I wish to focus on one aspect. Senator Feingold talked about the soft \nmoney aspects. My concern is that and also the raising of the hard \nmoney limitation. I know this gets lost on some people. There are \ndistinctions between soft and hard money. To the average citizen, money \nis money, and they get confused between what is hard and what is soft \nmoney. But the hard money increases are troubling to me in that we \nraise it from $1,000 to $3,000 an individual.\n  Let me translate that. That is really raising it from $2,000 to \n$6,000 because you contribute both to the primary and the general \nelection.\n  Let me get even more realistic. As a practical matter, when we call \nfor contributions and there is a married couple, we usually get double \nthat amount. So instead of $2,000 or $4,000, we are now talking about \n$12,000 for that couple.\n  Those are the practicalities, and everybody who has ever raised money \nknows exactly what I am talking about. All of a sudden, we have gone \nfrom $4,000 to $12,000, plus we raise the individual total amount for a \ncalendar year to $75,000, and then double that, really, because it is \n$150,000.\n  Now we are getting into the bizarre world where there are \nindividuals--and of course not many in the country can do it; we are \ntold it is really not enough because we ought to index it according to \nthe consumer price index or some other parameter, much as we do with \nSocial Security recipients or people on food stamps who are having a \nhard time feeding their families. We are going to index how much you \ncan give, how much more access you can have to the process for the less \nthan a fraction of the top 1 percent of the American public who could \neven begin to think about writing a check for $150,000 per calendar \nyear to support the candidates of their choice.\n  As we look at this, just to put it in perspective, we had .08 percent \nof the population who actually gave $1,000 or more during the same \nperiod in 1999-2000. There were 1,128 individuals who gave $25,000 \nannual aggregate maximums to candidates. So, unbelievable as it is, \nhere we are debating the need to raise contribution levels to benefit \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of 1,200 to maybe 2,000 people in the \ncountry.\n  How many Americans can write a check for $150,000 in hard money? \nObviously, very few. The idea somehow we are impoverished as candidates \nand we therefore need to raise the limits so people who fall into that \ncategory can write checks for us--only in this bizarre world could we \neven be talking about these numbers in this context.\n  My hope is Members will not be tempted to go this route. We ought to \nbe looking for ways to reduce the amount of money in politics. There \nare those who disagree with me on this, but I think we are awash in it. \nIt is running the risk of moving our very system of democracy into deep \ntrouble. There is no issue more important than this one.\n  The other issues we will have come before us are significant, but \nthis goes right to the heart of who we are as a people, who can run for \npublic office, who can get elected to public office. Our failure to do \nsomething about it places, as I said the other day, our democracy, in \nmy view, in peril.\n\n  So, reluctantly, because he is a good friend of mine, I will oppose \nthe amendment of Senator Hagel. I think we can do better. There will be \nalternatives offered this week that I think will be more attractive, \nand therefore I urge the rejection of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/26/senate-section/article/S2918-5", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2918-S2921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUT\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am going to use this time at this late \nhour, not to talk about the subject that has been before the Senate \nmost of the day but, rather, to an issue that I think is dominating the \nattention of the American people even more than the question of \ncampaign finance reform, and that is what is happening in their \nwallets, what is happening to their economic well-being.\n  We went through a long Presidential campaign in the year 2000. During \nthat campaign there was considerable discussion about tax policy, \nfiscal policy, the direction of the economy. Each of the candidates \ntended to mark out their own position.\n  Then Governor Bush basically said, beginning before the Iowa caucuses \nin January of 2000, that taxes were too high; that the surplus was \ngenerating more money than the Federal Government could intelligently \nutilize, and therefore a significant amount of that surplus should be \nreturned to the taxpayers. He laid out a specific plan to return $1.6 \ntrillion of an estimated $5.6 trillion surplus; about a $2.6 trillion \nsurplus minus the Social Security and Medicare trust fund.\n  The Democratic candidate, Vice President Gore, said we should have a \ntax policy targeted to achieve a set of specific economic and social \npurposes. They ranged from education to encourage more people to send \ntheir children to college, to continue their own personal education in \na changing economy, to energy conservation: How could we use the Tax \nCode to encourage a set of incentives for conservation?\n  I suggest that just as the long campaign of 2000 finally ground \nitself to an\n\n[[Page S2919]]\n\nend, those arguments have, similarly, ground themselves to an end. What \nwe have come to realize is that the issue no more is how to return an \nunending gusher of surpluses or how to target in a very clinical, \nalmost surgical sense, tax relief in order to achieve specific economic \nand social purposes; rather, the question before us now is, What should \nthe National Government be doing in a time of unexpected economic \nslowdown?\n  We even had, in the period of the transition, the Vice President-\nelect state the ``R'' word. He began to use the suggestion that we \nmight be in or close to a recession.\n  If that is true, and if we are clearly--as we are--in a slowdown, and \nif in fact we are moving to an even more serious economic situation, it \nis largely because consumers have suddenly lost confidence in their own \nfuture and in our Nation's economic future, and they have stopped \nspending. Since two-thirds of the Nation's economic output is \npredicated on the ability of consumers to spend and consume that \noutput, that starts a process of a downward cycle. Spending slows on a \ngrand scale. The economy slows. Layoffs begin. Pay cuts materialize. \nThe cycle intensifies. The disease that may have started out largely in \nour heads is now in our bank accounts.\n  Colleagues, we are in the throes of that illness today.\n  Just a few statistics over the past couple of months:\n  Layoffs totaling 275,000 jobs have been announced, and they have been \nannounced from some of the businesses that we regard as the mainstays \nof America's consumer economy, such as last week's announcement of \nProcter & Gamble. This bad news has led to a 35-point plunge in the \nconsumer confidence index from an all-time high of 142.5 just as \nrecently as September of 1995.\n  I think the good news in this dreary circumstance is that we do not \nhave to stand on the sidelines as spectators and let the hand of the \nmarket control our destiny. We have the ability to take some steps that \nwould soften the impact of a declining economy that might be able to \neven buy an economic insurance policy to protect us against an \nunnecessarily long or deep economic decline.\n  Part of that ability is being exercised by the Federal Reserve Board \nas it has started the process of ratcheting down the interest rate \nincreases which it ratcheted up over the preceding couple of years.\n  We also have the opportunity to play a role not as a spectator but as \na participant through our control of fiscal policy.\n  In the past, Democrats would have said the fiscal policy that we want \nto follow is one to accelerate spending: Let's spend more money as a \nmeans of generating greater economic activity. Today, some of us who \nare the descendents of the Presiding Officer's noble son, Thomas \nJefferson, believe that the step we need to take to stimulate the \neconomy is to put additional dollars in the pockets of American \nfamilies so that they can make the decision as to where to spend, and \nthose decisions and the increased confidence they have will cause \nadditional dollars to go into their pockets, and we will begin to \nattack this psychology of despair which has become such a significant \nreason for the decline in consumer demand.\n  I believe that stimulative tax cuts in this year of 2001 and in the \nyear 2002 are what are required of Members of the Congress to play our \nrole as active participants in avoiding an unnecessarily severe \neconomic downturn. I believe there are some characteristics those tax \ncuts should have. I believe that is where the debate is today.\n  As recently as a month ago, if you had said I believe we ought to use \nthe resources that are available through our surplus for an economic \nstimulus in tax cuts, you could not have commanded a majority on the \nRepublican side because there would have been objection as to the \ndirection in which you were suggesting the tax cuts flow. And you would \nnot have gotten a majority on the Democratic side because they would \nhave said tax cuts are too large in terms of our overall allocation of \nthe surplus, and maybe a question as to whether tax cuts could make any \ndifference as a stimulative matter at all.\n\n  I believe that argument has now been decided, that the American \npeople want us to--and the American people have concluded correctly, in \nmy opinion, that it will be in their economic best interest if we \nprovide an immediate significant tax stimulus.\n  The American people understand what some of the characteristics of \nthat tax stimulus must be. That tax stimulus must be large enough to \nmake a difference. We might argue at the edges as to what the numbers \nwould be, but my suggestion, based on the advice of a range of \nprominent economists, is that we need to be able to inject into the \neconomy during calendar year 2001 at least $60 billion in tax cuts; \nand, if we can do so, we can anticipate that the gross national \ndomestic product will grow by one-half to three-quarters of a \npercentage point greater than it would have grown had we not taken that \naction.\n  Senator Corzine, who joins us now, and I have developed a formula \nthat we believe meets the criteria of an effective economic stimulus. \nThat formula came from an idea in President Bush's tax proposal; that \nis, that we create a new 10-percent tax bracket; that that tax bracket \ncover taxable income for single Americans up to the first $9,500 of \ntheir taxable income; and that for joint filers, for married couples, \nit would be up to $19,000 of taxable income; the first $19,000 would be \ntaxed at the 10-percent rate; and that all of those would be effective \nas quickly as Congress could pass it but made retroactive to January 1, \n2001.\n  That simple, easily enacted withholding rate change would result in \nsingle Americans this year--calendar year 2001--receiving a $475 tax \ncut if they had taxable income of $19,000 or more. For married couples, \nit would result in a $950 tax cut for the year 2001. Our proposal would \ncontinue this as a permanent change in the law, so those same \nreductions would be applicable in each future year.\n  This plan is not deceptively simple; it is truly simple. That is why \nit would work. Taxpayers will see it. They will understand it. They \nwill feel comfortable that this is not a one-time ``manna'' from \nHeaven; that it represents a permanent change in their tax \nrelationship. They would feel comfortable as early as this summer in \nbeginning to incorporate that into their economic expectations.\n  While this tax relief is broad based--every American taxpayer, single \nor married, who pays Federal income tax would be a beneficiary of this \nplan--it would provide the largest portion of the relief to middle-\nincome families. That is not a statement based on class warfare or a \nstatement based on fairness; it is a statement based on sheer economic \nreality.\n  There is a correlation between the tendency of people to spend and \nthe amount of their income. The lower the income, the greater \npropensity there is that the new additional dollar that would come by \nreducing tax rates would actually move quickly into the bloodstream of \nthe American economy. So we are, for that reason, since our goal is to \nstimulate the demand side of the economy, suggesting this single rate \nchange as the most effective means of getting that immediate surge of \naction in our economic bloodstream. It is large enough to make a \ndifference but it is not so large as to crowd out other important \nbudget priorities.\n  While it is a substantial share of this year's budget surplus--\napproximately $2 out of every $3 of the non-Social Security, non-\nMedicare surplus in 2001 would be committed for this purpose--its claim \non future surpluses is much smaller.\n  If I could contrast this with other proposals that are before the \nCongress and before the American people: The President has a total tax \nplan of $1.6 trillion. That compares over 10 years with approximately \n$693 billion that would be the cost of the 10-percent plan Senator \nCorzine and I are advocating. But there are other differences beyond \njust the sheer scale of the tax measure.\n  The President's plan would be largely backloaded. Most of the tax \nbenefits would come in the last 4 or 5 years of the 10-year cycle. In \nfact, in the year 2001, when I believe the stimulus is most needed, the \ntax cut in the President's plan is only $183 million. That contrasts \nwith the $60 billion Senator Corzine and I believe is the appropriate \nlevel of stimulus for this economy.\n  Another plan that is before the Congress and has already passed the \nHouse\n\n[[Page S2920]]\n\nof Representatives is the Ways and Means proposal: The first phase of \nthe President's tax plan, which is limited to changes in marginal rates \nof the income Tax Code for personal filers.\n  In my judgment, this, too, falls far short of what is needed because \nit would only provide $11 billion of so-called stimulus in 2001. Eleven \nbillion dollars is better than $183 million, but neither of them are \nadequate to the task of providing the stimulus that our economy needs. \nAnd these packages do not target those taxpayers who are the most \nlikely to use this money, to spend this money in the ways that would \nbest advance our economy.\n  Three-quarters of all taxpayers do not pay beyond the 15-percent \nbracket as it is currently calculated. That means that three-quarters \nof all taxpayers have total taxable income of less than $45,000, which \nis the top of the 15-percent rate. Yet nearly 60 percent of the total \ncost of both the President's plan and the House Ways and Means's plan \nis devoted to persons who earn more than $45,000 in taxable income.\n  Again, this is not an issue of class warfare. It is an issue that \nthose higher income folks are less likely than the middle- and lower-\nincome Americans to spend that money and, therefore, create the \nstimulus in the economy.\n  As I have said, Senator Corzine and I have been very impressed with \nthe President's excellent idea of creating this new 10-percent bracket. \nWe think that deserves to be the centerpiece, the focus, of an economic \ninsurance policy that we can enact soon.\n  What would this mean for a middle-class American family? With the \nkind of cut we provide, they could almost buy a new Dell computer. They \ncould buy a new RCA 36-inch stereo color TV. They could buy a week's \nvacation in Florida. We all agree that America's hard-working families \ndeserve that computer, that color TV, and especially that Florida \nvacation. We all agree that America's workers need job security. Now \nlet's agree on a tax cut that can stimulate the economy and make that \njob security happen for all Americans this year.\n  I am afraid that we are about to move from the chapter in which the \ndebate was over: Should we have an economic stimulus, a chapter that I \nthink has ended--we now have broad agreement that should be the title \nof whatever tax relief we provide first in the year 2001--and we are \nnow about to go into a debate on which is the most perfect way to get \nto that objective. That then fall prey to exactly the comments that the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Mr. Alan Greenspan, made in \nFebruary to the Senate Budget Committee when he said he was skeptical \nabout an economic stimulus tax plan, not because it did not have the \neconomic potential but he did not believe that the Congress had the \ncapacity to enact it quickly enough to make a difference; that the \nhistory of these efforts to use the Tax Code to stimulate the economy \nhas been that a good idea was birthed but it was never nurtured quickly \nenough to be fully available while the problems still existed.\n\n  To me, it is critical we have a plan that is simple and direct \nenough, that is sufficiently shorn of controversy that it can be \nenacted, ideally by the first of July, so that it could begin to affect \npaychecks in August of this year.\n  We need to be bold and aggressive and recognize that this is our time \nto step out of the boxes above the arena down to the floor and become \nan active participant in assisting American families in dealing with \nthis serious problem of a declining economy and the effect that it is \nhaving on the quality of their lives and on their psychological sense \nof the future for their families and our Nation.\n  We have the opportunity to do so. We should grasp that opportunity \nnow.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair thanks the Senator from Florida.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to endorse the concepts about \nwhich the Senator from Florida has spoken this evening and to make the \npoint that the economic necessity of this grows clearer every day.\n  There is a need for a stimulative package, and it needs to be brought \nto bear in the quickest possible fashion. The apparentness of that need \nis reflected very clearly in the economic indicators we see reported \nalmost daily, apart from what many people talk about in most of their \nconversations, which is the stock market, which is an important \nindicator of future economic conditions.\n  We see a pattern of deterioration currently in place that needs to be \nfocused on, particularly the pattern of layoffs coming out of corporate \nAmerica. Those are broadening and are reflective of underlying \nrecession business conditions, if not more broadly in the economy.\n  This substantial deterioration is beginning to show up in consumer \nconfidence numbers. At the end of last week we saw a deterioration in \nnew home sales which reflects underlying consumer confidence. As we \nknow, it is about 65 percent of our economic engine in the United \nStates. These kinds of conditions are most properly underscored, most \nvividly underscored by actions taken by one of America's most important \nconsumer companies, Procter & Gamble, which reported last week they \nwould be laying off 9,500 people. This is another indication of growing \neconomic weakness.\n  Add to that that there are problems in our international sector, the \nreported deterioration in the Japanese economy. The central bank in \nJapan actually lowered their interest rates to zero percent trying to \nstimulate the economy. This is important because it demonstrates that \nif you only depend on monetary policy, as opposed to a combination of \nmonetary and fiscal policy, you sometimes can lead the horse to water \nbut it won't necessarily drink, and you won't get the kind of stimulus \nwe need to make sure that this economy is secure; that we keep job \ngrowth increasing. International weakness is also one that we need to \nbe concerned about, particularly in Asia, but we are seeing early signs \nof weakness in Europe as well.\n  Right now we are depending far too much on monetary policy, where the \nFederal Reserve has moved, on a proportionate basis, actually faster, \ncertainly than I have ever seen in my own personal experience, with \nthree 50-basis-point cuts in interest rates in less than 2\\1/2\\ months, \na very substantial move percentage-wise on interest rates. It is even \nmore imperative that we move to have a fiscal stimulus as a partnership \nwith the Federal Reserve to get that stimulus going. That needs to be \nsubstantial. It needs to be done efficiently and speedily. It needs to \nbe sustainable.\n  Too often, one-time cuts go into savings. Most economic thought would \nshow that single one-time payments tend to go to savings as opposed to \nconsumption. The plan Senator Graham and I are proposing is one that is \nintended to be substantial but sustainable through time. People can \ncount on that tax cut over a longer period of time. It changes consumer \nconfidence. It changes their way of how they are going to look at \nfuture earnings. They can discount that to the future. We think that \nwill end up having a meaningful impact on current economic conditions. \nIn fact, it is an economic insurance policy. If we are wrong and we are \nnot in a recession, this is a good thing because it will boost economic \ngrowth. But if we fall into a slower period where recession actually \ntakes place, and you never know that until after the fact, then we have \na fiscal stimulus in place to go hand in hand with monetary policy.\n\n  We believe strongly that this is a proposal that does reflect balance \non many of the competing arguments we see. It is a direct lead-in from \nwhere the President suggested a 15- to a 10-percent cut. We just give \nit now as opposed to in future years. We think this is an important \nprecondition to make sure we have a strong economy that will allow for \nall boats to rise on that rising tide.\n\n[[Page S2921]]\n\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to support the arguments and \ndescription of the program Senator Graham, my friend from Florida, has \nproposed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/26/senate-section/article/S2921-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:15 A.M.
