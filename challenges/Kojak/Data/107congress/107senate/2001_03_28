There will be up to 30 minutes of debate prior to the vote at \n9:45 a.m. Following the vote, another amendment regarding hard money is \nexpected to be offered by Senator Feinstein.

Everybody will agree that \nwe have had full, and some would even say good, debate on this subject. \nI think it has been handled in a fair way. I think we are going to be \ntested this morning in the next 3 hours to see if that will be the way \nit continues. I am concerned about things I have heard regarding how \nthe Thompson amendment and others would be considered. I urge the \nSenate to continue in not only the words of the unanimous consent \nagreement but in the spirit and make sure each Senator has an \nopportunity to have his or her amendment fully considered and fairly \nvoted upon.\n  If that doesn't occur, then I think it could lead to other \ncomplications, and I will be prepared to become engaged in trying to \nmake sure that this remains on an even keel.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/28/senate-section/article/S3005-7", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. 27, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 27) to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     of 1971 to provide bipartisan campaign reform.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Specter amendment No. 140, to provide findings regarding \n     the current state of campaign finance laws and to clarify the \n     definition of electioneering communication.\n       Thompson amendment No. 149, to modify and index \n     contribution limits.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 149\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of the Thompson amendment No. 149 \non which there shall be 30 minutes for closing remarks.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, as was stated, we are here to consider \nour amendment to modestly raise the hard money limits that can be \ncontributed to candidates. We should keep our focus on what this whole \nreform debate is about; that is, the concern over large amounts of \nmoney going to one individual and the appearances that come about from \nthat.\n\n[[Page S3006]]\n\n  What we are doing today is a part of helping that. It is not enough \njust to get rid of soft money and leave the hard money unrealistically \nlow limitations where they are. Everything will go to the independent \ngroups. We see how powerful they are now, and they are getting more and \nmore so.\n  Under the first amendment, they have the right to do that. It will be \neven more in the future when and if we do away with soft money. \nTherefore, we should not keep squeezing down the most legitimate, on \ntop of the table, limited, full disclosed parts of our campaign system, \nwhich is the hard money system which is now at $1,000.\n  It has not been indexed for inflation since 1974. All we are asking \nis that we come up to limits, not even bringing it up to inflation, \nwhich would turn the $1,000 limitation into about a $3,550 limitation. \nWe are not suggesting that. We are saying let's go to $2,500, \nsubstantially below inflation and the other numbers commensurate with \nthat.\n  If those limits did not have corruption significance and appearance \nproblems in 1974, they do not today because we are actually giving the \ncandidate less purchasing power than we gave him in 1974, and the \nreason we are having to bump it up in the increments that we are is \nbecause we have not done anything for all of that time.\n  I think the most salutary benefit of raising the hard money limits \njust a little bit and to the parties just a little--let the parties \nhave some money to do the things they are supposed to do--no corporate \nmoney, no union money, no soft money, but hard money to the parties. \nLet them be raised, too, again below inflation. The effect of that \nwould be to benefit challengers.\n  I engaged in a little colloquy with my friend from New York as to how \nin the world somebody in New York, who wants to run as a challenger in \nNew York, under the $1,000 limitation, or how in the world would a \nchallenger in the State of California or the State of Texas or any \nother big State--or small State for that matter, but especially large \nStates--get enough money to run as a challenger under these present-day \nlimitations?\n  They will not even try anymore, and we will continue to have a system \nmade up of nothing but multimillionaires and professional politicians \nwho have Rolodexes big enough to barely fit in the trunk of an \nautomobile.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Did the Senator see the full-page ad yesterday in the \nWashington Post?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I did not.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. A full-page ad paid for by an individual named Jerome \nKohlberg, a billionaire, who is financing a lot of the effort on behalf \nof the underlying legislation, which I know the Senator from Tennessee \nsupports.\n  I bring it up only to underscore the point the Senator is making. To \nthe extent you weaken the parties, these people are going to control \nthe game. This particular individual put a half a million dollars in \nagainst Senator Jim Bunning in his campaign in 1998.\n  The point, I gather, I heard the Senator from Tennessee making, to \nthe extent you totally weaken the parties--they already lost money. We \nknow that 40 percent of the RNC and DNC budget is gone. What the \nSenator from Tennessee is doing, as I understand it, is giving the \nparties a chance to compete against the billionaires.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Exactly, and the candidates a chance. Continue on with \nthose full-page ads. Spend millions of dollars on those full-page ads \nslamming the candidate. That is free speech, that is America, but let \nthe candidate have a fighting chance. Let him have some control over \nhis own campaign.\n  I am most disturbed to read in the newspaper that the leadership on \nthe other side, with whom I have worked on these reform measures, is \nsaying now that we can increase it this much, but if you go one \ncentimeter over that, they are going to be against the whole McCain-\nFeingold bill.\n  I ask how that considers those of us who have stood with McCain-\nFeingold, against those who say it will hurt their own party, through \nthick and thin over the years, to hear the other side now saying that \nif you go one centimeter over this level, which is still substantially \nbelow inflation, we are going to blow up the whole bill because it \ndisadvantages our party.\n  Are we back to trying to figure out which party is going to get a \nlittle advantage on the other party? Is that what this is all about? \nThat is what we have been fighting against. That is not reform.\n  The fact of the matter is, in all of these areas, we are in as much \nequilibrium from a party's standpoint as we are ever going to be. \nRaising these limits to a point that is far below what the writers in \n1974 wanted certainly does not tinge on corruption. It does nothing to \nweaken McCain-Feingold. It strengthens McCain-Feingold.\n  If you want a bill the Senate will pass, if you want a bill the House \nwill pass, if you want a bill the President will sign, then you will \nassist in raising these hard money limits up to a decent point.\n  We talk about a couple and treating a man and a wife as the same; the \nwife going to do exactly what the husband says, presumably. Raise those \nmoney limits. We are talking about $100,000. This is $100,000. Why not \nextend it over 4 years and say $200,000? You can get the theoretical \nlimits up as high as you wish as long as no large amounts are going to \nindividual candidates, as long as amounts are going to parties that \nunder the law and under all of the learned speculation about what the \nlaw will be in terms of these cases that are pending, you are still not \ngoing to be able to coordinate between the donor and the candidate. You \ngive to the party and the party can give to the candidate, but you \ncannot have that kind of coordination that was suggested on the floor. \nThat is just not the law.\n  Let us remember the purpose of this effort. This will strengthen this \neffort if we will raise these hard money limits. Give the candidates a \nfighting chance, give challengers a fighting chance, and not engage in \nsome class warfare: Because not everybody can contribute $2,500 then \nnobody ought to be allowed to contribute $2,500, even though it skews \nour system and it will ultimately result in these independent groups \ntotally taking over.\n  We will be back in here with a strong effort to get rid of all \nlimitations and total deregulation. That will be the result.\n\n  We often say do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. If that \nphrase ever applied, it applies today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nDodd.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I gather the opponents of this measure have \n15 minutes; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct; the opponents have \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Chair advise me when I have consumed 4 minutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Tennessee, as I said \nlast evening, I have great respect and admiration for him as a \ncolleague and as a Member of this body. I remind my good friend from \nTennessee that the McCain-Feingold bill, of which my friend from \nTennessee is a supporter and of which I am and a majority of us are, \nhas a $1,000 per capita limitation on hard money contributions.\n  That is what McCain-Feingold says. McCain-Feingold does not raise the \nhard dollar contributions at all. It limits PAC contributions to \n$5,000; contributions to parties to $10,000; $20,000 to national \nparties; and raises the aggregate limits from $25,000 to $30,000. There \nare increases in hard dollar contributions in McCain-Feingold. But our \ncolleague from Tennessee is suggesting we increase the hard dollar \ncontribution by 150 percent, from $1,000 to $2,500. The practical \nrealities are, it is $2,500 for the primary and $2,500 for the general, \nso we are talking a $5,000 base in that contribution; and as we solicit \nthe contributions from families, a husband and wife, that is really \n$10,000. We are going from $4,000 to $10,000. That is a significant \nincrease.\n\n  I realize costs have gone up in the last 24 years, but this jump from \n$1,000 to $2,500, the net effect of going from $4,000 to $10,000, is a \nrather large increase. When we take the aggregate limits from $25,000 \nto $50,000, that is a\n\n[[Page S3007]]\n\n100-percent increase, $50,000 per individual per calendar year. That is \na large amount of money.\n  If you subscribe to the notion that there is too much money in \npolitics, that we ought to try to get less or slow it down, so we don't \nhave the chart my friend from Tennessee showed last evening where the \ncosts have gone from $600,000 for a statewide race in 1976 to in excess \nof $7 million in the year 2000, 10 years from now, if you extrapolate \nthe numbers, we are looking at $13 million for the average cost of a \nSenate race.\n  When does this stop? When do we try to reverse this trend that I \ndon't think is a part of natural law? This is not natural law. The cost \nof campaigns has to go up exponentially?\n  There are those who believe there should be some increase--I accept \nthat--in the hard dollar. I am not happy, but I understand there should \nbe some increase.\n  My plea is the one I made last evening to my friend from Tennessee, \nwho I know is a strong supporter of McCain-Feingold and has been for \nseveral years; he is not a Johnny Come Lately to the reform effort. We \nought to be able to find some common ground between his proposal and \nthose who agree with McCain-Feingold, who believe and understand there \nshould be some increase, and to find some number we can support.\n  There are many people who support the amendment of the Senator from \nTennessee who ultimately will vote against McCain-Feingold. I think \nthey are hoping to get this number up so high that there will be people \non this side who do support McCain-Feingold but can't in good \nconscience if the number is so high that it makes a mockery of reform. \nThere is sort of a three-dimensional chess game going on here.\n  My appeal to my colleague from Tennessee is, while we will vote on \nhis amendment in 15 minutes, I suspect there will be a tabling motion, \nand I suspect there is a possibility the tabling motion may prevail. If \nit does, that may be a time in which we can begin to sit down and see \nif we cannot resolve some of this issue. I don't think the differences \nhave to be that great; There can be some common ground.\n  My plea would be for those who support McCain-Feingold, to try to \nseek that level of increase that is acceptable, although not something \nmany of us would like to see but certainly a more moderate increase \nthan what is proposed.\n  I know we have several other colleagues who want to be heard on this \namendment. I will yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Minnesota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, putting more big money into politics is \nnot reform; it is deform. Saying that an individual can contribute as \nmuch as $5,000 a year to a candidate, that an individual can contribute \nas much as $100,000 a year in an aggregate to different political \nefforts, means two things. It means, first of all, that those who run \nfor office are going to be even more dependent on the top 1 percent of \nthe population. Is that reform?\n  It means the vast majority of the people in the country are now \nreally going to believe if you pay, you play, and if you don't pay, you \ndon't play. They will feel left out. And they should feel left out.\n  It is hard for me to believe that Senators want to go back home to \ntheir States and say, we have voted for reform by making it possible \nfor those people who are the heavy hitters and the well-connected and \nhave the money to have even more domination over politics today in our \ncountry. How are you going to explain that? Do you think it will be the \nschoolteachers who are going to be making $100,000 contributions per \nyear? Do you think it will be the hospital workers? Do you think it \nwill be the child care workers? Do you think it will be middle-income \npeople, working-income people, low- and moderate-income people, the \nmajority of people? One-quarter of 1 percent of the population \ncontributes over $200. One-ninth of 1 percent of the population \ncontributes over $1,000. Now you will take the lid off and make the \npeople with the big money even more important, with more influence over \npolitics? And you dare to call that reform?\n  This is one of the most frustrating and disappointing times for being \na Senator if we pass this amendment. My colleague from Tennessee talks \nabout class warfare. Let me put it a different way. This is fine for \nincumbents; I guess they get the money. I don't see myself getting \nthese big bucks. What about whoever wants to run for office as a \nchallenger but he or she is not connected to all these interests; they \nare not connected to people who are so well heeled; they represent \ndifferent people? There is not one Fannie Lou Hamer in the United \nStates. There is not one Fannie Lou Hamer. The truth of the matter is, \nthere will not be one Senator who will be able to represent a Fannie \nLou Hamer, a civil rights leader, a poor person, people without any \npower, and people without any money.\n  You are not going to get people elected any longer if you raise these \nlimits because no one is going to have a chance unless they have a \npolitics that appeals to people who have all of the economic clout. \nWhat kind of reform is this?\n  I think this amendment, if it passes, is a potential ``deal \nbreaker.'' And my colleague from Tennessee says we cannot let the \nperfect be the enemy of the good. I say to my colleague from Tennessee, \nthe question is whether or not we have the good any longer. The \nquestion is whether or not we have the good any longer. We take the \ncaps off; we bring more big money into politics; we now make hard money \ncontributions essentially soft money.\n  One hundred thousand dollars per year? How many couples in the State \nof Minnesota can contribute $200,000 a year? How many people in \nMinnesota can contribute that? And we call this reform?\n  This amendment has that made-for-Congress look. This amendment has \nthat pro-incumbent look. This amendment has that pro-money, big money \nlook.\n  I ask, where are the reformers? Why aren't we making an all-out \nfight? Why aren't people saying this is the deal breaker? We are \ngetting to the point where it is a very real question, if this kind of \namendment passes, whether we even have the good any longer. I hope this \namendment will be defeated.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Does the Senator from New Jersey wish to speak?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. If the Senator will yield time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am informed we have 7\\1/2\\ minutes. I yield the \nremaining time to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nyielding. I compliment him on his leadership on this issue.\n  This is a regrettable debate in the McCain-Feingold reform question \nbecause it is in some measure a distinction without a difference. This \nis a matter that should have been and should still be settled.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is offering an amendment that allows a \n$2,500 individual contribution per election. I believe it is the right \nlevel. Some of my colleagues have been apoplectic, that this is an \nextraordinary change in the system; it would destroy the campaign \nfinance system. The only right and proper thing for the Republic is to \nhave a $2,000 individual campaign limit.\n\n  Our Republic must be weak, indeed, if that $500 is the difference \nbetween reform and destruction for the whole national campaign finance \nsystem.\n  I believe Senator Thompson has struck an appropriate level. Indeed, \nthe $2,500 level that he has established is less, accounting for \ninflation, than the reforms of 1974. Indeed, in adjusted dollars, the \n$1,000 limit of 1974 is now worth $300. That $1,000, if adjusted for \ninflation today, would be $3,400.\n  Let me explain to my colleagues why I feel so strongly about raising \nthis limit. My hope and wish is we could have reached a compromise on \nthis level. Real campaign finance reform means creating a balanced \nsystem. We cannot reform just one part of the campaign finance system. \nDifferent aspects must be adjusted for a balanced, workable system.\n  Can I have order, Mr. President?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will come to order. \nSenators will please take their conversations off the floor so the \nSenator from New Jersey can be heard and other Senators can hear the \nSenator from New Jersey as well.\n\n[[Page S3008]]\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, a balanced system must include a \nreduction of costs to end this spiraling cost of campaigns that adds so \nmuch pressure on Senate and House candidates. We did that by reducing \nthe cost of television time.\n  We must eliminate soft money to increase confidence on accountability \nof these funds, and limits so every American believes they have an \nappreciably equal influence on their government.\n  We must ensure that not only the wealthy can get access to \nfundraising and their own ability to dominate the system is limited.\n  But there is another component that perhaps only Members of Congress \nthemselves understand, another element of reform. It is the question of \ntime. How much time are Senators taking, raising funds rather than \nlegislating? How much time with their constituents rather than at \nfundraisers? How many times do they meet ordinary Americans rather than \nsimply being with the wealthy and privileged few.\n  That last element is part of what Senator Thompson is trying to \naccomplish today. Because the $1,000 limit forces people to go to \nhundreds and hundreds of fundraisers, putting together these \ncontributions to fund these massive campaigns is part of the problem. \nIndeed, I demonstrated to the Senate a few days ago what it would take \nto run a $15 million campaign today at $1,000. You would raise $20,000 \nevery day, 7 days a week for 2 years; 1,500 fundraising events at \n$10,000 per event. This is part of what we are addressing. If a person, \nindeed, contributes $2,500 per election, $5,000 a year, no one in this \ninstitution can possibly believe that either by perception or reality \nthe integrity of a Senator is compromised.\n  Indeed, if our country has come to the point where the American \npeople have their confidence in their government undermined because of \na $2,500 contribution, there is no saving this Republic. Certainly, we \nhave better people in the Senate.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If the Senator will yield, I understand the Senator has \nabout 2 minutes left. Will the Senator yield about 30 seconds of that \nto me?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I will yield 1 minute and I will conclude.\n  I believe with the Thompson amendment we will have this balanced \nsystem reducing the amount of time candidates must campaign, and \nsufficient hard money can be raised to be able to communicate a \nmessage. It is a workable and a balanced system. Mostly I regret we \nhave to divide ourselves on this issue, a $500 difference between the \nSenator from California and the Senator from Tennessee. Even at this \nlate moment, I wish we could bridge this gap. But I hope we can avoid \ncoming to the conclusion that because this amendment is agreed to, \nsomehow we have a less viable reform. This is still fundamental and \ncomprehensive reform. It still reduces the amount of campaign \nexpenditures and the reliance on large contributions. It is a better \nsystem under McCain-Feingold, and it is a system that now includes the \nsupport of more Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle.\n  I yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will save what little remaining time I have and defer \nto my colleagues on the other side who oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Five minutes for the opposition.\n  Mr. DODD. I don't know if I have any other people who wish to be \nheard on this amendment, so I will take a couple of minutes and close.\n  Let me say to my friend from New Jersey that my hope is that also we \nwill find some level that we can support. I said that last evening; I \nsaid it again this morning; I say it again this moment. There is a \ndifference. For those of us who have long supported McCain-Feingold and \nvariations of that and other such suggestions over the years, it would \nbe a great tragedy, in our view, to finally close the door on soft \nmoney and then open up the barn doors on the other side for a flood of \nhard money.\n  To paraphrase Shakespeare, a rose by any other name is just as sweet. \nA dollar coming through one door or another door still poses the same \nproblem.\n  What I reject is the idea that there is too little money in politics \nor there must be some inevitable, unstoppable increase in the cost of \ncampaigns. Unsettled as I am about that, what really troubles and \nbothers me is who we are excluding. I said it last evening, and I will \nrepeat it.\n  As we go and seek out these larger contributors, which is what we do \nevery time we increase those amounts, we get further and further and \nfurther away from what most, the overwhelming majority of Americans, \ncan participate in.\n  I think that is unhealthy in America. If we end up saying $50,000 per \nindividual per year--$2,500--Mr. President, there are only a handful of \npeople in this country--last year there were 1,200 people out of 280 \nmillion who made contributions of $125,000 to politicians; 1,200. And \nwe are saying it is not enough; we have to raise those amounts even \nfurther.\n  As we do that, we get further away from the average citizen of \nVirginia, Connecticut, Tennessee, and New Jersey. As we get further \naway from that individual who can write the $25, $50, $100 check \nbecause we are not interested in them any longer, it is no longer \nvaluable for our time to seek that level of support. That is dangerous \nwhen we start excluding people from the process.\n\n  My concern about this amendment is not just that it puts us on a \ntrack that we are going after bigger contributors, giving more access, \nbut it is also whom we exclude--de facto, whom we exclude, and that is \npeople who cannot even begin to think about this kind of level of \ncontribution.\n  That is dangerous for the body politic. It is dangerous for \ndemocracy, in my view, when we or those who challenge us will only be \ngoing after those who can write these huge checks. And they are huge. \nOnly here could we be talking about $2,000 as a modest increase.\n  Who are we talking about? How many Americans could sit down and write \na check for that amount--for anything, for that matter, let alone for a \npolitician? I am supposed to somehow believe this is reasonable, when \nwe ought to be doing everything we can to engage more people in the \nprocess.\n  I accept the reality there is going to be some increase. My plea \nwould be to the author of this amendment and to those who also seek \nincreases, to see if we cannot find some agreement that will be \nacceptable, but please don't try to convince me there is just an \ninevitable path we have to go down that continues to ratchet up the \ncost of these campaigns, shrinks the pool of those who can seek public \noffice, and further excludes the overwhelming majority of Americans \nfrom financially participating in the political life of this country.\n  That is a dangerous path. That is a very dangerous path. I suggest we \nwill come to rue the day in the not too distant future of having \ntraveled this road, closing the soft money door and swinging wide open \nthe hard money door and suggesting somehow we have achieved a great \naccomplishment.\n  We have an opportunity this morning to do both, to have a modest \nincrease in hard money and to close down that soft money door. And then \nwe can truly say we have reformed this process after 25 years of \nbickering about it. And I believe the President would sign it.\n  With all due respect to my colleague from Tennessee, I will oppose \nthis amendment and urge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. One minute on each side remains.\n  Mr. DODD. I think there is going to be a tabling motion. Maybe my \ncolleague would like to complete his argument and then have Senator \nFeingold make his and move to table. Do you want to yield back?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will yield back part of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield a half minute to my colleague from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have worked real hard to close the soft \nmoney loophole with one hand. We are hopefully going to do that after a \nhuge amount of work. We cannot and should not with the other hand \nundermine\n\n[[Page S3009]]\n\npublic confidence by raising the hard money limits from $25,000 per \nyear to $50,000 per year for an individual. That is too much money. It \nis corruptive in its appearance, and it undermines public confidence.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is out of time.\n  Mr. DODD. I apologize to the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, should we achieve our dream of passing \nthis bill, there are just four or five Senators who are said to be \nresponsible for it. One of them is Senator Fred Thompson. So I regret \nthat this amendment is too high and I have to oppose it. His attitude \nand his spirit on this bill has been stalwart, and I am grateful to \nhim. It is necessary, though, that I have to move to table the \namendment at the appropriate time. I will do that after his remarks.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I simply remind my colleagues that we \nare here about $100,000 contributions, $200,000 contributions, and \n$500,000 contributions. That is what this debate is all about. There is \na difference from that and raising the hard money limit from $1,000 and \n$2,000 or $500--whichever commentator says it--which is just and \nreasonable and substantially below inflation. This will help McCain-\nFeingold, not hurt it.\n  I yield the rest of my time. I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I move to table the Thompson amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table the Thompson \namendment. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 46, nays 54, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 53 Leg.]\n\n                                Yeas--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The motion was rejected.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). The majority \nleader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are very close to a unanimous consent \nrequest that will allow us to proceed to a conclusion on this issue of \nthe so-called hard money. I emphasize that I think what we should do at \nthis point is go to a straight vote on the Thompson amendment. The \nmotion to table was defeated by a considerable margin, and normally \nwhat we do, in an abundance of fairness, is go to a vote at that point \non the amendment that was not tabled.\n  Of course, there is continuing interest in this area, and Senator \nFeinstein has an amendment she wants to offer that will have a \ndifferent level for hard money and will affect not only individual \ncontributions but what individuals could give up and down the line, \nincluding to the parties.\n  The fair thing to do is have the two Senators have a chance to have a \ndirect vote side by side and not go through procedural hoops of second \ndegrees and motions to table. At some point, we should get to a vote, \nget a result, and move to either raise these limits or not.\n  I believe very strongly these limits need to be raised. They have not \nbeen modified in over 25 years. A lot has happened in 25 years. It is \npart of the fundraising chase with which Senators and Congressmen have \nto wrestle.\n  I am concerned what this is trying to do is set up a marathon or \nnegotiating process that drags the responsible Thompson amendment down \nfurther.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is the first time, as the leader \npointed out, during the long 8 days of this debate that the will of the \nSenate has not prevailed on an amendment. What is happening, of course, \nis those who were not successful on the Thompson amendment do not want \nto allow the Senate to adopt the amendment.\n  The negotiation that the majority leader is discussing presumably \nwill occur now over the next couple of hours, but it is important to \nnote that 54 Members of the Senate were prepared to adopt the Thompson \namendment and that apparently is going to be prevented for the first \ntime during the course of this debate.\n  I thank the leader.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I simply note that a motion to table \ndoes not mean one is prepared to vote for the underlying amendment. It \nmeans one is not prepared to table the amendment. I know, in fact, \nthere are some Members interested in the negotiating process and \nlooking for alternatives.\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand that, but I hope we do not negotiate it into a \nmeaningless number or right of people to participate further. Having \nsaid that, we have an agreement that I think we can accept at this \npoint that will get us to some straight up-or-down votes and \nconclusion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feinstein now be recognized to \noffer a second-degree amendment; that there be 90 minutes equally \ndivided in the usual form, to be followed by a vote in relation to the \nFeinstein amendment. If the amendment is tabled, a vote will \nimmediately occur on the Thompson amendment without any intervening \naction or debate. If the amendment is not tabled, there will be up to \n90 minutes for debate on both amendments running concurrently to be \nequally divided, and following that time, the Senate proceed to a vote \non the Thompson amendment to be followed by a vote on the Feinstein \namendment which will be modified to be a first-degree amendment. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that Senator Thompson have the right to \nmodify his amendment, with the concurrence of Senator Feinstein and \nSenator McConnell, if the motion to table the Feinstein amendment \nfails, and the modification must be offered prior to the vote on the \nThompson and the Feinstein amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I ask that following Senator \nMcConnell, we insert the name of our manager, Senator Dodd, in that \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to modify it to that extent, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, as I understand it, we have to have the \nconcurrence of the two managers of this bill before Senator Feinstein \nand I can set forth a modification or a perfection.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to Senator Reid for comment.\n  Mr. REID. We would be happy to eliminate Senator Dodd if Senator \nMcConnell were taken out so the two proponents of the two measures \nwould be the determining individuals as to whether or not there would \nbe a modification.\n\n[[Page S3010]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe Senator Thompson has a further comment.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I certainly want Senator McConnell and Senator Dodd to \nbe a part of this process and a part of the discussions and \nnegotiations, but I did not understand that we would necessarily have \nto have their concurrence in order for us to agree on a motion.\n  I don't think it would be appropriate, frankly.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is a process that allows time to debate \nfurther the provisions of the Thompson proposal and to debate the \nFeinstein proposal and for those that are trying to find some third way \nto negotiate, too.\n  I think in order to keep everybody calm and everybody comfortable in \ngoing forward, everybody ought to have a part and be aware of what \nchange might be entered into in terms of the modification. I think this \nis the way to guarantee that.\n  Senator Dodd, Senator McConnell, Senator Feinstein, Senator Reid, \neverybody has been, so far, dealing with this in a fair way, protecting \neach other's rights. We started off by a Senator not being allowed to \nmodify his amendment. It caused a pretty good uproar and everybody said \nwe don't want to do that.\n  I think we are swatting at ghosts when it is really not necessary.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Basically, what we are asking for is the concurrence of \nSenator McConnell and Senator Dodd. I hope that would be forthcoming to \nhave a vote on something that had been agreed to by all parties.\n  If not, the Senator from Tennessee has the right to pull down his \namendment and we would propose another amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. I say to Senator McCain, he is absolutely right. I could \nseek recognition and offer a modification, too. I am going to try to \nmake sure nobody gets cut out. Senator McCain was one of the ones who \nmade sure when we started this whole debate that the Senator was \nallowed to modify his own amendment. If there is an agreement reached, \nwe are going to find a way to get that done.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Under the consent agreement, it requires unanimous \nconsent to modify, anyway. I don't think anybody will unreasonably deny \nthat. But I don't think it is inappropriate for the managers of the \nbill to be a part of the negotiation.\n  Mr. REID. Everyone doesn't have to agree if this unanimous consent \nagreement goes forward. It is my understanding that the modification \nwould be under the direction of the two proponents of these two \namendments. The rest of us would not have to agree.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. My understanding is that under ordinary rules, absent \noverall agreement, if the Feinstein motion to table does not carry, it \nwould leave the Thompson amendment not tabled and the Feinstein \namendment not tabled. Ordinarily, I would have the right to come in at \nthat point with a motion or perfecting amendment. I am told because we \nare operating within the confines of an overall agreement, that right \nis no longer there. So we are operating on the basis of what is fair \nand what is expeditious.\n  I don't want to complicate the issue in having more players, more and \nmore players--as we are trying to refine this process and get a \nresolution, having more and more players involved. Obviously, everybody \nneeds to be involved and would have to be in order for us to get a good \nresolution, but I don't want to bog it down more than necessary.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I urge we go ahead and get this consent, get started, and \nstart talking and continue to try to find a way to move forward in good \nfaith, as we have done so far.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nmajority leader? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 151 to Amendment No. 149\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the senior Mississippi \nSenator, Mr. Cochran, the senior Senator from New York, and myself, I \nsend a second-degree perfecting amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered \n     151 to amendment No. 149.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to clarify \n                         contribution limits).\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     104.

Mr. President, let me begin quickly by going over \ncurrent law, McCain-Feingold, the Thompson amendment, and the \nFeinstein-Cochran-Schumer amendment.\n  Under current law, candidates in hard money are limited to $1,000 per \nelection or $2,000 a cycle. PACs are limited to $5,000 a calendar year, \nState and local parties to $5,000, national parties to $20,000, and the \naggregate limit that any individual can contribute to all of the above \nis $25,000 a year. That is present law.\n  McCain-Feingold keeps the $1,000 limit, keeps the limit on PACs at \n$5,000. State and local parties are doubled to $10,000 per calendar \nyear. National parties remain the same at $20,000 per calendar year. \nAnd the aggregate limit that an individual can contribute to all of the \nabove is $30,000 a calendar year, or $60,000 a cycle.\n  The Thompson amendment changes that. The limit on an individual \ncontribution goes to $2,500 an election or $5,000 a cycle. PACs go to \n$7,500 per calendar year. State and local parties stay the same as \nMcCain-Feingold at $10,000. National parties double to $40,000 a \ncalendar year or $80,000 a cycle. The aggregate limit is a substantial \nchange. It goes from $50,000 per calendar year to $100,000 a cycle.\n  What Senators Cochran, Schumer, and I propose is as follows: that a \ncandidate limit go to $2,000. That is a doubling of the $1,000 limit of \ncurrent law. The PACs remain the same as McCain-Feingold and as present \nlaw at $5,000 a calendar year. The State and local parties remain the \nsame as McCain-Feingold, and the national party's contributions remain \nthe same as McCain-Feingold.\n  We differ with McCain-Feingold, and I will make clear why. We raise \nthe aggregate per cycle, which is $60,000, under McCain-Feingold, to \n$65,000 a cycle. So we are just $5,000 more than McCain-Feingold. What \nwe do in this cycle to allow for flexibility and also to allow for \nparty building, we say of that $65,000, it is split as follows: $30,000 \nper election cycle can go to candidates, and $35,000 per election cycle \nto party committees and PACs. We also say the $2,000 cap on individual \ncontributions would be indexed for inflation.\n  So the substantial differences between McCain-Feingold and Feinstein-\nCochran-Schumer are on the candidate cap, which is doubled, which is \nfrom $60,000 to $65,000 with a split to encourage both giving to \ncandidates as well as to parties, and indexing per election to \ninflation, which I happen to believe is extraordinarily important.\n  Right now, individuals may contribute $1,000 to a House or Senate \ncandidate for the primary and another $1,000 for the general. As I \nsaid, we double that. We believe our amendment is necessary for the \nsimple reason the $1,000 limit was established in 1974. It hasn't been \nchanged since then. That was 27 years ago. Ordinary inflation has \nreduced the value of a $1,000 contribution to about one-third of what \nit was in 1974. The costs of campaigning have risen much faster than \ninflation.\n  In 1996, the Congressional Research Service cites figures to the \neffect that $4 billion was spent on elections in 1996, up from $540 \nmillion in 1976. So that is an eightfold increase in spending; an 800-\npercent increase in spending between 1976 and 1996.\n\n  Let me give some examples of how the cost of campaigning has soared \nsince that thousand dollar limit was established three decades ago. The \nbulk mailing permit rate in 1974 was 6 cents per piece. Today it is 25 \ncents per piece. If you send out mail, that is a substantial increase \nin cost. In 1990, when I ran a gubernatorial campaign in California, a \n30-second television spot run in the Los Angeles media market at 6 \no'clock at night cost $1,800, one spot. Last year, when I ran for \nreelection to the Senate, the same spot cost $3,000. That is a 67-\npercent increase in the cost of one television spot in 10 years.\n  In 1990, a 30-second spot run in the Los Angeles media market during \nprime time cost about $12,000; by 2000, it cost $22,000. That is an 83-\npercent increase. So bulk mail has gone up dramatically, television \nadvertising has gone up dramatically. If you come from a large State, \nyou cannot run a campaign without television advertising and without \nsome bulk mail.\n  The hard money contribution limits have been frozen now for 27 years. \nWhat has been the result? Is that result good or bad? Candidates, \nincumbents, and challengers have had to spend more and more time just \nraising money. What gets squeezed out in the process? Time with \nconstituents or, in the case of challengers, prospective constituents. \nI don't think that is good for our democracy.\n  Personally, in just this past election alone we have had to have over \n100 fundraisers, and that took a lot of time--time to call, time to \nattend, time to travel, time to say thanks. That was time I could not \nspend doing what I was elected to do.\n  So the task of raising hard money in small contributions, unadjusted \nfor inflation, is indeed increasingly daunting. Particularly in the \nlarger States, it is not uncommon for Senators to begin fundraising for \nthe next election right after the present one, as they often find \nthemselves dialing for dollars instead of attending to other duties. In \nmy book, that is bad.\n  I think that presents us with a problem. Let's be honest with each \nother and the American people. Campaigning for office will continue to \nget more and more expensive because television spots are getting more \nand more expensive. Meanwhile, one of the effects of McCain-Feingold is \nthat as we ban soft money, which I am all for, the field is skewed \nbecause one has to say: Can you still give soft money? Some would say \nno. That is wrong. The answer is: Yes, you can still give soft money. \nBut that soft money then goes toward the independent campaign; into so-\ncalled issue advocacy. I think it is a very dangerous skewing of the \nfield.\n  Spending on issue advocacy, according to CRS, rose from $135 million \njust 5 years ago, 1996, to as much as $340 million in 1998. Then it \nrose again to $509 million in the year 2000. So there has been almost a \n400-percent increase in unregulated, undisclosed soft money-type \ndollars going into independent issue advocacy campaigns. That is the \ndanger I see.\n  Remember, these figures are only estimates and are probably very \nconservative, since issue advocacy groups do not have to disclose their \nspending. It is likely that spending on so-called issue advocacy, most \nof which is thinly\n\n[[Page S3012]]\n\ndisguised electioneering, probably is going to surpass all hard money \nspending, and very soon. It has already passed soft money spending. If \nwe do not raise the limit on hard money contributions to individual \ncampaigns, the pressure on the candidate and the party will grow \nexponentially.\n\n  Between 1992 and 2000, soft money jumped from $84 million to $487 \nmillion. In just 8 years, soft money increased sixfold.\n  Hard money has not. Clearly, that indicates the skewing of the \nplaying field that I am trying to make the case against. Clearly, what \nthat indicates is more and more people are turning to the undisclosed, \nunregulated, independent campaign which, increasingly, has become \nattack oriented.\n  There are some who do not want to increase hard dollars at all. To \nthem I say if you do not increase hard dollars, you put every candidate \nin jeopardy. You put political parties in jeopardy.\n  What we have tried to do in this amendment is create an incentive for \ncontributions to political parties for party building in the aggregate \nlimit, for contributions to the individual within the aggregate limit, \nand also to give the candidates the opportunity to better use their \ntime, to increase the hard cap, the contribution limit from $1,000 to \n$2,000.\n  Additionally, what the Feinstein-Cochran-Schumer amendment will do is \nmove campaign contributions from under the table to over the table. Our \namendment will make it easier to staunch the millions of unregulated \ndollars that currently flow into the coffers of our national political \ncommittees and replace a modest portion of that money with \ncontributions fully regulated, fully disclosed under the existing \nprovisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act. That is the value of \nthis split, the raising from $60,000 per cycle provided for in McCain-\nFeingold to $65,000, providing that $30,000 per election would go to \ncandidates and $35,000 for PACs and party committees.\n  McCain-Feingold is meaningful reform. I have voted for versions of it \nat every opportunity over the past several years. I commend both \nSenators McCain and Feingold. I support the soft money ban in S. 27. I \nsupport the Snowe-Jeffords provision in S. 27. I support the bill's ban \non foreign contributions and the ban on soliciting or receiving \ncontributions on Federal property.\n  Doubling the hard money contribution limit to individual candidates \nand creating these two new aggregate limits that are just $5,000 more \nthan what is already in McCain-Feingold per election cycle will help \nlevel the playing field and better enable candidates to run for \nelection with dollars that are all disclosed and regulated.\n  On March 20, on the floor of the Senate, Senator Feingold remarked:\n\n       We used to think that [$10,000] was a lot of money. \n     Unfortunately, given this insane soft money system, it is \n     starting to look as if it is spare change.\n\n  To an extent that is what has happened to the $1,000 limit.\n  It is very likely that candidates and their campaigns are going to \nhave to live with what we do today for more than likely another 30 \nyears, and costs are not going to drop in the next three decades.\n  Therefore, some ability to account for inflation, we believe, is both \nnecessary and achievable.\n  Additionally, we believe that increasing the limit on individual \ncontributions to Federal candidates would also reduce the need for \npolitical action committee--or PAC--funding by reducing the disparity \nbetween individual contributions and the maximum allowable PAC \ncontribution of $5,000.\n  The concern about PACs almost seems unimportant now compared with the \nproblem that soft money, independent expenditures, and issue advocacy \npresents. But we shouldn't dismiss the fact that PACs retain \nconsiderable influence in our system.\n  Again, from 1974 to 1988, PACs grew in number from 608 to a high of \n4,268, and PAC contributions to House and Senate candidates from $12.5 \nmillion to $148.8 million--that is a 400-percent rise in constant \ndollars--and in relation to other sources, from 15.7 percent for a \ncongressional campaign committee to 33 percent.\n  So, today, one-third of all congressional campaigns are fueled by \nPACs.\n  The amendment Senators Cochran, Schumer, and I are offering would \nalso diminish the influence of PACs.\n  The underlying Thompson amendment would increase the PACs. And that \ntakes us back to where we were a few years ago, which is a mistake.\n  The Feinstein-Cochran-Schumer amendment would reinvigorate individual \ngiving. It would reduce the incessant need for fundraising. I believe \nit compliments McCain-Feingold.\n  Let me conclude.\n  As I pointed out last Monday when I spoke in support of the Domenici \namendment, I just finished my 12th political campaign. For the fourth \ntime in 10 years, I ran statewide in California, which has more people \nthan 21 other States. These campaigns are expensive. I have had to \nraise more than $55 million in those four campaigns. And I can tell you \nfrom my personal experience that I am committed to campaign reform. And \nI am heartened to see that we are considering this bill, and I believe \nwe will pass it on Thursday.\n  I believe this amendment will make that bill stronger. I believe it \nwill help to level the playing field.\n  I believe if we pass a campaign spending bill without adding \nadditional dollars of hard money to political parties and increasing \nthe individual campaign limits, we skew the playing field so \ndramatically that the issue of advocacy and the independent campaign \nhas an opportunity with unregulated large soft dollars to occupy the \narena entirely.\n  That is a very deep concern to me.\n  With this amendment, a candidate has an opportunity to respond to an \nattack ad. With party building, a candidate has an opportunity to tell \ntheir political party they need help, that they are being attacked by \nthe X, Y, or Z group that is putting in $5 million in attack ads \nagainst them, that they need the party's help. Individuals can respond \nthrough the party on an increasing basis with flexibility because the \nlimit is for the election cycle and not the individual calendar year.\n  That gives an opportunity for parties to raise disclosed regulated \nhard dollars.\n  Without this--again, as one who has done a lot of campaigns now--the \nplaying field becomes so skewed that the independent campaign and the \nattack issue advocacy effort has an opportunity to dominate the \npolitical arena.\n  Mr. President, I would like to yield the floor and hope that you will \nrecognize my cosponsor, the distinguished senior Senator from the State \nof Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia for yielding, and also for her leadership in helping to \ncraft an amendment to seek to find a solution to the challenge of \nputting the so-called hard money or regulated contributions at an \nappropriate limit in this modification of the Federal Election Campaign \nAct.\n  My perspective comes from my first candidacy for Congress in 1972. It \nwas the first year that candidates for House and Senate seats in \nCongress were required to operate and fund their campaigns under the \nFederal Election Campaign Act of 1971. It required recordkeeping. It \nrequired disclosure of contributions that candidates were receiving. It \nlimited those contributions. It required all expenditures to be \nreported on periodic reports to the Federal Election Commission. It \nrequired the keeping of records of all expenditures that were made and \nthe keeping of receipts and invoices to back up the entire financial \noperation of a Federal election campaign.\n  That was the first election year in history that such extensive \nrecordkeeping and disclosures and limitations were required.\n  Many Senators have been talking about the post-Watergate limits and \nreforms. Frankly, this preceded Watergate. It was in that election \ncampaign that the Watergate incident occurred in 1974. But the fact is, \ncandidates were required to make full disclosure but not organizations \nwho were not covered by the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n\n  Now we have seen that the amounts being raised and spent by \nindividual candidates have diminished considerably in comparison with \nthe total amount of money being raised and spent to influence the \noutcome of Federal elections. Most of that money is\n\n[[Page S3013]]\n\nnow not even recorded. The contributions are not limited. The \nexpenditures are not limited. Hence, the phrase ``soft money'' has been \nused to describe those expenditures and those contributions. They are \nbehind the scenes. They are secret. And we are trying, by this McCain-\nFeingold bill, to put an end to that kind of spending that is secret, \nundisclosed, repetitious, and expenditures which are not disclosed \neither.\n  Advertising is bought by groups. You don't know who is buying the \nads. You just see the campaign ad attacking a candidate or a cause. The \npeople are completely confused in many cases as to who is on which side \nand who is spending the money. We are trying now to help recreate a \nsystem where there is full disclosure.\n  In doing so, the McCain-Feingold original bill makes very few changes \nto the regulated, disclosed, and reportable political spending that \ngoes on. Only in two instances--one involving contributions to State \nand local parties--does the McCain-Feingold bill increase the amount \nthat could be contributed, from $5,000 per calendar year to $10,000 per \ncalendar year. Then, in the aggregate limit allowed by law for \nregulated publicly disclosed contributions, the limit was increased \nfrom $25,000 per calendar year to $30,000 per calendar year.\n  Most Senators believe those modest changes aren't enough; that in \norder to make the campaign system fully operational so that candidates \ncan, on their own initiative, raise and spend the moneys they need to \noffset opposition from organized groups, those limits must be \nincreased. Most Senators agree with that proposition.\n\n  The issue now before the Senate is how much should the increases be. \nThe Senator from Tennessee offered an amendment, and he discussed his \nviews with the Senate that originally he wanted to triple the \ncontributions in all of these categories. My personal preference was to \ndouble them. I made that comment to several Senators as we began to \nlook closely at the provisions of McCain-Feingold.\n  Senator Feinstein from California agreed that in most instances she \nthought so, too. We have been working now to craft the specifics of an \namendment that would be more than McCain-Feingold provided for \nincreases but a level that we think should pass and could pass the \nSenate and become a part of the McCain-Feingold bill on final passage.\n  That is the effort that is reflected in this amendment. It does not \nincrease some of the categories as much as I personally think they \nshould be. As I say, I think they should be doubled across the board.\n  It is easy to understand. It is substantially less than the index \namounts would be if you took inflation into account from 1971 when the \nact was first created. Over $3,000 would be reflected if we had indexed \nthose amounts in 1971; so that the amount of an individual contribution \ncould be limited now, if it were indexed for inflation, at about \n$3,300-something instead of $1,000 as it is now.\n  So to strike a compromise, our suggested limit is $2,000. It is a \nmodest increase when you think about it. The other accounts are \nlikewise increased, except for PACs, which some Members view with some \nskepticism. Frankly, all of the PAC contributions that are made under \nthe law are fully disclosed; records have to be kept, just as in the \ncase of individual contributions. It is there for the public to \nscrutinize and see in every instance of contributions from political \naction committees to Members or to candidates.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will look carefully at this proposal and in \nthe instance of a motion to table, that Senators will vote not to table \nthe Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. How much time is remaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen and a half minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If neither side yields time, it will be taken \nout equally.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If I could say to my friend from Kentucky, Senator Schumer \nwishes to speak for 15 minutes. He is indisposed at this time. He badly \nwants to speak. We only have 16 minutes left. Do you think we can work \nit out that he have 15 minutes?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Nevada, I am sure we can work \nit out. He will come back sometime before the vote is scheduled?\n  Mr. REID. He will be back sometime within the next 5 or 6 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It shouldn't be a problem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally, and also keeping in \nmind that my friend from Kentucky, if he does not have a number of \nspeakers here when Senator Schumer comes back, might give him the extra \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from \nCalifornia for at least moving in the right direction, recognizing that \nthe cost of campaigns has gone up dramatically.\n  If the Senator from California is willing to respond to a couple \nquestions, I do wonder, in the Senator's proposal, since the underlying \nbill would take away 40 percent of the budgets of the Republican \nNational Committee and the Democratic National Committee, and 35 \npercent of the budgets of the Democratic Senatorial Committee and the \nRepublican Senatorial Committee--and I know from reading the newspaper \nthat many Senators on your side are concerned about what this proposal \nis going to do to the parties, regardless of how they may be voting--I \nwas curious why the Senator made no change at all in the amount of \nmoney an individual could give to a political party in order to try to \nprovide some opportunity to compensate, in hard dollars, for the \ndramatic loss of funds that this underlying bill will provide by the \nelimination of soft dollars?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to try to answer the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  Essentially, today, under current law, the aggregate limit that \nanyone can give in a calendar year to anything--to all of these--is \n$25,000 or $50,000 a cycle. McCain-Feingold, as you know, increases \nthat to $60,000 a cycle or $30,000 a calendar year. We increase that \nfurther to $65,000 a calendar year. And we tried to create an \nincentive. Again, we are replacing soft dollars with hard dollars.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Right.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. All the giving to the political parties would have to \nbe with hard dollars. So the way we approach it is that we create these \nsplit accounts. In other words, over the cycle an individual can \ncontribute up to $30,000 to candidates and $35,000 to PACs and party \ncommittees. So that is a specific requirement.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. But the Senator is not responding to my question, \nwhich is, the category right above the one you are pointing to on your \nchart, which is what an individual can give to a national party \ncommittee, remains unchanged from current law. According to your own \nchart, which I have in front of me, that remains unchanged from current \nlaw.\n  Let me repeat the question. Everyone agrees that the abolition of \nsoft money, which this bill will accomplish based upon the Hagel vote \nyesterday, will take away 40 percent of the budgets of the two big \nnational committees and 35 percent of the budgets of the two senatorial \ncommittees--gone. Your bill does not change what an individual can \ncontribute in hard dollars to a party; it does not change that from \ncurrent law.\n  Thus my question: How does the Senator envision that her proposal \nwould help in any way the national party committees compensate in hard \ndollars for the loss of soft dollars?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. You are correct. It does not. We simply believe the\n\n[[Page S3014]]\n\namount in this for PACs and parties, which is the $35,000 out of the \n$70,000--$35,000 a cycle out of the $70,000--can be given to parties.\n  Now, of course, this is not $40,000 a calendar year, but, again, \nthere is a limit on the individual in hard dollars. I think most of the \nparty building today comes from soft dollars rather than hard dollars, \nin any event.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So the Senator from California would agree with me, \nwhile there is some relief for us candidates, there basically is no \nchange on the hard dollar donations--\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. To the parties.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I think the evidence is that very few people \nessentially max out to parties. So we make it easier to contribute to \nparties by creating a separate account. That is my answer.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from California, both parties, it \nseems to me, are going to be anxious to try to increase the number of \npeople who are interested in giving to parties because they are both \ngoing to have a dramatic shortage of funds should this----\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is healthy. It is all hard dollars. It is \nregulated. It is all disclosed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Of course, as the Senator knows, all party soft money \ncontributions are disclosed. That is how everyone knows what the \nparties are getting in soft dollars. There is no point in having that \ndebate again. We had it yesterday. Soft dollars are gone. Now we are \nlooking at a hard-dollar world.\n  I am trying to figure out how in the world the parties can compensate \nfor the loss of those soft dollars under the proposal of the Senator \nfrom California. The annual aggregate under her proposal actually \ndecreases the amount national parties can receive. Currently an \nindividual can give $50,000 to national parties in a cycle; that is, \nover 2 years. But under the Feinstein proposal, I gather they can only \nreceive $35,000 over a cycle; is that correct?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct. As I said, this really affects very \nfew people. We believe it is a good, healthy reform.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from California. I did understand \nher amendment correctly.\n  Again, we saw a picture in the Washington Post yesterday of the world \nto come. This is a full-page ad by a billionaire named Jerome Kohlberg \nwhich appeared in the Post yesterday. He is one of the principal \nfunders of this reform industry, the employees of which are huddled off \nthe floor of the Senate working on this bill. I bring up Mr. Kohlberg \nonly to illustrate what the world is going to be increasingly like if \nMcCain-Feingold passes.\n  The distinguished occupant of the Chair experienced the wrath of Mr. \nKohlberg in 1998 as he spent half of $1 million trying to defeat the \njunior Senator from Kentucky. People such as Mr. Kohlberg are going to \nbe the wave of the future. There is a common misconception that people \nof great wealth are Republicans. In fact, they are overwhelmingly \nliberal Democrats, people such as Mr. Kohlberg.\n  With the dramatic weakening of the parties not only through the loss \nof soft money--that decision having been made yesterday--but should the \nFeinstein amendment or anything close to it be approved, none of that \nwill be compensated for in hard dollars because there is no change in \nwhat individuals can give to parties. Get used to it; this is the wave \nof the future. We have a picture of it right here in the Washington \nPost yesterday. People of great wealth who have an interest in politics \nand public policy are going to increasingly control the national \nagenda, allied, of course, with the great corporations that own the New \nYork Times and the Washington Post that also have an unfettered right \nto speak. I am not trying to change that. They just have a bigger voice \nthan all the rest of us because they have big corporations behind them.\n  I find this very distressing. I do think it is important for \neverybody to understand the world into which we are about to march.\n  Having said that, I commend the Senator from California for at least \nrecognizing the need to increase the individual contribution limit set \nback in 1974, when a Mustang cost $2,700. She represents a State which \nreally illustrates the heart of the problem. Imagine an unknown \nchallenger in California who is not wealthy deciding to take on the \nwell-known and powerful incumbent Senator from California, Mrs. Dianne \nFeinstein. I expect Senator Feinstein would agree with me, with a \n$1,000 contribution limit, trying to pool enough resources together to \nreach 30 million people against a well-known incumbent, that challenger \nwould probably have to spend the whole 6 years trying to pool together \nenough resources to be competitive. I wonder if the Senator agrees with \nthat observation.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I actually agree with it strongly. Most people in \nCalifornia find that they can't win statewide the first time out. Money \nis one of the issues here. The State is so big.\n  I harken back to a conversation I had with Alan Simpson. He said he \ncould go home and have lunch at the grill in Cody and he would see all \n200 people in Cody. He would campaign that way.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Right.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. In the big States, that is impossible to do. Your \ncampaign, getting your message out, has to depend to some extent on \nlarge-scale communication, big speeches, large direct mail, television, \nradio, those things that reach large numbers of people. It is a fact of \nlife. As these prices go up, the candidate can buy less and less. This \nis what opens the field, then, to the very wealthy candidate who can \ncome in and spend tens of millions of his or her own money and preempt \nthe field just because of that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think the Senator has it absolutely right. I am sure \nshe also shares my opinion that the people who would benefit from a \nhard money contribution limit increase the most would be challengers \nwho typically have fewer friends and not nearly the network that we \nincumbents have. They have a smaller group of friends and supporters to \ntry to start with as a way to pool enough resources to get in the game. \nDoes the Senator not think that the principal beneficiaries of an \nincrease in the hard money contribution limits to candidates really \nwill be challengers?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If the Senator will yield for a moment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I do.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I heard an interesting comment by a Senator \nyesterday. He said: Well, at least I will only have to do half the \nnumber of fundraisers to raise the amount of money that is required. \nNow the question is, Is that good or bad? I happen to think it is \ngreat.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I do, too.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The fewer fundraisers one has to do, the better, \nbecause you can spend more time doing the things you are supposed to be \ndoing. I have seen on both sides of the aisle the prodigious efforts \ndialing for dollars. People leave; they have to take time off. They go \nto party headquarters. They stand out on the street corner with their \ncell phone, and they call people and ask for contributions.\n  If inflation had not risen to the extent it has, that would be a \ndifferent story. I know there are people on my side who believe that if \nyou raise this contribution limit, it disadvantages Democrats. I truly \ndo not believe that. It goes across the field. It gives a nonincumbent \nan advantage; it gives an incumbent the ability to do their work and \nconcentrate less on fundraising. It gives one at least double the \nopportunity to meet expenses which, since this limit was put on, have \nactually tripled.\n  May I ask a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I have the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Is the Senator's time running?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield for a question.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I just wanted to know whose time was running.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my time, the Senator will be pleased to know.\n  Regretfully, the problem with the Feinstein amendment is it just \ndoesn't go very far. It is certainly headed in the right direction. I \ndon't know enough about the exact annual inflation increase over the \nyears to know what going from $1,000 to $2,000 gets us up to. My guess \nis it probably gets us up to the mid-1980s in terms of purchasing \npower. I know my friend from California may even be in the minority on \nher side that want to raise the limit at all.\n\n[[Page S3015]]\n\n  I have heard it said by a number of our colleagues that not many \npeople can contribute this amount of money. That is certainly true. The \nfact that not many people can contribute this amount of money does not \nmean that no one should be able to. The cold, hard reality is that most \npeople are not terribly interested in politics, and most people don't \ncontribute to it. The best example of that that we talked about \nyesterday is the Presidential checkoff on the tax return where a \ntaxpayer gets to check off $3 they already owe--it doesn't add to their \ntax bill, just $3 they already owe--into a Presidential campaign fund. \nOnly 12 percent of Americans do that even when it doesn't cost them \nanything.\n  The real message is, people are just not terribly interested in \npolitics and not terribly interested in contributing. I wish they were. \nIt would certainly be great if large numbers of Americans had an \ninterest and were willing to contribute. I wish we could get back to \nthe $100 tax deduction we had before 1986 that at least made some \neffort, through the Tax Code, to encourage people to contribute. But \nthe cold, hard reality is, a rather small number of people are going to \ncontribute to politics.\n  The question is, Are the parties going to still be viable? \nRegretfully, it seems to me, the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia creates an incentive for contributions to the party \ncommittees for party building, she said, but how can this happen if we \nreduce the amount national parties can receive? With the aggregate \nlimit to parties, the $20,000 limit, under current law, it is actually \nreduced to $17,500 by the amendment. I think by, in effect, pushing the \n$20,000 limit backward because of the aggregate provision the Senator \nhas, we really move the party contributions back to the 1960s, not even \nleaving them at 1974.\n\n  I have sort of a mixed feeling about the Senator's amendment. It is \ngreat that she is moving in the right direction as far as candidates \nare concerned, but she has not addressed the needs of political \nparties, which are getting whacked by the underlying bill in a major \nway.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 28\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am hopeful Senator Schumer will come \nto the floor as soon as possible. Let me make a couple of comments to \nthe remarks the distinguished Senator from Kentucky just concluded. I \nvery much appreciate his comment about the political parties. On our \nside of the aisle, when you are in public office, there is concern \nabout asking individuals to contribute large amounts of money to a \nparty, period, and that this uses power unwisely. What McCain-Feingold \ndoes is it eliminates the soft money aspect of that powerful use of \nrequest. You can't ask someone to contribute $500,000 to the party or \n$1 million to the party or $100,000 to the party. You are essentially \nlimited to the $35,000 per election to go to the party. There are some \non our side who don't like that because they say it is too big a \nrequest. I don't happen to believe that it is. I also don't happen--\nwell, some are willing to do that and others are not willing to do it.\n  But in answer to the question of the Senator from Kentucky, that is \nreally the answer. It is people in elected office requesting citizens \nto contribute large amounts of money. And what that request in itself \nconveys is the sense of that public official then giving the \nappearance, somehow, of indebtedness to the individual because they \ncontribute that large amount of money.\n  The beauty of McCain-Feingold is that is now removed and a Senator is \nnot in the position of having to do that anymore. I think that is very \nhealthy for the system.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a further provision in the Feinstein \namendment, which I want to call to the attention of the Senator--and I \nam sure she is familiar with it, as is the rest of the Senate--is \nworthy of discussion. There is a current Supreme Court case, called the \nColorado case, pending for decision, which, if the Court upheld the \nlower court, would declare that the party-coordinated contribution \nlimits are unconstitutional. These are hard dollars spent by party \ncommittees on behalf of their candidates.\n  The Schumer provision says if that is struck down--the coordinated \nlimit--and if parties take advantage of this ruling and make unlimited \ncoordinated expenditures, then they will not get the lowest unit rate \non television. They say parties will only get the lowest unit rate if \nthey continue to abide by the coordinated party limits, even if those \nlimits have been declared unconstitutional.\n  Now, I say to my friend from California--and I see the Senator from \nNew York is back--this is clearly an unconstitutional condition. Party-\ncoordinated expenditures are 100-percent hard dollars. There is no \nproblem unless you believe parties can corrupt their own candidates, \nand it is illegal to earmark contributions to specific candidates in \nthe amount beyond the individual contribution limit. In short, it is my \nunderstanding that the Schumer provision requires an unconstitutional \ncondition on party spending.\n  So let's sum it up. If the Supreme Court strikes down the coordinated \nlimit as unconstitutional, which might happen, then the Schumer \nprovision will require parties to continue to abide by an \nunconstitutional limit, in order to get the lowest unit rate from a \nbroadcaster. I would look forward to litigating that in court, Mr. \nPresident. Declaring an unwillingness to follow a pattern declared as \nunconstitutional, putting in a stipulation that to do something that is \nconstitutionally protected costs you money is not likely to be upheld \nby any court in the land.\n\n  I wanted to call that to the attention of our colleagues before we \nvote on the Feinstein amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from California has 12\\1/2\\ \nminutes, and the Senator from New York needs 15 minutes. May I get the \nattention of my friend from Kentucky? Would the Senator be so kind as \nto allow us 2\\1/2\\ minutes of his time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 26 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be happy to give 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom New York.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield 14 minutes of my time to the \nSenator from New York and 1 minute of my time directly following that \nto the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Kentucky for his \ncourtesy, as well as the Senator from Nevada for arranging things on \nthe floor with exquisite neatness and efficiency, as he always does, \nand most of all the Senator from California for her leadership on this \nissue.\n  I agree with everything the Senator from California was trying to do \nbefore. But I have joined this because of my concern about the \n441(a)(d) amendment, which the Senator from California and the Senator \nfrom Mississippi have graciously agreed to add to their amendment. I \nwill address that issue now.\n  Although I am fully supportive of the other parts of the amendment as \nwell, the Senators from California and Mississippi have taken those up \nvery well. Many Members come to me and say: What are you talking about \nwith these 441(a)(d) limits?\n  Well, the bottom line is simple, that the very basis of McCain-\nFeingold, which is limiting the amount of contributions that can go to \na candidate, is undermined by a removal of the 441(a)(d) limit. That \nlimit is in the law now. It has been in the law for a long time--since \nthe original campaign finance bill was passed.\n  But a Supreme Court case, called FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal \nCampaign Committee, has just been argued in the Court, and a decision\n\n[[Page S3016]]\n\nshould come down shortly, within the next month or two. And to believe \nmost--not all, but most--of the prognosticators, they will rule that \nthe 441(a)(d) limits are removed. If the Court rules as most observers \nexpect, we will face a gross distortion of our campaign finance system \nand the return of six-figure contributions by wealthy individuals that \nwe absolutely have to address now.\n  The bottom line is simple. Even if McCain-Feingold were to pass \ncompletely intact, this Court case would greatly undermine what we are \ntrying to do. But if we were to raise the limits under which a person \ncould give to a party and then a party could give to a candidate, it \nwould make it so much the worse.\n  Part of the Feinstein-Cochran-Schumer amendment that I am referring \nto would at least prevent that exacerbation of the problem.\n  Let us take it from the beginning. The 441(a)(d) limits direct a \nnational party, whether it be the RNC or the DNC or, as usually \nhappens, the DSCC and the RSCC, in the amount of money they can give \ndirectly to a candidacy. Coordination between the national party and \nthe candidacy is completely allowed by the 1996 Supreme Court decision. \nIt may be 1998. I do not remember the year.\n  Until now and as of now, there are real limits as to how much a party \ncan give. It is 2 cents per voter-age person in the State. In \nCalifornia, it is limited to about $2 million; in my State of New York, \n$1.7 million; and the rates go down accordingly.\n  The problem with the 441(a)(d) mechanism, from the point of view of \nMcCain-Feingold, is very simple. Under present law, a person can give \n$20,000 to a national party, to the DSCC or the RSCC, and they can give \nit right to the candidate. What has kept that in check, of course, is \nthe overall amount the party can give to that candidate is limited, but \nif the Supreme Court lifts that ruling and says there can be no limits \non a constitutional first amendment basis--something we debated with \nSenator Hollings' amendment and others; I disagree with that \ninterpretation of the Constitution, but like everyone else, we must \nlive with it. But if they were to lift that limit, then parties \npresently could raise virtually unlimited amounts of money in $20,000 \nchunks. Under McCain-Feingold, it would go up to $30,000 chunks per \nyear.\n  If John Q. Citizen wished to fund Senate Candidate Smith in his \nState, he could give $20,000, $30,000 a year, each for 6 years to the \nnational party, and that money could go right to Candidate Smith. It \nmakes a mockery of the $1,000 and $2,000 limit. It allows people of \ngreat wealth to give huge amounts of money to the candidates.\n  My view is that the No. 1 thrust of McCain-Feingold in eliminating \nsoft money was to prevent these large sums of money from going to \ncandidates. If 441(a)(d) is lifted, those large sums of money will \ncontinue. True enough, McCain-Feingold does other things with corporate \nand labor union contributions, and true enough, no one can give, say, \n$\\1/2\\ million to a candidate through the party, which they can do \ntoday, but the limits would be so astoundingly high that they would \nalmost make a mockery of the $1,000 or $2,000 limit that we are talking \nabout on individual contributions.\n  What can we do about that? One thing we can do is make sure we do not \nraise the aggregate limits of giving to a party very high. One of the \nreasons--and I discussed this last night with my friend, the Senator \nfrom Tennessee--I am so opposed to his amendment is because it would \nnot just mean you could not just give to the candidate through a party \nat a $20,000 clip but rather at a $60,000 clip. The Feinstein-Cochran-\nSchumer amendment at least limits that to $35,000 per cycle.\n  It is an improvement over present law and, in my judgment, an \nimprovement over McCain-Feingold before it was adopted. I think this is \na step forward, not just a compromise, that you are not stepping back \nas much, but on the aggregate limits on the party, it is a step \nforward.\n  The second thing we have to do is try to discourage the parties from \ngiving unlimited amounts of money to the candidates. Parties have great \nfunctions. I am all for party building. I have no problem with money \ngoing to the parties for get-out-the-vote operations and educating the \npeople about the process but not for TV ads for candidates, which is \nwhat happens, no matter what disclaimer is on the ad.\n\n  What we do in this amendment is say that if you go over the limits \nthat are in this bill--because the Supreme Court may rule that you can \ngo over those limits; if the Supreme Court rules the other way, this \namendment has no effect. But if you do go over those limits, you cannot \nget the low-cost TV time that the Torricelli amendment now allows. It \nis an incentive to keep the limits low to prevent the parties from \nraising vast amounts of money for the candidates and obliterating the \n$1,000 or $2,000 limit for individual contributions that we are hoping \nto make a much stronger basis of campaign financing with McCain-\nFeingold.\n  Is it constitutional? We have consulted a variety of experts, and \nthey say very simply that the constitutional requirement is that the \ncarrot is related to the stick. In other words, it can well be a \nconstitutional limitation that does not strike down free speech.\n  I understand my friend from Kentucky has a much broader \ninterpretation, but it is a constitutional limitation if what you are \nsanctioning is related to the reward. Clearly, the proposal we have \nmade in the Schumer part of this amendment is related: Go over the \nlimit and you do not get low-cost TV time. Stay within the limit and \nyou get low-cost TV time. There could not be a clearer relationship \nbecause most of this money is used, at least in every campaign I have \nseen, for television time.\n  We have consulted a variety of experts who all believe there is not a \nconstitutional problem with this amendment.\n  If we do not adopt this amendment, if we do not include this \namendment, I believe 6 months from now, and certainly 2 years from now \nafter the next cycle of elections, people are going to scratch their \nheads and say: Was this bill a step forward on the road to reform or \nwas it a step backward? Because even though some limits are placed on \ncorporate contributions, the ease with which people will be able to \ngive large amounts of money to candidates will probably increase or at \nleast not decrease at all.\n  The ease with which somebody could, say, contribute $150,000 to a \ncandidate through the party in an election cycle would be large.\n  I say to my colleagues, first, whether you are for or against the \nlimits in Feinstein-Cochran-Schumer, this is a salutary addition. \nSecond, I say to my colleagues who have trouble raising the limits, \nwhich I do not, I support what is in the amendment that the senior \nSenator from California has crafted, and I think very well, that this \nwill ameliorate some of the greater danger and make it more palatable \nto those who are against raising the limits altogether.\n  I particularly salute the Senator from California for having the \naggregate party limit be $35,000 a cycle. That is extremely important. \nAlso, when in combination with the part of the amendment before us that \nI have added, it will put some brakes on a potentially runaway \nsituation that could undo the very reform we seek to pass.\n  This is a complicated area but one that will become very obvious \nwithin a year or two if we do nothing about it. I urge my colleagues to \nadopt the Feinstein-Cochran-Schumer amendment, to not go in the \ndirection, as much as the good Senator from Tennessee wishes to go, \nwhich, as I said, will have much greater ramifications should the \nSupreme Court rule against 441 (a)(d) limits in the Colorado decision.\n  I hope we will support it.\n  I yield whatever time I have not consumed back to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator has 1 minute 5 \nseconds.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield that to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly urge the body not to table \nthis effort of Senator Feinstein and Senator Cochran. It is much more \nrestrained than the alternative. My personal view is we shouldn't \nincrease the limits at all. I don't think we need to. I realize the \nmajority of the body believes that is something that has to happen. I \nunderstand it will happen.\n\n[[Page S3017]]\n\n  Senator Feinstein has tried to craft a reasonable compromise between \nthe different views, actually bring us together, and help us pass a \nbill. I urge my colleagues, at least on this vote for tabling, to vote \nno to table.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I listened carefully to the Senator from New York talk \nabout the possibility of circumventing the individual contribution \nlimits. Let me say under current law contributions received by a \nnational party committee which is directed to be used on a specific \ncandidate's behalf is considered an earmark. Thus, if a donor gives \n$1,000 to the Republican National Committee and directs it to a \nspecific candidate, the $1,000 contribution is attributable to the \ncandidate. If the donor gives $20,000 to the Democratic Senatorial \nCommittee and directs it be spent on behalf of a specific candidate, it \nis a $20,000 contribution to the candidate, and the contributor is \nprosecuted for making an individual contribution in excess of the \n$1,000 limit.\n  What am I talking about? The Democrats understand that in the early \n1990s the Democratic Senatorial Committee and the Democratic Senate \ncandidates were raising hard money with the DSCC which tallied or \nearmarked these contributions to be used for individual Senators \naccredited with bringing them in.\n  Since the $20,000 earmark contributions to the party were in excess \nof the limits individuals can contribute to a candidate, the DSCC was \nprosecuted. In 1995, the prosecution resulted in the DSCC being forced \nto: One, pay a $70,000 fine; two, end the tally and earmark program; \nand, three, include specific language on all future solicitations \nstating the money raised into the DSCC is spent as the committee \ndetermines within its sole discretion.\n  Why bring that up? Only to make the point that the fear that the \nSenator from New York has is unwarranted because we have already \nlearned that lesson and the party committees know they cannot receive \ncandidate contributions in hard dollars earmarked for candidates.\n  The problem with the Feinstein amendment and particularly the Schumer \nprovision is this: If the Supreme Court strikes down the coordinated \nlimit--we are talking hard dollars, the good dollars; that is what \ncoordinated is, hard dollar expenditures by petitioners on behalf of \nthe candidates--if the Supreme Court strikes down the current limit \ncoordinated as unconstitutional, Schumer requires parties to continue \nto abide by unconstitutional limits in order to get a broadcast \ndiscount. This is a classic unconstitutional condition.\n  The Feinstein-Schumer provision will increase the individual \ncontribution limit from $1,000 to $2,000. It does not increase the \namount an individual can give to political parties. The aggregate \nindividual limit in the Feinstein amendment reduces the amount an \nindividual can give to a party from $20,000 per year to $17,500 per \nyear. Even if the Supreme Court declares party coordinated expenditure \nlimits unconstitutional, the Colorado case we were just talking about, \nparties must still abide by them or lose the broadcast discount.\n\n  Even though the Senator from California gives the candidate a little \nhelp, it is worse than current law for parties. It is already clear \nfrom the action taken yesterday there is going to be no more non-\nFederal money in the party committees. That is gone. If the Feinstein \namendment passes, there will be less hard dollars for the committees \nthan we have today. We are going backwards. There may be some relief \nfor parties, but it is a bad deal for candidates.\n  I see the Senator from Tennessee is on the floor. I yield 10 minutes \nto the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I have had an opportunity to read or have summarized \nthe Feinstein amendment, and I thought we were just basically dealing \nwith dollar limits. But as we get into it, it is breathtaking in its \nscope and, in my opinion, clearly unconstitutional.\n  The Senator from Kentucky had it exactly right. Basically what the \nso-called Schumer provision would do--it is like the government losing \na first amendment case and then conditioning a benefit upon not doing \nwhat the Supreme Court just decided he has a right to do.\n  There is no way we can engage in that kind of activity. As we know, \nthere are limits now on what a party can spend in coordination with its \ncandidates. A lot of people think that will be overturned in Colorado \nand the Colorado 2 case.\n  As I understand the Schumer amendment, if the Supreme Court strikes \nthe coordinated expenditure limits of parties, then no broadcaster is \nrequired to give a party the lowest unit rate unless the national party \ncertifies to the FEC that neither it nor the State committees where the \ntelevision ad is run--that certifies they are adhering to what the \nSupreme Court just struck down.\n  I have never seen anything quite like that before. It is clear in a \nlong line of cases that we cannot require private citizens to restrict \ntheir speech in order to get certain benefits. It is easier when it is \nthe government. This is not the government. These are private \ngovernmental entities, some right-to-life case, and so forth. These are \nnot governmental entities. You cannot require private citizens to \nrestrict their speech in order to get certain benefits.\n  Velazquez v. Legal Services Corporation was decided just this year. I \nurge my colleagues to have someone take a look at that case and explain \nto me why the principles of that case don't clearly set out or \nestablish that we just can't do this constitutionally. They held in \nthat case that Congress can't condition legal services grants on a \nlawyer's inability to challenge the constitutionality of welfare \nreform. That is an unconstitutional restriction of the first amendment \nrights of that lawyer, even though it is government money and the \ngovernment doesn't have to give them money to start with.\n\n  Once you have a scheme like that, you cannot condition receiving that \ngovernment benefit on an agreement to not exercise your free speech \nrights. In this case, we are putting into law something that requires \nthem not to exercise a free speech that the Supreme Court had just \ndecided they had a constitutional right to.\n  This is clearly unconstitutional. I know I sound like a broken \nrecord. Some of these other things that we have been engaging in have \nsimilar problems, but I think this is the worst that I have seen.\n  As I look at the limits, I second what the Senator from Kentucky said \nabout party committees. I have been spending a lot of time trying to do \nsomething about soft money and the kind of money that gives the wrong \nkind of appearances with the hundreds of thousands of dollars that are \nflowing into these parties and soft money, corporate money, union \nmoney, coordinated money, and we are trying to do something about that. \nI still am. Hopefully, we can get rid of all of that.\n  But we cannot emasculate the parties. Parties are not bad. Parties \nare weak enough as they are. The Feinstein amendment provides for \n$35,000 per cycle to the party committees. That is $17,500 a year when \nthe limit today is $20,000. We are going backwards. That is $20,000 \nthat was established in 1974, which adjusted for inflation, will be in \nthe neighborhood of $60,000 or $70,000. Instead of recognizing that and \nmaking some inflationary adjustment in response to getting rid of soft \nmoney, which we are trying to do, we are going in the opposite \ndirection and further clamping down on the parties.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator and apologize that I had to be off \nthe floor for a minute while he was addressing this amendment.\n  Let me say we can disagree on the policy, in terms of strengthening \nor weakening the parties. My view is the parties are not strengthened \nwhen they are conduits for large amounts of money, whether it be hard \nmoney or soft money. I would be all for giving the money for get-out-\nthe-vote operations, giving the money for true educational operations--\nthe things the parties used to do before 1985 when I think most of us \nwould admit they were a lot stronger than they are now.\n  We can debate that. That is for each person. All of us here have lots \nof experience that way and have made up our minds.\n  I know in our State when these party committees are formed----\n\n[[Page S3018]]\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Let me say to my friend, I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Let me ask him this question on the constitutionality. \nShould the Supreme Court knock down the 441(a)(d) limit, then they \nwould be doing it, I believe--because this is the argument; I have read \nthe arguments--on its mandatory nature. Right now that limit is \nmandatory.\n  Our amendment, as my good friend from Tennessee knows, is voluntary. \nIt says you can go above the limit but you don't get the benefit of the \nlow-cost TV time. But if you want the benefit of the low-cost TV time, \nthen you do not get the benefit.\n  My reading of constitutional law is very simple, and that is that it \nis quite different, on a first amendment case, to make something \nmandatory, where the Court is very reluctant--at least this Court--I do \nnot agree with it, but it is there, and we have to live with it--than \nwhen there is an option, there is a voluntary limit for which you get \nsome kind of benefit.\n  I ask the Senator what his view is of that argument, so he can \nrespond to it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I say to my friend, I do not view that argument very \nfavorably because it flies in the face of Velazquez v. Legal Services \nCorporation. The people in Legal Services did not have to take that \nmoney either. They had the option to take that money or not, and the \nSupreme Court there said you can't require private citizens to restrict \ntheir speech in order to get those benefits.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will you yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I guess the Senator from New York was saying speech up \nto a certain amount only costs this much but if you speak above that \namount, that speech costs more.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Or if you exercise your speech as a party committee to \ncoordinate with a candidate--not the donor but the party committee, \ncoordinate with the candidate, which the Supreme Court has just decided \nyou have a constitutional right to do--that if you exercise that right, \nthen you do not get the benefits described.\n  I yield to my friend from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  As I understand the Velazquez case, which dealt with Legal Services, \nthe very rationale of the Supreme Court in striking that down was they \nsaid there was no relationship between the reward and the punishment. \nIn other words, they said that this is simply an attempt to limit free \nspeech and using an unrelated reward to do it. They said the nexus was \nnot close enough, the nexus between government funding and the ability \nof a Legal Services lawyer to proceed in a certain way or say a certain \nthing.\n\n  It seems to me in the amendment that we have crafted there is a \ndirect nexus. First of all, the nexus is very close. You have the \nability to get more money from your party and the privilege of getting \nthe lowest TV cost.\n  It does not say you can't put an ad on television. That would \nprobably be unconstitutional. But what we have said here is that \ncertain people, in a certain position--i.e., candidates--should be \nprivileged.\n  Maybe the Senator from Tennessee might think the Torricelli amendment \nitself is unconstitutional. I do not recall if the Senator from \nKentucky has argued that. But that would be the nub of his argument \nthere.\n  Second, the attempt here is not the same as in Velazquez, as I \nunderstand the case, and that is because in Velazquez people were \ntrying to shut down a certain type of activity they did not like, a \ncertain type of speech, a certain type of activity. There is no such \nattempt here.\n  So I ask the Senator from Tennessee, doesn't he see a real difference \nin both what the Court has said in the case law, the case \ncircumstances, that way?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Tennessee has \nexpired.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator like some more time?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will ask unanimous consent----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. You don't need unanimous consent. I yield you 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I respond to my friend from New York by saying, yes, in \nfact I do see a distinction. Here we are dealing with political speech, \nwhich makes it even more sensitive. What my friend's amendment would do \nis cut back and restrict clearly constitutionally protected political \nspeech. The Supreme Court has decided on numerous occasions that there \nare only certain limited ways and times you can restrict political \nspeech, such as if you are engaging in express advocacy, which this has \nnothing to do with.\n  So I think not only is Velazquez relevant and on point, the amendment \nbefore us is more egregious than the activity in Velazquez that was \nstruck down by the Supreme Court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think we are close to a vote here. My \nunderstanding is the time has run on the other side. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator from Kentucky has \n7 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just sum up prior to the vote.\n  The Feinstein-Schumer provision will increase individual contribution \nlimits from $1,000 to $2,000. That certainly is helpful to candidates. \nIt sort of catches us up, maybe, to the early 1980s in terms of \npurchasing power. It does not, however, increase the amount an \nindividual can give to political parties. In fact, the aggregate \nindividual limit also, as part of the amendment, will reduce the amount \nan individual can give to a party from $20,000 per year down to $17,500 \nper year. So we are going backwards.\n  We have already taken away all the non-Federal money from political \nparties. That is 40 percent of the budgets of the Republican National \nCommittee and the Democratic National Committee, 35 percent of the \nbudgets of the Republican Senatorial Committee and the Democratic \nSenatorial Committee. We have wiped that out with the votes yesterday.\n  Now if the Feinstein amendment were adopted, the parties, national \nparties, would be left only with hard money and we have, in effect, \nreduced the amount an individual could give to a party, set back in \n1974, from $20,000 down to $17,500.\n  While the Feinstein amendment might make some marginal improvement \nfor candidates, it is a step backwards for parties.\n  In addition, it has the Schumer provision in it that the Senator from \nTennessee has very skillfully discussed a few moments ago, that even if \nthe Supreme Court declares party-coordinated expenditure limits \nunconstitutional--which may happen in the next few months in the \nColorado Republican case currently before the Supreme Court--even if \nthat coordinated limit, that hard money limit that parties can spend on \nbehalf of their candidates is struck down as unconstitutional, if a \nparty chooses to spend more than the old limit just having been struck \ndown as unconstitutional, then the party loses the lowest unit rate on \nads.\n  So the practical effect of that is a party could spend so much on \nbehalf of a candidate at a certain price and then, once it has spent \nmore than that, it would have to pay more for additional speech.\n  The Senator from Tennessee has persuasively argued, and I would as \nwell, that is an unconstitutional condition or surcharge, if you will, \non the exercise of free speech, a tax on speech. Clearly, a tax on \nspeech raises serious constitutional questions. I could have raised a \nconstitutional point of order on this. I say to the Senator from \nTennessee that I am not going to do that. I have done that in the past \nwhen we had campaign finance debates. I am not going to do that.\n  But I assure you that if this is in the final bill, and if the bill \nis signed by the President, it will be one of the items that, as a \nplaintiff in the case, I intend to be as one of the items that we will \nbe raising in court.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time on my side.\n  I make a motion to table, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n\n[[Page S3019]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while we in the Senate are working hard \nexploring the mysteries of campaign finance reform, many Americans are \nenjoying the annual tradition known as ``March Madness.'' In Missouri, \nwe are particularly fixated on ``the March to the Arch'' where St. \nLouis is hosting the final four of the Women's NCAA basketball \ntournament. In the final four are a couple of teams from somewhere in \nIndiana and Connecticut but in Missouri, we will be cheering for our \nSouthwest Missouri State University Lady Bears. They started out as a \nlow seed, but they are two upset wins away from a national \nchampionship. The Lady Bears are coached by Cheryl Burnett who, in her \n14 years at SW Missouri, has posted a 274-117 record winning 70 percent \nof her games.\n  In recent years, the residents of my home State of Missouri have been \nprivileged to witness many great sports legends, from George Brett and \nDerrick Thomas in Kansas City to Mark McGuire and Kurt Warner in St. \nLouis to Springfield's own Payne Stewart. Today I recognize the \nachievements of the Southwest Missouri State University basketball team \nand, Jackie Stiles--our newest sports legend.\n  On March 1 of this year, in front of a sell-out, standing-room-only \ncrowd, Jackie broke the record for most career points scored by a \nwomen's basketball player in NCAA Division I, a record that has stood \nsince 1989.\n  Ms. Stiles is the Nation's leading scorer at 30.7 points per game and \nthe career total is a whopping 3,253 points. Monday night, in Spokane, \nWashington, Southwest Missouri State rolled over the home team \nWashington 104 to 87. Jackie Stiles left the game to a standing ovation \nfrom 11,000 fans rooting for the opposing team.\n  Fans in her hometown of Claflin, KS, enjoyed watching her compete in \nbasketball, track, and tennis at the high school level. They watched as \nshe scored more points in the history of Kansas prep sports than any \nhigh school basketball player--boys or girls. Her decision to play NCAA \nDivision I basketball at SMS was made after all of the top women's \ncollege basketball programs tried to recruit her. Her choice has been \napplauded time after time over the last 4 years as fans pack into \nHammons Student Center to cheer on the Lady Bears team.\n  Jackie Stiles has led Division I teams in average points per game the \npast 2 years and was nominated for the prestigious ESPY award, the \nNaismith Award, and was recently named to both the Associated Press and \nthe Sports Illustrated Women's All-American First Team. The awards she \nhas earned throughout her career are too numerous to list. Beyond the \nmany honors she has earned we should recognize her for something more \nimportant than records and awards. Jackie Stiles has become a role \nmodel to the many young people who dream of the kind of achievements \nshe has accomplished. The best thing about this is that she is showing \nthem the way to achieve their goals. First, by being a role model and \nsetting a fine example for young people everywhere. In the words of SMS \nLady Bear's head coach Cheryl Burnett, ``She really is the kind of role \nmodel that an athlete should be . . . Jackie is a tremendous ambassador \nfor women's basketball and athletics in general.''\n  Whether she is breaking records on the court or reading to elementary \nstudents, Jackie embodies a spirit of excellence. Second, Jackie Stiles \nhas reached the pinnacle of women's college basketball by combining her \ntalent with more hard work than most can comprehend. She is the product \nof a small mid-western town and reflects the values you would expect to \nfind in a town of just over 600--hard work, friendliness, dedication, \nand devotion to family. She has distinguished herself from many sports \nheros with her humility which was evident in her recent ESPN interview \nwhere she gave credit to the team and the program rather than accepting \nit for herself. I agree the team deserves a lot of credit, but so does \nJackie Stiles.\n  When Jackie broke her wrist during her sophomore year of high school \nshe did not let it get her down. Instead, she learned to shoot left \nhanded and still averaged 26 points per game. That is also when she \nbegan her now-famous 1,000 shots per day practices that kept her in the \ngym all hours of the day and night. It is that kind of work ethic that \nbuilds champions, and that I stand to honor today. She puts her team \nfirst and plays unselfishly on the court. When she scored 56 points in \na game she gave the credit to her coaches and her teammates, as well as \nto the enthusiastic fans from Southwest Missouri that have lined up to \nsee her play the last 4 years.\n  Her team-centered focus on winning games, not personal accolades, \nsets Jackie Stiles apart. And, finally, it is her focus on being a \nscholar-athlete, maintaining a high grade point average while dealing \nwith the intense pressures of being in the national spotlight. Thank \nyou, Jackie, for choosing Southwest Missouri State University, and for \nsetting an example for young people everywhere with your hard work and \nhumility. Those are the true things of which champions are made.\n  I congratulate Coach Burnett, Ms. Stiles, the entire team and \nUniversity for this great achievement or making it to the Final Four. I \nplan on attending the game Friday night game in St. Louis to see one of \nthose Indiana teams dispatched by the Lady Bears. I say to my friends \nfrom Indiana, while Indiana may be known for men's basketball, I \npredict this weekend will make Missouri host to the capital of college \nwomen's basketball.\n  Mr. President, I see no one seeking recognition, so I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are having a little pause in the \nsubject of campaign finance reform, thankfully. We have been at it for \nsome time. Hopefully, we will be through this week soon. It is a very \nimportant issue, but I am anxious, as most of us are, to move on to \nsome of the other issues before us. Probably the most important one is \nthat of the budget.\n  Each session, of course, is important and vital. It is important for \nus to have a budget. You can argue about the details of the budget, but \nthe fact is that a budget is more than just a piece of paper with our \nspending plans on it. The budget is what defines where we are going to \ngo over the next 2 years and into the future. It defines, as well, what \nour priorities are, which is a very important issue. It causes us to \nlook ahead as to where we ought to be doing things that strengthen \nAmerica, things that we ought to be doing that help put this economy \nback in place. Hopefully, we will be working on that budget next week.\n  The President has put forth a budget. Our Budget Committee will come \nforth\n\n[[Page S3021]]\n\nwith a budget. I believe the Republican budget addresses the priorities \nof the American people. It puts us on the continued road of a balanced \nFederal budget which, of course, for many years we didn't have. We had \ndeficit spending and we continued to increase the debt. We now, largely \nbecause of a strong economy, have a situation where we have not only a \nbalanced budget, but a surplus which is, of course, in many ways a very \nhappy thing to have. We have a priority, I hope, of continuing to save \nSocial Security for seniors, not only for the immediate future but for \na distance in the future where young people will be able to have \nbenefits from the Social Security they pay in from the very first day \non the job. We can commit ourselves to do that by assuring the dollars \nthat come in that are designed for Social Security are used for Social \nSecurity.\n  We have a priority to improve and strengthen Medicare--obviously, one \nof the things that affects many people. We have to deal with \npharmaceuticals and with many of the things that go together to \nstrengthen the Medicare. In terms of dealing with the future and \ndealing with young people, we need to deal with our national debt \nwhich, of course, is very large. I believe we have a responsibility to \nbegin to pay that down. Some people want to pay it down immediately, \nwhich is not practical in terms of the fact that the money is invested. \nBut over a period of 10 years under this budget, we can pay that \npublicly held debt off. I think that is what we ought to do. We have an \nobligation to do that. We have spent the money and now we should not \nleave the debt over to the other people.\n  We are committed to improve educational funding, and we need to do \nthat, to give every school an opportunity. We always get into the \nargument--of course, a valid argument--about which I feel strongly, and \nthat is whether or not dollars that go from the Federal Government out \nto education should be used only for purposes that are defined in \nWashington, which I think is wrong, or should there be an opportunity \ngiven for people in local and State levels to use the money as they \ndetermine it is most needed for their particular school. And then, \nfinally, we have an opportunity, which I hope we will take full \nadvantage of, to return the surplus tax overcharges to the American \ntaxpayers. Return the money to the people who have paid.\n\n  Of course, we also have a challenge with our economy weakening. It \nhas weakened over the past year. We have an opportunity to do something \nmore immediate on tax changes and put more money back into the economy \nin the short run. I am hopeful that we will do that.\n  The budget the President has proposed, the budget we will be talking \nabout, does strengthen and reform education. It provides the Education \nDepartment with the largest percentage increase of any Federal \ndepartment. It triples the funding for children's reading programs.\n  It does protect Social Security. It preserves Social Security by \nlocking away all of the $2.6 trillion Social Security payments that \nwill be paid in and the surplus for Social Security.\n  It strengthens defense, which has to necessarily be one of our \npriorities. We have not, over the past several years, done what we have \nneeded to do to keep our defense the toughest in the world, or have the \noversight to make an evaluation of where we are on weapons, or to do \nsomething for the volunteer service to encourage people to be in the \nmilitary, or to do something about the living conditions of our \nmilitary personnel.\n  We need to protect the environment. Right now we are faced with a \nchallenge, a crisis in energy, and much of that will have to be \nresolved by more production, by, as in my State of Wyoming, producing \nmore resources for energy.\n  As we do that, we must equally be concerned about protecting the \nenvironment. We are being challenged by organizations that say: If you \nare going to protect the environment, you cannot have access, you \ncannot use those lands at all. Those are not the choices. We can, \nindeed, have access to public land. We can, indeed, utilize those \nresources and allow people to hike, hunt, produce on those lands, and, \nat the same time, protect the environment.\n  Next week is going to be one of the most challenging weeks as we deal \nwith the budget, our priorities, and what we are going to do about the \nsurpluses. Americans are paying the highest percentage of tax of gross \nnational product, higher than World War II. That should not be the \ncase, and we have an opportunity to change it.\n  We have an opportunity to let local people and the States be involved \nin the decisions rather than dictating from Washington, as we have \nbecome accustomed to over the last number of years.\n  We have an opportunity to do some things, and I am excited about that \nopportunity. It is very important we pass a budget. If we do not do \nthat, we will not be able to deal with tax reductions, which I think \nare terribly important, not only as a matter of fairness to the \nAmerican people but as a matter of helping this economy and moving it \nforward as quickly as we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/28/senate-section/article/S3021-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3021-S3022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Madam President, we will have many important debates \nover the coming year on this Senate floor. Debates about tax cuts, \nspending priorities, education and defense, health care and \nagriculture. But none of these debates will be more important to the \nfuture of our democratic process than the debate over campaign finance \nreform.\n  From the time I sat at our kitchen table balancing the books on my \nhusband's earliest campaign to his race for the U.S. Senate, I have \nwitnessed the changing face of campaigns.\n  Last year's U.S. Senate race in Missouri shattered all previous \nrecords. The two opposing campaigns spent almost $18 million. This \nfigure does not include spending by the state parties or outside \ninterest groups.\n  For $18 million, Missouri could have done any one of the following:\n  built two new elementary schools;\n  hired 500 new teachers;\n  sent 3800 students to the University of Missouri;\n  provided day care to an additional 5000 low-income children;\n  put 9,000 new computers into our schools.\n  There is no accounting of the hours and effort that went into raising \nthese large sums of money. It is time and energy I am sure all Senators \nwould rather spend discussing the issues and dealing with problems \naffecting their constituents.\n  The traditional face-to-face visits with voters at the State fair, \nthe local diner or a town hall play a much smaller role in modern \npolitical campaigns. Instead, candidates introduce themselves with \ncostly and skillfully packaged commercials.\n  According to a recent study, viewers in the Kansas City area were \nexposed to over 22,000 campaign commercials during the 2000 election \ncycle. At 30 seconds apiece, that is the equivalent of 187 straight \nhours of campaign ads. The same study showed that the number of ads \nnationwide has nearly tripled since 1998. Without reform, there is no \nend in sight.\n  Not only do candidates air ads to get their own message out, they \nmust also respond to negative attacks. More and more, our political \ndiscourse is turning away from an honest discussion of the issues \naffecting the average American. Personal attacks and outrageous \ndistortions are all too common.\n  What are the consequences?\n  Today, Americans are more cynical and more disconnected from the \ngovernment than ever. They read of huge contributions from special \ninterest groups and wonder how one small voice can possibly be heard \nover the shouts of large donors to political campaigns.\n  Election day for them is not a celebration of self-government, but a \nfinale to months of nasty, negative messages that have invaded their \nhomes and mailboxes.\n  To rejuvenate our democracy, we must change the common perception and \nreality that our political system is dominated by big money. To wean \nAmerican politics from these excesses will be costly and painful, but \nwe must begin.\n  While many reforms are necessary, purging the system of unlimited \ndonations to campaigns through so called ``soft money'' is a necessary \nfirst step.\n  Some would argue that passing McCain-Feingold will hurt the \nDemocratic Party, but I say if we do not pass\n\n[[Page S3022]]\n\nMcCain-Feingold, we will be hurting the democratic process.\n  This is a time when all of us, Democrats and Republicans alike, must \ndo what is right for our country, what is right for our democracy.\n  The Biblical account of Joshua and the battle of Jericho shows us the \nstrength of a united voice. We are told that ``the people shouted with \na great shout, so that the walls fell down.''\n  If we speak with one voice, the wall of ``soft money'' that separates \nordinary citizens from their government will come down. Only then can \nwe be confident that campaigns are decided by the power of our ideas, \nnot by the power of our pocketbooks.\n  I enthusiastically support campaign finance reform and hope that we \ncan pass legislation that reduces the influence of money in politics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/28/senate-section/article/S3022-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH AND JACKIE STILES\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Madam President, this month we celebrate Women's \nHistory Month. It is an opportunity to reflect on the successes, \nadvances and contributions women have made and are making in American \nlife.\n  Today, I have the special privilege of honoring a woman who is not \nonly celebrating women's history this month--she is making it.\n  Jackie Stiles stands 5 feet 8 inches tall, but she is a giant on and \noff the court. Earlier this week, she led the Lady Bears of Southwest \nMissouri State into victory over Washington, securing her team a spot \nin the NCAA Final Four. It was the latest accomplishment in the life of \nthis remarkable young woman.\n  In high school, she was a 14-time state track champion and once \nscored 71 points in a single basketball game. Her fans would show up at \nnine in the morning with lounge chairs to be first in line when the gym \ndoors opened at 4:30. They just wanted to catch a glimpse of Jackie in \naction. She is a hero in her home town--and in towns across America \nwhere young girls dream impossible dreams. Jackie shows them dreams can \nhappen.\n  At Southwest Missouri State, Jackie Stiles has scored--as of today--\n3,361 points, becoming the all-time leading scorer in the NCAA. She has \nalso become the heart of the Lady Bears. Every time she plays, she \nthrills the sell out crowds at the Hammons Student Center--better known \nas the ``House of Stiles.''\n  On Friday, the team will come home to Missouri for the Final Four. \nAnd with all due respect to my colleagues from the great state of \nIndiana, I predict a big win over Purdue for Jackie Stiles and the Lady \nBears.\n  Jackie Stiles didn't become a star overnight. She does it the hard \nway--the only way she knows how. She began training at age two with her \nfather and has pushed herself ever since. She goes to the gym and won't \nleave until she makes 1,000 shots.\n  The story of Jackie Stiles is also the story of Title IX, the \nlandmark civil rights legislation which set out to curtail \ndiscrimination against women and girls in education and athletics. \nWithout Title IX, we might never have heard of heroes like Jackie \nStiles. In 1971, the year before Title IX, only 25,000 women competed \nin college sports. Today, that figure has grown to more than 135,000 \nwomen--including one very talented player who wears the number ten \njersey for Southwest Missouri State.\n  Jackie's success is measured in more than just rebounds, lay-ups, and \njump shots. She has brought attention to women's sports, and has proven \nthat women's basketball is exciting. Most of all, she is a role model \nand an inspiration for thousands of girls.\n  If she chooses, Jackie's next stop is probably the WNBA. I have no \ndoubt that she will become one of the league's greatest attractions. \nShe will help not only her team but her sport and all those who \nappreciate and enjoy it.\n  Mr. President, in honor of Women's History Month, I'd like to offer \nmy congratulations to Jackie Stiles, the Lady Bears of Southwest \nMissouri State, and all the other heroes who are bringing women's \nsports to a new high and teaching young girls to follow their dreams. \nMay they continue to thrill, entertain, and inspire us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/28/senate-section/article/S3022-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I will take a little bit of time \nbecause I think other Senators will be coming out to the floor soon to \ntalk about where we are on the hard money changes. We had a proposal by \nSenator Thompson which basically raised the amount of money that an \nindividual could give to a candidate from $1,000 to $2,500 per \nelection; from $2,000 to $5,000 over a 2-year cycle; so $2,500 per \nelection, primary, general, up to $5,000 per candidate. There are other \nprovisions as a part of the Thompson amendment.\n  The other one I want to mention is raising the aggregate limit from \n$30,000 to $50,000, which actually per cycle means $100,000.\n  So what we are saying now is an individual can give up to $5,000 \nsupporting a candidate, and in the aggregate, an individual, one \nindividual could give as much as $100,000 to candidates.\n  I have recited the statistics on the floor so many times that I am \nboring myself. But there is the most huge disconnect between the way in \nwhich--here on the floor of the Senate and in the ante room--the way \nthat people who come together in the lobbying coalitions are defining \ncompromise and victory, and the way people in coffee shops think about \nthis. One-quarter of 1 percent of the population contributes $200 or \nmore, one-ninth of 1 percent of the population contributes $1,000 or \nmore.\n  So I do not really see the benefit of injecting yet more money into \npolitics, literally turning some of the hard money into soft money. I \nam sure people in the country are bewildered by hard money, soft money. \nLet me put it this way. I don't see how politics that becomes more \ndependent on big contributors, heavy hitters, people who have more \nmoney and can afford to make these contributions, is better politics. I \njust don't get it.\n  On the Thompson amendment, there was a motion to table. It was \ndefeated. I thought, frankly, some of the moderates on the Republican \nside who were part of the reform camp would have voted against the \nThompson amendment. They did not. Senator Feinstein came out with an \namendment, and her amendment basically doubles the limits. So I guess \nwe go from $1,000 to $2,000 and then $2,000 to $4,000 and it raises the \naggregate amount but not a lot.\n  The Feinstein amendment is certainly better than the Thompson \namendment. Now there are some negotiations. Regardless of what happens \nin these negotiations, the point is the headlines in the newspapers in \nthe country tomorrow for the lead story should be ``U.S. Senate Votes \nfor Reform, Votes to Put More Big Money Into Politics,'' because that \nis really what we are doing. I think this is a huge mistake. I have two \nchildren who teach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/28/senate-section/article/S3022-4", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to keep the floor as we move on to the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam Chair, I have two children who are teachers. I\n\n[[Page S3023]]\n\ncan tell you right now that neither one of them can afford to make a \n$1,000 contribution or a $2,000 contribution or $4,000 or $5,000 in an \nelection cycle. I can tell you right now that neither one of them can \nafford to make $30,000 worth of contributions. My God, that is, \nfrankly, the salary of a good many teachers in this country. They \ncannot afford to make those kinds of contributions.\n  On the floor of the Senate we are saying, my gosh, the reality is \nthat we have this inflation and $1,000 isn't worth $1,000. The reality \nis that the vast majority of the people in the country don't make these \nbig contributions; therefore, we don't pay as much attention to them; \ntherefore, they have become increasingly disillusioned, and now as a \npart of this deal we are raising the spending limits--whatever the \ncompromise is. It seems to me that it goes exactly in the opposite \ndirection than we should be going.\n  How are ordinary citizens who can't afford to make these big \ncontributions going to feel--that this political process is now going \nto be better for them when we have taken the caps off and have raised \nthe contribution level? Now people who are running for office are going \nto be even more dependent on the top 1 percent of the population. How \nis that reform?\n\n  I haven't done the analysis. I do not know how it will add up. My \nguess is that while, on the one hand we are taking the soft money out, \nwe are now going to be putting a whole lot more hard money into \npolitics. In the election year 2000, 80 percent of the money in \npolitics was hard money.\n  I am not trying to denigrate taking soft money out--the prohibition \non soft money that is in McCain-Feingold. But as this legislation moves \nalong, I am, in particular, saddened and a little bit indignant that we \nare now defining ``reform'' to raise the limits so those people who can \nafford to make a $1,000 contribution can now make $2,000; those who can \nafford over 6 months--whatever cycle--to make not $2,000 but to now \nmake $4,000 contributions will be able to do so.\n  The argument that some of my colleagues make is the fact that 99 \npercent of the population can't afford to do this doesn't mean we \nshouldn't let the other 1 percent.\n  But I tell you what is going to happen. We are going to be even more \ndependent on the big givers. We are going to become even more divorced \nfrom all of those people who we serve who can't afford to make those \ncontributions. We are going to spend even less time. There will be even \nless of an emphasis on the small fund raisers and less of an emphasis \non grassroots politics. It is a tragedy that we are doing this.\n  I do not know how the bill will ultimately go. I think this is a \nterrible mistake. It has that sort of ``made for Congress'' look.\n  This is the sort of agreement that is a victory, Minnesotans. This \nvictory is for all you Minnesotans who now contribute $1,000 or more. \nYou will be able to give even more money to candidates. Minnesotans, \nplease listen. The Senate is now pretty soon about to pass a reform \nmeasure. All of you Minnesotans who contribute $1,000 and $2,000 a year \nand can afford to do it will now be able to double your contributions. \nI am sure people in Minnesota will just feel great about this. I am \nsure people in Minnesota will feel that this is real reform. And I am \nsure 99 percent of the people in Minnesota will feel it is true.\n  This is a game we can't play: You pay, you play. You don't pay, you \ndon't play.\n  I will finish, maybe, but just to make one other point.\n  I am looking at this in too personal of a way by showing more \nindignation than I should. People can disagree. That is the way it is. \nYou win or lose votes.\n  We talk about getting rid of soft money. With what we are now about \nto do on these individual spending limits, there is a bunch of people \nwho will never be able to run for this Senate. They are really not. I \nwill tell you who those people are. They are women and men who \nthemselves don't have a lot of money and who take positions that go \nagainst a lot of the money interests in this country and people who \nhave the economic resources.\n  I said earlier that the Chair would be interested in this because of \nher own history. I was talking about the Fannie Lou Hamer Project. \nSpencer Overton from the Fannie Lou Hamer Project was speaking \nyesterday at the press conference. Fannie Lou Hamer, as the Chair \nknows, was this great civil rights leader, daughter of a sharecropper \nfamily, large family, grew up poor, and became the leader of the \nMississippi Democratic Party. She was a great leader, a poor person, a \npoor woman, and a great African-American leader.\n  He was saying yesterday that there are not any Senators who look like \nFannie Lou Hamer. He was right. He went on to say that the truth is, \nthis isn't an issue of corruption. This is an issue of representation--\nof whether there is inclusion or exclusion. The Fannie Lou Hamers of \nthis country are going to be even less well represented when we become \neven more dependent on those fat cats who can make these huge \ncontributions.\n  How is a woman such as Fannie Lou Hamer, a great woman, ever going to \nrun? How about people who want to represent the Fannie Lou Hamers? How \nare they going to have a chance to run? They are going to be clobbered.\n  Democrats, don't get angry at me, but there are plenty of Democrats \nwho will be able to raise the money. That is good. You will be able to \nget the two, or three, or four, or five, or six. I don't know what \ntheir final deal will be. You will be able to get those big \ncontributions. But you will pay a price. Democrats, we will pay a \nprice. We are paying that price. We will dilute our policy performance. \nWe will trim down what we stand for. We will be more reluctant to take \ncontroversial positions on test economic issues. We will be less \nwilling to challenge economic and political power in America today than \nwe are already, and today we are not so willing to challenge that \npower.\n  This isn't just like statistics. And here is one proposal to raise \nthe money, and here is another one, and now we have a compromise. This \nis about representation.\n  Spencer was right. Spencer Overton was right. Fannie Lou Hamers are \nnot going to be well represented at all. I doubt whether hardly anybody \nwho comes from those economic circumstances today and who take \npositions that are antithetical to economic and political power in \nAmerica--I hate to argue conspiracy. I am just talking about the \nrealities. Are they ever going to be able to run? I don't think they \nwill be able to run. It is going to be very hard. If you are well known \nor an incumbent, you have a pretty good chance. That is good.\n  We get some great people here. We have the Presiding Officer. We have \nSenator Kennedy. Senator Dayton is here--people who have been well \nknown for good reasons and who have accomplished a lot in their lives. \nThe Chair has. People who have economic resources--Senator Kennedy \ndoes, and Senator Dayton does--care deeply about these issues. That is \nnot my point.\n  My point is that as we rely more and more on the big contributors and \nthe well oiled and the well heeled and the heavy hitters, all of us who \nare running are going to become more dependent on that money. The \npeople who are going to have the most difficult time ever getting \nelected are going to be ordinary citizens, which I think means they are \nthe best citizens. I mean that not in a pejorative way but in a \npositive way. They are not going to have a prayer. They are not going \nto have access to this money.\n  Let's not kid ourselves. If you believe the standard of a \nrepresentative democracy is that each person should count as one, and \nno more than one, we have moved dangerously far away from that. I do \nnot see how any kind of ``compromise,'' defined by the pattern of power \nright here in the Senate today, represents a step forward, where we now \nare going to say that those people who are the big givers are going to \nbe able to give more and those people running for office are going to \nbe more dependent on them.\n  I bet you, Madam Chair, that after this amendment or this compromise \npasses, that over 50 percent of the money that will be raised in the \nnext election cycle--the cycle I am in--over 50 percent of the money \nthat will be raised will be in these large contributions, raised from, \nagain, about 1 percent of the population.\n  Now I ask you, how does that represent reform? How does that make\n\n[[Page S3024]]\n\nthis a healthier representative democracy? I think it is a huge \nmistake. And, I, for one, am adamantly opposed and want to express my \nopposition.\n  I am not out on the floor to launch a filibuster, so I will yield the \nfloor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we expect the group that has been \nworking on a compromise on the hard money contribution limit to come \nback to the floor at some point in the next hour or so. Rather than sit \naround and churn, it is agreeable to both sides for Senator DeWine, who \nwill have the next amendment after we finish the disposition of the \nThompson and Feinstein matter, to go on and lay his amendment down, \nwhich he can set aside when those involved in the discussions come back \nto the floor. He can lay down his amendment and begin the discussion. I \nbelieve that is all right with the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes. What I suggest is that this requires unanimous consent \nas we go along.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Ohio be recognized for \na half hour for the purpose of offering his amendment and speaking on \nhis amendment, and that at the hour of 3:30, the Senate would revert to \na quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized until the hour of 3:30.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 152\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], for himself, Mr. Hatch, \n     Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Roberts, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 152.\n\n (Purpose: To strike title II, including section 204 of such title, as \n  added by the amendment proposed by Mr. Wellstone (Amendment No. 145)\n\n       Beginning on page 12, strike line 14 and all that follows \n     through page 31, line 8.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment, which I \nwill explain in just a moment. I offer it on behalf of myself, Senator \nHatch, Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas, Senator Brownback, and Senator \nRoberts.\n  Our amendment is very simple. It is a motion to strike title II, the \nWellstone-Snowe-Jeffords provision from the underlying McCain-Feingold \nbill.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is necessary because title II draws an \narbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional line--a line that \nabridges the first amendment rights of U.S. citizens. Under title II, \ncitizens groups--and I emphasize that this is currently in the bill and \nunless our amendment is adopted, it will stay in the bill--American \ncitizens would be prohibited from discussing on television or radio a \ncandidate's voting records and positions within 60 days before a \ngeneral election or 30 days before a primary.\n  That is right, Mr. President, and Members of the Senate. It would be \nillegal for citizens of this country, at the most crucial time, when \nfree speech matters the most, when political speech matters the most--\nthat is, right before an election--this Congress would be saying, and \nthe ``thought police'' would be saying, the ``political speech police'' \nwould be saying that you cannot mention a candidate's name; you cannot \ncriticize that candidate by name.\n  It silences the voices of the people. It silences them at a time when \nit is most important for those voices to be heard. It restricts \ncitizens' ability to use the broadcast media to hold incumbents \naccountable for their voting records. It says essentially that the only \npeople who have a right to the most effective form of political speech, \nthe only people allowed to use television or radio to freely express an \nopinion or to take a stand on an issue when it counts, when it is \nwithin days of an election, are the candidates themselves and the news \nmedia. But under the way the bill is written now, not the people--just \ncandidates and the news media. Everyone else would be silenced by this \nunconstitutional, arbitrary line.\n  Let's suppose for a minute that title II stays in the bill and it \nbecomes law. Under this scenario, if you are a candidate running for \nFederal office and it is 60 days before the election, yes, you can go \non the radio or the local television station and broadcast your \nmessage. If you are lucky enough to be Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, or Peter \nJennings, or the person who anchors the 6 o'clock news or 7 o'clock \nnews in Dayton, OH; or in Steubenville, OH; or in Cleveland, you can \nalso talk about the issues and candidates, and you can talk about them \ntogether. You can talk about the candidate's voting record.\n  But if you don't fall into either one of these two categories--if you \nare part of a citizens group wanting to enter the political debate and \nengage in meaningful discourse, using the most wide-sweeping medium for \nreaching the people which is TV, under this provision you cannot do \nthat. You simply cannot enter the debate using television or radio as a \nmode of communication.\n  Title II of this bill makes that illegal. So if you would go in to \nbuy an ad and say you want to criticize where the ad mentions the name \nof a candidate who is up for election within that 60-day period, the \nlocal broadcaster would have to turn to you and say, no, he cannot \naccept that. It is illegal because the U.S. Congress has said it is \nillegal.\n  Title II would make it illegal for citizens groups to take to the \nairwaves and even mention a political candidate by name. It would make \nit illegal to state something as simple as to tell the voters whether \nor not a candidate voted yes or no on an issue. It basically just \nthrows the rights of citizens groups out of the political ring. It \nthrows them right out of the ring. I believe that is wrong and I think \nit is also unconstitutional.\n\n  It represents a direct violation of the people's right to free \npolitical speech, the right guaranteed to us by the first amendment of \nthe Bill of Rights in the Constitution of the United States of America.\n  The language in this bill picks the time when political speech is the \nmost important and restricts who can use that political speech, and who \ncan engage in that political speech.\n  Let me tell you an example from the real world. It is an example that \ncould have involved me. I have been a proponent for something in Ohio \nwe refer to as the Darby Refuge. It would be a wildlife refuge in \ncentral Ohio. I won't trouble or bother Members of the Senate now with \nthe reasons why I have been a strong advocate for this, but I have \nbeen. I think it is the right thing to do.\n  There are also citizens in the State of Ohio who live in that area of \nthe State who don't think it is such a good idea. They have exercised \ntheir first amendment rights time after time to explain to me and to \nother citizens in Ohio who are driving down the highway that it is not \nsuch a good idea, and that this proposed wildlife refuge is not the \nthing to do. We have seen signs up--and I think they are still up--\nwhich say ``No Darby, Dump DeWine.'' We have seen signs that say ``Get \nMike DeWine Out of my Backyard.'' That was on a T-shirt. Other signs \nhave been around also.\n  Obviously, I didn't particularly like the fact that these signs were \nthere.\n  What was my response to people when they said, What about those \nsigns? I tried to explain why I was for the Darby, but I also said: The \nfirst amendment is there; it is alive and well, and people are \nexercising their constitutional rights.\n  Let us suppose this citizens group--actually there are two formal \ncitizens groups that oppose the Darby and have been very vocal about \nit. Let us suppose that within 60 days prior to the last November \nelection--I was up for reelection last November --let us suppose they \nhad put some money together, and let us suppose they went to the \nColumbus TV stations and the Dayton TV stations. Let us also suppose \nthis title II was law.\n  Let us suppose they took their money and went to buy an ad, and what \nthey wanted to talk about in that ad was why the refuge was a bad idea. \nLet us suppose also they wanted to convey another message, and that \nmessage was: Call Senator Mike DeWine\n\n[[Page S3025]]\n\nand tell him he is wrong. Call Senator Mike DeWine and tell him that \nyou oppose the refuge and you think he should as well.\n  I would not have liked that. It probably would have irritated me. But \nthey have a constitutional right to do that if they want to do it.\n  Under the bill as now written, they could not do that. The TV station \nin Dayton or the TV station in Columbus would have had to turn to them \nand say: Oh, no, you cannot say that; there are only certain things you \ncan say. You can talk about the refuge being a bad idea, but you cannot \nmention Mike DeWine's name.\n  That is when it would become apparent to these citizens that their \nfirst amendment rights were being abridged, and the person who ran the \nTV station, the general manager, would have had to tell them: Congress \nsaid you cannot run this type of ad. I submit that is wrong.\n  As much as those of us who have been in public office and who have \nfaced tough elections do not like criticism, as much as sometimes we \nthink political ads that attack us are unfair, as much as we sometimes \nthink they distort, as much as sometimes we think they only tell half \nthe story, that is just part of the political process. That is what the \nfirst amendment is all about.\n  The fact is that today in a State such as Ohio, my home State, if you \nwant to reach the people of the State, there is really only one way to \neffectively do it, and that is the use of television. You have to be on \nthe air, and you have to get your message across. That is true whether \nyou are running for office and you are the candidate or whether you are \na group of citizens who decide they want to convey a message, they feel \nstrongly about an issue and want to link that issue with a person who \nis running for office. Today they can do that. The way the bill is now \nwritten, they cannot.\n  The fact is, given today's national political discourse in the modern \nage of technology, television and radio play the primary, if not the \nkey, role in the spreading of political messages. The whole reason we \nuse the names of candidates in political speech on television is to \nemphasize policy positions and alternative policy options. Doing so \nenables people to evaluate and support or criticize incumbents' voting \nrecords and their positions on issues. That is the basis, the very \nessence, of political speech and debate.\n  Messages about the candidates, about their voting records and their \npositions on the issues, speak louder and have a greater impact on \nvoters than just generic issue ads about Social Security or about \nMedicare, tax cuts, or whatever is the issue of the day.\n\n  Constitutionally, we cannot deny citizens groups access to the most \neffective means of reaching the largest number of people for the least \namount of money, and that is TV and radio. We cannot deny them the \nability to communicate through television and radio during the time \nperiod most vital to deciding the outcome of an election, the time when \nthey can have the most impact. We should not deny them a voice in the \npolitical debate, but, unfortunately, title II effectively does just \nthat.\n  Ultimately, political speech is directly tied to electoral speech. We \ncannot escape that. We cannot escape, nor should we try to escape, the \nfact that our Constitution protects the rights of people to support or \nto criticize their Government or the people running for Federal office. \nThe founders of this country recognized that. They knew from their own \npersonal experience in forming this Nation that political speech is of \nthe highest value, particularly during the election season, and it must \nbe protected.\n  Given that, the last thing we should be doing is restricting 60 days \nbefore an election the people's right to get the word out to voters \nabout the issues and about the candidates. Such a restriction is \nabsurd. Such a restriction is wrong. Such a restriction is blatantly, \ncertifiably unconstitutional.\n  I realize that criticism, very often part of political speech, makes \nincumbents uncomfortable. It makes us all uncomfortable. I know this. I \nhave been there. Do I like to be criticized? No. Does anyone like to be \ncriticized? No. Do we like to see our voting record picked apart? No.\n  The fact remains that no matter how much those in public office do \nnot like to hear negative political speech, our Constitution protects \nthat very speech. Federally elected officials are here to serve the \npeople, and the people deserve the right to cheer us or to chastise us, \nparticularly during an election campaign.\n  Are we, as Members of this body, becoming the political speech \npolice? Are we becoming the guardians of incumbent protection? Are we \nso worried about tough criticism from outside groups, American \ncitizens? Are we so concerned about what we consider to be unfairness \nand the potentially misleading nature of their message that we are \nwilling to curtail their basic, constitutional, first amendment rights?\n  I hope not, and I hope we adopt this amendment and pull back from \nthis infringement on people's constitutional rights. We all should be \noffended by the attempt to do that.\n  The fact is that the limits imposed by title II on political speech, \nlimits on legitimate political discourse, debate, and discussion will \nhurt voters. The voters will have less opportunity to make informed \nchoices in elections. It is the voters and the public who ultimately \nwill lose.\n  Allow me to read directly from the Bill of Rights--and we are all \nfamiliar with it--amendment I:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \n     abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the \n     right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition \n     the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\n  I repeat, ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of \nspeech. . . .''\n  These are very simple words, but they are some of the most powerful \nand certainly most important words in the Bill of Rights and in our \nConstitution.\n  I am certain that my colleagues in the Senate all realize our \nFounding Fathers, when crafting our Bill of Rights and our first \namendment protections, had political speech--political speech \nspecifically--in mind. They knew how important and vital and necessary \nfree speech is to our political process and to the preservation of our \ndemocracy. They knew that democracy is stifled by muzzles and gags. \nThey knew that free speech was necessary for our political system--our \nopen, free political system--to function and, yes, to flourish. They \nknew that liberty without free speech is really not liberty at all.\n  We all understand that none of our rights is absolute. In fact, there \nare constitutionally acceptable limits on political speech. For \nexample, the Supreme Court has ruled that the government has an \ninterest in regulating political speech when there is a clear and \npresent danger that the speech will result in the imminent likelihood \nof violence. Also, the Court has said that defamation laws apply to \npolitical candidates, so as to protect them from statements that are \nknowingly false. In such situations, the government has a compelling \ninterest in restricting the speech. I ask my colleagues: What is the \ngovernment's overriding and compelling interest in restricting core \npolitical speech 60 days or less from an election--at the time most \ncrucial to the public's interest in hearing and learning about \ncandidates and their positions and incumbents and their voting records? \nHow will restricting the most important speech at the most important \ntime further our election process and political system? It clearly will \nnot.\n\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that core political speech is \ndifferent from other forms of speech. It lies at the heart of the first \namendment and deserves the highest--the utmost--level of protection. To \nthat extent, I agree with Justice Thomas who said that political speech \nis the very speech that our founding fathers had in mind when actually \ndrafting our Bill of Rights and our first amendment protection. Justice \nThomas further argued that the key time for political speech is during \ncampaigns. He wrote:\n\n       The Founders sought to protect the rights of individuals to \n     engage in political speech because a self-governing people \n     depend upon the free exchange of political information. And \n     that free exchange should receive the most protection when it \n     matters the most--during campaigns for electrive office.\n\n  The Supreme Court, in Buckley v. Valeo, emphasized the importance of\n\n[[Page S3026]]\n\nprotecting political speech. The Court wrote:\n\n       The First Amendment denies government the power to \n     determine that spending to promote one's political views is \n     wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society ordained \n     by our Constitution, it is not the government, but the \n     people--individually, as citizens and candidates, and \n     collectively, as associations and political committees--who \n     must retain control over the quality and range of debate on \n     public issues in a political campaign.\n\n  The Court was telling Congress, essentially, to stay out. It was \nsaying don't diminish the first amendment rights of citizens and \norganizations to participate in political debate. Don't restrict the \nmeans by which the people of this nation make informed decisions about \ncandidates running for federal office.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, in order to embrace the freedoms \nguaranteed by the first amendment, we must allow others to exercise \nthose freedoms. Title II runs counter to that, and in the process, \nviolates our Constitution.\n  Title II hugely undercuts the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform \nbill. It has turned the campaign finance debate on its head. It has \nturned the debate into a clear struggle over the soul of the first \namendment, and ultimately, the preservation of our democracy.\n  If we are to protect and preserve our democracy, we must allow the \npeople to be heard. Voters cannot make informed decisions about \ncandidates when political speech--when ideas and information about \ncandidates--is restricted at the most pressing time. As voters, we make \nbetter decisions when there are more voices, more information, and more \nideas on the table. Ideas competing with one another. That is the \nessence of democracy.\n  That is the basis for political debate and challenges to public \npolicy.\n  That is the basis for how we make changes in our society--for how we \nmake the world a better place. With all of the complexities of today's \nelection laws and competing campaign finance reform plans, I think that \nRalph Winter, the respected judge and former law professor, said it \nbest when he noted that the greatest election reform ever conceived was \nthe first amendment. He was right. Unfortunately, title II strikes at \nthe first amendment by restricting the dissemination of information to \nvoters and the open exchange of ideas that we so much treasure.\n  The exchange of those ideas, Mr. President--through core political \nspeech, whether it's two years, two months, two weeks, or two days \nbefore an election--is a prerequisite for democratic governance. That \nis the basis of our Constitution. We in Congress have an obligation to \nprotect that Constitution--to protect our first amendment and the free \nflow of ideas. That, after all, is the spirit--the essence--the \nfoundation of our democracy.\n  What all of this means is simply this: If you are a citizens group, \nyou are an American citizen, and you don't like what I am saying today \nor what this amendment does, or what my vote will be on final passage \nof this bill, under this bill, as currently written, you could not talk \nabout any of this if it were right before a Federal election. You could \nnot use the airways and the TV and radio to criticize me or to talk \nabout this vote and to talk about this amendment. If we accept this, it \nwill silence a citizen's ability to tell the public about our voting \nrecords.\n  What this language says is that we are afraid to let people tell the \noutside world what we do in the Senate. We can't do that. Rather, I \nbelieve we must protect the rights of the people. We must preserve our \nConstitution. We must not let that great Constitution, that great Bill \nof Rights, that first amendment be chipped away by efforts clearly \naimed at protecting the self-interests of the incumbent political \ncandidates. To do any less, as we change this, as we amend it, to do \nany less would fly in the face of our democracy and the American people \nwhom we are here to serve.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent I may proceed as in morning \nbusiness for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. 638 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I now suggest a period of, say, 15 minutes \nfor general discussion on an agreement that has been reached between \nSenator Thompson and Senator Feinstein. On the purpose of that \ndiscussion, why don't I yield to Senator Thompson of Tennessee to begin \nthe discussion and then Senator Feinstein as time permits, as far as \nthis agreement, or others who may want to talk about it. My hope would \nthen be we would have legislative language which would include this \ncompromise which we would be able to offer as a modification of the \nThompson amendment, and a vote to occur thereon shortly after the \ndebate is concluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator have a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. DODD. No. We are just going to proceed in this regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Connecticut is \ncorrect. Senator Feinstein and others and I have been meeting, talking \nabout how we might come together for a unified modification of my \namendment. As this body knows, my amendment was not tabled. Senator \nFeinstein's amendment was not tabled. That was the basis for our \ndiscussion.\n  We acknowledge readily that it was certainly appropriate to increase \nthe hard money limits in certain important categories.\n  We had a full discussion of those categories of concerns and desires \non either side.\n  Pending the language and subject to comments of my distinguished \ncolleague from California, I would like to basically outline the \nhighlights of the crucial elements of this modification.\n  The individual limitation to candidates, which now stands at $1,000, \nwill be increased to $2,000 and indexed. The PAC limitation of $5,000 \nunder current law stays at $5,000. The State local party committees, \nwhich is now $5,000 a calendar year under current law, will go to \n$10,000 per year. The contribution to national parties, which under \ncurrent law is limited to $20,000 a year, will go to $25,000 a year and \nbe indexed at the base.\n  The aggregate limit, which is now $25,000 per calendar year under \ncurrent law, will go to $37,500 a year and be similarly indexed.\n  We will double the amount that national party committees can give to \ncandidates from $17,500 to $35,000 and be similarly indexed.\n  A part of our agreement also has to do with the amendment originally \nfrom Senator Schumer, that was later incorporated into the Feinstein \namendment, having to do with the 441 situation he described pending the \nSupreme Court decision in the Colorado case; that we expect a part of \nour agreement with regard to this modification is that it will not be a \npart of this Thompson-Feinstein modification but will get a vote \nseparately shortly after the vote on this.\n  I believe that basically outlines the major provisions of the \nagreement.\n  I relinquish the floor and ask my distinguished colleague from \nCalifornia to make any statement she cares to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank the \nSenator from Tennessee, the Senator from Wisconsin, the Senator from \nArizona, the Senator from Connecticut, the senior Senator from \nMississippi, as well as\n\n[[Page S3027]]\n\nthe senior Senator from New York--all who participated in this \nnegotiation.\n  Essentially the question was around whether we could bring enough \npeople together to settle what is a question that has become a major \nproblem; that is, how do we account for inflation in hard money because \nit is likely we will not address this issue for another 20 or 30 or 40 \nyears. Therefore, this is a bill that has to stand the test of time.\n  Many of us are deeply concerned that once you restrict soft money in \ncampaigns and in parties, you create an opportunity for this soft money \nto go into the issue of advocacy of independent campaigns. It is \nundisclosed. It is unregulated. So what we want to try to avoid as much \nas we can is a transfer of millions of dollars of soft money from \ncampaigns into millions of dollars of soft money into independent \ncampaigns.\n  The way we do this is by trying to find a modest vehicle by which we \ncan come together and agree on how much an individual contribution \nlimit should be raised. I am very pleased to say that contribution \nlimit in the bipartisan agreement is $2,000. That $2,000 would be \nindexed, as will the other indexes I will speak about in a moment, for \ninflation from a baseline that is provided for in the statute.\n  We came to agreement on the PACs--that PACs should remain the same; \nthey should not be increased in amounts; they should remain at $5,000 a \ncalendar year.\n  We came to agreement on continuing State and local parties at the \nsame amount as McCain-Feingold--$10,000. That was clear in the Thompson \namendment, the Feinstein amendment, as well as the McCain-Feingold \nbill.\n  Also, where we had the major discussion--I say a difference of \nviewpoint--was on the aggregate limit and the national party \ncommittees.\n  The people who were negotiating are people who wanted to see a bill. \nAnd it was very difficult because each of our proposals was at the \nouter limits of our own political party. So it was very difficult to \nfind a way to move forward.\n  We did, however, in the Thompson amendment, which had $50,000 per \ncalendar year for the aggregate limit, and it was agreed that we would \ndrop that to $37,500 per year for the aggregate limit and that we would \ndrop out of that the split I had proposed earlier in my statement.\n  With respect to national parties, that would go from $20,000--just by \n$5,000 a year--to $25,000.\n  Additionally, there are four things in this bill that are indexed. \nAgain, the indexing is not compounded. It goes to the baseline in the \nstatute for the candidate, for the national party per year amount, and \nfor the aggregate amount.\n  Also, there is a provision in Thompson we agreed to which would \ndouble the amount that national parties can give to candidates from \n$17,500 to $35,000. That would be indexed on the same baseline formula \nas the other items.\n  In my view, and I hope in Senator Thompson's view, this gives us an \nopportunity to meet the future and to see that there is a modest \nincrease. It is not a tripling of the individual limit. It is simply \nincreasing it from $1,000 to $2,000 and then indexing it to inflation, \nbut that there is a the basis now, we hope, where both sides can come \ntogether and vote for this bill.\n  I, for one, happen to think the indexing is healthy. I think it gives \nus an opportunity that we don't come back again, to reopen the bill, \nbut that we live by the bill as it is finally adopted.\n  I really thank the Senator from Mississippi who began this fight with \nme. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for our ability to sit down \ntogether and have a turkey sandwich and also come to this agreement. I \nthink it is a very important step forward for the bill.\n  I thank the Senators from Wisconsin and Arizona for their persistence \nin moving this bill along.\n  I yield the floor.\n  May I ask if the modification is available?\n  Mr. DODD. As my colleague spoke, an angel brought it. The \nmodification has arrived.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, under the provisions of the consent \nagreement, with the concurrence of Senator Feinstein, myself, and \nSenator Dodd, Senator Thompson will now send a modification to the \ndesk.\n  In addition, I ask unanimous consent that the Feinstein amendment be \nwithdrawn and there now be 30 minutes of debate equally divided in the \nusual form prior to the vote on the Thompson amendment, as modified, \nwith no amendments in order to the amendment. I further ask consent \nthat following the vote, the pending DeWine amendment be set aside, \nSenator Schumer be recognized to offer an amendment, and there be 60 \nminutes equally divided in the usual form. Finally, I ask consent that \nfollowing the use or yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to a \nvote on the Schumer amendment, with no amendments in order to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 151), as modified, was withdrawn.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, it is my intention to send a \nmodification to the desk very shortly. It might take a couple moments.\n  Mr. DODD. To save a little time, if my colleague would yield, Mr. \nPresident, I have been looking at a couple drafting notes from \nlegislative counsel. I have spoken on numerous occasions over the last \nseveral days of my concerns of raising the hard dollar limits that \nindividuals may contribute on the theory that I do not think there is \ntoo little money in politics, on the contrary, I think there is too \nmuch money. We are shutting down the door of soft money. Fine, as it \nshould be. However, my concern is that we are also banging open the \nback door with hard dollars amounts. To the average citizen in this \ncountry, there is no distinction between hard and soft money. We make \nthe distinction for the reasons we are all aware of. What I believe is \npeople are sort of disgusted with the volume and amount of money in \npolitics. This agreement is one I am going to support. I do so \nreluctantly. However, I support the underlying McCain-Feingold bill. I \nthink it is very important that we take steps forward to change the \npresent campaign finance system. I regret we are adding to the hard \ndollar limits on contributions that individuals can make to candidates, \nnational political parties, and overall aggregate annual limit.\n  I come from a small State. I represent a State of 3.5 million people. \nMy colleague from California represents a State 10 times that size. I \nrecognize that there are distinctions between these States. For \nexample, campaigning is far more costly in California than it is in a \nState such as my own. I accept there needs to be some increase.\n  The modification Senator Thompson graciously worked out with Senator \nFeinstein exceeds what I would do. It is certainly less than what was \noffered by our colleague from Nebraska, Senator Hagel. It was less than \nwhat others wanted as well. It reduces substantially the aggregate \namounts that were originally being offered at $75,000 per year or \n$150,000 a couple, down to $37,500 per calendar year. That still is too \nmuch, in my view, but it is a lot less than it otherwise could have \nbeen.\n  There are some other changes dealing with individual contributions to \nState and local party committees and the national parties. However, the \nPAC limits remained the same. We provided indexing for inflation. \nAgain, this is something I have reservations about. I recognize that in \nany legislative body, if you are trying to put together a bill where \n100 different people have something to say about it, and you have to \nproduce 51 votes, then you are going to have to give up something if \nyou are going to accomplish the overall goal.\n  My overall goal has been for years to get McCain-Feingold adopted \ninto law. However, it was not a goal I was going to accept regardless \nof what was in the bill. Had we gone beyond these individual \ncontribution limits we had\n\n[[Page S3028]]\n\nagreed to in these modifications, I would have had a very difficult \ntime supporting the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  I will support McCain-Feingold. I urge my colleagues to do so. We \nhave other amendments to address on both sides. The Members have ideas \nthey want to add to this bill. In my view, this is a worthwhile effort. \nI commend my colleague from Tennessee--he is a noble warrior, a good \nfighter and debater, and a good negotiator--and our colleague from \nCalifornia who likewise has championed a good cause. I thank Russ \nFeingold and John McCain. I know this goes beyond even what they would \nlike to do. We recognize we can't do everything exactly as we would \nlike to do it. I believe this modification still is within the realm of \nthe McCain-Feingold restrictions. For those reasons, I will support the \nbill.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 149, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Tennessee has the floor to send the modification to the \ndesk.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, the modification has been sent to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and without \nobjection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 37, after line 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . MODIFICATION OF CONTRIBUTION LIMITS.\n\n       (a) Increase in Individual Limits.--Section 315(a)(1) of \n     the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. \n     441a(a)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``$1,000'' and \n     inserting ``$2,000''; and\n       (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``$20,000'' and \n     inserting ``$25,000''.\n       (b) Increase in Aggregate Individual Limit.--Section \n     315(a)(3) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 \n     U.S.C. 441a(a)(3)), as amended by section 102(b), is amended \n     by striking ``$30,000'' and inserting ``$37,500''.\n       (c) Increase in Senatorial Campaign Committee Limit.--\n     Section 315(h) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 \n     (2 U.S.C. 441a(h)) is amended by striking ``$17,500'' and \n     inserting ``$35,000''.\n       (d) Indexing of Contribution Limits.--Section 315(c) of the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 441a(c)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)--\n       (A) by striking the second and third sentences;\n       (B) by inserting ``(A)'' before ``At the beginning''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), in any \n     calendar year after 2002--\n       ``(i) a limitation established by subsections (a)(1)(A), \n     (a)(1)(B), (a)(3), (b), (d), or (h) shall be increased by the \n     percent difference determined under subparagraph (A);\n       ``(ii) each amount so increased shall remain in effect for \n     the calendar year; and\n       ``(iii) if any amount after adjustment under clause (i) is \n     not a multiple of $100, such amount shall be rounded to the \n     nearest multiple of $100.\n       ``(C) In the case of limitations under subsections \n     (a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(B), (a)(3), and (h) increases shall only be \n     made in odd-numbered years and such increases shall remain in \n     effect for the 2-year period beginning on the first day \n     following the date of the last general election in the year \n     preceding the year in which the amount is increased and \n     ending on the date of the next general election.''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (2)(B), by striking ``means the calendar \n     year 1974'' and inserting ``means--\n       ``(i) for purposes of subsections (b) and (d), calendar \n     year 1974; and\n       ``(ii) for purposes of subsections (a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(B), \n     (a)(3), and (h) calendar year 2001''.\n       (e) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to contributions made after the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I, too, commend the Senator from \nTennessee. I would love to have gone further to really provide full \nindexation for the limits that were established in 1974, 26 years ago, \nand were thought to be appropriate at that time. But any increase in \nhard money limits is a step in the right direction.\n  To give you an idea of what the world without soft money is going to \nlook like for our national parties, we took a look at the 2000 cycle, \nthe cycle just completed, and made an assumption that the party \ncommittees would have had to operate in 100 percent hard dollars, which \nis the way they will have to operate 30 days after this bill becomes \nlaw. The Republican National Committee would have had 37 million net \nhard dollars to spend had we converted the last cycle to 100 percent \nhard dollars. Under the current system, they had 75 million net hard \ndollars to spend. So the Republican National Committee would go from 75 \nmillion net hard dollars that it had to spend last cycle down to $37 \nmillion.\n  The Democratic National Committee, in a 100-percent hard money world, \nlast cycle, would have had 20 million net hard dollars to spend on \ncandidates. In fact, it had $48 million under the current system. So \nthe Democratic National Committee would go from 48 million net hard \ndollars down to 20 million net hard dollars, if you convert the last \ncycle into a 100-percent hard money world.\n  Finally, let me take a look at the two senatorial committees. The \nRepublican Senatorial Committee last cycle under the current system had \n14 million net hard dollars to spend on behalf of candidates. In a 100-\npercent hard money world, they would have had about 1.2 million net \nhard dollars to spend for candidates. Our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, the Democratic Senatorial Committee, in the current \nsystem had 6 million net hard dollars to spend on their candidates. In \na 100-percent hard money world, they would have had 800,000 hard \ndollars to have spent on all of their 33 candidates.\n  The one thing that is not in debate, there is no discussion about it, \nthis is going to create a remarkable, a huge shortage of dollars for \nthe party committees. At least the Senator from Tennessee is trying, \nthrough negotiating an increase in the hard money limits for parties \nand providing indexation, to help compensate for some of this dramatic \nloss of funds that all of the party committees are going to experience \n30 days after this bill becomes law.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for the effort he made. I wish we \ncould have done more. I hear there are plenty on the other side who \nwish we would have done less. This is at least a step in the right \ndirection.\n  We are going to have a massive shortage of funds in all of the \nnational party committees to help our candidates. It is going to be a \nreal scramble. Hopefully, this will help a bit make up at least a \nfraction of what is going to be lost on both sides that will be \navailable for candidate support.\n  I intend to support the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, do I control the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask the Senator from Arizona if he wishes to be heard \nat this time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. One minute.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to take a minute to thank Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Thompson. I have been privileged to see \nnegotiations and discussions between people of good faith and a common \npurpose. I was privileged to observe that in the case of Senator \nThompson and Senator Feinstein. The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, \nwas very important, as was the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, as \nwell as Senator Hagel of Nebraska and others, as well as the Senator \nfrom New York, Mr. Schumer. I know I am forgetting someone in this \ndepiction.\n  I am proud that people compromised without betraying principle to \ncome to a common ground so we can advance the cause of this effort. I \nexpress my deep and sincere appreciation to those Senators who made \nthis happen, as well as our loyal staffs.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senators who took the lead \nin the negotiations, especially the Senator from Tennessee who, again, \nhas had so much to do with this reform, and the Senator from \nCalifornia. They were extremely skilled at bringing us together. I \nthank Senator McCain, Senator Cochran, who was part of the effort, \nSenator Feinstein, Senators Dodd, Levin, Schumer, of course, Senators \nReid and Daschle, Senators Nickles and Hagel, who were all involved.\n  I join in the remarks of the Senator from Connecticut. This \nparticular\n\n[[Page S3029]]\n\namendment doesn't move in the direction that fits my philosophy. I \nbelieve we should stay where the levels are, as do many of my \nDemocratic colleagues. I very regretfully came to the conclusion that \nwe had to do it. I realized if we are going to get at the No. 1 problem \nin our system today, the loophole that has swallowed the whole system, \nas Senator Thompson has said, we had to make this move.\n  I am grateful that we were able to keep the individual limit increase \nto a reasonable level. Although I would prefer that it not be indexed, \nI will note, at least we won't have to hear anymore that it isn't \nindexed for inflation because it is. So the next time Senators have to \ndeal with this issue 20 years from now or 30 years from now, at least \nthat very troubling and persistent argument will not be there.\n  I thank all my colleagues and look forward to the vote on the \namendment.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee controls 8 minutes \n45 seconds. The Senator from Connecticut controls 11 minutes 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I don't know of any other requests to speak. \nI think people are familiar with this issue. Does my colleague from \nCalifornia wish to be heard?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I think I have said what I needed to say. Maybe we \ncan concede the rest of our time and have a vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I am prepared to yield back our time and go to a vote. We \nhave other amendments on this side. There are several over there. We \nhave to keep things going.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am prepared to yield back our time.\n  Mr. DODD. We yield back our time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I suggest that we proceed to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, No. 149 as modified.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 84, nays 16, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 55 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--84\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--16\n\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Conrad\n     Dorgan\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Sarbanes\n     Stabenow\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 149), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New York is recognized to \noffer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 135\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 135.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the need for \n Congress to consider and enact legislation during the 1st session of \n     the 107th Congress to study matters related to voting in and \nadministering Federal elections and to provide resources to States and \n        localities to improve their administration of elections)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 305.

The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the two sides have \n30 minutes each to debate the amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am here to urge my colleagues to \nsupport an amendment that is of great importance to the future of \nMcCain-Feingold and to the bill in general that we are debating, \nparticularly in light of the fact we have just raised hard money \nlimits. Let me explain to my colleagues what this is all about.\n  Mr. President, may we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, this amendment is vital to the \neffectiveness of McCain-Feingold, particularly in light of the increase \nin hard money limits which we have passed by a large margin in the \nThompson-Feinstein amendment. It is necessary because of an impending \nCourt decision. The Supreme Court has already heard the case and is \nabout to issue a decision related to the 441(a)(d) limits.\n  Let me first explain what the 441(a)(d) limits are, what the Court \ncase is, what it does, and why it is so important. As we all know, \nthere are 441(a)(d) limits, whereby a national party--in this case the \nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee or the National Republican \nSenatorial Committee--can contribute a certain amount of money directly \nto a candidate. There is complete coordination allowed between the \nparty and the candidate by the recent Supreme Court decision. That \namount of money is limited by the amount of voters in the State. It is \n2 cents a voter, so it runs from a high of over $2 million in \nCalifornia, $1.8 million in my State of New York, down to a low in the \nState of Wyoming and places such as that, probably no more than a \ncouple of hundred thousand dollars.\n  The case before the Supreme Court, which is called FEC v. Colorado \nRepublican Federal Campaign Committee, has been argued. There it has \nbeen argued that those limits should be lifted, that there should be no \nlimit as to the amount of money a national party organization can give \nto a candidate for the Senate or for the House.\n  What this would do, if the Court should rule favorably and uphold the \nlower court, is very simple. It would allow parties to go around and \nraise money in large, large amounts. After the Feinstein amendment that \nhas passed, that would be $25,000 a year or $150,000 per 6-year Senate \ncycle. And then with complete coordination, the party could give that \nmoney to any particular candidate.\n  The consequences are obvious. The $1,000 or $2,000 limit that we now \nhave would become much less important and large donors could \ncontribute, through the national parties, obscenely large amounts of \nmoney to candidates. In effect, the Court decision would, if the \n441(a)(d) limits were lifted, pull the rug out from under McCain-\nFeingold, all the more so because of the increase we have made in hard \nmoney limits.\n  You can call it hard, you can call it soft--it is large. The whole \npurpose of getting rid of soft money was not that it was soft, per se, \nbut rather it was so large that it was unlimited. Imagine, after \npassing McCain-Feingold and having it signed into law--which I hope \nwill happen--that the Supreme Court could make that ruling and then we \nbasically go right back to the old days, where large contributions \ngoverned. That, in my judgment, would be a serious error on our part. \nThat, in my judgment, would so undermine McCain-Feingold that we would \nhave to be back here next year changing the law again.\n  I have heard colleague after colleague say we will not come back for \n20 years. If the Court rules in favor of Colorado Republican Federal \nCampaign Committee, which most of those who have looked at the case \nbelieve they will, we will not be back here in 20 years; we may be back \nhere in 20 months.\n  The amendment I have offered tries to ameliorate these conditions. In \nall candor, it does not eliminate them, but it does make them better. \nIt does it very simply by saying, if a candidate should wish to go \nabove the 441(a)(d) limit, the 2 cents per voter in his or her State, \nthey cannot take advantage of the low-rate television time that is now \noffered in McCain-Feingold.\n  It is an incentive as many other incentives--to have candidates abide \nby limits. Again, could a candidate still violate those limits? Yes. \nThey would just pay a lot more for their television advertising, which \nof course is the No. 1 expenditure in just about every hotly contested \nrace.\n  Some have brought up the issue of constitutionality. Others have \nasked: Why are we legislating this at the time when we do not even know \nhow the Court will rule? In answer to the second question, this \namendment has no effect if the Court rules to keep the 441(a)(d) \nlimits. No one can go over them and the mandatory limit will be held as \nconstitutional. That is just fine. This amendment is designed to deal \nwith the advent, the likely advent that the Supreme Court does rule. If \nwe should fail to pass this amendment, which I know is subject to \nheated debate--the parties feel quite differently about this and I \nexpect the vote will be very close, but if we should fail to pass it, I \nwould say on the individual side, not on the corporate and labor side, \n80 percent, 90 percent of McCain-Feingold will be undone.\n  It will allow a couple to give, through the party, $300,000 to a \nSenate candidate. It is true, of course, that the party cannot solicit \nthem and say that we will, for sure, contractually almost, give the \nmoney to that candidate. But they can do virtually everything but. It \nwould also allow a party to go to someone and say: Give us $100,000 \nover the next few years and we will give $25,000 to our four toughest \nraces.\n  The whole idea of McCain-Feingold to stick to the $1,000 and the \n$2,000, or now the $2,000 and $4,000 limits, would be undone, again \nconstitutionality, which seems to be the major argument against this.\n  In the amendment is the severability clause, and in that severability \nclause we say, of course, if this is thrown out, it will not affect the \nrest of the McCain-Feingold bill. Some say that is not necessary. But \nwe put it in there just to deal with anyone who was not satisfied with \nthe general language in the bill.\n  Second, on constitutionality, the courts have ruled repeatedly that \nvoluntary limits may be placed on speech to further other goals.\n  The underlying case is Buckley v. Valeo which said that a government \nbenefit can be conditioned on a candidate's voluntary agreement to \nforego other sources of funding. The $1,000 limit on Buckley v. Valeo \nis very simple. It has been in existence and upheld and would apply in \nthis case.\n  Another case in 1979 where the Presidential limits were challenged is \nalso applicable. It is called RNC, the Republican National Committee, \nversus the FEC. I believe it is a 1979 case before the Supreme Court. \nThere again it was stated that in return for limits on campaign \ncontributions--in this case, the Presidential limits, which every \nPresidential candidate until George Bush of this year abided by--the \ngovernment could confer benefit, in this case money.\n  The only difference with what we are doing is instead of providing \nmoney to benefit, they are providing low television rates, which is in \na sense money.\n  It is perfectly clear, and it has been repeated by the courts, that a \nvoluntary limit on speech in exchange for another benefit that helps \nfurther that same goal is constitutional.\n  I know some have seen the Colorado case. If they bring it up, I will \nrebut it.\n  But I want to conclude before I yield my time by pleading with my \ncolleagues to support this amendment. I salute all those of us who have \nworked on McCain-Feingold. I salute both the Senator from Arizona and \nthe Senator\n\n[[Page S3031]]\n\nfrom Wisconsin for their leadership, the Senator from Kentucky, and the \nSenator from Connecticut for conducting this debate in a fair, \nadmirable, and open fashion, and all the others who have worked on this \nissue.\n  Everyone sort of had a vested interest in seeing that this amendment \npasses. I would like to see it pass. But it would be a shame if we pass \nthe amendment only to see it undone in large part 3 months from now. It \nwould increase the cynicism of the public. It would increase for \nthousands of us who believe in reform the view that nothing could be \ndone, and it would make it harder to continue reform. It would be close \nto a tragedy.\n  After all the work done by so many, if the 441(a)(d) limits were \nlifted and hard money could cascade into candidacies just the way soft \nmoney does now, we would be making a major mistake.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week Senator Schumer stated that \nthe Supreme Court's decision in FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal \nCampaign Committee could deluge the system with unlimited amounts of \nmoney raised in enormous amounts through the national parties for \nspecified campaigns.\n\n  This statement was false.\n  As Senator Schumer recognized, the Colorado case is about coordinated \nparty expenditures by the national committees on behalf of House and \nSenate candidates.\n  The FECA has a formula to calculate these limits based on the size of \nthe state which ranged from $135,000 in Montana to $3,200,000 in \nCalifornia in 2000.\n  Senator Schumer's attempt to portray these expenditures as soft \ndollar contributions is false. Coordinated party expenditure always \nhave been, and always will be 100 percent hard money.\n  The hard money limits to the national committees which were set in \n1974 are $20,000 per year for an individual and $15,000 per year from a \nPAC.\n  The coordinated party limits at issue in the Colorado case are the \nlast vestige of spending limits in FECA.\n  In 1976 the Supreme Court in Buckley struck down expenditure limits \non candidates and their committees and limits on independent \nexpenditures.\n  In 1996 the Supreme Court in Colorado I ruled that party committee's \ncan make independent expenditures, in addition to coordinated \nexpenditures. (See sec. 213 of S. 27) The Court remanded the question \nof the coordinated limits back to the district court which became the \nColorado case pending before the court today.\n  If the Supreme Court strikes down the coordinated party limits in the \nColorado case, the only impact is that national parties will be able to \nspend unlimited amounts on behalf of their candidates.\n  However, these expenditures must still be all hard dollars, raised \nunder the limits of FECA.\n  As for concern that striking these limits will lead to enormous \namounts of party money going into the system, I would point out that in \nthe 2000 cycle, Republican parties spent $28,000,000 on all coordinated \nexpenditures and Democratic parties spent $20,000,000. This is the \ntotal for all races--Presidential, Senatorial and Congressional--470 \nraces nation-wide.\n  Senator Schumer also presented a scenario where national parties are \na mere pass-through for candidates.\n  This is false for soft dollars.\n  For hard dollars it is called earmarking.\n  Current law permits donors to earmark contributions through national \nparty committees directly to be used on a specific candidate's behalf. \nHowever, it is subject to the $1,000 contribution limit.\n  For example, if a donor gives $1,000 to the RNC and directs it to a \nspecific candidate, the $1,000 is a contribution to the candidate.\n  However, if a donor gives $20,000 to the DSCC and directs it to be \nspent on behalf of a specific candidate, it is a $20,000 contribution \nto that candidate--a violation of the contribution limits under FECA.\n  This has been tried before and squarely rejected.\n  In 1995 the DSCC paid the largest civil fine ever by a national \ncommittee for engaging in this type of activity.\n  In that case the DSCC and democratic Senate candidates were raising \nlarge amounts of money into the DSCC to be ``tallied'' for use on that \ncandidate's behalf. These contributions were earmarks and exceeded the \ncontribution limits to candidates.\n  The DSCC was fined $75,000, forced to end that tally program and was \nand is required to include specific language on all solicitations \nclarifying that money raised into the DSCC is spent ``as the Committee \ndetermines within its sole discretion.''\n  To be clear, coordinated expenditures are made with all hard dollars \ngiven to the party committees and cannot be restricted for use on \nspecific candidates.\n  So there is simply no legal way to circumvent that law. The \nconstitutional problem with the Schumer amendment is that if the \nSupreme Court strikes down the coordinated limit as unconstitutional, \nthen the Schumer provision will require parties to continue to abide by \nan unconstitutional limit in order to get the lowest unit rate.\n  This is a classic unconstitutional condition and would make the whole \nbill further subject to problems in Court.\n  I hope the Schumer amendment will not be approved.\n  It is my understanding that there is a desire on both sides to have a \nquick vote. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes. If I may, Mr. President, let me respond to my \ncolleague from Kentucky by saying that this amendment has been debated \nand discussed. The Senator from New York has, I know, at on least three \ndifferent occasions explained this amendment and the value of it.\n  I think we have had a pretty good debate. I recommend to my friend \nand colleague from Kentucky that we have a vote on or in relationship \nto the Schumer amendment at 5:20.\n  I believe there is a meeting for some of our colleagues at the White \nHouse at around 5:30. My hope would be we might have this vote before \nthat meeting occurred. That would give those who would like to be heard \non this amendment some time to come to the floor and to express their \nviews on this.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my colleague from Connecticut, it would be \nhelpful if it were even a little bit earlier, at 5:10 or 5:15.\n  Mr. DODD. We can do that. I will try to accommodate you on that. The \nmessage has gone out. Why don't I take a few minutes myself. Certainly \nmy colleague from New York should have 5 minutes or so to respond to \nsome of the arguments made.\n  Let me say in relation to this amendment, the Senator from New York, \nas he has done characteristically throughout his public career--\ncertainly as long as I have known him as a Member of the other body and \nas a new Member of this body--has literally discovered, in a sense, \nwhat could be the new soft money loophole if we do not deal with this.\n  I say to my colleagues, for those who care about McCain-Feingold, \ncare about what we are trying to do on soft money, as almost every \nlegal expert in the country who is knowledgeable about campaign finance \nlaws has predicted will be the Supreme Court decision in the Colorado \ncase II. The section 441(a)(d) coordinated expenditure limits will be \nheld unconstitutional by a majority of the Supreme Court in the \nColorado II case. The practical results is that when spending limits on \nthe national parties are removed from the hard dollar cap, then the \nparties can contribute to Federal candidates, directly or indirectly, \nwith unlimited sums of money. If I have misspoken here, my colleague \nfrom New York will correct me. I believe this summarizes the sum and \nsubstance we believe is about to happen. If, of course, the Supreme \nCourt goes the other way and rule the section 441(a)(d) limits \nconstitutional, then this amendment has no effect. But if the \ncoordinated spending limits are overturned, as the Senator from New \nYork has predicted, and as others have suggested, we will not be \nobligated to return to this subject matter. Knowing how painful it is \nto spend as many days as we have already talking about campaign finance \nissues, it could well be another 25 years before we would come back to \nthis subject matter.\n\n[[Page S3032]]\n\n  In the meantime, we could have a Supreme Court decision that would \nblow open the doors for hard money, or the new soft money loophole, \nhaving spent all these days working to shut down the existing soft \nmoney loophole and limiting the hard dollar contributions in order to \nslow down the money chase.\n  Let me quickly add, again, I voted for the Thompson modified \namendment. I did so reluctantly. I disagree with the notion that we had \nto increase these hard dollar limits of individual contributors by as \nmuch as the Thompson modification allowed.\n  Now to reject the Schumer amendment, and by doing so allow unlimited \nhard dollar contributions would fly right in the face of everything a \nmajority of us have spent the last 10 days working to accomplish. We \nhave improved, in my view, the McCain-Feingold bill. It is a better \nbill in many ways than it was when it came to the floor a week and a \nhalf ago.\n  If we now reject this amendment, in light of what is clearly going to \nhappen in the court, we will undo much of what we have done, not only \nover this past week and a half, but what Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold have achieved, along with those of us who have sponsored or \ncosponsored their efforts over the past several years.\n  So I urge my colleagues to take a close look at this. Try to \nunderstand what the Senator from New York is saying here. He is saying \nif, in fact, the coordinated party expenditure limits are ruled \nunconstitutional, then we need to provide a voluntary mechanism for how \nsuch limitations may be dealt with. He does it in a way that tracks the \ntwo Supreme Court decisions in the Colorado Republican cases and on \nfirst amendment issues very successfully. Having read these decisions \ncarefully, he has now crafted a proposal that is directly in sync with \nthese decisions, including the projected decision in Colorado II, where \nnexus has to occur between the activities and there is no mandatory \nrequirement attached.\n  While I am not an expert in this area of the constitution, but based \non what I have read, if you meet the two criteria I suggested, then \nyour proposal can pass constitutional muster. I think it is our \ncollective judgment to move forward in this area.\n  Last week we passed an amendment that would prohibit millionaires \nfrom running against us incumbents. We allowed the hard dollar \ncontributions to immediately go up if someone out there challenges us. \nIf the challenger suggests he or she might spend half a million dollars \nof their own money against us, then the trigger threshold comes into \nplay. I voted against it because I thought it was a ludicrous \namendment. But, if you felt comfortable that amendment was adopted and \nyou are protected from the personal wealth of challengers, then don't \nstart breathing a sigh of relief now. The millionaire amendment is \nhere. I would pause before I would enjoy the sense of security. If this \namendment is rejected, then you could face million-dollar contributions \ngoing to your opponent if, in fact, the Supreme Court does what many \nthink it will do, and strike down the spending limits.\n  So, again, whether you are a proponent or opponent of McCain-\nFeingold, I think you ought to support this amendment. None of us \nhere--nor any challenger--should face the possibility of watching \nalmost unlimited contributions come through national or State parties \nto fund these races without any restrictions at all. Particularly after \na majority of us--a significant majority of us--believe there should be \nsome limitations, some slowing down of a process here the amount of \nmoney is getting out of hand.\n  With that, Mr. President, I see my colleague from Michigan who has \nbeen eloquent on this subject matter and understands it almost as well \nas the Senator from New York and certainly far more than the Senator \nfrom Connecticut. So I would be happy to yield to him 2 or 3 minutes to \ncorrect any mistakes I may have made in describing what this amendment \ndoes and how it works.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Connecticut. I \nwish I could come close to him in terms of knowledge of this subject, \nor my friend from New York.\n  I just want to very briefly say one thing. We have been guided so \nfar, a majority of us, by a principle; and that principle is, there \nshould be limits. That is what this debate is all about. We have limits \non individual contributions. We have now decided what those limits \nwould be. We have limits on PAC contributions, limits to PACs, limits \nto State and party committees, limits on national party committees, and \naggregate limits.\n  What this debate is about is restoring limits to campaign \ncontributions. Without McCain-Feingold, or a variant thereof, we have \nthe status quo: Unlimited contributions to campaigns. Despite the fact \nthat our law--our law--says there should be limits, there has been a \nloophole created which has destroyed that law--destroyed the limits--\nand we have seen the result.\n  There is one potential loophole left. That is the loophole which the \nSenator from New York and the Senator from Connecticut have identified. \nThat loophole is, assuming the Supreme Court finds as many think is \nlikely they will find, the amount of money which could be contributed \nto a candidate by a political party would be unlimited. Without this \nkind of an effort to set some kind of limit on those contributions, it \nseems to me we would be violating the very principle that has guided \nthe majority of us in this debate so far.\n  So I hope we will not give up on that principle. I hope we will be \nguided by that principle--the principle of the restoration of limits, \nthe preservation of limits, the protection of some limits--because the \nunlimited amounts of money which have come into these campaigns, it \nseems to me, have degraded the process, and degraded all of us in the \nprocess.\n  So I commend our good friend from New York for identifying this \nproblem. I hope this will be a bipartisan vote of support, to basically \ndo what the law already intends to do, to set limits on the \ncontributions of parties to candidates. That is in the current law. \nThere is a formula that we are simply trying to protect in the event \nthat the Supreme Court says that process does not pass constitutional \nmuster.\n  We knew 25 years ago--and we know now--that limits are important, \nthat unlimited, excessive contributions can create a problem in terms \nof public confidence. This is the one area left which is critical to \nthe principle in McCain-Feingold.\n  I hope that the amendment of the Senator from New York is adopted, \nand that it is adopted with a bipartisan vote, because it is so key to \nthis bill accomplishing what it set out to do: Restoration, \npreservation, protection, of some limits on contributions.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DODD. Does my colleague from Kentucky wish to be heard?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I tell my friend from Connecticut, I think we are \nready to vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I think the Senator from New York wants 2 minutes to wrap \nup before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nhis leadership and his cogent explanation. With my lack of \narticulateness, it has taken a few days for me to convince the Chamber \nthat this issue is important, and within 5 minutes the Senator from \nConnecticut and the Senator from Michigan have summed it up well.\n  We are here now because we realize how important this issue is. It \nwas said exactly right, in answer to the Senator from Kentucky; some \nthings that are unconstitutional when mandatory are perfectly \nconstitutional when voluntary. This is the case now.\n  I find it interesting that my friend from Kentucky is talking about \nthe unconstitutionality of this provision when yesterday he voted for \none and said: I knew it was unconstitutional, but it will help bring \nthe bill down. Maybe he wants to do the same on this amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will change my position, if he keeps talking.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I want him to change his position. I want to reiterate \nto my colleagues, this is a crucial amendment. If we don't pass it, we \nwill come back 6 months from now and say, why didn't we do it, because \nall the work on\n\n[[Page S3033]]\n\nMcCain-Feingold, much of the work on McCain-Feingold--not all of it but \ncertainly much of it--will be undone.\n  As my friend from Michigan said, limits are the theme of this bill. \nTo say that we want to limit soft money but put no limits on hard money \nmakes no sense. They are both greenbacks. Too much of one and too much \nof the other is not a good thing in our political financing system. \nThat is all our amendment seeks to undo. It is reasonable. It is \ncompletely within the theme of McCain-Feingold.\n  I fear that if it is not passed, we will have trouble passing the \nbill as a whole, and, worse than that, we will have undone a good \nportion of what we tried to do with McCain-Feingold.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the proponents of the amendment are prepared \nto yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield back such time as may remain on \nthis side.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Schumer \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Schumer amendment No. 153. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 56 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amemdment (No. 153) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 152\n\n  Mr. DODD. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the amendment of the \nSenator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine.\n  Mr. DODD. On our side, I know the opponents have a request for about \n20 minutes. I don't know if the Senator from Ohio is prepared to accept \na time agreement so we know when the next amendment might occur.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I am not prepared to enter into a time agreement. I will \ntell my colleague that I don't anticipate it will be very long. We have \na couple of speakers and we will be done. I don't want to enter into a \ntime agreement, but I think the projection we see of votes at 6:30, I \ncertainly think we will make that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, \non this side of the aisle, I am aware of about eight amendments, some \nof which I hope will disappear. I hope by announcing this I do not \nencourage the proliferation of more. Also, it is my understanding that \na discussion is underway to water down or mitigate the coordination \nlanguage in the underlying bill at the request of organized labor. I \nassume we will see that amendment at some point during the process. I \ndon't know whether Senator Dodd has any idea how many amendments may be \nleft on his side.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in response to my friends and colleague from \nKentucky, I have 21 amendments. Now, we all have been down this road in \nthe past. How many of those will actually be offered--I know around 12 \nat this juncture. I have asked the authors of these amendments how \nserious they are, and I would say around 12 or 13 feel very adamant. \nThey may not need much time. We don't necessarily need 3 hours as the \nbill requires or allows.\n  We are constantly working, trying to see if we can't get this number \ndown. We have a list. We are prepared to go with several amendments. I \nhave Senator Bingaman with amendments ready; Senator Durbin has \namendments ready; Senator Harkin has amendments ready. We are prepared \nto move along based on the schedule the leadership wants to endorse.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my understanding the desire of the leadership is \nto finish up the debate on the DeWine amendment tonight. I understand \nthe Senator from Ohio is not interested in a time agreement at this \npoint but to have the vote in the morning.\n  In the meantime, I say to my colleague from Connecticut and others, \nwith regard to any amendment that might be offered to reduce the \nopposition of the AFL-CIO to the bill by massaging the coordination \nlanguage, we would like to see that when it is ready. That is the \namendment I have been predicting for a week and a half, that there \nwould be at some point an effort to water down the coordination \nlanguage in the underlying McCain-Feingold bill in order to placate the \nAFL-CIO. We are anxious to see that language. I am sure it will pass, \nonce offered, but we are anxious to take a look and make sure all \nMembers of the Senate are aware of the substance of it.\n  It looks as though I may have fewer amendments to deal with than \nSenator Dodd. I suspect the sooner we shut up, the Senator from Ohio \ncan continue his discussion of his amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I am for that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I have used about 30 minutes of my time \nand I think at this point I yield the opponents some of their time.\n  For the information of Members of the Senate, we have one or two \nspeakers who will not speak very long, and we will be prepared to vote.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 6 or 7 minutes to my colleague from \nVermont in opposition to the DeWine amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to once again discuss the \nSnowe-Jeffords provisions in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. My \nfocus today will be rassuring you that the Snowe-Jeffords provisions \nare constitutional.\n  We took great care in crafting our language to avoid violating the \nimportant prrinciples in the first amendment of our Constitution. In \nreviewing the cases, limiting corporate and union spending and \nrequiring disclosure have been areas that the Supreme Court has been \nmost tolerant of regulation.\n  Since 1907, federal law has banned corporations from engaging in \nelectioneering. In 1947, that ban was extended to prohibit unions from \nelectioneering as well. The Supreme Court has upheld these restrictions \nin order to avoid the corrupting influences on federal elections \nresulting from the use of money by those who exercise control over a \nlarge amount of capital. By treating both corporations and unions \nsimilarly we extend current regulation cautiously and fairly.\n  We also worked to make our requirements sufficiently clear and narrow \nto overcome unconstitutional claims of vagueness and overbreadth. This \nrequired us to review the seminal cases in this area, including Buckley \nv. Valeo. I have heard some of my colleagues argue that Buckley clearly \nshows that the Snowe-Jeffords provisions are unconstitutional. I must \ndisagree most strongly with that reading.\n  In fact, the language of the case should--must be read to show that \nthe Snowe-Jeffords provisions are constitutional. In Buckley the court \nlimited spending that was ``for the purpose of influencing an \nelection.'' As I noted in my speech last Friday, 80 percent of the \nvoters, an overwhelming majority, see these sham issue ads as trying to\n\n[[Page S3034]]\n\ninfluence their vote and the outcome of the election.\n  Buckley also allowed disclosure of all spending, ``in connection with \nan election.'' As I discussed last Friday, 96 percent of the public \nsees these ads as connected with an election. In addition, the chart my \ncolleague Senator Snowe presented on the Senate floor last Monday \nclearly demonstrates that these ads are run in lock step with the \ncandidate's own ads. This makes sense this clearly proves that these \nsham issue ads are well connected with the election.\n  A final point concerning the Buckley decision. The Supreme Court was \nconcerned about both deterring corruption and the appearance of \ncorruption, plus ensuring that the voters were properly informed. The \nSnowe-Jeffords provision satisfies the Court's concerns. We deter the \nappearance of corruption by shining sunlight on the undisclosed \nexpenditures for sham issue advertisements. Corruption will be deterred \nwhen the public and the media are able to see clearly who is trying to \ninfluence the election. In addition our provisions will inform the \nvoting public of who is sponsoring and paying for an electioneering \ncommunication. Unlike what our opponents may say, the Supreme Court \nusing the standards articulated in the Buckley decision would uphold \nthe Snowe-Jeffords provision as constitutional.\n  Our opponents also point to the Supreme Court decision in \nMassachusetts Citizens For Life as demonstrating that the Snowe-\nJeffords provisions are unconstitutional. I would agree with my \nopponents that the MCFL decision seems to reaffirm the express advocacy \ntest articulated in Buckley, but I would argue in upholding this test \nthat the Court actually made it even more likely that the Snowe-\nJeffords provisions would be upheld as constitutional. The MCFL \ndecision broadens the standard articulated in Buckley by analyzing the \ncontext of a communication and divining its ``essential nature.'' As \nthe results from the BYU Center for the Study of Elections and \nDemocracy study I discussed earlier show, the esential nature of these \nsham issue-ads is to influence the outcome of an election. Presented \nwith all of the facts provided by myself and Senator Snowe, the Supreme \nCourt would be consistent only in finding our provisions constitutional \nunder the standards laid out in Buckley and MCFL. So rather than \nstrengthening their case, the MCFL decision shows that the Court is \nwilling to examine the issue closely and look beyond a strict \ninterpretation of the magic words test that some have said the Buckley \ndecision created.\n\n  A final court decision my opponents point to as supporting their \nposition that the Snowe-Jeffords provisions are unconstitutional is the \nrecent Vermont Right to Life decision in the second circuit. I must \nfirst point out that as a circuit court opinion it is not the law of \nthe land. That can only come from the decisions of the Supreme Court, \non which the provisions of the Snowe-Jeffords provisions are built.\n  Additionally, the facts that faced the second circuit in the Vermont \nRight to Life case are clearly distinguishable from the Snowe-Jeffords \nprovisions. Unlike the Vermont statute that was vague and overbroad, \nour provisions are narrowly tailored to avoid overbreadth, and create \nclear standards about what is allowed or required by our provisions, \nthus avoiding the vagueness in the Vermont statute. In addition, the \ncourt focused much of its discussion in declaring the Vermont statute \nunconstitutional on the effects of the provision on modes of \ncommunication not covered by Snowe-Jeffords. As the Snowe-Jeffords \nprovisions do not cover these types of communication, our language is \ndistinguishable from the facts faced by the second circuit. So, don't \nbe fooled when the opponents of our provision say that the Vermont \nRight to Life case clearly shows that the Snowe-Jeffords provisions are \nunconstitutional. They are comparing apples with oranges, and such a \nconclusion in inappropriate.\n  In conclusion, James Madison once said,\n\n       A popular government without popular information is but a \n     prologue to a tragedy or a farce or perhaps both. Knowledge \n     will forever govern ignorance and a people who mean to be \n     their own governors must arm themselves with the power which \n     knowledge gives.\n\n  The Snowe-Jeffords provisions will give the voters the knowledge they \nneed. I ask for my colleagues continued support in this vital effort to \nrestore faith in our campaign finance laws.\n  It is time to restore the public's confidence in our political \nsystem.\n  It is time to increase disclosure requirements and ban soft money.\n  It is time to pass the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. \nMr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my colleague from the State of Maine wishes \n10 minutes. I am happy to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nyielding me some time to address some of the issues that have been \nraised by the amendment and the motion to strike by our colleague from \nOhio, Senator DeWine.\n  I urge this body to oppose that motion to strike the provisions known \nas the Snowe-Jeffords provision. A vote to strike these provisions is \nessentially a vote against comprehensive reform. A vote against this \nprovision is a vote against balanced reform. A vote against this \nprovision is a statement that we are only willing to tackle part--\nalbeit a vital part--of the problem that is confronting the political \nsystem of today.\n  The other part of the problem that we seek to address through these \nprovisions is the glut of advertisements in elections--close to \nelection time, close to election day--that seek to influence the \noutcome of Federal elections. So there is no disclosure. We have no \ndisclosure. We do not know who is behind those advertisements. Yet they \nare very definitively influencing the outcome of Federal elections.\n  To illustrate the amount of advertising, you only have to look at \nwhat has happened since 1995-1999, when $135 million to $150 million \nwas spent on these types of commercials. Now in the election of 2000, \nover $500 million was spent.\n  Is everybody saying it does not matter? That we should not know who \nis behind these types of commercials that are run 60 days before the \nelection, 30 days before a primary, whose donors contribute more than \n$1,000? Are we saying it does not matter to the election process? Are \nwe saying we do not care?\n  I know the Senator from Ohio is saying these provisions are \nunconstitutional. I would like to make sure my colleagues understand \nthat this provision was not developed in a vacuum. It was developed \nwith more than 70 constitutional experts, along with Norm Ornstein, a \nreputable scholar associated with the American Enterprise Institute. \nThey looked at the constitutional and judicial implications of the \nBuckley v. Valeo decision back in 1976. They crafted this type of \napproach, which carefully and deliberately avoids the constitutional \nquestions that my colleague, the Senator from Ohio, suggests may be \nraised.\n  First of all, we designed a provision to address the concerns that \nwere raised in the 1976 Buckley decision about overbroad, vague types \nof restrictions on the first amendment. So what we said was that we \nhave a right to know who is running these ads 60 days before a general \nelection when the group has spent more than $10,000 in a year and whose \ndonors have contributed more than $1,000 to finance these election \nads--over $550 million of which were run in the election of 2000, more \nthan three times the amount that was spent in the election of 1996.\n  We also went on to say that unions and corporations would be banned \nfrom using their treasury money financing these ads when they mention a \ncandidate 60 days before a general election or 30 days before a \nprimary. Again, there is a basis in law extending back to 1907, when we \nhad the Tillman Act passed by Congress that banned the participation of \ncorporations in elections and, in 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act that \nprohibited unions from participating directly in Federal elections. \nThis amendment and provision is building upon those decisions that were \nmade by Congress that have been upheld by the Court. In fact, the most \nrecent decision of 1990, Austin v. Chamber of Commerce, is again \nupholding\n\n[[Page S3035]]\n\nthose decisions in the prohibition of the use of corporations \nparticipating in Federal elections.\n  That is what we have done. That is what we sought to do when \ndesigning this amendment.\n  Are we saying these ads do not make a difference? We have seen and \nexamined a number of studies over the last few years that talk about \nthe influence of these ads on elections. What have we determined? No. \n1, and I guess it is not going to come as a surprise to this audience \nwhich has participated in election after election and have seen these \nads, but more than 95 percent of the ads that are run in the last 2 \nmonths, the last 60 days of the election, mention a candidate; 94 \npercent of those ads are seen as attempting to influence the outcome of \nan election. They mention a candidate's name. Virtually all the ads \nthat are run in the last 60 days mention a candidate's name. Don't we \nhave the right to know who is running those ads, who is supporting \nthose ads, who is financing those ads? Yes. The Supreme Court has said \nit is permissible for Congress to have this requirement. It is in our \ninterest. We have the right. It is not just the right to free speech. \nIt is similar to other restrictions that have been incorporated in \nFederal election laws.\n\n  Ninety-five percent of the ads that are run for the final 2 months of \nan election mention a candidate. The worst thing when organizations run \nthese types of ads is that they mention a candidate by name 60 days \nbefore an election. We have the right to know who the $1,000 donors \nare.\n  We are also saying that unions and corporations would be banned from \nrunning those types of ads using their treasury money when they are \nmentioning a Federal candidate the last 60 days because of preexisting \nlaw that has stood for almost a century and has been upheld by the \nFederal court.\n  The next chart shows that, again, 94 percent have spots during the 2 \nmonths before the election making a case for a candidate.\n  Again, we are entitled to know who is behind those types of \nadvertisements. We have the right to know. The public has the right to \nknow because they are playing a key role.\n  We had a number of studies that examined the impact of these ads.\n  First of all, it wouldn't come as a surprise to this audience once \nagain that 84 percent of the ads that were aired in the last 2 months \nof a Federal election were attack ads. They were negative. And they \nmentioned a candidate's name.\n  Again, we are saying we have the right to know. The Supreme Court \nwill uphold our right to know and the public's right to know. This is \nsunlight; it is not censorship.\n  In this next chart, only 1 percent of the ads were true issue \nadvocacy ads.\n  In the final 2 months of an election, 99 percent identified a \ncandidate by name. They were attack ads. Only 1 percent would be \nconstrued as being legitimate issue advocacy ads.\n  For example, on an ad that would say, ``Call your Senator on an issue \nthat is before Congress,'' they would still have that right. If they \nidentified a candidate by name, however, they would be required to \ndisclose.\n  On this chart we see the relationship between TV ads and the \ncongressional agenda.\n  We are trying to make distinctions between true issue advocacy ads \nand election ads. That is what this Snowe-Jeffords provision does. It \nis carefully crafted to make sure we have a narrow provision \nidentifying the time period of 60 days and 30 days. We ban only union \nand corporation money. So the entities know which provisions affect \nthem in the election.\n  Then we also require disclosure of those donors who contribute more \nthan $1,000 to organizations that run ads that mention a candidate in \nthe 60-day window.\n  Again, groups or individuals will know exactly what is permissible \nand what is not and whether or not they would be running afoul of the \nlaw. That is what the Supreme Court said--that it not result in an \noverly broad or vague provision to ultimately have a chilling effect on \nthe constitutional right of freedom of speech. That is why this \nprovision was so narrowly and carefully drawn, with constitutional \nexperts examining each and every provision.\n  Look at the relationship between TV ads and congressional agenda. In \nthe last 60 days we do a lot here in Congress before an election. So \nyou are going to affect organizations' abilities to talk about those \nissues in their ads. Guess what. All the ads, virtually speaking, run \nby these organizations that mention or identify a candidate in that 60-\nday window parallel the ads that are run by the candidates themselves.\n\n  In the lower line at the bottom, which is the line that reflects the \nissues being debated in Congress, you can see that there is virtually \nno parallel between what we are discussing in Congress and the ads that \nare being run by organizations in that 60-day window. They parallel the \nads with a candidate's ad, which again reflects one thing--that these \nads are designed to influence the outcome of an election.\n  There was a study of just 735 media markets in this last election. \nGuess what. One hundred million dollars was spent in the last 2 weeks \nof the election on advertisements that identified a Federal candidate \nby name in that 60-day period--in fact, in that 2-week period.\n  I think the public deserves the right to know who is financing those \nads and who is attempting to affect the outcome of an election given \nthe amount of money that has been invested in these types of \ncommercials. As I said, it was three times the amount in the last \nelection compared to the 1996 election. They are ultimately engulfing \nthe political process. In some cases, these organizations, whether they \nexist in the State in which they are running these ads or not, are \nhaving a greater impact than the ads the candidates run themselves.\n  It may come as a surprise to you that in the focus group that \nexamined the Snowe-Jeffords provision and looked at the ads that were \nrun in that 60-day period--guess what--they didn't even see the \ncandidate's ads being the ones that influenced the outcome of a Federal \nelection. They saw these so-called sham ads as the ones that influenced \nthe outcome of a Federal election.\n  I think we need to take this step. It is a limited step; it is not a \nfar-reaching step.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes has expired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. May I have an additional 2 minutes?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, we have a consent \nrequest with regard to how to proceed for the rest of the night and \ntomorrow.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time on the DeWine \namendment be used during tonight's session and, following that time, \nthe Senate proceed to morning business. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate resume consideration of the bill at 9:30 a.m. and there \nbe 15 minutes for closing remarks on the amendment, to be equally \ndivided, and the Senate then proceed to a vote in relation to the \nDeWine amendment. I further ask unanimous consent that following that \nvote the Senate proceed to the Harkin amendment for 2 hours equally \ndivided in the usual form, and following that time the Senate proceed \nto vote on or in relation to the Harkin amendment.\n  Let me note that I didn't get a chance to clear this with Senator \nReid. But I understand Senator Warner has an amendment he wants to \noffer.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leader. I should \nlike to offer it, and I shall withdraw it. I will require no more than \n10 minutes of time at the most convenient point this evening before we \ncomplete our work on this bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. I modify the request to say, as I have already read it, \nexcept that after the DeWine amendment the time be used tonight and \nthen go to the Warner amendment at that point. Following that, we would \ngo to morning business.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I will not--I \nhope leadership will recognize the great work done today on this bill. \nI don't know how great it has been, but certainly it has been a lot of \nwork. Senators Dodd and McConnell have done an outstanding job moving \nthis matter along. It has been very tedious today. I would like for the \nleader and Senator Daschle to recognize what good work they have done.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I certainly agree with that. These two \nmanagers of\n\n[[Page S3036]]\n\nthis bill have worked together very closely--Senators McConnell and \nDodd. Their job has been particularly difficult this time because they \nare trying to accommodate everyone on all sides of this issue on both \nsides of the aisle and are trying to also accommodate the wishes of the \ntwo leaders on both sides as well as the principal sponsors of this \nbill. They have worked hard to make good progress. Without commenting \non the work product result, I think they certainly deserve a lot of \ncredit for their yeomen efforts to try to keep it calm and moving \nforward.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Warner will withdraw his amendment tonight?\n  Mr. LOTT. He will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. In light of this agreement, there will be no further votes \ntonight. The next vote will occur at approximately 9:45 a.m. Thursday. \nAlso, the managers intend to complete this bill by the close of \nbusiness tomorrow, so that is going to mean a lot more work. There are \na number of amendments that are still pending. But if Senators expect \nto complete our work tomorrow, we are going to have to put our nose to \nthe grindstone and just make it happen. So we should expect numerous \nvotes tomorrow. And we would hope to finish at a reasonable hour early \nin the evening or late in the afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I be yielded about 4 minutes to speak on the \namendment?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe Senator Snowe had gotten consent \nfor 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Maine ask for additional \ntime? The consent was not given because of the interruption of the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I do not believe there would be any objection.\n  Ms. SNOWE. The time is controlled by whom?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled by the Senator from \nOhio and the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Maine is given 3 minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I will yield to the Senator from Arizona. He needs 4 \nminutes. Can we have 10 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. Following the Senator from Maine, the Senator from Arizona \nis yielded 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could we have a total of 10 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. Again, I \nthank Senator McConnell for the level and tenor of this debate. I \nunderstand his concerns about one additional amendment we will have \ntomorrow concerning coordination, and I have given him the language. We \nwant to work with him on that particular amendment.\n  I also know a lot of time and attention is going to be devoted to the \nissue of severability. I thank the Senator from Maine for a very \nimportant presentation. I find myself between two of my dearest friends \non this amendment. I, obviously, am strongly in favor of the Snowe-\nJeffords amendment which the Senator from Maine and the Senator from \nVermont have worked on for literally years together. This Snowe-\nJeffords amendment, unlike some of the business we do around here, was \nnot hastily thrown together. It was crafted after careful consultation \nwith constitutional experts all over America. It clearly addresses a \ngrowing problem in American politics.\n\n  I believe that the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, if removed, would open \nup another huge channel for the use of soft money into so-called \nindependent campaigns.\n  I also listened with great attention to my friend from Ohio, Senator \nDeWine. I understand his concerns, and I appreciate them. He makes a \nvery strong case. But I would like to say why we think Snowe-Jeffords \nis constitutional and why we are convinced of it.\n  First, it avoids the vagueness problem outlined in Buckley by \ninstituting a bright-line test for what constitutes express advocacy \nversus issue advocacy. People will know if their ads are covered by \nthis statute. They will know whether it is covered by Snowe-Jeffords.\n  Second, the main constitutional problem with bright-line tests is \nthat they eliminate vagueness at a cost of overbreadth--a situation in \nwhich constitutionally protected speech such as issue advocacy is \nunintentionally swept in by the statute. Specifically, the Supreme \nCourt is concerned whether there is ``substantial overbreadth'' as far \nas the statute is concerned.\n  Snowe-Jeffords minimizes the overbreadth concern. It only covers \nbroadcast ads run immediately before an election that mention a \nspecific Federal candidate. Studies show that only a minuscule number \nof these types of ads in this time period are strictly issue ads. \nAnyone who observed the last couple campaigns would attest to that.\n  Besides, we all know that Buckley's ``magic words'' are not necessary \nto make a campaign ad. In fact, a Brennan Center for Justice analysis \nof the last congressional election showed that only 1 percent of \ncandidates' own campaign advertising used express advocacy language--in \nother words, magic words--to promote the candidate.\n  In sum, Buckley left the door open for Congress to define express \nadvocacy. That is what Snowe-Jeffords seeks to do, in keeping with the \nSupreme Court's concern about protecting free speech guaranteed by the \nfirst amendment. In addition, we can demonstrate that the Court's \ndefinition of ``express advocacy''--magic words--has no real bearing in \ntoday's world of campaign ads.\n  You never see an ad anymore that says ``vote for'' or ``vote \nagainst.'' You see plenty of them that say: Call that scoundrel, that \nno-good Representative of yours or Senator of yours, who is guilty of \nevery crime known to man. Call him. Tell your Senator that you want \nthus and such and thus and such.\n  We have seen it all develop to a fine art. I believe Snowe-Jeffords \nis a very vital part of this bill. If it were removed, it would have a \nvery significantly damaging effect on our desire to try to enact real \nand meaningful campaign finance reform.\n  I thank my friend from Ohio for his impassioned advocacy of the other \nside. I believe this is really what this debate has been all about: \nWhat we have just seen between Senator DeWine and Senator Snowe, an \nopen and honest and informed ventilation of a very important issue to \nthe American people. I am very proud of the performance of both because \nI think the American people have learned a lot from this debate, \nespecially on this very important amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain for his words \nregarding these provisions and for underscoring the importance and the \nsignificance and the meaning of the Snowe-Jeffords provision as \noutlined in the McCain-Feingold legislation.\n  The preponderance of these ads in the political process has to be \ndisturbing to each and every one of us, not to mention the American \npeople. That is what it is all about and what we need to address.\n  How can we say we are going to allow these so-called sham ads to go \nunchecked? How are we going to say to the American people that somehow \nthey or we do not have a right to know who is financing these ads?\n  As Senator McCain indicated, even candidates now, who already come \nunder the Federal election laws, do not use the magic words ``vote \nfor'' or ``against'' because what has become most effective is not \nusing those magic words to get the point across. That is why all of \nthese organizations have taken to running ads because they know what is \nmore effective and more influential.\n  In every focus group and study group that has been conducted over the \nlast few months, to take the Snowe-Jeffords provisions and use them in \na focus group, to see what the response was of the individuals included \nin that group--guess what--they were most influenced by those \norganizational ads that mention a candidate by name but do not use \nthose magic words. The Supreme Court said there isn't one single \npermissible route to getting where we are going in terms of \nrestrictions and\n\n[[Page S3037]]\n\nchanges in election laws. And the fact is, since 1976, Congress has not \npassed a law concerning campaign financing, has not sent any law to the \nCourt because we have not passed anything in the last quarter of a \ncentury. So it has no guidepost. But the Court was addressing in 1976 \nwhat was happening in 1976. We well know what has changed and \ntranspired in over a quarter century. We have seen the kind of \ndevelopment and evolution of these ads that has taken a very disturbing \ntrend and change in the election process.\n  I hope we defeat the motion to strike by my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Ohio, because truly we are getting at a very serious problem that \nhas characterized the political process in a way that does not engender \nconfidence in the American people.\n  These ads are intended to affect an election. They are overwhelmingly \nnegative. Ninety-nine percent mention a candidate in that 60-day \nwindow. Are we saying that we should allow them to go unchecked? I say \nno.\n  I know the Supreme Court will uphold this provision because in \nanalyzing every decision since and in analyzing what the Court had said \neven previously, this is not treading on the constitutional rights of \nthose who are willing to express themselves.\n  This is a monstrosity that has evolved in terms of the so-called sham \nads that are having a true impact on our election process in a way that \nI do not think the Supreme Court could foresee back in 1976, and we, as \ncandidates, could not possibly envision. I ran for Congress in 1978. No \none heard of these ads. Independent expenditures were even rare at that \nmoment in time. What has happened in the election process has taken \nplace in the last few years. Those expenditures have tripled in these \ntypes of advertisements that are having a true impact on elections.\n  That is what we are talking about. I have a chart that shows the \ndegree to which the ads were intended to influence your vote. The \ncandidates' ads are less influential than these ads to which we are \nreferring in the Snowe-Jeffords amendment. They have more influence in \nthe overall election than the candidates' ads.\n  We do have a right to know. We are talking about disclosure. The \nSupreme Court will uphold that view that, yes, the public does have a \nright to know. These provisions are not chilling first amendment \nrights. People will have very defined guidance under these provisions \nthat would inform any group, any individual who has an intention of \nrunning these types of advertisements.\n  Norman Ornstein, who was instrumental in developing this provision, \nalong with numerous constitutional experts, spoke in a column recently. \nI ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From Congress Inside Out]\n\n  Limits On So-Called ``Issue Advocacy`` Will Pass Constitutional Test\n\n                        (By Norman J. Ornstein)\n\n       Is McCain-Feingold unconstitutional? When campaign finance \n     reform is debated in the Senate this week, the answer to this \n     question will be a key one. There will no doubt be questions \n     raised about banning soft money, but despite the bleating of \n     reform opponents, that proposal seems to be on sound \n     constitutional footing. Soft money, after all, was neither a \n     natural development nor a court-generated phenomenon; rather \n     it was created in 1978 by a bureaucratic decision of the \n     Federal Election Commission. If a regulatory commission could \n     invent soft money, Congress can uninvent it.\n       More problematic is the campaign reform measure's provision \n     on so-called issue advocacy, an amendment known as Snowe-\n     Jeffords. Would it pass Supreme Court muster? No doubt some \n     Senators opposed to reform will offer elaborate smoke screens \n     to scare their colleagues. But there is legitimate concern \n     about the constitutionality of the proposal, even among many \n     sympathetic to it.\n       Changes in the rules surrounding anything close to issue \n     advocacy, as opposed to express advocacy to elect or defeat \n     candidates, are delicate and tricky. This area is at the \n     heart of the First Amendment and cannot be reformed lightly. \n     Still, when Senators take a careful look at Snowe-Jeffords \n     and the reasoning behind it, their concerns should be \n     assuaged. There is every reason to believe that this measure \n     will withstand constitutional scrutiny.\n       The challenge here starts with the language of the landmark \n     1976 Supreme Court decision Buckley v. Valeo that accepted \n     parts of a 1974 Congressional act reforming the campaign \n     finance system and rejected others, and continues to govern \n     our campaign finance rules. The court rejected as overly \n     broad the 1974 Congressional decision to include in its \n     regulatory net any communication ``for the purpose of \n     influencing'' a federal election. Instead, the court drew a \n     line between direct campaign activities, or ``express \n     advocacy,'' and other political speech. The former could be \n     regulated, at least in terms of limits on contributions; the \n     latter had greater First Amendment protection. How to define \n     express advocacy? The High Court in a footnote gave some \n     suggestions to fill the resulting vacuum and to define the \n     difference between the two kinds of advocacy. Express \n     advocacy, the justices said, would cover communications that \n     included words such as ``vote for,'' ``vote against,'' \n     ``elect'' or ``defeat.'' The residual category included \n     ``issue'' advocacy.\n       The court did not say that the only forms of express \n     advocacy are those using the specific words above. Those were \n     examples. However, political consultants and high-priced \n     campaign lawyers are like the raptors in ``Jurassic Park''--\n     they regularly brush up against the electric fence of \n     campaign regulation, trying to find dead spots or make the \n     fence fall down entirely. In this case, they egged on parties \n     and outside groups to behave unilaterally as if any \n     communication that did not use these specific so-called \n     ``magic words''--no matter what else they did say--was by \n     definition ``issue advocacy'' and thus was exempt from any \n     campaign finance rules. By this logic, ads or messages \n     without any issue content whatsoever that is clearly designed \n     (usually by ripping the bark off a candidate) to directly \n     influence the outcome of an election could use money raised \n     in any amount from any source, with no disclosure required.\n       Ads of this sort have exploded in the past few elections, \n     with outside groups and political parties exploiting a \n     loophole to run campaign spots outside the rules that apply \n     to candidates. In the past couple of election cycles, solid, \n     substantial and comprehensive academic research, examining \n     hundreds of thousands of election-related ads, has \n     demonstration two things. One was that only a minuscule \n     proportion of the ads run by candidates themselves--the sine \n     qua non of express advocacy--actually used any of the so-\n     called ``magic words'' that shaped the court's definition of \n     express advocacy a quarter century ago. Secondly, hundreds of \n     millions of dollars in political ads--nearly all viciously \n     negative, personality-driven attacks on candidates without \n     issue content--have blanketed the airwaves right before the \n     elections, dominating and drowning out candidate \n     communications. The parties and outside groups that have run \n     them have declared that they fall under ``issue advocacy,'' \n     meaning no disclosure and no limits on contributions are \n     required.\n       These sham issue ads have drastically altered the landscape \n     of campaigns, reducing candidates to bit players in their own \n     elections and erasing a major share of accountability for \n     voters. But under Buckley, as interpreted by the campaign \n     lawyers, this process has been unchallenged. Lower courts \n     have routinely upheld the framework and most of the specifics \n     of Buckley, leading reform opponents and many objective \n     observers to question whether any change in the Buckley \n     standards or framework could possibly pass constitutional \n     muster in the Supreme Court.\n       That view ignores a fundamental reality. Since it spoke in \n     1974, Congress has been essentially silent on campaign \n     finance reform. Buckley v. Valeo is in effect the law of the \n     land because Congress has not superseded it by filling the \n     vacuum in the quarter century that followed. If Congress \n     acted, the Supreme Court would give it due deference. In a \n     1986 decision on campaign finance and the role of \n     corporations (Federal Election Commission v. Massachusetts \n     Citizens for Life), Chief Justice William Rehnquist, in a \n     separate opinion joined by three other justices, noted, ``We \n     are obliged to leave the drawing of lines such as this to \n     Congress if those lines were within constitutional bounds.''\n       The lines Congress drew in 1974 were not within \n     constitutional bounds. But other lines, different from the \n     Congress in 1974 and the court's in Buckley, can be, \n     especially if Congress makes clear that its views are based \n     on both careful deliberation and strong emotional evidence.\n       Two years ago, I led a group of constitutional scholars in \n     careful and systematic deliberation over the judicial and \n     constitutional framework behind Buckley v. Valeo, the \n     dramatic changes in campaign behavior that have occurred in \n     the past several years, and the ways, within the Buckley \n     framework, that the system can be brought back into \n     equilibrium.\n       The result was a new approach, which was embraced by Sens. \n     Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) and Jim Jeffords (R-Vt.) and several \n     of their colleagues, and converted into legislation.\n       The Snowe-Jeffords provision defines ``electioneering'' as \n     a category of communication that is designed to directly \n     shape or change the outcome of federal elections. Unlike the \n     1974 overly broad Congressional definition, Snowe-Jeffords is \n     much more specific, with a definition that includes \n     substantial broadcast communications run close to an election \n     and that specifically targets a candidate for office in that \n     election. Research has shown that only a sliver of all issue \n     ads meeting this definition in the last campaign (well under \n     1 percent) were by any standard genuine issue ads. If \n     Senators are wary that even this definition is too broad,\n\n[[Page S3038]]\n\n     it is easily possible to refine the definition of targeting \n     to reduce the number to perhaps 1/10th of 1 percent of the \n     ads.\n       Snowe-Jeffords bans the use of union dues or corporate \n     funds for broadcast electioneering communications within 60 \n     days of an election and requires disclosure of large \n     contributions designated for such ads. As recently as 1990, \n     in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, the Supreme Court \n     reaffirmed the notion that corporations lack the same free-\n     speech rights as individuals and some other groups; other \n     decisions have made the same point about unions.\n       In Buckley itself, the court said that disclosure \n     requirements are permissible if they provide citizens with \n     the information they need to make informed election choices \n     or help safeguard against corruption and reduce the \n     appearance of corruption. As long as disclosure doesn't \n     produce the chilling effect of requiring an organization to \n     disclose all of its donors, which Snowe-Jeffords avoids, it \n     clearly meets court guidelines. Sen. Mitch McConnel (R-Ky.) \n     regularly refers to the court's 1958 decision NAACP v. \n     Alabama to argue that disclosure requirements are \n     unconstitutional. However, that is a misinterpretation of the \n     decision, which said that a requirement of an organization to \n     disclose all its contributors would be inappropriate. That is \n     not at all what Snowe-Jeffords does.\n       Now add together the clear deference to Congress' views \n     that Chief Justice Rehnquist has expressed, the clear \n     evidence from impeccable academic research showing the \n     fallacy behind the so-called ``magic words'' test in Buckley, \n     and the restrained and carefully drawn language in Snowe-\n     Jeffords defining a narrow category of ads and relying on \n     past court decisions about disclosure and the roles of unions \n     and corporations. These three factors make it reasonable to \n     believe that the Supreme Court would rule that a reform that \n     includes Snowe-Jeffords is within constitutional bounds.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. He said:\n\n       The court rejected as overly broad the 1974 Congressional \n     decision to include in its regulatory net any communication \n     ``for the purpose of influencing'' a federal election. \n     Instead, the court drew a line between direct campaign \n     activities, or ``express advocacy,'' and other political \n     speech. The former could be regulated, at least in terms of \n     limits on contributions; the latter had greater first \n     amendment protection. How to define express advocacy? The \n     High Court in a footnote gave some suggestions to fill the \n     resulting vacuum and to define the difference between the two \n     kinds of advocacy. Express advocacy, the justices said, would \n     cover communications that included words such as ``vote \n     for,'' ``vote against,'' ``elect'' or ``defeat.'' The \n     residual category included ``issue'' advocacy.\n       The court did not say that the only forms of express \n     advocacy are those using the specific words above. Those were \n     examples.\n\n  Now we hear the only way we can have these ads covered is if they use \nthose magic words. As Norman Ornstein is saying in his column, the \nCourt was citing examples back in the Buckley v. Valeo decision in \n1976. He went on to say, the fundamental reality is that Congress had \nbeen essentially silent on campaign finance reform since it spoke in \n1974.\n\n       Buckley v. Valeo is in effect law of the land because \n     Congress has not superseded it by filling the vacuum in the \n     quarter century that followed. If Congress acted, the Supreme \n     Court would give its due deference.\n       The lines Congress drew in 1974 were not within \n     constitutional bounds. But other lines, different from \n     Congress' in 1974 and the court's in Buckley, can be, \n     especially if Congress makes clear its views are based on \n     both careful deliberation and strong empirical evidence.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will vote against the \nmotion to strike that has been offered by our colleague from Ohio. It \nwould remove a fundamental provision in the legislation before us. We \ncannot have comprehensive reform without addressing this egregious \ndevelopment that has occurred in the election process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in a moment I will yield to the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. I do want to briefly respond \nto the comments of my friend from Maine, my friend from Vermont, and my \nfriend from Arizona. I appreciate very much their comments.\n  One thing they did not mention and that is important for us to \nremember, as we look at this amendment and as we look at how the bill \nis currently written, is that Snowe-Jeffords is now Snowe-Jeffords-\nWellstone. It is fundamentally different than the original provision \nabout which my colleagues have talked for the last 20 minutes or so.\n  Very simply, Snowe-Jeffords, as originally written, did this: Under \ncurrent law express advocacy is not restricted for unions and \ncorporations. What Snowe-Jeffords did is to say that 60 days out from \nan election, unions and corporations--it is usually unions who are \ndoing it--would be prohibited from mentioning the name of a candidate. \nIt is a major change in what is going on today, a major restriction on \na union's ability to communicate, a fundamental change in the law.\n  Under Snowe-Jeffords, express advocacy is expanded to include any \nmessage with the candidate's name 60 days before the election and, if \nthey do that, it is illegal.\n  That is not what we are talking about. Snowe-Jeffords is now Snowe-\nJeffords-Wellstone, and it has been dramatically changed and expanded. \nI think the original language, quite candidly, you can argue either way \nwhether it is constitutional. Frankly, no one in this Senate is going \nto know until the Supreme Court tells us. The Wellstone language that \nis now a part of Snowe-Jeffords is absolutely unconstitutional. I have \ntalked to a number of Members on the floor who voted on both sides of \nthe original Wellstone amendment. I haven't found one yet--I am sure \nsomeone will come to the floor in a minute; I am sure my colleague from \nMinnesota may come--who will tell me it is constitutional because what \ndoes it do? It takes the original Snowe-Jeffords and expands it and \nsays, not only will labor unions not be able to do this within 60 days \nof an election, not only will corporations not be able to do it, but \nnow everybody else can't do it. Any groups that want to get together \nand buy an ad that mentions the candidate's name will no longer be able \nto do that.\n  So within 60 days of an election, at the time when political debate \nshould be the most respected, when political debate has its greatest \nimpact, the Snowe-Jeffords-Wellstone amendment now says, no, you can't \ndo it.\n  That is absolutely unconstitutional. That is the state of the bill \ntoday. That is what Members have to ask themselves when they vote on \nthis amendment. Are you willing to accept a bill that in all \nprobability is going to pass that has a provision in it that is \nblatantly unconstitutional? I hope on reflection my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, when they look at that, will say: I don't want to \ndo that. I don't want to cast a vote for a bill that is blatantly \nunconstitutional.\n  The only chance Members are going to have to correct that is with the \nDeWine amendment.\n  I yield at this time to the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as my colleagues in this body are aware, \nunlike contributions to a candidate's campaign, expenditures of money \nto influence public opinion has been accorded nearly ironclad first \namendment protection by the U.S. Supreme Court. In fact, I know those \nwho would argue it is absolutely ironclad.\n  The reason for this protection is simple to understand. Freedom of \nspeech is one of the bedrock protections guaranteed for our citizens \nunder the Constitution of the United States. Nowhere is the role of \nfree speech more important than in the context of the elections we hold \nto determine the leaders of our representative democracy. As the \nSupreme Court stated in Buckley:\n\n       Discussion of public issues and debate on the \n     qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of \n     the system of government established by our Constitution. The \n     First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such \n     political expression in order to assure the unfettered \n     interchange of ideas. . . .\n\n  Obviously, we would have no democracy at all if government were \nallowed to silence people's voices during an election. I have spoken \nbefore more generally on some of the constitutional limits on our \nefforts to regulate campaigns. Today I rise to speak more specifically \nabout the limitations on expenditures.\n  Under our Constitution, a person simply cannot be barred from \nspeaking the words ``vote for Joe Smith.'' Under our Constitution, a \nperson simply cannot be barred by speaking the words ``lower my \ntaxes.'' Under our Constitution, a person cannot be simply barred from \nspeaking the words ``provide our seniors with a prescription drug \nbenefit.'' The right to speak any of these\n\n[[Page S3039]]\n\nphrases at any time is protected as a core fundamental right under the \nfirst amendment.\n\n  It is especially important to our democracy that we protect a \nperson's right to speak these phrases during an electoral campaign \nbecause it is through elections that the fundamental issues of our \ndemocracy are most thoroughly defined. It is through elections that the \nleaders of our democracy are put in place to carry out the people's \nwill.\n  Not only does a person have a right to speak out during a campaign \nregarding candidates and issues, a person also has a right to speak out \nin an effective manner. The right to speak would have little meaning if \nthe government could place crippling controls on the means by which a \nperson was permitted to communicate his or her message. For instance, \nthe right to speak would have little meaning if a person was required \nto speak in an empty room with no one listening.\n  Accordingly, the Supreme Court has consistently ruled that Congress \nmay not burden a person's constitutional right to express his or her \nopinion during an electoral campaign. And to effectuate these rulings, \nthe Court has consistently held that Congress may not burden a person's \nright to expend money to ensure that his or her opinion reaches the \nbroadest possible audience.\n  In Buckley, the Supreme Court made a fundamental distinction that has \nsurvived to this day, a distinction that must inform our discussion of \ncampaign finance, and a distinction that continues to place significant \nlimitations on what reforms are permissible under the strictures of the \nfirst amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n  With respect to expenditures, the Court has said this:\n\n       A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can \n     spend on political communication during a campaign \n     necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting \n     the number of issues discussed, the depth of their \n     exploration, and the size of the audience reached.  . . . The \n     expenditure limitations contained in the Act represents \n     substantial rather than merely theoretical restraints on the \n     quantity and diversity of political speech. The . . . ceiling \n     on spending . . . would appear to exclude all citizens and \n     groups . . . from any significant use of the most effective \n     modes of communication.\n\n  As recently as last year, in the case of Nixon v. Shrink Missouri \nGovernment PAC--and that is a 2000 case--the Court reaffirmed its \nholding in Buckley, quoting extensively from the Buckley opinion and \nreiterating that expenditure restrictions must be viewed as ``direct \nrestraints on speech,'' irreconcilable with the first amendment.\n  As I said before, the McCain-Feingold legislation is well intentioned \nin its effort to remove the influence of big money from our electoral \nprocess. However, several provisions of the proposed legislation are \nsimply irreconcilable with the first amendment of the U.S. \nConstitution. It is not Congress' role to pass unconstitutional \nlegislation and stand by while that legislation is struck down by the \ncourts.\n  The provision of the McCain-Feingold legislation that \nunconstitutionally burdens free speech is section 201, the so-called \nSnowe-Jeffords amendment. That is what the current DeWine amendment \nseeks to address. Snowe-Jeffords is designed to address what many have \ncharacterized as a loophole in the campaign finance laws that allows \nthird parties prior to an election to fund advertisements which relate \nexclusively to an issue and refrain from the expressly urging to vote \nfor or against a particular candidate. Recent experience has shown that \nsuch speech may effectively advance the prospects of one candidate over \nanother, even though it refrains from express advocacy of the \ncandidate.\n\n  I applaud my colleagues for their ingenuity in seeking to address \nthis avenue by which money, unregulated by our electoral laws, may play \na role in our elections.\n  You can call a dog a hog and it still remains a dog. I think trying \nto say their amendment and this particular clause in this bill is not \nviolative of the first amendment free speech rights fits the \ndescription of trying to call a dog a hog. Still, it remains a dog.\n  The problem I have with this portion of the legislation is that issue \nadvocacy prior to an election simply cannot be viewed as a loophole in \nthe election laws that we must endeavor to close with appropriate \nlegislation. Viewed through the lens of the first amendment, this issue \nadvocacy is exactly the type of speech that must be accorded the \nultimate protection of the first amendment. The Supreme Court has \nconsistently refused to sanction disclosure requirements on issue \nadvocacy, unless the communication in question directly advocates for \nor against a particular candidate.\n  Look, issue advocacy generally is used against us Republicans. There \nis not much doubt about that. That is where the money is. It is used \nagainst both from time to time, but really against us. I remember back \nin 1982 there was tremendous issue advocacy against me by the trade \nunion movement. It was very difficult to put up with some of the ads \nused against us, both in print and otherwise. But it was a free speech \nright, and I would fight to my death to defend those rights of free \nspeech.\n  The Snowe-Jeffords amendment seeks to redraw the line between \nprotected issue advocacy and nonprotected express advocacy of a \ncandidate in order to regulate a larger chunk of public speech prior to \nan election. Section 201 of the proposed legislation broadens the \nFederal Election Commission Act's regulatory scope to include any \nindividual or group that expends at least $10,000 a year on \nelectioneering communications. Now that is free speech.\n  Let's go further. Electioneering communications are defined as any \ncommunications in the electorate within 60 days before a general \nelection that ``refers to a clearly identified candidate''--regardless \nof whether such communication urges a vote for or against that \ncandidate.\n  The problem with this line-drawing exercise is that the Supreme Court \nhas already done it. In Buckley v. Valeo the Supreme Court defines what \ntypes of issue advocacy could, consistent with the Constitution, be \nmade subject to FECA's regulatory requirements. The Court found that \nonly communications that expressly advocated for or against a specific \ncandidate were subject to regulation. The Snowe-Jeffords amendment \ninvades the constitutionally protected territory of pure issue \nadvocacy. In fact, that invasion is the sole purpose of the provision.\n  It may well be true that third parties are, in fact, able to \ninfluence the electorate for or against the candidate by running \nindependent issue advertisements, uncoordinated with a candidate's \ncampaign, in the weeks leading up to the election. That phenomenon does \nnot manifest a flaw in the regulatory scheme established by our current \ncampaign finance laws. For better or for worse, that phenomenon \nmanifests the free interchange of ideas in an open society. Such issue \nadvocacy is free speech, protected by the first amendment, and \naccordingly, the McCain-Feingold legislation is unconstitutional.\n  In Snowe-Jeffords, those provisions are fatally overinclusive. They \ntry to sweep away our first amendment political speech. The Supreme \nCourt has been more than clear on this. What the authors are attempting \nto do is understandable, it is well intentioned, but unfortunately it \nis unconstitutional. That is one reason I have to stand here today and \nspeak out for the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Ohio.\n\n  I believe he is right in his motion to strike. I believe he is right. \nI believe we ought to support him, and I hope our colleagues will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of the opponents of this \nlegislation, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina, 20 \nminutes to the Senator from Maine, and 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota. We have 50 minutes left. Whatever time is left we will yield \nback.\n  I recognize my friend from Ohio is controlling the time on the other \nside. After Senator Edwards, I understand it will be his time to \nallocate. That is the only time we have requested tonight. That is how \nwe will allocate our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we talked at great length in this debate about the \nneed to\n\n[[Page S3040]]\n\nreturn this democracy to the voters and to remove the influence of big \nmoney or the appearance of influence of big money.\n  Tonight I want to talk about two things: First, the two critical \nprovisions of the McCain-Feingold bill; and, second, I want to speak in \nopposition to the DeWine amendment.\n  As most people who follow this debate know, the two most critical \nprovisions of this bill are the ban on soft money and the Snowe-\nJeffords provision. I first want to speak to the constitutionality of \nthe ban on soft money.\n  There has been some suggestion during the course of this debate that \nthere is a serious question about constitutionality. In fact, there is \nno serious question about that. The U.S. Supreme Court in the Buckley \ncase said that in order for the Congress to regulate these sorts of \ncontributions, the only constitutional test that must be met is a \nfinding of a compelling State interest.\n  In the Buckley case, the U.S. Supreme Court went on to find, in fact, \nthat preventing the actuality or appearance of corruption constitutes a \ncompelling State interest. The language of the Court is:\n\n       Congress was justified in concluding that the interest in \n     safeguarding against the appearance of impropriety requires \n     the opportunity of abuse inherent in the process of raising \n     large monetary contributions be eliminated.\n\n  What the U.S. Supreme Court held in Buckley was in order to regulate \nthese soft money contributions, there must first be a compelling State \ninterest. They then went on to find that, in fact, there was a \ncompelling State interest created by the appearance of impropriety \nassociated with raising these large monetary contributions.\n  The Buckley case has already decided the question of whether a ban on \nsoft money contributions is, in fact, constitutional. The U.S. Supreme \nCourt has held that, in fact, that ban is constitutional and there is \nno serious or legitimate question about the constitutionality of the \nsoft money ban.\n  Now I want to move to the Snowe-Jeffords provision. There has been \nsome suggestion, including by my friend from Ohio in offering his \namendment, that there are very serious questions raised by the Snowe-\nJeffords provision of the McCain-Feingold bill. I will first summarize \nwhat Snowe-Jeffords does.\n  Snowe-Jeffords bans for the 60-day period prior to a general election \nor a 30-day period prior to a primary election broadcast television ads \nby unions or corporations paid for out of general treasury funds. It \nalso contains certain disclosure provisions for other entities who may \nwant to run such ads.\n  The suggestion is made that under the criteria established by the \nU.S. Supreme Court in Buckley, Snowe-Jeffords does not meet \nconstitutional muster. In fact, it is very clear if you look at the \nlanguage of the U.S. Supreme Court in Buckley and if you look at the \ncases that come after Buckley, Snowe-Jeffords does exactly what the \nU.S. Supreme Court in Buckley required in order to meet the test of \nconstitutionality. First I will talk about that test.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has established four requirements in order for \nthe Snowe-Jeffords provision to be found to be constitutional.\n  The first of those requirements is that it cannot be vague. The \nsecond is that it must serve a compelling State interest. The third, it \nmust be narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The fourth, it cannot \nbe substantially overbroad.\n  The Court, in reaching that conclusion, first recognized that the \nfirst amendment in the case of electioneering--which is what we are \ntalking about, campaign ads--is not absolute. There are certain \ncircumstances where first amendment rights can be restricted, but only \nif these tests are met.\n  The first question, ``cannot be vague.'' The Snowe-Jeffords provision \nis by any measure, a clear, easy-to-identify, bright-line test. It \nrequires that the ad be within the 60 days before the general election \nor within 30 days of the primary election; second, that it contain the \nlikeness of a candidate or the name of the candidate; and third, that \nit be a broadcast television ad.\n  No one reading that definition could have any misunderstanding. It is \nspecific. It is clear. It is a bright-line test. By any measure, it is \nnot vague. It would meet the first test established by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Buckley.\n  Second, it ``must serve a compelling State interest.'' Just as in the \ncase of the soft money ban, the U.S. Supreme Court has already held \nthat avoiding the appearance of impropriety is, in fact, a compelling \nState interest. The Court has already held that the reason for the \nSnowe-Jeffords provision is a compelling State interest. So that test \nis easily and clearly met by the language of the Court in Buckley v. \nValeo.\n  The third, it ``must be narrowly tailored to serve that interest.'' \nFirst of all, why did Senators Snowe and Jeffords offer this provision \nas part of McCain-Feingold? They offered it because in order to avoid \nlegitimate campaign election laws in this country, what has been \noccurring is people have been broadcasting what has been described as \nissue ads as opposed to campaign ads. Now there is a ban, of course, on \nthe broadcasting of campaign ads with General Treasury funds, so \ninstead they call these ads issue ads, not campaign ads, in an effort \nto avoid that legitimate legal restriction.\n  In fact, what we know both empirically and from our own experience, \nmany of these so-called issue ads--not many, the vast majority--of \nthese so-called issue ads are campaign ads, particularly when they fall \nwithin that 60-day period.\n  Let me stop on this test for just a moment and give a couple of \npieces of evidence. First, the empirical studies show in the year 2000 \nelection, 1 percent of the ads that fall within the test of Snowe-\nJeffords--that is, within 60 days of the general election, mention the \nname or show the likeness of the candidate, broadcast television ads--1 \npercent constituted legitimate issue ads; 99 percent constituted \ncampaign ads. We know what our gut would tell us, anyway. We know from \nour own experience from watching these television ads, and voters would \nknow from their own experience, that when they see these ads on \ntelevision, in fact, they are campaign ads. They are not issue ads. \nThey are advocating for the election or defeat of a particular \ncandidate, not for some particular issue.\n  We now know empirically in the case of the 2000 election, 99 percent \nof those ads covered by Snowe-Jeffords are campaign ads and not issue \nads. They are sham issue ads. They are a fraud under the campaign \nelection laws that exist in this country.\n  Snowe-Jeffords is trying to eliminate that fraud, eliminate that \nsham. What we now know, the ads covered by Snowe-Jeffords, 99 percent \nof those ads are not issue ads but are campaign ads.\n\n  I have one or two examples. This is an ad run in a congressional \nelection in 1998:\n\n       Announcer: The Daily reports criminals are being set free \n     in our neighborhoods.\n       In May, Congressman X voted to allow judges to let violent \n     criminals out of jail, rapists, drug dealers, and even \n     murderers.\n       X's record on drugs is even worse. X voted to reduce \n     penalties for crack cocaine. And in April, X voted to use \n     your tax dollars to give free needles to illegal drug users.\n       Call X. Tell him he's wrong. Dangerous criminals belong in \n     jail.\n\n  This doesn't use the language used as illustrative by the U.S. \nSupreme Court in Buckley. It doesn't say ``vote for;'' it doesn't say \n``elect;'' it says ``call.'' But any rational person, including all the \npeople who watched this ad on television, know that this ad is aimed at \ndefeating Congressman X in the campaign. That is exactly what it is \nabout.\n  That is what was demonstrated in my chart, 99 percent of the ads that \nfall within the test of Snowe-Jeffords are ads just like this. They are \npure campaign ads, plain and simple. These ads are being paid for by \ncontributions that otherwise would violate the legitimate election laws \nof this country.\n  What we are trying to do in Snowe-Jeffords, we have a very narrowly \ntailored provision that catches ads that are clearly campaign ads. We \nnow know that 99 percent of those ads that fall within Snowe-Jeffords \nare campaign ads, plain and simple; not issue ads.\n  So what conclusion do we draw from this? If 99 percent of the ads are \ncampaign ads, if, in fact, 99 percent of the ads are like the one I \nhave just shown as illustrative, they ``must be narrowly tailored'' to \npass constitutional muster.\n\n[[Page S3041]]\n\n  It is not vague, a clear, bright-line test, we have compelling State \ninterest, and now we know this provision is narrowly tailored, and that \ngoes hand in glove, by the way, with the fourth provision, which means \nit ``cannot be substantially overbroad.''\n  The Court recognized that any time you have a bright-line test that \nis not vague, you are, by definition, going to catch some stray \nadvertisements that are not intended to be included. They don't just \nrequire that there be no overbreadth. There has to be substantial \noverbreadth in order to be unconstitutional.\n  What we now know empirically, 99 percent of the ads that meet Snowe-\nJeffords are exactly what are intended to be targeted by Snowe-\nJeffords. The empirical evidence clearly supports the notion that \nSnowe-Jeffords is not substantially overbroad, on top of the fact that \nthe provisions of the bill itself are not substantially overbroad. They \nare narrowly tailored. They do exactly what the U.S. Supreme Court has \nrequired.\n  I suggest that, in fact, Senators Snowe and Jeffords have done a \nterrific job of meeting the constitutional test because they have made \nthe provision for bright line, they have made it clear it is not vague, \nand at the same time it is sufficiently narrow to meet the \nconstitutional requirements of Buckley v. Valeo.\n  What we now know and can see by looking at the constitutional \nrequirements is that Snowe-Jeffords meets all those requirements. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has established these requirements, has defined what \nthey mean, and Snowe-Jeffords, we know, meets those requirements. The \nempirical evidence shows it is not overly broad, it is not \nsubstantially overbroad, that it reaches very few ads that are, in \nfact, issue ads.\n  One argument made is that Buckley v. Valeo uses a test in order for \nan ad to be a campaign ad, as opposed to an issue ad: ``Vote for,'' \n``elect,'' ``support,'' ``cast your ballot for.'' The people who are \nmaking that argument are not reading the U.S. Supreme Court opinion. \nBecause what the Court said was, in order to make the existing election \nlaws--as of the time of this opinion--constitutional, we are going to \nestablish a test since Congress did not do it. They go on and invite us \nto do it, to establish the test. Instead of saying ``this is language \nthat is required,'' they say:\n\n       This construction would restrict the application of section \n     608 . . . to communications containing express words of \n     advocacy of election or defeat, such as `vote for,' `elect'. \n     . . .\n\n  It is obvious from the ``such as'' language that the Court by no \nmeans intended this list to be exhaustive. The Court fully recognized \nthat given the imagination of campaign managers and people who prepare \nthese ads, that they could not even begin to do an exhaustive list. \nThis list is nothing but illustrative, never intended to be anything \nbut illustrative.\n  For those who come to the floor and say, wait a minute, Snowe-\nJeffords doesn't use the magic language, doesn't use ``vote for,'' \ndoesn't use ``elect''--what the U.S. Supreme Court made clear in their \ncase was these are nothing but illustrations of what changes an ad from \nan issue ad to a campaign ad.\n  Sure, if they say ``vote for'' and ``elect'' they become a campaign \nad, but as we have shown from the illustration a few moments ago, it is \njust as simple to have a pure campaign ad that never says ``vote for,'' \nthat never says ``elect,'' that simply says: Call Congressman so-and-\nso, call Senator so-and-so. But any rational person looking at the ad \nwould know it was calling for the election or defeat of a particular \ncandidate and it was nothing, on its face, but a pure campaign ad.\n  The point is, it is not a legitimate argument that because Snowe-\nJeffords does not use these magic words--the language I have heard \nduring the course of the debate--it cannot pass constitutional muster.\n  The Supreme Court established four tests in Buckley v. Valeo. The \nSupreme Court, in fact, invited us, the Congress, to decide what \nlanguage ought to be used to determine whether ads, in fact, are \nprohibited or not prohibited. They have left it to us to define what \nads are prohibited.\n  The only thing they require in order to do that is that we meet the \nfour tests they established, which we talked about before. Snowe-\nJeffords clearly meets all those tests. It is not vague. It is a clear, \neasy to understand bright-line test. The U.S. Supreme Court already \nsaid what we are attempting to do serves a compelling State interest, \nit is narrowly tailored--60 days before a general election, 30 days \nbefore a primary, likeness or name of the candidate, broadcast ads. And \nit is not substantially overbroad. As we have already established in \nthe last election, 99 percent of the ads that fall within the \ndefinition of Snowe-Jeffords are, in fact, campaign ads and not issue \nads.\n  If you look carefully at the U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Buckley, \nand if you look at the tests that have been established by the U.S. \nSupreme Court, first of all, the soft money ban of McCain-Feingold is, \non its face, constitutional. There is not even a legitimate argument \nthat it is not constitutional.\n  Second, the Snowe-Jeffords provision of the McCain-Feingold bill, \nwhich bans broadcast ads during this defined period, paid for out of \nunion or corporation treasury funds, also clearly meets all the \nconstitutional tests established by the Court in Buckley v. Valeo. It \nis a critical component of the McCain-Feingold bill because without it \nwe are going to continue to see these sham issue ads run solely for \ncampaign purposes being paid for by funds that are not legitimate and \nare not legal.\n\n  The only way we can bring this thing to conclusion is to not only do \nwhat we have already done during this debate, which is pass the ban on \nsoft money; but to, second, pass the Snowe-Jeffords provision. Because, \nnumber one, it is constitutional and, number two, it is absolutely \ncritical to going about reestablishing the public faith in our \ncampaigns and the public faith in our election system. Because not only \nare people worried about the flow of money, they are worried about what \nhappens when they turn their television sets on in the 30 or 60 days \nbefore an election. They are sitting there watching television with \ntheir kids and what do they see? They see these nasty, personal \nattacks, in a huge percentage of the cases being paid for as issue ads, \nout of funds that are not intended to be used for that purpose.\n  That is what Snowe-Jeffords is intended to stop. Snowe-Jeffords is \nclearly constitutional. We should defeat the DeWine amendment as a \nresult.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank my colleague \nfrom North Carolina for his excellent dissertation. I just loved it \nwhen he was going through these ads. I want to make it real clear that \nfor all of these different groups and organizations--I don't want to \nkeep my colleague from North Carolina--on the floor, but I know he will \nagree with this very important distinction--that all of these groups \nand organizations, whether they are left, right, center, lean \nDemocratic, lean Republican, you name it, they can run all the ads in \nthe world they want and they can finance those ads with soft money; in \nother words, money they get in contributions of hundreds of thousands \nof dollars, and it is absolutely fine as long as the focus is on the \nissue. As long as those are genuine issue ads and it is not \nelectioneering, they have all of the freedom in the world to do that--\nperiod. No question about it.\n  Second, if they want to do the electioneering and they want to do \nthese sorts of ads where you say ``call' as opposed to ``vote against \ncandidate x,'' you bash the candidate, whatever party--they can run all \nthe ads they want and they can have all of the freedom of speech in the \nworld. The only thing is, they have to finance it out of hard money. \nThat is all. They cannot pretend that these are ``issue ads'' when they \nare sham issue ads and we all know it is electioneering. That is the \npoint. But they can do it. They just have to raise their money under \nthe campaign limits that deal with hard money. That is the whole point \nof some of the amendments to this bill.\n  From my own part, one more time--and the more I talk to people, I \nthink the people agree this is a very important strengthening \namendment--what we want to make sure of is when we do the prohibition \non soft money to the\n\n[[Page S3042]]\n\nparties, all of a sudden that money, again, like pushing Jell-O, \ndoesn't just shift to these sham issue ads where a variety of existing \ngroups and organizations, much less the proliferation of all the new \ngroups and organizations, will take advantage of a loophole and just \npour all of their soft money into these sham issue ads which are really \nelectioneering. In that case, what will we have accomplished if we \nhave, roughly speaking, just as much soft money spent but it is just \ngoing to be spent in a different way, unaccountable big dollars?\n\n  That is what the amendment I introduced the other night was all \nabout.\n  I only came to the floor because I want to make sure the Record is \nclear. My colleague from Maine was gracious enough to give me a little \nbit of time. Let me make three quick points.\n  Point No. 1. The amendment I introduced the other night--since this \namendment has been mentioned several times by my colleague--uses the \nexact same sham issue test ad, with some additional targeting, as the \nSnowe-Jeffords language in the bill which is constitutional. In fact, \nactually the targeting language I use makes the amendment more likely \nto survive any constitutional challenge.\n  Point No. 2, the Snowe-Jeffords test is a bright-line test, as my \ncolleague from North Carolina pointed out. It is perfectly obvious on \nits face, whether an ad falls under this definition. This means there \nwill be no ``chilling effect'' on protected speech, which was a concern \nraised by the Supreme Court in the Buckley decision because every \ngroup, every organization would be uncertain if an ad they intended to \nrun would be covered or not. We make sure everybody would be certain.\n  Point No. 3, the test is not overly broad. A comprehensive study \nconducted by the Brennan Center, which did a whole lot of work on \ncampaign finance ads during the 1998 election, found that only two \ngenuine issue ads, out of hundreds run, would have been inappropriately \ndefined as a sham issue ad.\n  This is a really important one for the Record.\n  On February 20, 1998, a letter signed by 20 constitutional scholars, \nincluding the former director of the ACLU, which analyzed the Snowe-\nJeffords provision on electioneering communications, argued that even \nthough the provision was written to exempt certain organizations from \nthe ban on electioneering communication, such omission was not \nconstitutionally necessary.\n  I quote from these scholars, including a former director of the ACLU:\n\n       The careful crafting of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment stands \n     in stark contrast to the clumsy and sweeping prohibition that \n     Congress originally drafted. Congress could, if it wished, \n     apply the basic rules that currently govern electioneering to \n     all spending that falls within this more realistic definition \n     of electioneering. Congress could, for example, declare that \n     only individuals, PAC's and the most grassroots of nonprofit \n     corporations could engage in electioneering that falls within \n     the broad definition. It could impose fundraising \n     restrictions prohibiting individuals from pooling large \n     contributions towards such electioneering.\n\n  Fifth point: If you believe that the amendment that passed the other \nnight that I introduced covers certain groups unconstitutionally--if \nthat is what you believe--then you must also believe that the current \nShays-Meehan bill--the version passed by the House of Representatives--\nand the 1997 version, and all previous versions of the McCain-Feingold \nbill are also unconstitutional because they cover the same groups.\n  Point No. 6: In September 1999, Don Simon, then-executive vice \npresident and general counsel of Common Cause, argued in a memo to all \nHouse Members that the Shays-Meehan bill is fully constitutional. That \nis exactly the amendment we passed the other night on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Finally, in the event of constitutional problems, the amendment \npassed the other night is fully severable.\n  I make five arguments as to why this is a very different question.\n  First, this amendment, and indeed the Snowe-Jeffords provision \nalready in the bill, only covers broadcast communications. It does not \ncover print communications like the one at issue in Massachusetts \nCitizens for Life. Indeed, the group argued that the flyer should have \nbeen protected as a news ``editorial.'' Snowe-Jeffords specifically \nexempts editorial communications.\n  Second, the court based its decision in part on the logic that \nregulation of election related communications was overly burdensome to \nsmall, grass roots, nonprofit organizations and so would have a \nchilling effect on speech. But the Snowe-Jeffords standard that the \namendment would apply has a high threshold that must be met before a \ncommunication is covered. A group would have to spend $10,000 on \nbroadcast ads that mention a federal candidate 60 days before an \nelection before this provision would kick in. This meets the Court's \nrequirement in the case that minor communications be protected.\n  Third, the federal law that the court objected to was extremely broad \nand the Court specifically cited that fact as one of reasons it reached \nthe decision it did, saying ``Regulation that would produce such a \nresult demands far more precision that [current law] provides.'' This \namendment provides that precision. The Snowe-Jeffords language is very \nnarrowly targeted and has a very high threshold before it applies, \nwhich further protects amateur, unsophisticated, or extremely limited \ncommunications.\n  Fourth, the Court actually argued that the election communications of \nnon-profit corporations--such as the ones covered by amendment--could \nbe regulated once it reached a certain level. In fact, the Court held \nthat, quote:\n\n       . . . should MCFL's independent spending so extensive that \n     the organization's major purpose may be regarded as campaign \n     activity, the corporation would be classified as a political \n     committee . . . As such, it would automatically be subject to \n     the obligations and restrictions applicable to those groups \n     whose primary objective is to influence political campaigns.\n\n  Yet since the decision, such groups have actually operated outside \nthe law with impunity. Take for example, the organization ``Republicans \nfor Clean Air.''\n  Despite it's innocuous name, this was an organization created for the \nsole purpose of promoting the candidacy of George W. Bush during the \nRepublican primary during the last election. Another example is the \nClub for Growth. This was an outfit that ran attack ads against \nmoderate Republican congressional candidates in Republican \ncongressional primaries. Both groups, which would be covered by my \namendment--but not the current Snowe-Jeffords provision--could clearly \nbe banned from running these sham issue ads with their treasury funds \nunder the Massachusetts Citizens for Life decision.\n  Fifth, the court's decision was based on a premise that may have been \ntrue in 1986, but certainly is not the case today: that non-profit \ngroups such as the one at issue in the decision did not play a major \nrule in federal elections. In fact, the court held that: ``the FEC \nmaintains that the inapplicability of [current law] to MCFL would open \nthe door to massive undisclosed spending by similar entities . . . We \nsee no such danger.'' Today, it is clear that the FEC had it exactly \nright and the Court had it exactly wrong.\n  In fact, the Campaign Finance Institute at George Washington \nUniversity in a February 2001 report found this to be the case and \nstated quote: ``These undisclosed interest group communications are a \nmajor force in U.S. not little oddities or blips on a screen.'' Perhaps \nin 1986 it was a ``blip on the screen'' but today we are talking about \ntens of millions of dollars just in these sham issue adds. These groups \nhave become major players in our elections but the law does not hold \nthem accountable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to conclude the debate on the motion \nto strike that has been offered by my colleague from Ohio by making \nseveral points on the Snowe-Jeffords provision. We will conclude the \ndebate tomorrow before the vote. But I think it is critical for my \ncolleagues to understand that the essence of this provision, as the \nSenator from North Carolina so eloquently stated, the legal rationale \nfor the underpinnings of this amendment, was drafted with an abundance \nof caution. It was carefully crafted to specifically address the issues \nthat were raised in the Buckley decision in 1976 with respect to the \nrestrictions\n\n[[Page S3043]]\n\nbeing either too vague or too broad, and so they in effect would not \nhave a chilling effect on the public's right to free speech.\n  Since that time, as I indicated earlier, in the 25 years or 26 years \nthat have ensued, there has been no other major campaign finance law \nthat has been passed by this Congress or that has come before the \nSupreme Court because we have not acted. We have not taken any action \non campaign finance reform or changes in our campaign finance laws \nsince that time.\n  We have seen the evolution and the eruption of the so-called sham \nissue ads that supposedly were operating under the guise of being \nadvocacy ads. But in reality, as we all well know, with the studies \nthat have been done recently on the influence and impact they are \nhaving on the election because they mention the candidates by name, \nthey come into that very narrow window of 60 days before an election.\n  That is not just happenstance; it is because the election is \noccurring. They design these ads to mention a candidate and to avoid \nusing those magic words ``for or against'' but knowing full well that \nit will have an effect on the intended audience on a candidate's \nelection.\n  We are very definitive. We are very specific in the Snowe-Jeffords \nprovision in the McCain-Feingold legislation that is before us. It has \nto identify. It has to mention a candidate. The ad has to run 60 days \nbefore a general election and 30 days before a primary. The ad has to \nrun in a candidate's State or district.\n  Those criteria are very specific, and therefore anybody who has the \nintention of running those ads will know exactly whether or not they \nare treading constitutional grounds. That is why 70 constitutional \nscholars and experts signed a letter in support of these provisions, \nbecause they know they don't run afoul of constitutional limitations in \nthe first amendment because it is very specifically drafted to address \nthose issues.\n  Fundamentally, it really comes down to whether or not we are truly \ninterested in disclosure. The Supreme Court said we have a right to \ndisclosure. It is in the public interest. It is a compelling public \ninterest for disclosure. The Supreme Court has said clearly in a number \nof cases for constitutional purposes that electioneering is different \nfrom other speeches. That was handed down as one decision by the \nSupreme Court in 1986.\n  Of course, in the Buckley case, it said Congress has the power to \nenact campaign financing laws that extend electioneering through a \nvariety of ways, even though spending in other forms of political \nspeech is entitled to absolute first amendment protection. It said, as \nan example, to ``vote for'' or ``vote against'' are the magic words but \nthat it was not all-inclusive.\n  The Supreme Court could not possibly have foreseen the evolution of \nthe kinds of ads that are pervading the election process today. They \nare escaping. They are coming in under the radar of disclosure.\n  We are saying those major donors of $1,000 or more--that is five \ntimes the requirement for disclosure that we have to provide as \ncandidates under Federal election laws--but we are saying five times \nhigher before the trigger for disclosure occurs to organizations that \nrun ads in that 60-day window, in the 30-day window in the primary, \nthat mention a candidate because it is clear that the intent is \ndesigned to influence the outcome of an election.\n  In Buckley, it said Congress has broader latitude to require \ndisclosure of election-related spending than it does to restrict such \nspending. Disclosure rules, according to the Court, are the least \nrestrictive means of curbing the evils of campaign ignorance and \ncorruption.\n  Congress banned corporate union contributions as upheld in United \nStates v. UAW in 1957, reaffirmed, as I said earlier, in the Austin v. \nMichigan Chamber of Commerce decision in 1990. It is all weighted in \nsound legal precedent. That is what the Snowe-Jeffords provision is all \nabout.\n  I really do think we have to come to grips with the realities of what \nis occurring in our elections when 99 percent --99 percent is almost as \nhigh as it gets--99 percent of all of the ads that are aired during \nthat period of time before the election mention candidates. And their \nintent is clear, because all the focus groups that responded to the \nSnowe-Jeffords provision used that as an analysis and viewed these ads, \nand identified these ads as being the most influential, negative, and \nintended to effect an outcome. So that is essentially what we are \ntalking about.\n  I think the vote tomorrow to strike this provision is basically \ncoming down to whether or not we want fundamental reform, if we are \nwilling to take back the process, if we are willing to take back the \nprocess as candidates.\n  I want to control my own campaign. As I said in my previous \nstatement, in 1978 when I first ran for the House of Representatives, \nthese phenomena were virtually unknown. It was rare to even have an \nindependent expenditure--and that is another story--under Federal \nelection laws. That is a different thing. But we did not even have \nthat.\n\n  These elections should be between and among the candidates \nthemselves. Do we really think it is in our interest, in the public's \ninterest, to have organizations of whom we know little, if anything, to \ninfluence, to impact, our elections--In fact, to spend more than the \ncandidates themselves in some of these elections? Sometimes these \norganizations spend more than the candidates themselves who are \ninvolved in these elections. Are we saying that that is in our public \ninterest?\n  They hide behind the cloak of anonymity. We do not even know who they \nare. I have a list here. Some of them we would probably readily \nidentify by name, at least in terms of their interests. But while you \ndo not know most of them, this is a list of 100 organizations. And this \nis not all of them. This is not all inclusive. But you have the \nAmericans for Hope, Growth & Opportunity, Americans for Job Security, \nCoalition to Protect Americans Now, Coalition to Protect America's \nHealth Care, Committee for Good Common Sense. Those all sound very \nappropriate, meritorious, but who are they? Who are they?\n  We are not saying they can't run ads. They can run ads all year long. \nThey can do whatever they want in that sense. But what we are saying \nis, when they come into that narrow window, we have the right to know \nwho are their major contributors who are financing these ads close to \nan election.\n  There are no guaranteed rights to anonymity when it comes to \ncampaigning. Even the Supreme Court has said it is in our public \ninterest to have disclosure. In fact, the Court has said time and time \nagain, disclosure is in the public's interest because it gives details \nas to the nature and source of the information they are getting. That \nis why 70 constitutional scholars have endorsed the Snowe-Jeffords \nprovision.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter from the \nBrennan Center for Justice printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law,\n                                     New York, NY, March 12, 2001.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     Senator Russell Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators McCain and Feingold: We are scholars who have \n     studied and written about the First Amendment to the United \n     States Constitution. We submit this letter to respond to a \n     series of public challenges to two components of S. 27, the \n     McCain-Feingold Bill. Critics have argued that it is \n     unconstitutional to close the so-called ``soft money \n     loophole'' by placing restrictions on the source and amount \n     of campaign contributions to political parties. Critics have \n     also argued that it is unconstitutional to require disclosure \n     of campaign ads sponsored by advocacy groups unless the ads \n     contain explicit words of advocacy, such as ``vote for'' or \n     ``vote against.'' We reject both of those suggestions.\n       As constitutional scholars, we are deeply committed to the \n     principles underlying the First Amendment and believe \n     strongly in preserving free speech and association in our \n     society, especially in the realm of politics. We are not all \n     of the same mind on how best to address the problems of money \n     and politics. However, we all agree that the nation's current \n     campaign finance laws are on the verge of being rendered \n     irrelevant, and that the Constitution does not erect an \n     insurmountable hurdle to Congressional efforts to adopt \n     reasonable campaign finance laws aimed at increasing \n     disclosure for electioneering ads, restoring the integrity of \n     the long-standing ban on corporate and union political \n     expenditures, and reducing the appearance of corruption that \n     flows from ``soft money'' donations to political parties.\n\n[[Page S3044]]\n\n       The problems of corruption and the appearance of corruption \n     that the McCain-Feingold Bill attempts to address are ones \n     that inhere in any system that permits large campaign \n     contributions to flow to elected officials and the political \n     parties. These problems have been brought to the public's \n     attention in a rather stark manner through the recent \n     presidential pardon issued to fugitive financier Marc Rich. \n     Regardless of underlying merits of that presidential \n     decision, the public perception that flows from the publicly-\n     reported facts is that large political contributors receive \n     both preferred access to and preferential treatment from our \n     elected government officials. These perceptions, regardless \n     of their truth or falsity in any individual case, are \n     ultimately very corrosive to our democratic institutions.\n\n\n  I. Limits on ``Soft Money'' contributions to Political Parties from \nCorporations, Labor Unions, and Wealthy Contributors Are Constitutional\n\n       To prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption, \n     federal law imposes limits on the source and amount of money \n     that can be given to candidates and political parties ``in \n     connection with'' federal elections. The money raised under \n     these strictures is commonly referred to as ``hard money.'' \n     Since 1907, federal law has prohibited corporations from \n     making hard money contributions to candidates or political \n     parties. See 2 U.S.C 441b(a) (current codification). In 1947, \n     that ban was extended to prohibit union contributions as \n     well. Id. Individuals, too, are subject to restrictions in \n     their giving of money to influence federal elections. The \n     Federal Election Campaign Act (``FECA'') limits an \n     individual's contributions to (1) $1,000 per election to a \n     federal candidate; (2) $20,000 per year to national political \n     party committees; and (3) $5,000 per year to any other \n     political committee, such as a PAC or a state political party \n     committee. Id. Sec. 441a(a)(1). Individuals are also subject \n     to a $25,000 annual limit on the total of all such \n     contributions. Id. Sec. 441a(a)(3).\n       The soft money loophole was created not by Congress, but by \n     a Federal Election Commission (``FEC'') ruling in 1978 that \n     opened a seemingly modest door to allow non-regulated \n     contributions to political parties, so long as the money was \n     used for grassroots campaign activity, such as registering \n     voters and get-out-the-vote efforts. These unregulated \n     contributions are known as ``soft money'' to distinguish them \n     from the hard money raised under FECA's strict limits. In the \n     years since the FEC's ruling, this modest opening has turned \n     into an enormous loophole that threatens the integrity of the \n     regulatory system. In the recent presidential election, soft \n     money contributions soared to the unprecedented figure of \n     $487 million, which represented an 85 percent increase over \n     the previous presidential election cycle (1995-96). It is not \n     merely the total amount of soft money contributions that \n     raises concerns, but the size of the contributions as well, \n     with donors being asked to give amounts of $100,000, \n     $250,000, or more to gain preferred access to federal \n     officials. Moreover, the soft money raised is, for the most \n     part, not being spent to bolster party grassroots organizing. \n     Rather, the funds are often solicited by federal candidates \n     and used for media advertising clearly intended to influence \n     federal elections. In sum, soft money has become an end run \n     around the campaign contribution limits, creating a corrupt \n     system in which monied interests appear to buy access to, and \n     inappropriate influence with, elected officials.\n       The McCain-Feingold bill would ban soft money contributions \n     to national political parties by requiring that all \n     contributions to national parties be subject to FECA's hard \n     money restrictions. The bill also would bar federal \n     officeholders and candidates for such offices from \n     soliciting, receiving, or spending soft money. Additionally, \n     state parties that are permitted under state law to accept \n     unregulated contributions from corporations, labor unions, \n     and wealthy individuals would be prohibited from spending \n     that money on activities relating to federal elections, \n     including advertisements that support or oppose a federal \n     candidate.\n       We believe that such restrictions are constitutional. The \n     soft money loophole has raised the specter of corruption \n     stemming from large contributions (and those from prohibited \n     sources) that led Congress to enact the federal contribution \n     limits in the first place. In Buckley v. Valeo the Supreme \n     Court held that the government has a compelling interest in \n     combating the appearance and reality of corruption, an \n     interest that justifies restricting large campaign \n     contributions in federal elections. See 424 U.S. 1, 23-29 \n     (1976). Significantly, the Court upheld the $25,000 annual \n     limit on an individual's total contributions in connection \n     with federal elections. See id. at 26-29, 38. In later cases, \n     the Court rejected the argument that corporations have a \n     right to use their general treasury funds to influence \n     elections. See, e.g., Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, \n     494 U.S. 652 (1990). Under Buckley and its progeny, Congress \n     clearly possesses power to close the soft money loophole by \n     restricting the source and size of contributions to political \n     parties, just as it does for contributions to candidates, for \n     use in connection with federal elections.\n       Moreover, Congress has the power to regulate the source of \n     the money used for expenditures by state and local parties \n     during federal election years when such expenditures are used \n     to influence federal elections. The power of Congress to \n     regulate federal elections to prevent fraud and corruption \n     includes the power to regulate conduct which, although \n     directed at state or local elections, also has an impact on \n     federal races. During a federal election year, a state or \n     local political party's voter registration or get-out-the-\n     vote drive will have an effect on federal elections. \n     Accordingly, Congress may require that during a federal \n     election year, state and local parties' expenditures for such \n     activities be made from funds raised in compliance with FECA \n     so as not to undermine the limits therein.\n       Any suggestion that the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC, 1518 \n     U.S. 604 (1996), casts doubt on the constitutionality of a \n     soft money ban is flatly wrong. Colorado Republican did not \n     address the constitutionality of banning soft money \n     contributions, but rather the expenditures by political \n     parties of hard money, that is, money raised in accordance \n     with FECA's limit. Indeed, the Court noted that it ``could \n     understand how Congress, were it to conclude that the \n     potential for evasion of the individual contribution limits \n     was a serious matter, might decide to change the statute's \n     limitations on contributions to political parties.'' Id. at \n     617.\n       In fact, the most relevant Supreme Court decision is not \n     Colorado Republican, but Austin v. Michigan Chamber of \n     Commerce, in which the Supreme Court held that corporations \n     can be walled off from the electoral process by forbidding \n     both contributions and independent expenditures from general \n     corporate treasuries. 494 U.S. at 657-61. Surely, the law \n     cannot be that Congress has the power to prevent corporations \n     from giving money directly to a candidate, or from expending \n     money on behalf of a candidate, but lacks the power to \n     prevent them from pouring unlimited funds into a candidate's \n     political party in order to buy preferred access to him after \n     the election. See also Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Govt. PAC, \n     120 S. Ct. 897 (2000) (reaffirming Buckley's holding that \n     legislatures may enact limits on large campaign \n     contributions to prevent corruption and the appearance of \n     corruption).\n       Accordingly, closing the loophole for soft money \n     contributions is in line with the longstanding and \n     constitutional ban on corporate and union contributions in \n     federal elections and with limits on the size of individuals' \n     contributions to amounts that are not corrupting.\n\n\n II. Congress May Require disclosure of Electioneering Communications, \nand It May Require Corporations and Labor Unions to Fund Electioneering \n  Communications With Money Raised Through Political Action Committees\n\n       The current version of the McCain-Feingold Bill adopts the \n     Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, which addresses the problem of \n     thinly-disguised electioneering ads that masquerade as \n     ``issue ads.'' Snowe-Jeffords defines the term \n     ``electioneering communications'' to include radio or \n     television ads that refer to clearly identified candidates \n     and are broadcast within 60 days of a general election or 30 \n     days of a primary. A group that makes electioneering \n     communications totaling $10,000 or more in a calendar year \n     must disclose its identity, the cost of the communication, \n     and the names and addresses of all its donors of $1,000 or \n     more. If the group has a segregated fund that it uses to pay \n     for electioneering communications, then only donors to that \n     fund must be disclosed. Additionally, corporations and labor \n     unions are barred from using their general treasury funds to \n     pay for electioneering communications. Instead, they must \n     fund electioneering communications through their political \n     action committees.\n       The Supreme Court has made clear that, for constitutional \n     purposes, electioneering is different from other speech. See \n     FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, 479 U.S. 238, 249 \n     (1986) (``MCFL''). Congress has the power to enact campaign \n     finance laws that constrain the spending of money on \n     electioneering in a variety of ways, even though spending on \n     other forms of political speech is entitled to absolute First \n     Amendment protection. See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 \n     (1976). Congress is permitted to demand that the sponsor of a \n     campaign and disclose the amount spent on the message and the \n     sources of the funds. And Congress may prohibit corporations \n     and labor unions from spending money on campaign ads. This is \n     black letter constitutional law about which there can be no \n     serious dispute.\n       There are, of course, limits to Congress's power to \n     regulate election-related spending. But there are two \n     contexts in which the Supreme Court has granted Congress \n     freer reign to regulate. First, Congress has broader latitude \n     to require disclosure of election-related spending than it \n     does to restrict such spending. See id. at 67-68. In Buckley, \n     the Court declared that the governmental interests that \n     justify disclosure of election-related spending are \n     considerably broader and more powerful than those justifying \n     prohibitions or restrictions on election-related speeding. \n     Disclosure rules, the Court opined, in contrast to spending \n     restrictions or contribution limits, enhance the information \n     available to the voting public. Plus, the burdens on free \n     speech rights are far less significant when Congress requires \n     disclosure of a particular type of spending than when it \n     prohibits the spending outright or limits the funds that \n     support the speech. Disclosure rules, according to the \n     Court, are ``the least\n\n[[Page S3045]]\n\n     restrictive means of curbing the evils of campaign \n     ignorance and corruption.'' Id. at 68. Thus, even if \n     certain political advertisements cannot be prohibited or \n     otherwise regulated, the speaker might still be required \n     to disclose the funding sources for those ads if the \n     governmental justification is sufficiently strong.\n       Second, Congress has a long record, which has been \n     sustained by the Supreme Court, of imposing more onerous \n     spending restrictions on corporations and labor unions than \n     on individuals, political action committees, and \n     associations. Congress banned corporate and union \n     contributions in order ``to avoid the deleterious influences \n     on federal elections resulting from the use of money by those \n     who exercise control over large aggregations of capital.'' \n     United States v. UAW, 352 U.S. 567, 585 (1957). As recently \n     as 1990, the Court reaffirmed this rational. See Austin v. \n     Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 491 U.S. 652 (1990); FEC v. \n     National Right to Work Committee, 459 U.S. 197 (1982). The \n     Court emphasized that it is constitutional for the state to \n     limit the electoral participation of corporations because \n     ``[s]tate law grants [them] special advantages--such as \n     limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treatment of \n     the accumulation of and distribution of assets.'' Austin, 491 \n     U.S. at 658-59. Having provided these advantages to \n     corporation, particularly business corporations, the state \n     has no obligation to ``permit them to use `resources amassed \n     in the economic marketplace' to obtain `an unfair advantage \n     in the political marketplace.' '' (quoting MCFL, 479 U.S. at \n     257). Snowe-Jeffords builds upon these bedrock principles, \n     extending current regulation cautiously and only in the areas \n     in which the First Amendment protection is at its lowest ebb.\n       Contrary to the suggestion of some of the critics of Snowe-\n     Jeffords, the Supreme Court in Buckley did not promulgate a \n     list of certain ``magic words'' that are regulable as \n     ``electioneering'' and place all other communications beyond \n     the reach of campaign finance law. In Buckley, the Supreme \n     Court reviewed the constitutionality of a specific piece of \n     legislation--FECA. One section of FBCA imposed a $1,000 limit \n     on expenditures ``relative to a clearly identified \n     candidate,'' and another section imposed reporting \n     requirements for independent expenditures of over $100 ``for \n     the purpose of influencing'' a federal election. The Court \n     concluded that these specific provisions ran afoul of two \n     constitutional doctrines--vagueness and overbreadth--that \n     pervade First Amendment jurisprudence.\n       The vagueness doctrine demands clear definitions. Before \n     the government punishes someone--especially for speech--it \n     must articulate with sufficient clarity what conduct is legal \n     and what is illegal. A vague definition of electioneering \n     might ``chill'' some political speakers who, although they \n     desire to engage in discussions of political issues, may fear \n     that their speech could be punished.\n       Even if a regulation is articulated with great clarity, it \n     may still be struck as overbroad. A restriction that covers \n     regulable speech (and does so clearly) can be struck if it \n     sweeps too broadly and covers a substantial amount of \n     constitutionally protected speech as well. But under the \n     overbreadth doctrine, the provision will be upheld unless its \n     overbreadth is substantial. A challenger cannot topple a \n     statute simply by conjuring up a handful of applications that \n     would yield unconstitutional results.\n       Given these two doctrines, it is plain why FECA's clumsy \n     provisions troubled the Court. Any communication that so much \n     as mentions a candidate--any time and in any context--could \n     be said to be ``relative to'' the candidate. And it is \n     difficult to predict what might ``influence'' a federal \n     election. The Supreme Court could have simply struck FECA, \n     leaving it to Congress to develop a clearer and more precise \n     definition of electioneering. Instead, the Court intervened \n     by essentially rewriting Congress's handiwork itself. In \n     order to avoid the vagueness and overbreadth problems, the \n     Court interpreted FECA to reach only funds used for \n     communications that ``expressly advocate'' the election or \n     defeat of a clearly identified candidate. In an important \n     footnote, the Court provided some guidance on how to decide \n     whether a communication meets that description. The Court \n     stated that its revision of FECA would limit the reach of the \n     statute ``to communications containing express words of \n     advocacy of election or defeat, such as `vote for,' `elect,' \n     `support,' `cast your ballot for,' `Smith for Congress,' \n     `vote against,' `defeat,' `reject,''' Buckley, 424 U.S. at 44 \n     n.52.\n       But the Court did not declare that all legislatures were \n     stuck with these magic words, or words like them, for all \n     time. To the contrary, Congress has the power to enact a \n     statute that defines electioneering in a more nuanced manner, \n     as long as its definition adequately addresses the vagueness \n     and overbreadth concerns expressed by the Court.\n       Any more restrictive reading of the Supreme Court's opinion \n     would be fundamentally at odds with the rest of the Supreme \n     Court's First Amendment jurisprudence. Countless other \n     contexts--including libel, obscenity, fighting words, and \n     labor elections--call for delicate line drawing between \n     protected speech and speech that may be regulated. In none of \n     these cases has the Court adopted a simplistic bright-line \n     approach. For example, in libel cases, an area of core First \n     Amendment concern, the Court has rejected the simple bright-\n     line approach of imposing liability based on the truth or \n     falsity of the statement published. Instead the Court has \n     prescribed an analysis that examines, among other things, \n     whether the speaker acted with reckless disregard for the \n     truth or falsity of the statement and whether a reasonable \n     reader would perceive the statement as stating actual facts \n     or merely rhetorical hyperbole. Similarly, in the context of \n     union representation elections, employers are permitted to \n     make ``predictions'' about the consequences of unionizing but \n     they may not issue ``threats.'' The courts have developed an \n     extensive jurisprudence to distinguish between the two \n     categories, yet the fact remains that an employer could \n     harbor considerable uncertainty as to whether or not the \n     words he is about to utter are sanctionable. The courts are \n     comfortable with the uncertainty of these tests because \n     they have provided certain concrete guidelines.\n       In no area of First Amendment jurisprudence has the Court \n     mandated a mechanical test that ignores either the context of \n     the speech at issue or the purpose underlying the regulatory \n     scheme. In no area of First Amendment jurisprudence has the \n     Court held that the only constitutionally permissible test is \n     one that would render the underlying regulatory scheme \n     unenforceable. It is doubtful, therefore, that the Supreme \n     Court in Buckley intended to single out election regulations \n     as requiring a mechanical, formulaic, and utterly unworkable \n     test.\n       Snowe-Jeffords presents a definition of electioneering \n     carefully crafted to address the Supreme Court's dual \n     concerns regarding vagueness and overbreadth. Because the \n     test for prohibited electioneering is defined with great \n     clarity, it satisfies the Supreme Court's vagueness concerns. \n     Any sponsor of a broadcast will know, with absolute \n     certainty, whether the ad depicts or names a candidate and \n     how many days before an election it is being broadcast. There \n     is little danger that a sponsor would mistakenly censor its \n     own protected speech out of fear of prosecution under such a \n     clear standard.\n       The prohibition is also narrow enough to satisfy the \n     Supreme Court's overbreadth concerns. Advertisements that \n     name a political candidate and are aired close to election \n     almost invariably are electioneering ads intended to \n     encourage voters to support or oppose the named candidate. \n     This conclusion is supported by a comprehensive academic \n     review conducted of television advertisements in the 1998 \n     federal election cycle. See Buying Time: Television \n     Advertising in the 1998 Congressional Elections (Brennan \n     Center for Justice, 2000). This study examined more than \n     300,000 airings of some 2,100 separate political commercials \n     that appeared in the nation's 75 largest media markets in \n     1998. The study found that there were a total of 3,100 \n     airings of only two separate commercials that met the Snowe-\n     Jeffords criteria of naming a specific candidate within 60 \n     days of the general election and that were judged by academic \n     researchers to be true issue advocacy. This, the Snowe-\n     Jeffords general election criteria were shown to have \n     inaccurately captured only 1 percent of the total political \n     commercial airings, and represented an insignificant 0.1 \n     percent of the separate political commercial airings in the \n     1998 election cycle. This empirical evidence demonstrates \n     that the Snowe-Jeffords criteria are not ``substantially \n     overbroad.'' The careful crafting of Snowe-Jeffords stands in \n     stark contrast to the clumsy and sweeping prohibition that \n     congress originally drafted in FECA.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       McCain-Feingold is a reasonable approach to restoring the \n     integrity of our federal campaign finance laws. The \n     elimination of soft money will close an unintended loophole \n     that, over the last few election cycles, has rendered the \n     pre-existing federal contribution limits largely irrelevant. \n     Similarly, the incorporation of the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment \n     into the McCain-Feingold Bill is a well-reasoned attempt to \n     define electioneering in a more realistic manner while \n     remaining faithful to First Amendment vagueness and \n     overbreadth concerns. It seeks to provide the public with \n     important information concerning which private groups and \n     individuals are spending substantial sums on electioneering, \n     and it prohibits corporations and labor unions from skirting \n     the ban on using their general treasury funds for the purpose \n     of influencing the outcome of federal elections. While no one \n     can predict with certainty how the courts will finally rule \n     if any of these provisions are challenged in court, we \n     believe that the McCain-Feingold Bill, as currently drafted, \n     is consistent with First Amendment jurisprudence.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Erwin Chemerinsky,\n       Sydney M.

They illustrate exceptionally well the legal validity and \nrationale for this provision. It charts a very narrow course. That is \nwhy they have every confidence it will withstand constitutional \nscrutiny.\n  You hear some who say: Oh, no, it will create a loophole. On the \nother hand, it creates too many restrictions.\n  Well, which is it? I think we have reached the point in time where we \nhave to stand up and be counted as to whether or not we want to hide \nbehind the guise of anonymity, of organizational anonymity, to shape \nthe direction and influence of these elections. I say that is the wrong \ndirection.\n  The Annenberg Center did a study. It showed, as I said earlier, $100 \nmillion was spent in the final weeks of the campaign. And guess what. \nThey mentioned a candidate by name. They mentioned a candidate by name. \nThat is no coincidence. It had nothing to do with influencing the issue \nagenda because, as I showed on a chart earlier, what was happening in \nCongress and what was happening out in the elections was not parallel. \nThe ads run by these organizations tracked the ads run by candidates \nand had nothing to do, virtually speaking, with what Congress was \naddressing at that point in time.\n  So that is why this legislation becomes so important. It is an \nintegral part of the reform that is before us embodied in the McCain-\nFeingold legislation. It does represent a balanced approach.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a statement by persons \nwho have served the American Civil Liberties Union printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of Persons Who Have Served the American Civil Liberties Union \nin Leadership Positions Supporting the Constitutionality of the McCain-\n                     Feingold Bill, March 22, 2001\n\n       We have served the American Civil Liberties Union in \n     leadership positions over several decades. Norman Dorsen \n     served as ACLU General Counsel from 1969-76 and as President \n     of the ACLU from 1976-1991. Jack Pemberton and Aryeh Neier \n     served as Executive Directors of the ACLU from 1962-1978. \n     Melvin Wulf, Burt Neuborne, and John Powell served as \n     National Legal Directors of the ACLU from 1962-1992. Charles \n     Morgan, Jr., John Shattuck, and Morton Halperin served as \n     National Legislative Directors of the ACLU from 1972-1992. \n     Together we constitute every living person to have served as \n     ACLU President, ACLU Executive Director, ACLU Legal Director, \n     or ACLU Legislative Director, with the exception of the \n     current leadership.\n       We have devoted much of our professional lives to the ACLU, \n     and to the protection of free speech. We are proud of our \n     ACLU service, and we continue to support the ACLU's matchless \n     efforts to preserve the Bill of Rights. We have come to \n     believe, however, that the ACLU's opposition to campaign \n     finance reform in general, and the McCain-Feingold Bill in \n     particular, is misplaced. In our opinion, the First Amendment \n     does not forbid content-neutral efforts to place reasonable \n     limits on campaign spending and establish reasonable \n     disclosure rules, such as those contained in the McCain-\n     Feingold Bill.\n       We believe that the First Amendment is designed to \n     safeguard a functioning and fair democracy. The current \n     system of campaign financing makes a mockery of that ideal by \n     enabling the rich to set the national agenda, and to exercise \n     disproportionate influence over the behavior of public \n     officials.\n       We recognize that the Supreme Court's 1976 decision in \n     Buckley v. Valeo makes it extremely difficult for Congress to \n     reform the current, disastrous campaign finance system, and \n     we believe that Buckley should be overruled. However, even \n     within the limitations of the Buckley decision, we believe \n     that the campaign finance reform measures contained in the \n     McCain-Feingold Bill are constitutional.\n       We support McCain-Feingold's elimination of the ``soft \n     money'' loophole, which allows unlimited campaign \n     contributions to political parties and undermines Congress's \n     effort to regulate the size and source of campaign \n     contributions to candidates. There can be little doubt that \n     large ``soft money'' contributions to the political parties \n     can corrupt, and are perceived as corrupting, our government \n     officials.\n       We also support regulation of the funding of political \n     advertising that is clearly intended to affect the outcome of \n     a specific federal election, but that omits the magic words \n     ``vote for'' or ``vote against.'' The McCain-Feingold Bill \n     treats as electioneering any radio or television ad that \n     names a federal candidate shortly before an election and is \n     targeted to the relevant electorate. It would ban the use of \n     corporate and labor general treasury funds for such ads, and \n     it would require public disclosure of the sources of funding \n     for such ads when purchased by other groups and individuals. \n     We believe that these provisions are narrowly tailored to \n     meet the vagueness and overbreadth concerns expressed by the \n     Supreme Court in Buckley, and thus are constitutional.\n       Finally, we believe that the current debate over campaign \n     finance reform in the Senate and House of Representatives \n     should center on the important policy questions raised by \n     various efforts at reform. Opponents of reform should not be \n     permitted to hide behind an unjustified constitutional \n     smokescreen.\n\n     Norman Dorsen.\n     Morton Halperin.\n     Charles Morgan, Jr.\n     Aryeh Neier.\n     Burt Neuborne.\n     Jack Pemberton.\n     John Powell.\n     John Shattuck.\n     Melvin Wulf.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, every previous president of the ACLU has \nendorsed this legislation. They uphold it. As we know, they are an \norganization apt to take either side to preserve the freedom and the \nright to speak. But they believe this meets the constitutional \nsoundness as crafted in previous decisions by the Supreme Court.\n  The Supreme Court did not say forever and a day you could never pass \nany other legislation to address what might develop. As I said, the \nCourt could not possibly foresee 25 years later the emergence and the \npreponderance of the kind of ads that are clearly overtaking the \nprocess.\n  The time has come, I say to my colleagues in the Senate, to recognize \nwe have to stand up and be counted on this very significant issue. And \nit comes down to disclosure. It comes down to disclosure. I hope the \nSenate will stand four-square behind disclosure and sunlight and \nagainst the unchecked process of these electioneering ads that are \ncertainly transforming the political landscape in ways that we could \nnot possibly desire or embrace.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Chair how much time I \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 47\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Let me inform the Chair and my colleagues, I do not \nintend to take that entire time. I am sure the Chair is pleased by \nthat.\n  I do request of the Chair, though, in case I do get carried away, if \nthe Chair would notify me when I have 10 minutes remaining. I don't \nexpect to get to that point. If the Chair will do that, I would \nappreciate it.\n  I have listened to my colleagues from Vermont and Maine, Arizona and \nNorth Carolina. I agree with a lot of what they have had to say. I \ndon't like a lot of these ads either. I have the same fear that every \nincumbent does; that is, that the next time I run there is going to be \na group that will come in and spend a whole bunch of money on Ohio TV \nand tell people what a bad Senator Mike DeWine has been. We all live in \nfear of that. We all live with a lot of money coming in, and we have \nthe fear of very tough ads that use our name, that use our picture, and \ntell the voters why we are not doing such a good job. We have that \nfear.\n  The problem is, the Snowe-Jeffords-Wellstone amendment is \nunconstitutional. There is the first amendment. Even though we may not \nlike it when people say things about us, that is part of their rights \nunder the first amendment.\n  I will respond specifically to a couple comments that have been made. \nMy colleague from Maine and before that\n\n[[Page S3047]]\n\nmy colleague from Minnesota made the statement about former directors \nof the ACLU. Let me respond to that by referencing a letter from the \ncurrent ACLU opposing this language, opposing the bill. In part, in \nreferencing this section of the bill, they say:\n\n       Simply put, the bill is a recipe for political repression \n     because it egregiously violates longstanding free speech \n     rights.\n\n  There is more to the letter, but that is the essence of it.\n  With the exception of my colleague from Minnesota, everyone who has \ncome to the floor this afternoon and this evening to argue against the \nDeWine amendment, each one of those individuals, while I have a great \ndeal of respect for them and while they were all very eloquent, each \none of them, with the exception of Senator Wellstone, voted against the \nWellstone amendment. I can't tell my colleagues why in each case, but \neach one of them did. The fact we must remember, and I ask my \ncolleagues to remember, is we no longer are dealing with Snowe-\nJeffords. We now are dealing with Snowe-Jeffords-Wellstone. That is \nwhat is in the bill, not the original Snowe-Jeffords.\n  Ninety percent of the debate we have heard this evening is about \nSnowe-Jeffords. That is not where we are. I didn't come to the floor to \noffer an amendment to take out Snowe-Jeffords. It has been changed. It \nhas been fundamentally changed. Members need to think about it.\n  My friend from North Carolina who voted against the Wellstone \namendment said this in his closing statement when he argued why he was \ngoing to vote against it:\n\n       So the reason Senator Feingold and Senator McCain are \n     opposing this amendment is the same reason that I oppose this \n     amendment. It raises very serious constitutional problems. \n     The U.S. Supreme Court, in fact, in 1984, specifically ruled \n     on this question.\n\n  That is what Senator Edwards said on this floor a short time before \nwe voted on the Wellstone amendment. Every person who has come to the \nfloor, with the exception of Senator Wellstone, every one who opposes \nthe DeWine amendment opposed the Wellstone amendment. There had to be a \nreason.\n  Again, what we are dealing with now is a changed bill, a changed \nplaying field. It is a different ballgame. It is a different bill. I \nsay to each one of you who took an oath to uphold the Constitution of \nthe United States, it is a different bill that we now are going to be \nvoting on tomorrow or the next day.\n  My amendment makes it a better bill. It makes it a constitutional \nbill.\n  Now, where are we? What does the new bill with the Wellstone \namendment now say? It has the original provisions of Senator Snowe and \nSenator Jeffords: 60 days out, corporations, unions no longer can \nengage in express advocacy. They no longer can run ads that are now \nallowed by law. That is a fundamental change. It is a gag on unions for \nthe last 60 days during the period of time when it counts the most.\n  The bill now goes further. Not only does it cover unions for 60 days, \nnot only does it cover corporations for 60 days, now it says virtually \nnobody can run an ad that mentions the candidate's name except the \ncandidates. And no one can engage in discussion about candidates' \nvoting records when they mention their names. I don't know how you \ndiscuss a candidate's voting record without mentioning their name, but \nyou can't talk about a candidate's voting record within 60 days of an \nelection unless you are the candidate or the other candidate, or unless \nyou own a TV station, or unless you are the commentator for the nightly \nnews. Everybody else, every other citizen is silenced for 60 days.\n  Do we really want to do that? Putting aside whether it is \nconstitutional or not constitutional--I think it is blatantly \nunconstitutional, certifiably unconstitutional, but even if it wasn't--\ndo we still want to do that in this country and say within 60 days \nbefore the election all these people can't talk anymore? I don't think \nwe do.\n  Yes, speech is effective. My colleague from Maine in essence says it \nis too effective. She didn't use those words, but she said it is having \nan impact. Yes, it is having an impact. That is what political speech \nis all about. It is supposed to have an impact.\n  Everything seems to be reversed. At the crucial time when political \nspeech matters most to the voters, those who hear it or see it, the \nbill as now written says: You can't do it. Sixty-one days out, you \ncould run one of these ads, and you could talk about Mike DeWine's \nrecord. Fifty-nine days out from the election, you no longer can do it. \nAnd 3 days before the election, when everyone is paying attention, you \ncan't run those ads. During the period of time when it is most \neffective, you can't run the ad.\n  Not only does it pick out the time when it is the most effective, but \nthe bill also picks out the way candidates today communicate on TV and \nradio and says that is one method of communication you can't use. That \nis how we get our messages across. Whether we are candidates or whether \nwe are opposing candidates or whether we are issue groups, whoever we \nare, we get it across through TV.\n  You can't compete and you cannot reach people in the State of Ohio \nunless you are on TV. That is a fact. Whether you are an issue group \nattacking Mike DeWine or whether you are an independent expenditure \ngroup, whoever you are, you can't reach people, or whether you are the \ncandidate, you can't reach people unless you are on TV. So they pick \nthe most effective way to do it and the most important time, and they \nhave taken those off the table and said during that period of time, you \ncan't be on TV. It is a direct, absolute attack on the first amendment.\n\n  What I have a hard time understanding is some of my colleagues and my \nfriends who, on other days are the most vehement advocates for the \nfirst amendment, somehow don't think this violates the first amendment.\n  Mr. President, it is a direct attack on the first amendment.\n  I talked this afternoon about my own campaign, my last campaign. I \nwant to get back to that. I emphasize, most of what my colleagues fear \nand have said I agree with. Each one of us lives in fear of a group \nputting an ad on TV that criticizes us. We don't become any less human \nwhen we get into politics or when we come to the Senate. No one likes \ncriticism. And no one likes criticism that they think is unfair. Do you \nknow what. That is part of what we do. That is part of what you have to \naccept in the United States of America if you run for office--maybe not \nin some other countries but here you do. That is what makes us \ndifferent.\n\n  I told a story this afternoon about a group in Ohio--several groups \nthat are mad at me over my proposal and support of a wildlife refuge in \nOhio, the Darby Refuge. I happen to think it is a good idea; they \ndon't. For some period of time, throughout the roads that I travel \nclose to my home, and up through the different counties it takes me to \ngo through where this refuge would be in Madison County, I see an awful \nlot of signs which say, ``Dump DeWine.'' I see signs that say, ``No \nDarby, No DeWine,'' and variations of that. I don't like it. But do you \nknow what. That is part of the first amendment. If those people who put \nthose signs up had decided to run TV ads, it seems to me they ought to \nhave a right to do that. Again, I would not like it, but I think they \nhave a right to do that. I think they have the right to pick the most \neffective way to get their message across, during the most crucial \ntime, when people are really focused and paying attention, which is 60 \ndays before the election, and to get their message out. If they want to \nput out a message on TV that basically says, ``Dump DeWine, `` or, \n``Call Mike DeWine and tell him Darby is a bad idea,'' or variations of \nthat, they ought to have a right to do that--as much as I would not \nlike it.\n  It is a question of the first amendment. There has been a lot of \ntalk, not just on the floor but among my colleagues for the last at \nleast 3 days, almost nonstop, about the issue of severability. It is an \nissue we are going to get and vote on tomorrow. We would not have that \ndiscussion if it weren't so abundantly clear that the Wellstone \nprovision, which is now part of Snowe-Jeffords, is unconstitutional. \nMembers know it. They tell you that privately. Some have said it \npublicly. But virtually everyone gets that it is unconstitutional and \nthe Court is going to throw it out.\n  This big debate tomorrow on severability and whether or not when one \npart of the bill goes down, another part\n\n[[Page S3048]]\n\nshould go down, or whether we should fence off one part of the bill--\nthat discussion, and a fairly close vote tomorrow, will come about \nbecause people know the Wellstone amendment is unconstitutional. If it \nweren't so, we would not be having that debate. That is going to be the \nthing that is unspoken tomorrow when we get to that debate.\n  I want to talk for a moment about my colleague from North Carolina, \nwho is a very good lawyer. He and I had the opportunity, during the \nimpeachment hearings, to work together, along with Senator Leahy and \nothers. I saw how good he is. My colleague came to the floor this \nevening and talked about the constitutionality of Snowe-Jeffords. I \nrespect what he has to say. Again, I point out, though, that this is \nthe same Member of the Senate--not much more than 24 hours ago--who \ncame to the floor and basically said the Wellstone amendment was \nunconstitutional. I understand that his comments tonight were about \nSnowe-Jeffords; but the problem is that title II is no longer Snowe-\nJeffords, it is Snowe-Jeffords-Wellstone, and it contains that \nprovision which Senator Edwards said is unconstitutional, or certainly \nimplied it. I read it in the Congressional Record.\n  My colleague from North Carolina went through the tests that have \nbeen laid down by the Supreme Court. There are tests as to whether or \nnot you can basically infringe on the first amendment. The courts will \nlook at any restriction on the first amendment from a strict scrutiny \npoint of view. One of the tests is, is there a compelling State \ninterest? In other words, the burden upon someone asserting that it is \nconstitutional to prohibit speech. That person has to prove to a \ncourt's satisfaction that there is a compelling State interest to do \nthat, to restrict that speech, because the presumption is you can't \nrestrict speech. I talked this afternoon about that.\n\n  There were some areas where the courts have acknowledged that it is \nconstitutional to restrict speech, but they are very narrow. They have \nheld that it has to be a compelling State interest, and the burden of \nproof is on those who assert the constitutionality. It also has to be \nnarrowly tailored. In other words, when the language is written to \nrestrict speech, it has to be narrowly tailored.\n  I have failed to hear any discussion of any convincing nature of what \nthe compelling State interest is. What is the compelling State interest \nthat permits the U.S. Congress to say that within 60 days before an \nelection we will stifle--shut off --free speech? What compelling State \ninterest is there, and how is it narrowly drawn for Congress to say no \nspeech within 60 days that mentions a candidate's name? How is that \nnarrow? That is a sledgehammer that comes down on the first amendment \nand shatters it. It is certainly not narrowly tailored. And certainly \nthe proponents of the constitutionality of this provision have not \nshown there is any compelling State interest.\n  Now, the Court talked, in Buckley, about the appearance of \ncorruption. Proponents of this constitutionality provision have made \nthe flat assumption and assertion that there is an appearance of \ncorruption. Yet that is all they say. I don't know what the evidence is \nof that appearance of corruption. They made the flat out assertion that \nthere is corruption, or there is the appearance of corruption, and that \ngives them authority to write this type of legislation. I think they \nhave failed in their burden of proof. Again, I state what the law is. \nThe law is that they have a burden of proof.\n  Again, in conclusion, my amendment will strike article II of the \nbill. Article II prohibits what I believe is constitutionally protected \nfree speech on TV, within the last 60 days of an election, by labor \nunions, corporations and, most importantly, by all outside interest \ngroups, by all groups of U.S. citizens who have come together to talk \nin the one way that is the most effective; that is, on television. It \nbans that. There is no compelling State interest to do it. It is \nclearly unconstitutional.\n  My friend and colleague from Maine also made another interesting \ncomment. She said, ``I want to control my own campaign.'' I am sure the \nPresiding Officer thinks the same way. I can tell you I think the same \nway. I want to run my own campaign. I have had a lot of experience \ndoing it. I have won some and lost some. I want to run my own campaign. \nShe also said that this debate should be between the candidates \nthemselves. Debate goes back and forth on TV.\n  I sort of agree with that, too. At least I understand what she means \nby that. You run against someone and you want to have that debate \nbetween the two of you. You start to get nervous when someone else gets \ninvolved in the debate. They may be trying to help you or your \nopponent. You do not know what they are doing. Sometimes they do not \nknow what they are doing. I understand where she is coming from.\n  This is not an exclusive club we are talking about. There should be \nno walls built up in the political arena to keep people out. This is \nAmerica. This is the United States. We do have a first amendment.\n  One of the basic beliefs of our founders was that public discussion \nof issues is essential to democracy. They did not have TV in those \ndays, obviously. They did not have radio. The main method of \ncommunication was the printed press, posters being put up, or speeches \ndirectly given and directly heard, but the principle is the same. The \nmore people you can involve in political discussion, the better it is.\n  There can be no walls built around the political arena where we say \nno one else can enter except the candidates. No one can participate \nexcept the candidates. No one can talk about issues in relationship to \ncandidates, except the candidates.\n  That is just not what we do in the United States. That is not what \nthis country is about. That is not how our political debates should \ntake place. In essence, in a very revealing comment, my friend and my \ncolleague from Maine certainly implied that. That is part of the \nproblem with the way this bill is currently crafted.\n  This is the United States. I know many times when our campaigns drag \non and on and they get pretty messy, and they get pretty rough, a lot \nof people say: Gee, why don't we do it the way this country does or \nthat country, such and such a country. They do not mess around. They \ncall an election in 6 weeks. They were strict when you could be on TV. \nThey have their election, and it is over. Much as we might long for \nthat sometimes when our campaigns drag on, or when Presidential \ncampaigns start basically a couple months after one Presidential \nelection is over and Senate races start several years in advance and \nHouse races seem to never stop, much as we long for that tranquility \nand the order, if we really thought about it, I do not think we would \nreally want it.\n  As long as the Wellstone amendment stays in the bill, clearly this \nbill is going to be held to be unconstitutional.\n  What is different about us and other countries is our first \namendment. It is our first amendment that is at issue. Many countries \ndo not have the equivalent of our first amendment that protects \npolitical speech, that protects free speech. We do and we are much \nbetter for it. Our political discussion is much better for it and it is \nmore informed.\n  We are different. I hope when Members of the Senate think about this \ntonight and prepare to vote tomorrow, they will remember the importance \nof the first amendment. They will vote for the DeWine amendment. They \nwill vote to make this a better bill. They will vote to give this bill \na much better chance of being held to be constitutional.\n  It is not just a question of the Constitution; it is also a question \nof public policy. Putting aside the constitutional issue, I do not \nthink we want to be in a position where this Congress says, basically \nas the thought police in this country, political speech police, that \nwithin 60 days of the election we are going to dramatically restrict \nwho can speak in the only way that is effective in many States, and \nthat is to be on TV. I do not think we want to do that, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/28/senate-section/article/S3048-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3048-S3049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CAMPAIGN TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as chairman of the Rules Committee during \nthe 105th Congress, I presided over numerous hearings on campaign \nfinance reform and I filed two comprehensive bills on this subject. \nAnd,\n\n[[Page S3049]]\n\njust like my colleagues over the years in the course of my four Senate \nraces, I have gained a firsthand familiarity with campaign finance \nissues. The Senate can take pride in this debate, while issues \nregarding the first amendment have been center stage, it seems to me \nthere is another fundamental issue we should consider.\n  One of our aims during this great debate should be to encourage \ngreater citizen participation in elections. Citizens are the backbone \nof our democracy and should be given encouragement to participate in \nevery way in the elective process.\n  What are the means by which we can encourage a greater role for the \naverage citizen? I believe one method is a $100 tax credit for \ncontributions made to House and Senate candidates. I propose this tax \ncredit be available only to single persons with an adjusted gross \nincome at or below $50,000. For married couples, in order to avoid \nexacting a ``marriage penalty,'' a married couple filing jointly could \nclaim a total of $200 in tax credits.\n  For various reasons, the wealthy are already involved in politics, \nbut there has been a declining interest in campaigns for those at the \nother end of the spectrum. This credit would encourage broader \nparticipation by moderate and lower income voters to balance the \ngreater ability of special interests to participate in the process.\n  There is precedent for such a tax credit. Until 1986, there was a $50 \ntax credit for contributions to political campaigns. According to IRS \ndata, when Congress repealed the political contributions tax credit, \n``a significant percentage of persons claiming the credit have \nsufficiently high incomes to make contributions in after tax dollars, \nwithout the benefit of the tax credit.''\n  My proposal would contrast with the previous tax credit because it \nwould cap the eligible income levels to ensure it is not exclusively \nthe wealthy who take advantage of it.\n  I think this is an issue that should be addressed in this campaign \nfinance bill. However, because of the constitutional prerogatives of \nthe House of Representatives, I merely bring this issue to your \nattention now, with the expectation I will raise it again in the \ncontext of a reconciliation bill that may be forthcoming.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, during yesterday's campaign finance \ndebate, I referred to a number of businesses that support a campaign \nfinance reform proposal. I meant to say that top executives or chief \nexecutive officers of those businesses support the reform proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/28/senate-section/article/S3049-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         OIL EXPLORATION IN THE ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my colleague from Alaska, Senator \nMurkowski, and I just attended a press conference concerning \nexploration in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  In attendance were: James P. Hoffa, International Brotherhood of \nTeamsters; Michael Sacco, Maritime Trade Department, AFL-CIO; Terry \nO'Sullivan, Building Trades Department; Martin J. Maddaloni, United \nAssociation of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe \nFitting Industry; Joseph Hunt, International Association of Bridge, \nStructural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers; Frank Hanley, \nInternational Union of Operating Engineers; Larry O'Toole, Marine \nEngineers' Beneficial Association; James Henry, Transportation \nInstitute; and Michael McKay, American Maritime Officers Service.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement made by Michael Sacco of \nthe Maritime Trades Department of the AFL-CIO be printed in the Record \nfor my colleagues to read. It offers great insight into the reasons why \nworking men and women throughout the country support oil and gas \nexploration in the coastal plain.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Statement of Michael Sacco, MTD President\n\n       With increasing energy problems throughout the United \n     States, Americans are looking for new ways to meet the \n     growing demand for energy products and ensure the continued \n     economic expansion we have enjoyed over the past decade.\n       Only one location promises to help America meet its energy \n     needs while providing good-paying jobs to American workers--\n     the Arctic National Widlife Refuge.\n       By opening ANWR, the United States can increase domestic \n     oil production, reduce our reliance on foreign sources of \n     oil, and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs for \n     American workers.\n       ANWR will be explored and drilled by American workers--the \n     oil transported through U.S.-built pipelines--refined and \n     distributed by domestic facilities--and its by-products used \n     by U.S. energy producers and U.S. consumers.\n       These jobs will help keep the economic engine of this \n     country running.\n       Many of our brothers and sisters in maritime labor will \n     crew the growing fleet of environmentally safe, double-\n     hulled, U.S.-flagged tankers that will carry the oil from \n     Alaska.\n       These vessels will be American-owned--built by Americans in \n     American shipyards--and serviced and repaired in American \n     yards.\n       In times of national emergency, the U.S. Merchant Marine is \n     the first to enter the war zone to deliver supplies. \n     America's military depends on the ability to project its \n     power anywhere in the world.\n       That means we need sealift which is capable of quickly \n     transporting fuel and supplies across thousands of miles.\n       As we learned in Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, \n     U.S.-flag ships, American seafarers employed on those ships, \n     and the American shipyard workers that build the vessels, are \n     vital parts of our sealift capability.\n       Opening ANWR to development also will enable our U.S.-flag \n     Merchant Marine to grow and help expand our shipyard \n     industrial base--both of which serve valuable military \n     purposes.\n       We've shown that opening ANWR will be done in a \n     responsible, environmentally sound way.\n       Since the opening of Alaska's North Slope, nature and \n     development have safely co-existed. And today's technology \n     makes it possible to produce oil in a less-invasive and more \n     environmentally friendly manner.\n       The Maritime Trades Department stands with the Building \n     Trades, major oil producers, the business community and all \n     the members of JobPower in calling on Congress to open ANWR.\n       America will benefit for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/28/senate-section/article/S3049-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3049-S3050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROWLAND EVANS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today in our Nation's Capital funeral \nservices were held for Rowland Evans, a lifetime journalist of \ninternational acclaim. This magnificently conducted service, attend by \nan extraordinary gathering of family, friends, and peers, preserved \nforever the man's extraordinary love of family, journalism, and service \nto country in the uniform of the U.S. Marines in combat operations in \nthe Pacific during World War II.\n  The Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Jones, officiated in \npresenting the American Flag to the family to conclude this deeply \nmoving service.\n  Rowland Evans was an astute observer of the values of our federal \nsystem of government, but his great fascination was with the political \narena--the centerpiece being those who competed for and won or lost \nelective offices.\n  His partner--his close friend--for over a quarter of a century, \nRobert Novak, rose to the challenge of chronicling with sensitivity, \nhumor and insight his many lifetime achievements.\n  Senator Kennedy, Senator Snowe, and I were privileged to be in \nattendance at the services at Christ's Church, Georgetown. We join in \nasking unanimous consent to have printed in today's Record the \nproceedings of the U.S. Senate, a complex institution, which Rowland \nEvans keenly understood, the eulogy by Robert Novak.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Eulogy by Mr. Robert Novak\n\n       Having spend his life in journalism writing thousands of \n     columns and literally millions of words, Rowland Evans well \n     knew how hard it was to get things exactly right. So it was \n     with his well-meaning obituaries last Saturday.\n       The AP report said he had been in poor health for years. In \n     truth, until diagnosed with cancer last summer, it could be \n     said he was the healthiest 79-year-old on the planet. Even \n     for the past nine months, he was no invalid.\n       His oncologist said he had never quite seen a cancer \n     patient like Rowly Evans. Two weeks before he died he was \n     playing squash, appearing on television, climbing the \n     mountain at his place in Culpepper, even making a deal to \n     finally achieve his long-time desire to buy the top of the \n     mountain and complete ownership of it. As he entered the \n     hospital with two days of life remaining and the bleak \n     options were laid before him, he interrupted the doctor to \n     talk about his chances\n\n[[Page S3050]]\n\n     for presiding over the Evans-Novak political forum next week.\n       The headline in the New York Times called him a \n     conservative columnist. I guess he did end up as pretty \n     conservative--this friend and ardent admirer of Jack and \n     Robert Kennedy, the son of a liberal Democratic family on the \n     conservative Philadelphia mainline who, at the behest of his \n     New Deal father, delivered a speech--in Marine uniform--for \n     Franklin Roosevelt in 1944.\n       When Kay Winton told her liberal father she had fallen in \n     love with Rowly, she concluded by saying: and, daddy, he's a \n     liberal! Nearly half a century later, her husband was singing \n     the praises of Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich.\n       Still I can think of words more descriptive of the whole \n     man than conservative: reporter, patriot, mentor, competitor, \n     even--and here using a description by his wife of 51 years--\n     rascal.\n       He rejoiced in his rascality and loved to talk about it. \n     About the time as Marine recruit at Parris Island, when he \n     spotted an old buddy from the Kent School who was a Marine \n     lieutenant. They decided to have a drink together, but where \n     could an officer and an enlisted man go together? To go to \n     the Officers Club, his friend dressed Rowly as an officer. \n     All went well until Rowly spotted how own commanding officer \n     at the bar. They tiptoed out to prevent their Marine careers \n     from ending in court martial.\n       Most of us know the story of how Rowly, the lowest of the \n     low in the Washington Bureau of the Associated Press, posted \n     as bureau chief to interview Katherine for a job--at 8 \n     o'clock in the evening, no less.\n       And Rowly said the crowning achievement of his life came \n     just a few years ago when he and his friend Woody Redmond \n     skated the frozen Potomac River before being halted--and \n     nearly arrested--by police.\n       The skating incident also reflected one of the fiercest \n     competitive spirits any of us have ever seen--playing \n     competitive ice hockey until he was 40, winning squash \n     tournament after squash tournament at the Metropolitan Club \n     into his 70's and ranked nationally among senior squash \n     players, playing tennis or bridge or poker, shooting dice \n     with friends for lunch at the Metropolitan Club, just trying \n     to drive from Georgetown to Culpepper without hitting a \n     stoplight. He could recite nearly every shot of the semifinal \n     match in the National Father-and Son Tennis Tournament when \n     he was 14 years old.\n       He was a happy warrior, a delight at any dinner party, \n     playing the piano, stirring up trouble. But beneath these \n     high spirits burned the heart of a patriot--the Yale freshman \n     who stood in line on December 8, 1941 to enlist in the Marine \n     Corps, exchanging the privileged life he had always known for \n     combat at Guadalcanal.\n       His fierce passion for the security of his country was the \n     prism through which all his journalism passed. It guided his \n     greatest journalistic achievements--his expose of Soviet arms \n     control cheating in the 1970's that the U.S. Government \n     sought to hide, his informed forecasts of the fall of the \n     communist empire in Czechoslovakia and Poland.\n       That passion embroiled Rowly in controversy when he refused \n     to accept the Government cover-up of the bombing of the \n     U.S.S. Liberty in the Six-day War. He could not let the \n     reasons for the death of fellow Americans serving their \n     country go unnoticed.\n       Rowland Evans was no deskbound columnist. In the tradition \n     of his great friends the Alsop brothers, he went everywhere--\n     and anywhere--for a story: China, Southeast Asia, all over \n     Eastern Europe, the Mideast, the Indian subcontinent. He \n     skirted death in incidents in Vietnam and the Six-day War. He \n     could not report on the independence movement in the Baltics \n     without actually going to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. When \n     his father died, Rowly was reporting in Iraq--awaiting a rare \n     interview with Saddam Hussein. He flew to Philadelphia for \n     the funeral, then back to Baghdad--and that interview with \n     the Iraqi dictator.\n       But the heart of his reporting was here in Washington. His \n     sources were legion: the mighty of Washington and obscure \n     staffers, CIA spooks and mysterious emigres. All were \n     interrogated in the dining room of the Metropolitan Club.\n       In the last week, I have been contacted by so many younger \n     people in the news business who told me how Rowly counseled \n     them, gave them a helping hand. His was what Stew Alsop \n     called the reporter's trade and he sought to pass it along to \n     a new generation.\n       If I may close with a strictly personal note. On the \n     morning of Monday, December 17, 1963, returning to the \n     Washington Bureau of the Wall Street Journal after my \n     honeymoon, I found a batch of notes from a reporter form the \n     New York Herald-Tribune whom I barely knew: Rowland Evans. \n     When I called him, he asked me for lunch--not at the \n     Metropolitan Club by the way but at Blackie's House of Beef. \n     It was a lunch that changed my life and made my career.\n       The upshot was the Evans-Novak column which lasted for 30 \n     years until his retirement and a partnership of 38 years that \n     continued in television and our newsletter. We had a thousand \n     shouting arguments, often at the top of our voices. We never \n     fought about money, hardly ever about ideology but frequently \n     about what story to tell and how to tell it.\n       Rowland Evans was the life of every party, but he ceased \n     being a society boy long ago in the crucible of combat as a \n     Marine sergeant in the Solomon Islands. He was a tough \n     Marine, an unabashed patriot, a great journalist and a \n     faithful friend and colleague. Rest in peace, Rowly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/28/senate-section/article/S3050-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3050-S3051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CHAMPVA FOR LIFE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to be the author of the \nCHAMPVA for Life Act of 2001.\n  Last year, Congress finally enacted legislation to restore the \npromise of providing lifetime health care to our military retirees. \nTRICARE for Life, as it is known, is long overdue. However, an equally \nworthy group has been left out of the reform.\n  The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, CHAMPVA, provides health care coverage to several categories \nof individuals who have paid dearly for that right: dependents of \nveterans who have been rated by VA as having a total and permanent \ndisability; survivors of veterans who died from VA-rated service-\nconnected conditions; and survivors of servicemembers who died in the \nline of duty. As such, CHAMPVA provides a measure of security to a \ngroup of persons who have indisputably given a great deal to our \ncountry.\n  CHAMPVA is intended to serve as a safety net for dependents and \nsurvivors of severely disabled veterans who, because of their \ndisabilities, were unable to provide health insurance benefits to their \nfamilies through employment. The safety net mission of CHAMPVA has not \nchanged, but this law must change, since under current law, CHAMPVA \nbeneficiaries lose their eligibility for coverage when they turn 65.\n  The TRICARE for Life law passed last year specifically allows \nmilitary retirees and their dependents to remain in the TRICARE program \nafter they turn age 65, as long as they are enrolled with Part B of \nMedicare. TRICARE will cover those expenses not covered under Medicare. \nIt also provides for retail and mail-order pharmaceutical coverage for \nMedicare-eligible military retirees.\n  There is no doubt that TRICARE and CHAMPVA beneficiaries should \nretain similar eligibility for health care coverage. What TRICARE does \nfor the families of military retirees should be no less readily \navailable to the survivors and dependents of severely disabled veterans \nand those service-members who died in the line of duty. Simple justice \nand equity demand this. Just last week, I received a letter from a \nconstituent from Nutter Fort, WV, that hammered home this very point. \nShe asked in her letter, ``Why aren't the CHAMPVA beneficiaries offered \nthe same program recently approved for those on TRICARE who are now \neligible for Medicare?''\n  Indeed, title 38 of the United States Code reflects this view by \nrequiring the Secretary to provide medical care ``in the same or \nsimilar manner and subject to the same or similar limitations as \nmedical care furnished to certain dependents and survivors of active \nduty and retired members of the Armed Forces.'' And up until enactment \nof the new, highly valued TRICARE for Life provisions just last fall, \nthe two programs were, indeed, similar.\n  An argument could be made that since TRICARE was modified to remove \nthe limitation on eligibility, legislation is not necessary to equate \nthe two programs. However, VA has not yet embraced CHAMPVA for Life.\n  The bill simply clarifies that the CHAMPVA and TRICARE programs \nshould continue to operate in a similar manner, with similar \neligibility. This would mean that Medicare-eligible CHAMPVA \nbeneficiaries who enroll in Part B of Medicare would retain secondary \nCHAMPVA coverage, and beneficiaries would receive the same pharmacy \nbenefit as CHAMPVA beneficiaries who are under age 65.\n  The failure of Congress to enact prescription drug coverage under \nMedicare only underscores the need to enact this CHAMPVA reform. \nHowever serious a gap it was for Medicare to lack prescription drug \nbenefit in 1965, incredible advances in drug therapy, combined with \nstaggering inflation in prescription drug costs, have made the need for \naffordable prescription drug coverage even more important today. \nCHAMPVA beneficiaries who have sacrificed so much already should not be \nforced to sacrifice anything more to purchase needed prescription \ndrugs.\n  Nothing brings this closer to home for me than another letter I \nreceived\n\n[[Page S3051]]\n\nrecently, this one from a Korean War veteran and his wife in Alderson, \nWV. They were upset to learn that when the wife turned 65, she lost all \nof her CHAMPVA benefits. As a result, she was forced to pay more than \n$300 per month for her diabetes and heart medications, in addition to \nall the other new costs for care not covered by Medicare. With Social \nSecurity and disability compensation as their only income, this couple \nis struggling to absorb this enormous new expense in their modest \nbudget. The husband, a 100-percent disabled veteran, wrote poignantly \nto me, ``. . . it would help us out so much if CHAMPVA would continue \nto cover my wife's medical care.''\n  In closing, I thank the Gold Star Wives Association for their \ndedication and for bringing this issue to my attention. We must never \nforget that the costs of military service are borne not only by the \nservicemember alone, but by their families as well.\n  I hope the Committee on Veterans' Affairs will expedite passage of \nthis bill out of committee. CHAMPVA beneficiaries are depending upon \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/28/senate-section/article/S3051-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the \nresidents of Armada and the Armada Free Public Library on the occasion \nof its one-hundredth anniversary. Residents in my home State of \nMichigan will be gathering this Sunday, April 1, 2001 to celebrate this \nimportant milestone.\n  The Armada Free Public Library is a dynamic community institution, \nwith a proud tradition of serving the needs of all residents of the \ngrowing community in which it is located. This commitment to community \nservice is manifested in the library's efforts to provide access to \nover 25,000 books and many periodicals, as well as access the World \nWide Web. In addition, the Armada Free Public Library serves as a \nbarrier-free gathering place for community and civic groups.\n  The Armada Free Public Library was established on April 1, 1901. It \nwas on this day that village residents approved a mill tax to fund the \nlibrary by a resounding vote of 144 to 48. The library opened on August \n10th of the same year with 87 books on its shelves.\n  In the ensuing years, the library grew from these humble origins to \ncontinue serving the needs of area residents. In particular, the early \nlibrary emphasized its ability to serve as a meeting place for \nconferences, clubs and children located in this bustling farming \ncommunity. Given its central role in the community, it is only natural \nthat as Armada grew the Free Public Library needed to grow with it. \nWere it not for the efforts of philanthropists and concerned voters, \nthe Armada Free Public Library may not have reached this historic \nanniversary. A grant provided by the Carnegie's enabled the library to \nmove into a new facility in 1915, and subsequent efforts by local \nvoters and philanthropists, such as the estate of the late Elizabeth \nPomeroy, ensured both the growth of the library and its continued \neconomic viability.\n  Mr. President, I have mentioned only a small portion of the dynamic \nhistory of the Armada Free Public Library and the many ways in which \nthe library has remained committed to this community. I know my \ncolleagues will join me in honoring the Armada Free Public Library for \nits service to the people of Armada and the State of Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/28/senate-section/article/S3051-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF ROSARY HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Rosary High \nSchool's outstanding accomplishments and to congratulate them on their \n40th anniversary and rededication which will take place on April 29, \n2001.\n  Originally Archbishop Joseph Ritter dedicated the building for Rosary \nHigh School in St. Louis on April 29, 1962. Since its first graduating \nclass in 1965, Rosary High school has proudly graduated 8,000 students. \nOver the years its students have done an outstanding job of serving the \nSt. Louis community by completing more than 100 hours of community \nservice per student.\n  Rosary High School continues to maintain an excellent academic record \nwith average ACT scores that are above the state and national norms. \nFifty percent of their graduating class has received scholarships to \ncollege.\n  Rosary High School has excelled in their athletic programs. Over the \npast 40 years they have repeatedly won the State championship in \nsoccer, as well as championships in volleyball and basketball.\n  Rosary High School is an exemplary High School. The School, faculty, \nand students are an asset to the St. Louis community. It is my \nsincerest hope that the next forty years are as successful as the \nlast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/28/senate-section/article/S3051-4", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3051-S3052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PATRICIA MULROY\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a distinguished \nNevadan, a good person and a good friend, Patricia Mulroy. Pat will be \nreceiving the National Jewish Medical and Research Center's \nHumanitarian Award on April 28, 2001.\n  The Humanitarian Award honors people who have made significant civic \nand charitable contributions, people who have chosen to devote their \nlives to making their communities better places to live.\n  Pat first moved to Las Vegas in 1974, and began making her mark \nalmost as soon as she arrived as a young student at the University of \nNevada-Las Vegas by being admitted to Phi Kappa Phi and being listed in \nWho's Who in American Colleges and Universities.\n  After college, Pat began her career in public service by working in \nthe Clark County Manager's Office. She was appointed the county's first \nJustice Court Administrator in 1984, and later was appointed General \nManager of the Las Vegas Valley Water District.\n  Those of us who live in the southwestern United States know how \nimportant, and scarce, water is to our States. Pat took over as General \nManager of the Water District during one of the most difficult periods \nin Southern Nevada's water history, a year when the community began \ngrowing at the rate of 3000 to 5000 resident's per month, a trend which \nhas only increased. In response, in 1991, Pat was appointed the first \nGeneral Manager for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, an agency \ncreated by the state legislature to oversee competing governmental \ninterest in water.\n  Since then, Pat has become known nationally as an expert on water \nissues. She is a member of the American Water Works Association and \ncurrently sits on the Board of Directors of the Association of \nMetropolitan Water Agencies. In 1992 she helped found and was the \noriginal chairman of the Western Urban Water Coalition. She is also a \nmember of the Colorado River Water Users Association and has served on \nits Board of Directors. She serves on the Desert Research Institute \nResearch Foundation Board of Trustees and received the University and \nCommunity College System of Nevada Board of Regents' 1999 Distinguished \nNevadan Award.\n  Those of us who have had the privilege of knowing Pat personally know \nher as more than a public advocate and expert on water issues. We also \nknow her as a loving wife to her husband Robert, a devoted mother of \ntwo children, Ryan and Kelley, and a leader\n\n[[Page S3052]]\n\nwho is active in her church, on her school board, and in her community. \nNobody deserves this award more than Pat.\n  I extend my congratulations to you, and the appreciation of all \nNevadans for your good work on their behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/28/senate-section/article/S3052-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DR. M. GRAHAM CLARK\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I would pay tribute to Dr. M. \nGraham Clark, of Point Lookout, MO, who died earlier this month and \nwill be sadly missed by his family and all of us who were privileged to \nbe counted among his friends.\n  Dr. Clark was a tremendous educator, businessman and community \nleader. He came to what was then known as the School of the Ozarks in \n1946, a high school, as vice-president and became its president in \n1952.\n  On his watch of nearly a half century, the institution grew from a \nhigh school into a junior college and then a four-year college, and was \nbrought into regional accreditation. Dr. Clark was proud, and \ndeservedly so, of the fact that the College was accredited even before \nit issued its first full degree. The school Dr. Clark built was also \nnationally recognized for its adherence to Christian principles and the \nstrong work ethic of its students. He viewed the school as his mission, \nand tirelessly raised funds for its improvement, even when he was well \ninto his eighties.\n  During his more than 50 years of service to College of the Ozarks, \nand to all of Southwest Missouri, Dr. Clark touched millions of \npeople's lives. His leadership will be remembered for generations to \ncome. Those who knew him best know that his commitment and love of the \nCollege was second only to his dedication to his Lord and Savior, and \nto his family.\n  Our culture is quick to glorify the here and now, the ``flash in the \npan'' celebrities, the ``cause'' of the day. By that measure, Clark \nstood apart. While he could no doubt have made a fortune in the for-\nprofit sector, he devoted his considerable intellectual and business \nskills to the work of building a top-notch educational institution. He \nwas a strong Christian who never hid nor apologized for his beliefs. He \nspent his entire life making life better for young people in the Ozark \nregion, his family, his church,and his community. His love for others \nknew no social boundaries. We are in his debt, and remember him \nfondly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/28/senate-section/article/S3052-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/28/senate-section/article/S3052-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive sessions the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/28/senate-section/article/S3052-4", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 801.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Arsenic Standard \n     Reinstatement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in 1996, Congress amended the Safe Drinking Water Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.) to require the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency to revise the standard for \n     arsenic in drinking water;\n       (2) after conducting scientific and economic analyses, the \n     Administrator, on January 22, 2001, promulgated a final rule \n     to reduce the public health risks from arsenic in drinking \n     water by reducing the permissible level of arsenic from 50 \n     parts per billion (.05 milligrams per liter) to 10 parts per \n     billion (.01 milligrams per liter);\n       (3) the new standard would provide additional protection \n     against cancer and other health problems for 13,000,000 \n     people;\n       (4) the National Academy of Sciences has determined that \n     drinking water containing 50 parts per billion of arsenic \n     ``could easily'' result in a 1-in-100 risk of cancer;\n       (5) 50 parts per billion of arsenic causes a cancer risk \n     that is 10,000 times the level of any cancer risk caused by \n     any carcinogen that the Environmental Protection Agency \n     permits to be present in food;\n       (6) 10 parts per billion of arsenic in drinking water is \n     the standard used by the European Union, Japan, and the World \n     Health Organization;\n       (7) public water systems may apply for financial assistance \n     through the drinking water State revolving loan fund under \n     section 1452 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j-\n     12);\n       (8) since 1996, the revolving loan fund program has made \n     $3,600,000,000 available to assist public water systems with \n     projects to improve infrastructure; and\n       (9) on March 20, 2001, Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency proposed to withdrew the pending arsenic \n     standard that was promulgated on January 22, 2001, and due to \n     take effect on March 23, 2001.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) to authorize the establishment \nof individual fishery quota systems; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, together with Senator McCain, \nto introduce the Individual Fishing Quota Act of 2001 which will \naddress one of the most complex policy questions in fisheries \nmanagement, individual fishing quotas, IFQs. This bill will amend the \nMagnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to authorize \nthe establishment of new individual quota systems after October 1, \n2002. Last year, I introduced legislation to reauthorize the Magnuson-\nStevens Act and extend the existing moratorium on new IFQ programs for \nthree years. Congress ultimately extended the moratorium for two years \nthrough fiscal year 2002. The combination of the moratorium extension \nand the IFQ Act of 2001 will provide fishermen and fisheries managers \ntime to prepare for the possibility of using IFQs as a management \noption. This legislation will in no way whatsoever force IFQs upon any \nregional management council. This is not a mandate to use IFQs. Rather, \nit is intended to provide the councils with an additional conservation \nand management tool after the existing moratorium expires.\n  IFQ programs can drastically change the face of fishing communities \nand the fundamental principles of conservation and management. \nTherefore, this legislation needs to be developed in a careful and \nmeaningful manner. Accordingly, introduction of this bill is intended \nto begin the dialogue on the possibility of new IFQ programs. I fully \nanticipate that we will hear from many stakeholders to help the \nSubcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries shape and re-shape this bill as \nnecessary. I look forward to participation by all impacted groups as we \nmove this bill through the legislative process.\n  The IFQ Act of 2001 sets conditions under which fishery management \nplans, FMPs, or plan amendments may establish a new individual fishing \nquota system. The bill ensures that any council which establishes new \nIFQs will promote sustainable management of the fishery; require fair \nand equitable allocation of individual quotas; minimize negative social \nand economic impacts on local coastal communities; ensure adequate \nenforcement of the system; and take into account present participation \nand historical fishing practices of the relevant fishery. Additionally, \nthe bill requires the Secretary of Commerce to conduct referenda to \nensure that those most affected by IFQs will have the opportunity to \nformally approve both the initiation and adoption of any new individual \nfishing quota program.\n  This bill authorizes the potential allocation of individual quotas to \nfishing vessel owners, fisherman and crew members who are citizens of \nthe United States. The legislation does not allow, however, individual \nquotas to be sold, transferred or leased. In addition, participation in \nthe fishery is required for a person to hold quota. Acknowledging the \npossibility that undue hardship may ensure, the bill allows for the \nsuspension of the transferability requirements by the Secretary on an \nindividual case-by-case basis. Moreover, this bill permits councils to \nallocate quota shares to entry-level fisherman, small vessel owners, or \ncrew members who may not otherwise be eligible for individual quotas.\n\n  In 1996, Congress reauthorized the Magnuson-Stevens Act through \nenactment of the Sustainable Fisheries Act, SFA. The SFA contained the \nmost substantial improvements to fisheries conservation since the \noriginal passage of the Magnuson-Stevens Act in 1976. More \nspecifically, the SFA included a five year moratorium on new IFQ \nprograms and required the National Academy of Sciences, NAS, to study \nand report on the issue.\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\n  As a result, the NAS issued a report which contained a number of \nrecommendations to Congress addressing the social, economic, and \nbiological aspects of IFQ programs. The first recommendation was for \nCongress to lift the existing moratorium on new IFQ programs and \nauthorize the councils to design and implement new IFQs. The IFQ Act of \n2001 specifically incorporates certain recommendations of the NAS \nreport and provides councils with the flexibility to adopt additional \nNAS or other recommendations. Mr. President, as with other components \nof fisheries conservation and management, there is no ``one-size-fits-\nall'' solution to IFQ programs. Therefore, this bill sets certain \nconditions under which IFQs may be developed, but at the same time, it \nclearly provides the regional councils and the affected fishermen with \nthe ability to shape any new IFQ program to fit the needs of the \nfishery, if such a program is desired.\n  Over the past one and a half years, the Subcommittee on Oceans and \nFisheries traveled across the country and held six hearings on the \nreauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. We began the process in \nWashington, DC, and then visited fishing communities in Maine, \nLouisiana, Alaska, Washington, and Massachusetts. During the course of \nthose hearings, we heard official testimony from over 70 witnesses and \nreceived statements from many more fishermen during open microphone \nsessions at each field hearing. The Subcommittee heard the comments, \nviews and recommendations of federal and state officials, regional \ncouncil chairmen and members, other fisheries managers, commercial and \nrecreational fishermen, members of the conservation community, and many \nothers interested in these important issues. Additionally, the 26th \nannual Maine Fishermen's Forum held a very informative all-day workshop \non IFQs on March 1, 2001. The IFQ Act of 2001 incorporates many of the \nsuggestions we heard from those men and women who fish for a living and \nthose who are most affected by the law and its regulations.\n  Unfortunately successful fisheries conservation and management seems \nto be the exception and not the rule. The decisions that fishermen, \nregional councils and the Department of Commerce make are complex and \noften depend on less than adequate information. It is incumbent upon \nthe Congress to provide the many interested stakeholders with the \nability to make practical and informed decisions. At a later date, I \nwill introduce additional legislation to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Act \nto address the fundamental problems in fisheries management--a lack of \nfunding, a lack of basic scientific information, and enhanced \nflexibility in the decision-making process. But today, I introduce the \nIFQ Act of 2001 to begin the dialogue on new individual fishing quota \nprograms, the most significant policy question in fisheries management. \nClearly, I do not presume to offer a perfect solution to a complex and \nemotional concept. However, it is my intent to resolve this issue after \nappropriate debate and consideration by the Commerce Committee and the \nU.S. Senate. I look forward to and expect the full participation of \nthose Senators who have expressed interest in this issue in the past \nand those who may be new to the debate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the test of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 637\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthe same capital gain treatment for art and collectibles as for other \ninvestment property and to provide that a deduction equal to fair \nmarket value shall be allowed for charitable contributions of literary, \nmusical, artistic, or scholarly compositions created by the donor; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today is \ndesigned to restore some internal consistency to the Tax Code as it \napplies to art and artists.\n  No one has ever said that the Tax Code is fair even though it has \nalways been a theoretical objective of the code to treat similar \ntaxpayers similarly.\n  The bill I am introducing today would address two areas where \nsimilarly situated taxpayers are not treated the same.\n  Internal inconsistency No. 1 deals with the long term capital gains \ntax treatment of investments in art and collectibles.\n  Internal inconsistency No. 2 deals with the charitable deduction for \nartists donating their work to a museum or other charitable cause. The \nunartistic person wishing to make a charitable contribution of a piece \nof art is entitled to a deduction equal to fair market value of the \nart. An artist, on the other hand, just because he/she is the creator \nof the art, is limited to a deduction equal to the tube of paint, the \npaper, or other art supplies involved. Under this tax treatment few \neligible contributions exceed $19.95 even though the art may be worth \nhundreds or even thousands of dollars. The tax treatment is a \ndisincentive and a blatant unfairness.\n  If a person invests in stocks, or bonds, holds the asset for the \nrequisite period of time, and sells at a gain, the tax treatment is \nlong term capital gains. The top capital gains tax rate is 20 percent, \n18 percent if the asset is held for five or more years. However, if the \nsame person invests in art or collectibles the top rate is hiked up to \n28 percent.\n  Art for art's sake should not incur an additional 40-percent tax bill \nsimply for revenue's sake. That is a big impact on the pocketbook of \nthe beholder.\n  Art and collectibles are alternatives to financial instruments as an \ninvestment choice. To create a tax disadvantage with respect to one \ninvestment compared to another creates an artificial market and may \nlead to poor investment allocations. It also adversely impacts those \nwho make their livelihood in the cultural sectors of the economy.\n  Santa Fe, NM, is the third largest art market in the country. We have \na diverse colony of artists, collectors and gallery owners. We have \nfabulous Native American rug weavers, potters and carvers. Creative \ngiants like Georgia O'Keeffe, Maria Martinez, E.L. Blumenshein, Allan \nHouser, R.C. Gorman, and Glenna Goodacre have all chosen New Mexico as \ntheir home and as their artistic subject.\n  John Nieto, Wilson Hurley, Clark Hulings, Verl Goodnight, Bill \nAcheff, Susan Rothenberg, Bruce Nauman, Agnes Martin, Doug Hyde, \nMargaret Nez, Dan Ostermiller are additional examples of living artists \ncreating art in New Mexico.\n  Art, antiques and collectibles are a $12 to $20 billion annual \nindustry nationwide. In New Mexico, it has been estimated that art and \ncollectible sales range between $500 million and $1 billion a year.\n  Economists have always been interested in the economics of the arts. \nAdam Smith is a well-known economist. He was also a serious, but \nlittle-known essayist on painting, dancing, and poetry. Keynes was a \npassionate devotee of painting.\n  Even the artistically inclined economists found it difficult to \ndefine art within the context of economic theory.\n  When asked to define Jazz, Louis Armstrong replied: ``If you gotta \nask, you ain't never going to know.'' A similar conundrum has \nchallenged Galbraith and other economists who have grappled with the \ndefinitional issues associated with bringing art within the economic \ncalculus.\n  Original art objects are, as a commodity group, characterized by a \nset of attributes:\n  Every unit of output is differentiated from every other unit of \noutput.\n  Art works can be copied but not reproduced.\n  The cultural capital of the nation has significant elements of public \ngood.\n\n[[Page S3057]]\n\n  Because art works can be resold, and their prices may rise over time, \nthey have the characteristics of financial assets, and as such may be \nsought as a hedge against inflation, as a store of wealth or as a \nsource of speculative capital gain.\n  As chairman of the Budget Committee I pride myself on understanding \neconomics, so I reviewed the literature on ``cultural economics'' to \nsee how the markets have treated the muses.\n  Numerous economists have analyzed rates of return on works of art--\nsome studies going back as far as 1635. The more recent the study the \nmore favorable art investments compare with the stock market.\n  New Mexico is not only the third largest art market but it is also \nthe home of a unique company that manages the Metropolitan Fine Arts \nfund which charts the price performance of various categories of \ncollectibles over the past five years. Recently this firm, Lyons and \nHannover, compared the S 500 with different categories of fine art \nand collectibles. Had a person invested in American impressionists like \nCassatt, Hassam, or Sargent he would have beat the S An investment \nin 20th century expressionists like Klee or Nolde did not out perform \nthe S Of the other 16 categories most did almost as well as the S \n500. Furniture, ceramics, cars, photography, wine and weapons were also \nworthwhile investments during the last decade.\n  Lyons and Hannover are not the only ones putting theory into \npractice. Citigroup has created in essence an art mutual fund. \nDeutchsche Bank recently launched its own art fund and others are \nraising money for an ``art investment bank.'' Not to be outdone by the \n``Wall Street suits'' artist Ben McNeill has gone straight to the \npublic. He minted 800 shares in his ``Art Shares'' project at $5 each. \nEach can be redeemed for $10 in 2004, But buyers think they are worth \nmore. They've traded on his Web site for as high as $43.\n  William Goetzmann when he was at the Columbia Business School \nconstructed an art index and concluded that painting price movements \nand stock market fluctuations are correlated. I conclude that with art, \nas well as stocks, past performance is no guarantee of future returns \nbut the gains should be taxed the same.\n  In 1990, the editor of Art and Auction asked the question: ``Is there \nan `efficient' art market?''\n  A well known art dealer answered: ``Definitely not. That's one of the \nthings that make the market so interesting.''\n  For everyone who has been watching world financial markets lately, \nthe art market may be a welcome distraction.\n  Why do people invest in art and collectibles?\n  Art and collectibles are something you can appreciate even if the \ninvestment doesn't appreciate.\n  Art is less volatile. If bouncing bond prices drive you berserk and \nspiraling stock prices scare you silly, art may be the right investment \nfor you.\n  Because art and collectibles are investments, the long term capital \ngains tax treatment should be the same as for stocks and bonds. This \nbill would accomplish that.\n  Artists will benefit. Gallery owners will benefit. Collectors will \nbenefit. And museums benefit from collectors. About 90 percent of what \nwinds up in museums like the New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art \ncomes from collectors.\n  Collecting isn't just for the hoyty toity. It seems that everyone \ncollects something. Some collections are better investments than \nothers. Some collections are just bizarre. The internet makes \ncollecting big business.\n  The flea market fanatics are also avid collectors. In fact, people \ncollect the darndest things. Books, duck decoys, Audubon prints, chai \npets, snowglobes, thimbles, handcuffs, spectacles, baseball cards, and \ncaps, guns and dolls.\n  This bill could be called the ``Fine art, furniture, figurines, coins \nand stamps, china and pottery, silver, cast iron and brass wares, \nbeanie babies, rugs, quilts, and other textiles, architectural columns, \nglassware, jewelry, lamps, military memorabilia, toys, dolls, trains, \nentertainment memorabilia, political memorabilia, books, maps, antique \nhardware, clocks and watches'' Capital Gains Parity Act and I still \nwould not have accurately captured the full scope of the bill.\n  For most of these collections, capital gains isn't really an issue, \nbut you never know. Antique Roadshow is one of the most popular shows \non TV. Everyone knows the story about the women who bought the card \ntable at a yard sale for $25. It turned out to be the work of a Boston \ncabinet maker circa 1797. It later sold at Sotheby's for $490,000.\n  Like the women on Antique Roadshow, you could be creating a sizeable \ntaxable asset if you decide to sell your art or collectible collection. \nYou may find that your collecting passion has created a tax \npredicament--to phrase it politely. Art and collectibles are tangible \nassets. When you sell them, capital gains tax is due on any \nappreciation over your purchase price.\n  The bill provides capital gains tax parity because it lowers the top \ncapital gains rate from 28 percent to 20 percent, 18 percent if the \nasset has been held for five or more years.\n  The second area where people similarly situated are not treated \nsimilarly in the tax code deals with charitable contributions. When \nsomeone is asked to make a charitable contribution to a museum or to a \nfund raising auction it shouldn't, but under current law does, matter \nwhether you are an artist or not.\n\n  Under current law an artist/creator can only take a deduction equal \nto the cost of the art supplies.\n  The bill I am introducing with Senators Leahy and Bennett will allow \na fair market deduction for the artist. It includes certain safeguards \nto keep the artist from ``painting himself a tax deduction.''\n  This bill applies to literary, musical, artistic, and scholarly \ncompositions if the work was created at least 18 months before the \ndonation was made, has been appraised, and is related to the purpose or \nfunction of the charitable organization receiving the donation.\n  As with other charitable contributions it is limited to 50 percent of \nadjusted gross income, AGI.

A bill to amend section 842 of title 18, United States Code, \nrelating to explosive materials; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Explosives Protection Act.'' I do this in memory of the tragic \nbombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, because I hope that \nthis bill will, in some small way, prevent future bombings--whether by \nterrorists of symbolic targets, malcontents of random ones, or even \nspouses involved in marital disputes.\n  This bill, while not directly related to the circumstances in \nOklahoma City, is a first step towards protecting the American people \nfrom those who would use explosives to do them harm.\n  Not many people realize just how few restrictions on the use and sale \nof explosives really exist. While we have increasingly restricted the \nnumber of people who can obtain and use a firearm, we have been lax in \nextending these prohibitions to explosives.\n  For instance, while we prohibit illegal aliens from obtaining a gun, \nwe allow them to obtain explosives without restriction. And this same \ndivergence applies to those who have been dishonorably discharged from \nthe armed forces, those who have renounced U.S. citizenship, people who \nhave acted in such a way as to have restraining orders issued against \nthem, and those with domestic violence convictions. Each of these \ncategories of persons are prohibited from obtaining firearms, but face \nno such prohibition on obtaining explosive material.\n  Congress has already made the determination that certain members of \nsociety should not have access to firearms, and the same logic clearly \napplies to dangerous and destructive explosive materials, materials \nwhich can result in an equal or even greater loss of life. It is time \nto bring the explosives law into line with gun laws, and this is all my \nbill does. Specifically, the extend the list of persons barred from \npurchasing explosives so that it matched that of people barred from \npurchasing firearms.\n  This is a simple bill meant only to correct longstanding gaps and \nloopholes in current law. I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and \nI hope we can quickly move to get this passed and protect Americans \nfrom future acts of explosive destruction. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 641\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part Q of title I of the Omnibus Crime \nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to provide assistance for \nunincorporated neighborhood watch programs; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Neighborhood Watch Partnership Act.'' This bill will broaden the \neligibility of groups that may apply for essential funding for \nneighborhood watch activities.\n  Communities across the country are finding sensible ways to solve \nlocal problems. Through partnerships with local police, neighborhood \nwatch groups are having a decisive impact on crime. There are almost \n20,000 such groups creating innovative programs that promote community \ninvolvement in crime prevention techniques. They empower community \nmembers and organize them against rape, burglary, and all forms of fear \non the street. They forge bonds between law enforcement and the \ncommunities they serve.\n  Unfortunately, many communities find it difficult to afford the often \nexpensive equipment such as cellphones and CBs needed to start a \nneighborhood watch organization. While the COPS program within the \nDepartment of Justice provides funding for some neighborhood watch \ngroups, an organization must incorporate to benefit from the current \nprogram. A mere 2000 of the nearly 20,000 groups incorporate, however, \nmeaning that the vast majority of watch groups cannot apply for funding \nassistance. This makes very little sense.\n  The time has come to make a clear commitment to these groups. That is \nwhy I am introducing a bill to extend COPS funding to unincorporated \nneighborhood watch organizations. The bill would provide grants of up \nto $1950 to these groups. Under current law, either the local police \nchief or sheriff must approve grant requests by unincorporated watch \ngroups. We would impose the same requirement on unincorporated groups, \nthus providing accountability for the disbursement of funds.\n  Neighborhood watch organizations provide an invaluable service. By \nextending the partnership between community policing and watch group \norganizations, we will boldly encourage small and large communities to \npreserve and create crime prevention tools. We should act now, Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 642\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to implement the agreement establishing a United \nStates-Jordan free trade area; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nimplement the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement.\n  I introduce this legislation on behalf of myself and Senators Kerry, \nLandrieu, Inouye, Torricelli, Daschle, Leahy, Bingaman, Wyden, and \nLieberman. The same legislation is today being introduced by colleagues \nin the other body.\n  The United States-Jordan FTA was signed on October 26, 2000 and \nformally submitted to Congress on January 6.\n  For a variety of reasons, it is one of the most significant trade \nachievements in recent years.\n  Simply put, the United States-Jordan FTA is a strong trade agreement. \nIt eliminates barriers to trade on goods and services across the board.\n  The agreement is very much on a par with the FTA with Canada and \nMexico; the specific provisions of the agreement mirror the United \nStates-Israel FTA and the related understanding with the Palestinian \nAuthority.\n\n[[Page S3060]]\n\n  Although the volume of trade involved is not likely to have much \nimpact on the United States, it should be a significant boon to \nJordan--and that does benefit the United States.\n  Jordan has become one of the United States' best allies in the Middle \nEast. Demonstrating considerable courage and leadership, Jordan has \nmade peace with Israel and cooperated with the United States on a \nnumber of diplomatic fronts.\n  As the majority leader Senator Lott wrote in a letter to the \nPresident on March 8 urging approval of the agreement:\n\n       Jordan has been a reliable partner of the United States and \n     has played an important role in America's efforts to achieve \n     a lasting peace in the Middle East. The United States -Jordan \n     Free Trade Agreement is an important and timely symbol of \n     this critical relationship.\n\n  I strongly agree with Senator Lott. I am normally skeptical of using \ngeopolitical rationales to change U.S. trade policy, but in this case \nthe right geopolitical outcome is also the right trade policy outcome.\n  Most of the controversy surrounding the United States-Jordan FTA \nfocuses on provisions of the agreement regarding the environment and \nlabor.\n  Without question, these are significant provisions. They address \nlabor rights and environmental issues in the core of the agreement and \nmake the issues subject to dispute settlement like all other provisions \nof the agreement.\n  That said, the provisions simply obligate both countries to enforce \ntheir current labor and environmental laws and not weaken their laws \nwith the aim of distorting trade.\n  Any objective reading of the provisions makes it clear that critics' \nfears of private parties litigating under these portions of the \nagreement or attacking U.S. environmental laws are simply unfounded.\n  The agreement is clearly a government-to-government agreement; \nprivate parties cannot trigger dispute settlement proceedings. I \nbelieve there is little chance of the United States actually weakening \nits environmental laws, but it is certainly not going to take such a \nstep with the aim of distorting trade with Jordan.\n  Given Jordan's strong position on labor rights and environmental \nissues and the consultative process of the dispute settlement in the \nagreement, it is quite unlikely these provisions will ever result in \nthe imposition of trade sanctions--the stated fear of the critics.\n  In fact, in the decade and a half it has been in place, the United \nStates-Israel FTA dispute settlement procedures, the model for the \nJordan FTA, have only been invoked once and, even in that case, \nsanctions were never imposed.\n  I suspect the real fear of critics is that the Jordan agreement will \nset a precedent for inclusion of labor and environmental provisions in \nfuture trade agreements. I understand that. That precedent, however, \nhas already been set. Both the world trading system--now represented by \nthe World Trade Organization--and the North American Free Trade \nAgreement, NAFTA, address labor and environmental issues.\n  In my opinion, all future trade agreements must meaningfully address \nlabor and environmental issues to win congressional approval.\n  Further, the United States-Jordan FTA has already been negotiated, \nand it has been signed. Even if it was not ultimately approved by the \nCongress, the precedent has already been set with an approved and \nsigned agreement. The bell cannot be unrung.\n  There is a more serious precedent at stake.\n  When President Clinton took office in 1993, I urged him to support \nthe NAFTA agreement struck by his predecessor in the White House \nwithout renegotiation. I did this not because the NAFTA was a perfect \nagreement, it was not. It needed improvement. But certainly there were \ncertain areas where improvement was possible.\n  I supported it, and I told the President so because it is vital for \nthere to be continuity in trade policy, I might add, also in foreign \npolicy. Reopening negotiations on an agreement that is already signed \nto address what can only be called a partisan concern threatens the \ncredibility of U.S. trade policy.\n  Scuttling or renegotiating the United States-Jordan FTA also sets a \nprecedent for any new administration to undo the agreements negotiated \nby its predecessor. This would destroy any possibility of bipartisan \ntrade policy and discourage our trading partners from negotiating \nseriously with the United States. We simply cannot afford to allow this \nkind of partisan chicanery to overwhelm good trade policy.\n  I introduce this implementing legislation for the United States-\nJordan FTA in the hopes it can be rapidly passed and signed into law.\n  This is a good agreement. The United States-Jordan FTA advances U.S. \ntrade policy as well as Middle East policy. It has wide support from \nlabor and environmental groups, as well as from business leaders. The \nUnited States-Jordan FTA can go far to build a consensus on trade \npolicy. It is very important.\n  Aside from the concerns over the labor and environmental provisions \nwhich I have already addressed, no one has raised serious objections to \nthis agreement.\n  With Jordan's King Abdullah visiting the United States next week, the \nCongress and the administration should move together to approve the \nUnited States-Jordan FTA.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the bill in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 643\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 11. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to require two-thirds majorities for \nbills increasing taxes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nto amend the Constitution of the United States, requiring a two-thirds \nmajority vote of both houses of Congress to levy a new tax or increase \nthe rate of an existing tax.\n  I call this the tax limitation amendment, and I am proud to be joined \nin this effort by Senators Gramm of Texas, Kyl, Inhofe, Shelby, Smith \nof New Hampshire, Fitzgerald, Crapo, Hagel, and Helms.\n  In 1997, Congress balanced its checkbook for the first time in 29 \nyears, and we are now enjoying an era of unprecedented budget \nsurpluses.\n  Unfortunately, the tax burden on the American people is also rising \nto unprecedented levels. Today, federal tax revenues make up 20.6 \npercent of our nation's Gross Domestic Product, GDP, up from 17.6 \npercent in 1993.\n  This has had an enormous impact on our economy, and it has placed an \nunfair burden on the average taxpayer.\n  It is also clear the American people are frustrated with the \nincreasing amount of government spending, and they are tired of the \nfederal government reaching further into their wallets to pay for new \nspending and new programs.\n  Today, it is far too easy for Congress to go on a spending spree and \nthen send the bill to the taxpayers.\n  This amendment is important for many reasons, but most importantly, \nit will help restore fiscal responsibility and discipline in our budget \nprocess.\n  We need to make it more difficult for Congress to raise taxes, which \nwill put more pressure on us to control spending.\n  This resolution has been supported by a number of taxpayer groups \nincluding the Americans for Tax Reform, the Citizens Against Government \nWaste, the American Conservative Union, and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce. It has enjoyed broad support in previous years, and I would \nlike to invite other Senators to join me in this effort and cosponsor \nthis resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the resolution be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 11\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as \n     part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States within 7 years after the \n     date of its submission for ratification:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``Section 1. Any bill to levy a new tax or increase the \n     rate or base of any tax may pass only by a two-thirds \n     majority of the whole number of each House of Congress.\n       ``Section 2. The Congress may waive section 1 when a \n     declaration of war is in effect. The Congress may also waive \n     section 1 when the United States is engaged in military \n     conflict which causes an imminent and serious threat to \n     national security and is so declared by a joint resolution, \n     adopted by a majority of the whole number of each House, \n     which becomes law. Any provision of law which would, standing \n     alone, be subject to section 1 but for this section and which \n     becomes law pursuant to such a waiver shall be effective for \n     not longer than 2 years.\n       ``Section 3. All votes taken by the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate under this article shall be \n     determined by yeas and nays and the names of persons voting \n     for and against shall be entered on the Journal of each House \n     respectively.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire:\n  S.J. Res. 12. A joint resolution granting the consent of Congress to \nthe International Emergency Management Assistance Memorandum of \nUnderstanding; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 12\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The compact is substantially as follows:\n\n     ``Article I--International Emergency Management Assistance \n       Memorandum of Understanding Purpose and Authorities\n\n       ``The International Emergency Management Assistance \n     Memorandum of Understanding, hereinafter referred to as the \n     `compact,' is made and entered into by and among such of the \n     jurisdictions as shall enact or adopt this compact, \n     hereinafter referred to as `party jurisdictions.' For the \n     purposes of this agreement, the term `jurisdictions' may \n     include any or all of the States of Maine, New Hampshire, \n     Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut and the \n     Provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, \n     Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, and such other states and \n     provinces as may hereafter become a party to this compact.\n       ``The purpose of this compact is to provide for the \n     possibility of mutual assistance among the jurisdictions \n     entering into this compact in managing any emergency or \n     disaster when the affected jurisdiction or jurisdictions ask \n     for assistance, whether arising from natural disaster, \n     technological hazard, manmade disaster or civil emergency \n     aspects of resources shortages.\n       ``This compact also provides for the process of planning \n     mechanisms among the agencies responsible and for mutual \n     cooperation, including, if need be, emergency-related \n     exercises, testing, or other training activities using \n     equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect \n     of the giving and receiving of aid by party jurisdictions or \n     subdivisions of party jurisdictions during emergencies, with \n     such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency \n     periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the \n     use of emergency forces by mutual agreement among party \n     jurisdictions.\n\n     ``Article II--General Implementation\n\n       ``Each party jurisdiction entering into this compact \n     recognizes that many emergencies may exceed the capabilities \n     of a party jurisdiction and that intergovernmental \n     cooperation is essential in such circumstances. Each \n     jurisdiction further recognizes that there will be \n     emergencies that may require immediate access and present \n     procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and \n     effective response to such an emergency because few, if any, \n     individual jurisdictions have all the resources they need in \n     all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering \n     resources to areas where emergencies exist.\n       ``The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources \n     of the participating jurisdictions, including any resources \n     on hand or available from any other source that are essential \n     to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event \n     of any emergency or disaster, shall be the underlying \n     principle on which all articles of this compact are \n     understood.\n       ``On behalf of the party jurisdictions participating in the \n     compact, the legally designated official who is assigned \n     responsibility for emergency management is responsible for \n     formulation of the appropriate inter-jurisdictional mutual \n     aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact, \n     and for recommendations to the jurisdiction concerned with \n     respect to the amendment of any statutes, regulations, or \n     ordinances required for that purpose.\n\n     ``Article III--Party Jurisdiction Responsibilities\n\n       ``(a) Formulate Plans and Programs.--It is the \n     responsibility of each party jurisdiction to formulate \n     procedural plans and programs for inter-jurisdictional \n     cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed \n     in this section.
