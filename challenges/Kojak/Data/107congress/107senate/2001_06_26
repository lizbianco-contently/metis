The Senator from Arkansas.\n  I shall take the privilege of the Chair and say that was an \nespecially moving invocation this morning.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada and all of my colleagues for the \nopportunity to share with you all this morning a very special \nindividual in my life. I have been very blessed to grow up in a very \nclose-knit family of supportive and encouraging people. My uncle, the \nReverend Lawson Anderson, is just one of those wonderful people. I grew \nup within walking distance of both sets of my grandparents, and on hot \nsummer days I would walk over to his mother's home and in the cool of \nhis house play the organ that she practiced as she was the organist for \nour church.\n  One of the most wonderful stories and I think lessons I have learned \nfrom my Uncle Lawson I would like to share with my colleagues. He did \nnot get started in ministry. His degree is in forestry. He began as a \nforester. He then went into banking and figured out, in order to really \nmake it through life, he needed the wisdom and the courage that came \nfrom the ministry, which he joined later in life. He did say, however, \nthat one of the best lessons he learned was not necessarily from the \nministry but from his time in the forest industry.\n  He talked about dealing with problems in life, and he said one of the \nbest lessons he learned as a forester was when he was very young and \nwas presented with a forest fire, a difficult problem. He was beating \nat that fire with a shovel, and one of the older members of the \nforestry team came up to him and said: What are you doing? He said: I \nam putting this fire out; I'm putting it out. And the wise forester, \nwho was beyond I guess his years in wisdom, looked at Uncle Lawson and \nsaid: That is not how you conquer a problem. The way you conquer a \nproblem and, more importantly, a forest fire is you walk around it; you \napproach it from the front; you evaluate the circumstances: Which way \nis the wind blowing? What kind of moisture is there in the area? And \nthen you dig a hole all the way around so that you encircle your \nproblem and you actually take care of the whole thing. You do not just \nbeat at it, but you make sure you get in front of your problems, you \nassess the situation, and you face them head on.\n  I am honored and privileged to serve the people of our great State of \nArkansas. It has been something that has certainly been incredible in \nmy life. But when I am able to bring to the Senate and share with these \nindividuals, these incredible individuals with whom I serve in this \ngreat body, someone who has been a major part of shaping my life and \nmolding me into the person that I am, it is, indeed, my\n\n[[Page S6870]]\n\nhonor and privilege to do that and to have him with us today.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/26/senate-section/article/S6870-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. 1052 which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1052) to amend the Public Health Service Act and \n     the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to \n     protect consumers in managed care plans and other health \n     coverage.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Frist (for Grassley) motion to commit to the Committee on \n     Finance and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions with instructions to report back not later than that \n     date that is 14 days after the date on which this motion is \n     adopted.\n       Gramm amendment No. 810, to exempt employers from certain \n     causes of action.\n       Edwards (for McCain/Edwards) amendment No. 812, to express \n     the sense of the Senate with regard to the selection of \n     independent review organizations.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 2 hours of debate in relation to the Grassley motion to \ncommit and the Gramm amendment No. 810, the time to be equally divided \nin the usual form.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I just want to make a brief statement on \nbehalf of Majority Leader Daschle. As has been indicated, the \nresumption of the Patients' Bill of Rights will be the order at hand \ntoday. As has been announced, there will be approximately 2 hours of \nclosing debate in relation to the Grassley motion to commit--and I \nunderstand he wants to modify his motion.\n  I ask Senator Grassley, it is my understanding the Senator wants to \nmodify his motion to commit; is that right?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. We would not object--and with respect to the Gramm \namendment regarding employers. That debate will be ended shortly. There \nwill be two rollcall votes at 11:30 a.m.\n  I met with Senator Daschle early this morning, and he has indicated \nthat without any question we are going to finish the Patients' Bill of \nRights before the Fourth of July break.\n  Now, I would say to everyone within the sound of my voice, I believe \nwe have been on this bill a week. I think we have fairly well defined \nwhat the issues are, and I think it would be in everyone's best \ninterests if today we would decide what those issues are and have \namendments offered. If people want time agreements, fine. If they do \nnot, debate them, complete what they want to say, and move on. Everyone \nhas many things to do during the Fourth of July break. But this is \nimportant. This bill has been around for 5 years, and we are going to \ncomplete consideration of this legislation.\n  There is also a need to complete the supplemental appropriations \nbill. As I have indicated before, I think Senator Byrd and Senator \nStevens have done an excellent job in moving that bill along and I \nthink we can do that very quickly. But there are going to be late \nnights tonight, tomorrow, and Thursday. We are going to do our best to \nmake sure everyone is heard, but also in consideration of other \npeople's schedules, we will do our best to complete action on this \nlegislation as quickly as possible.\n  I see Senator Gregg, the ranking manager of the bill, is here. I did \nnot see him earlier.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Enzi be added as a cosponsor of the Gramm amendment which is \npending.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I hope you will call on the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nvote on the Grassley amendment, each side have a total of 3 minutes to \nsummarize the arguments on the amendment excluding employers from \nliability.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                     Motion to Commit, as Modified\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I speak on my motion, I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending motion to commit be modified to \nreflect the referral of the bill jointly to the Committee on the \nJudiciary and the same 14-day timeframe that affects the Finance \nCommittee and the HELP Committee also apply to the Judiciary Committee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The motion to commit, as modified, is as follows:\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n       Mr. Grassley moves to commit the bill S. 1052, as amended, \n     to the Committee on Finance, the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions, and the Committee on the \n     Judiciary with instructions to report the same back to the \n     Senate not later than that date that is 14 (fourteen) days \n     after the date on which this motion is adopted.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the majority for permission to \nmodify my motion.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of my motion to commit the \nKennedy-McCain bill to the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, \nJudiciary, and Finance Committees with instructions that these \ncommittees report the bill out in 14 days.\n  On a preliminary note, I thank the good counsel of Senators Thompson \nand Hatch. Yesterday, they reminded me that the Kennedy-McCain bill \nalso includes a series of provisions on liability that fall under \nJudiciary's jurisdiction and have never been reviewed by that committee \neither. Thus, I have modified my motion to include the Judiciary \nCommittee along with the HELP and Finance Committees.\n  I am deeply troubled that the Kennedy-McCain bill has bypassed the \nrelevant committees and has been brought directly to the floor--without \none hearing, without one markup, and without public input into this \nparticular bill.\n  As I made very clear on the floor yesterday, I strongly believe that \npatient protections are critical to every hard-working American who \nrelies on the managed care system. We need a strong and reliable \npatients' rights bill and I'm supportive of this effort 100 percent. \nWhat we do not need is a bill, like Kennedy-McCain, that exposes \nemployers to unlimited liability, drives up the cost of health \ninsurance, and ultimately increases the number of Americans without \nhealth coverage.\n  Instead, I believe we should protect patients by ensuring access to \nneeded treatments and specialists, by making sure each patient gets a \nreview of any claim that may be denied, and above all by ensuring that \nAmericans' who rely on their employers for health care can still get \nthis coverage. I'm confident these goals can be reached.\n  However, the very fact that our new leadership brought the Kennedy-\nMcCain legislation directly to the floor without proper committee \naction, violates the core of the Senate process.\n  I know my colleagues on the other side will waste no time accusing me \nof delaying this bill, but the truth is, had the relevant committees \nbeen given the opportunity to consider the Kennedy-McCain legislation \nin the first place, I would not be raising these objections.\n  By bringing this bill directly to the floor, the message seems to me \nto be loud and clear: that the new chairmen under the new Democratic \nleadership are merely speedbumps on the road to the floor.\n  I guess, as a former chairman who hopes to be chairman again in the \nnear future, I do not particularly enjoy being a speedbump. But there's \nsomething much more important at stake--\n\n[[Page S6871]]\n\nprocess. A flawed process, more often than not, will lead to a flawed \nlegislative product. We are seeing that point in spades on this \nlegislation.\n  Does anyone really think that if we had followed regular order and \ngone through the committee process that the bill before us would be in \nworse shape? Would we still be sitting around wondering where this bill \nis going? Or would it be necessary to define the employer liability \nexception with Senator Gramm's amendment?\n  I guess I have more confidence in the committees of jurisdiction than \nthe new leadership and sponsors of this bill do. The HELP, Judiciary, \nand Finance Committees have the experience and expertise to deal with \nthe important issues this bill presents. My motion simply provides \nthese fine committees with an opportunity to do their jobs.\n  Now let me turn for a moment to my committee, the Finance Committee. \nThe Kennedy-McCain legislation treads on the Finance Committee's \njurisdiction in three ways that are by no means trivial--on trade, \nMedicare, and tax issues.\n  In fact, approximately one-third of the nearly $23 billion in revenue \nloss caused by this bill, is offset by changes in programs within the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee.\n  First, section 502 extends customs user fees, generating $7 billion \nin revenue over eight years. These fees were authorized by Congress to \nhelp finance the costs of Customs commercial operations.\n  Most of my colleagues know first hand the financial pressures put on \nthe Customs Service. From Montana, to Delaware, Massachusetts, Texas, \nand California, there is a dire need for funds to modernize the Customs \nservice. Yet, the Kennedy-McCain legislation diverts money intended for \nCustoms and uses it to pay for this bill. This is not what Congress \nintended.\n  If these fees are to be extended--and I emphasize ``if''--they should \nbe done so in the context of a Customs reauthorization bill in the \nFinance Committee. This gives the Finance Committee the opportunity to \ncarefully review, analyze and debate the implications of any Customs \nchanges on the future of the Customs service and Customs modernization.\n  Second, section 503 of the Kennedy-McCain bill delays payments to \nMedicare providers, which generates $235 million to help offset the \nlosses in the bill.\n  It is ironic that while many of us are spending significant amounts \nof our time working to improve Medicare's effectiveness and \nefficiency--this bill actually takes steps to exacerbate the \nfrustrations so many providers already experience today with delayed \npayments in Medicare.\n  Any changes to Medicare need thorough evaluation and consideration in \nthe Finance Committee--where the expertise exists to determine the \nimplications of any changes to the program. For those who think we can \njust tinker with this program, they're wrong. It is much too important \nto our Nation's 40 million seniors and disabled that rely on it. Any \nchange, large or small, can have a sweeping impact on seniors, \nproviders, and taxpayers.\n  Finally, let me turn to the third Finance Committee policy area \nimplicated in this legislation. I'm talking about health care-related \ntax incentives.\n  Now I know there are no tax code changes in this particular bill. \nHowever, in years past, tax incentives have been an important part of \nthis legislation. There's good reason for this. As Senator McCain \nrecognized, tax incentives provide balance to patients' rights \nlegislation by making health care more affordable and therefore more \naccessible.\n  I am a strong believer in health tax policy and have proposed a \nnumber of changes in the tax treatment of health care--including ways \nto reduce long-term care insurance and expenses, promote better use of \nmedical savings accounts, and improve the affordability of health \ninsurance through refundable tax credits.\n  But while I might agree with these policies on a substantive level, I \nwill continue to oppose health tax amendments to the Kennedy-McCain \nlegislation simply because the Finance Committee has never been given \nthe opportunity to analyze, review, or discuss the implications of \nthese provisions on the internal revenue code--a code that is the \nresponsibility of the Finance Committee.\n  My motion provides the Finance Committee with its rightful \nopportunity to add health tax cut provisions to this legislation. There \nis no doubt that the Hutchinson-Bond amendment, along with a number of \nother good health care-related tax cuts, would be included in a package \nbefore the Finance Committee.\n  On that point, I want to make clear that at my urging, Chairman \nBaucus has already agreed to consider a package of health care-related \ntax cuts in an upcoming Finance Committee markup. So I look forward to \nworking through these very important issues in the committee.\n  It is my responsibility to Iowans, my Finance Committee members, and \nall Senators to be vigilant on committee business. I cannot let these \nthings just slip by. That would be easy to do, but it would also be \nirresponsible.\n  During my tenure as Finance chairman, Senator after Senator urged \nthat the committee process be upheld regarding tax legislation. I \nlistened and I acted.\n  I resisted strong pressures to bypass the Finance Committee as we \nconsidered the greatest tax relief bill in a generation. I forged a \nbipartisan coalition and consensus which I believe made it a better \nbill. Ultimately we were able to craft a bill that benefited from the \nsupport of a dozen members from the other side.\n  So I stand before you as someone who has seen the importance of the \ncommittee process as well the success of this process.\n  The new leadership and this bill's sponsors have simply tossed aside \nthe committees of jurisdiction. As justification for these actions, the \nnew leadership says Republicans did the same thing on their patients' \nrights bill in 1999, but this is simply not the case.\n  In 1999, the patients' rights legislation underwent a series of \nhearings in the HELP committee, and ultimately there were 3 days of \nmarkup--let me repeat 3 days of markup--in that committee. And only \nafter the bill was reported out of the committee was it then brought up \nfor consideration by the full Senate.\n  So let us hear no more discussion on this point. There is no \njustification for the conduct on this bill. It is a fact that the \nKennedy-McCain bill before us today has never undergone the committee \nprocesses that the 1999 patients' rights legislation did.\n  What our new leadership has done is violated the rights of the \nmembers of three important Senate committees from utilizing their \nexpertise and experience to fully evaluate the Kennedy-McCain \nlegislation--a job these committees were designed to do.\n  Any members of the three committees that support this faulty process \nshould beware. Supporting this process means that they support \ndisenfranchising their own rights as committee members.\n  What my motion does is correct this faulty process, a process that \nhas ensnared a bill that could have otherwise moved through floor \ndebate smoothly, if the committee process had been upheld.\n  A vote for my motion to commit puts this bill on the right track. It \nlets members of the HELP, Judiciary, and Finance Committees do the jobs \nthey were sent here to do.\n  These committees have good track records in this Congress. They will \ncontinue to produce legislation that is important to our Nation. Taking \nthis bill through the relevant committees will only improve this \nlegislation and ultimately make it better law. That's what is in the \nbest interests of the patients were trying to protect.\n  I believe we are at a critical juncture in history. Through a very \nclose election, the American people have instructed those of us who \nrepresent them in this town of Washington, DC, to get serious about \nlegislative business.\n  What the Iowans have told me, and Americans have told all of us, is \nto work together to produce results. They want less partisanship, more \naction, and more thoughtful debate.\n  People in Iowa expect Republicans and Democrats to work together, \nwith President Bush, to get things done. They expect us to refrain from \nplaying partisan politics and to be serious legislators.\n\n[[Page S6872]]\n\n  We have a responsibility to our constituents who have given us the \nopportunity to represent them. That responsibility is to legislate in a \nthorough, fair, and constructive fashion. That is not the way the \nKennedy-McCain bill has been handled thus far.\n  If we are to carry out the people's business in the manner the Senate \nset forth--through the committee process--then we must utilize this \nprocess to produce legislation that will help improve the lives of \nevery American.\n  After all, is that not what the people really want? A good law that \nis produced in the proper way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nMontana desires.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I commend my good friend from Iowa, \nSenator Grassley, and particularly applaud his continued effort to work \nin cooperation and in a bipartisan and frank manner to get results. It \nis an approach he has taken when he was at the helm of the Finance \nCommittee and an approach he knows works. I commend him for it.\n  I take this opportunity to address one of the amendments presently \npending, the amendment offered by my colleague from Texas, Senator \nGramm.\n  While I will not vote for this amendment, I believe it is critical \nthat we protect employers from unwarranted liability claims. But the \nGramm amendment I believe goes too far. It protects employers from \nliability even when they are responsible for making medical decisions \nthat result in injury or death.\n  Let me be clear. I do not believe employers should be held liable for \nmedical decisions made by others, nor do I believe they should be \nexempt from responsibility if they are making medical decisions \nthemselves.\n  This issue is very important to businesses in my State. It is very \nimportant to the people in my State. I must say it is very important to \nme. For that reason, I am working with my colleagues on a compromise. I \nhave recently spoken with Senator Edwards. We are working together on a \nbipartisan compromise that will shield employers from liability when \nthey are not involved in making decisions about medical care. It is a \nbipartisan compromise that will also protect patients. I believe there \nis a middle ground. I will be working with my colleagues to find it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cleland). The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 51 \nminutes on the motion and the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the Senate recently completed major education reform \nafter six weeks of debate focused on accountability. We agreed that in \norder to persuade schools to live up to high standards, serious \nconsequences were needed for schools that failed to improve. \nRepublicans in particular emphasized the need for tough financial \nsanctions. The risk of losing funds, they argued, is an appropriate and \nnecessary incentive to achieve high performance.\n  This emphasis on accountability is not new. It was also the hallmark \nof welfare reform, and the Senate has applied the same principle to \nmany other programs as well. Over and over, our Republican friends have \nargued that increased accountability is the way to produce responsible \nbehavior.\n  It is ironic that some of those who have called for accountability \nmost vigorously in these other debates now oppose accountability for \nHMOs and health insurance companies when their misconduct seriously \ninjures patients. It is irresponsible to suggest that HMOs and \ninsurance companies should not face serious financial consequences when \ntheir misconduct causes serious injury or death. If ever there was a \nneed for accountability, it is by those responsible for providing \nmedical care.\n  The consequences can be extremely serious when an HMO or an insurer \ndenies or indefinitely delays access to essential medical treatment. It \ncan literally be a matter of life and death. Yet there is overwhelming \nevidence that access to care is being denied in many cases for \nfinancial, not medical, reasons.\n  And after five years of debating this issue, we've finally reached \nthe point where very few Senators will come to the floor and openly \nclaim that HMOs and health insurers should not be held accountable in \ncourt when they hurt people. These corporations desperately want to \nkeep the immunity that they currently have, immunity that no other \nbusiness in America enjoys. But the HMOs and insurers have behaved so \nirresponsibly and hurt so many people that they are finally in danger \nof losing it. Too many children have died, too many families have \nsuffered, for even the HMOs' closest allies to stand here and say that \nthey do not need to be held accountable.\n  So instead, the HMOs' multi-million dollar lobbyists and their allies \nin Congress have devised a strategy for killing this legislation \nwithout directly questioning the need to hold HMOs accountable. Indeed, \nsome of those who repeatedly called for accountability in other areas \nare the very same members who are searching for ways to enable these \ncompanies to escape accountability when their misconduct seriously \ninjures people.\n  The pending amendment by Senator Gramm is a perfect example of this \nstrategy of collateral attack--an attempt to kill this legislation by \ndistorting what it would actually do, and by seeking to turn the focus \naway from HMO misconduct. Those supporting the Gramm amendment claim \nthat all employers are endangered by this legislation. Such claims are \nwrong. The vast majority of employers who provide health care merely \npay for the benefit. They do not make medical judgments, they do not \ndecide individual requests for medical treatment. Thus, under our \nlegislation, they have no liability. The only employers who would be \nliable are the very few who step into the shoes of the doctor or the \nhealth care provider and make final medical decisions. Our legislation \nonly allows employers to be held liable in court when they assume the \nrole of the HMO or the health insurance company.\n  By completely exempting employers from all liability no matter how \nclosely tied the employer is to an HMO and no matter how severe the \nemployer's misconduct, Senator Gramm's proposal aims to break the link \nof accountability in this bill.\n  President Bush stated in the ``Principles'' for the Patients' Bill of \nRights which he issued on February 7th: ``Only employers who retain \nresponsibility for and make final medical decisions should be subject \nto suit.'' That is consistent with what our bill does. But Senator \nGramm's amendment is directly at odds with the President's principle. \nThe Gramm amendment would mean that ``employers who retain \nresponsibility for and make final medical decisions'' could not be \nsued.\n  I'm surprised that the Senators from Texas would propose such an \nextreme approach--eliminating all accountability for employers no \nmatter what they do. Under their proposal, employers are never held \naccountable, period, even if an employer causes the death of a worker's \nchild by interfering in medical decisions that should have been made by \ndoctors.\n  The Gramm amendment is a poison pill designed to kill this \nlegislation. Not only does it absolve employers of liability regardless \nof how egregious their conduct, it also creates a loophole so enormous \nthat every health plan in America would look for a way to reorganize in \norder to qualify for the absolute immunity provided by the Gramm \namendment. Senator Gramm creates a safe harbor so broad that it will \nattract every boat in the fleet.\n  We all know what would happen if this amendment became law. HMO \nlawyers would craft contracts that enable them to be treated as \nemployees of the companies they serve, so HMOs could take advantage of \nSenator Gramm's absolute immunity. Other employers would turn to self \ninsurance as an obvious way to avoid accountability for the actions of \ntheir health plans.\n  Health insurance companies would rework their contracts to give \nemployers the final say on benefit determinations in order to take \nadvantage of this shield from accountability.\n  Today fewer than 5 percent of employers assume direct responsibility \nfor\n\n[[Page S6873]]\n\nmedical decisions on behalf of their employees. But if the Gramm \namendment became law, the share of employers taking on these decisions \nwould grow enormously. By providing absolute immunity from \naccountability, the Gramm amendment creates a strong incentive for \nemployers to intervene in medical decisions, despite the fact that most \nemployers are not qualified to do so.\n  Employers and HMOs are free to negotiate any relationship they want, \nand that relationship can be detailed in writing, or it can be detailed \nin informal ``understandings'' that workers never get to see. What the \nGramm amendment does is leave families completely vulnerable to the \nmost unscrupulous HMOs and employers.\n  For example, an employer could demand that an HMO call it for \napproval before allowing any treatment that would cost over a certain \namount, compromising the patient's privacy and enabling the employer to \nmake medical decisions based on cost alone. The Gramm amendment would \ncompletely shield an employer who causes grave injury or death in this \nway, and the HMO might also escape liability because it could show that \nthe employer alone made the final decision.\n  Subtler employers could instruct their HMOs to delay or complicate \nthe treatment approval process for certain kinds of medical care or for \ncertain employees. The Gramm amendment would allow an employer to \nrequire its HMO to send it all requests for mammograms, and the \nemployer would not be accountable if it chose to delay or deny a \nrequest for a mammogram that would have timely detected breast cancer. \nThe same employer practice can interfere with many diagnostic and \ntreatment decisions.\n  As Judy Lerner discovered, there is no end to the irresponsible \nbehavior of some unscrupulous employers. Ms. Lerner worked in Boston \nfor over two decades as a consultant in a human resources firm that \nself insured, and she relied on the health benefits that the company \nprovided. But when she broke her leg in several places and endured \nemergency surgery, the company simply stopped helping with her medical \nbills, agreeing only to pay for crutches. Despite her doctors' vigorous \narguments for continued home medical care, the company abandoned her. \nThe Gramm amendment would leave all employees like Ms. Lerner \nvulnerable after they have been told that their medical bills would be \ncovered at the time they accepted employment and begin working hard. \nThe Gramm amendment allows employers to deny necessary medical \ntreatment any time it suddenly becomes too costly or inconvenient, \nregardless of how much the employee has relied on that coverage.\n  Most employers, of course, would not find it morally acceptable to \nintervene in medical decisions against their employees. But if I were a \nsmall business owner, I wouldn't want to compete in the environment \ncreated by the Gramm amendment because it gives the worst employers an \neconomic incentive to cut corners on employee health care and frees \nthem from all accountability when they do so. It would create an uneven \nplaying field, allowing unscrupulous employers to gain a business \nadvantage over their honorable competitors.\n  As the President says, ``employers who retain responsibility for and \nmake final medical decisions should be subject to suit.'' That is what \nPresident Bush wants, and that is what we want to accomplish. I am \nconfident that the McCain-Edwards language accomplishes this, but I \nremain open to other ideas for writing President Bush's principle into \nlaw.\n  Under our language, employers have no liability as long as they do \nnot make decisions about whether a specific beneficiary receives \nnecessary medical care. The only employers who can be brought into \ncourt are the very few who step into the shoes of the doctor or the \nhealth care provider and make final medical decisions.\n  Our bill does not authorize suit against an employer or other plan \nsponsor unless ``there was direct participation by the employer or \nother plan sponsor.'' ``Direct participation'' is defined as the \n``actual making of such decision or the actual exercise of control'' \nover the individual patient's claim for necessary medical treatment.\n  Our bill directly protects employers from liability by stating: \n``Participation . . . in the selection of the group health plan or \nhealth insurance coverage involved or the third party administration'' \nwill not give rise to liability; ``Engagement . . . in any cost-benefit \nanalyses undertaken in connection with the selection of, or continued \nmaintenance of, the plan or coverage'' will not give rise to liability; \n``Participation . . . in the design of any benefit under the plan, \nincluding the amount of co-payment and limits connected with such \nbenefit'' will not give rise to liability. Our language is clear. As \nlong as the employer does not become involved in individual cases it is \nimmunized from suit.\n  Employers are very well protected by our legislation as it is \nwritten. We are pleased to consider other strategies for accomplishing \nPresident Bush's principle on this issue, but the loophole that the \nTexas Senators propose fundamentally contradicts the President's \nprinciple and ours.\n  Senator Snowe and others are working on language to codify that \nprinciple, and I am looking forward to seeing their ideas.\n  The Gramm amendment is exactly the wrong medicine for America. It \ndeserves to be soundly defeated for the sake of a level playing field \nfor all employers, and for the good health of employees and their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I will take the time Senator Gramm has \nand yield myself as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Gramm \namendment and ask unanimous consent to be listed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Today in the United States we do not mandate that any \nemployer or business provide health insurance. We do not force them to \nbuy it for themselves or their employees. We let the employer make this \ndecision.\n  And employers all across the United States do provide health care \ninsurance that covers over 160 million people. These employers do not \nhave to provide that health care. They do this voluntarily for a number \nof reasons. Some actually do it because they care about their \nemployees, but most do it because it is good business--it helps attract \nemployees to come to work for them. But regardless of why these \nemployers offer health benefits, the important factor is that they do \nthis voluntarily.\n  There is no employer mandate in America. We had that debate in 1994 \nduring the argument about the Clinton health bill, and it was clear \nthat everyone--the American people and American business--wanted to \nkeep our voluntary system. But if the bill before us today becomes law, \nthat could all change.\n  In spite of what the Senator from Massachusetts said, businesses--big \nand small--all over America would stop offering health insurance \nbenefits to their employees. And the reason they would stop can be \nsummed up in one word--lawsuits.\n  The simple fact is that the Kennedy-McCain bill would expose \nemployers who provide health care insurance coverage to their employees \nto lawsuits. I have heard some supporters of this bill claim that \nemployers are protected from lawsuits in this bill. We just heard the \ngood Senator from Massachusetts say that. They say that this bill \nprotects our current system. They point out that on page 144 of the \nKennedy-McCain bill that there is a section in bold headline that \nreads: ``Exclusion of Employers and Other Plan Sponsors.'' But what \nthey don't tell you is that on the very next page the bill reads, as \nclear as day: ``. . . A Cause of Action May Rise Against an Employer . \n. . .'' After that there are four pages explaining when an employer can \nbe sued.\n  That means that while this bill does exclude suits against doctors \nand hospitals and other providers, it does not exempt suits against \nemployers who purchase health insurance. In fact, the bill exposes \nemployers who provide health care insurance to both State and Federal \nlawsuits. It exposes them\n\n[[Page S6874]]\n\nto unlimited economic damages, unlimited noneconomic damages, unlimited \npunitive damages in State court, and $5 million in damages in Federal \ncourt.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, that is an awful lot of lawsuits.\n  I believe that this exposure to liability in the Kennedy-McCain bill \nwill scare employers away from providing health insurance. Instead of \nproviding coverage, one of two things is going to happen if this bill \nbecomes law. Employers are either going to drop their coverage \naltogether or they will give their employees cash or some sort of \nvoucher and wish them well in searching for the best deal for \nthemselves and their families they can find in health care. This would \nturn our entire health system on its head and would lead to serious \nproblems.\n  I don't believe anybody in this Chamber really wants that. Instead, I \nurge support for the Gramm amendment. This amendment would apply \nlanguage from the current Texas State law to specifically protect \nemployers that provide health benefits from facing lawsuits for doing \nso. It is clear cut. It is a simple solution, but it is very clear in \nits intent.\n  For weeks some of my colleagues have been eager to point out that \nTexas has a Patients' Bill of Rights, and some of them even talk about \nthis is a model for the Federal legislation. Now we have the \nopportunity to do just this and to ensure that employers cannot be sued \nfor doing the right thing--for helping their employees. It is simple.\n  We know the bill before us as written will not become law, and the \nexpanded employer liability is one of the very tough sticking points. \nNow we have a chance to fix it, to improve the bill, and to make it \nsignable.\n  I want to vote for a Patients' Bill of Rights, a bill of rights that \nis going to become law. A vote today for the Gramm amendment is a \ncritical step in that direction. A vote against the amendment means \nthat we will probably just talk about these problems without doing \nanything to change them. I urge my colleagues to vote to protect \nemployers and employees alike and support the Gramm amendment.\n  We do not want single-payer health insurance in the United States. It \nwas proposed in 1994 and soundly defeated. Even though the opponents of \nthe Gramm amendment would like to think that this is the reason they \nare opposing it, that it prevents liability, the basic fact is that \nthey may want no health care benefit at all and then force the United \nStates to have a single-payer plan at the end. We will do anything in \nour power to defeat that.\n  I urge a vote on the Gramm amendment and yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the Gramm \namendment. I see that neither Senators Gramm nor Grassley are present. \nI understand there is time remaining for Senators Grassley and Gramm. I \nsuppose the appropriate thing to do would be to ask for 10 minutes of \nthe time on the Gramm amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we are proceeding to clear the air on \nthis issue, and that is important. It is a very important issue. One of \nthe things Senator Grassley pointed out was that this did not go \nthrough the regular committee process. It is a very complicated bill, \nand we are just now seeing the complications of it; one of those being \nthe extent to which employers are liable, employers can be sued.\n  Unfortunately, we didn't have a chance to work all that out in \ncommittee. So now we are here in this Chamber arguing about the \nexposure of employers.\n  We are making progress because, when we first started this debate, \nthe supporters of the McCain-Kennedy-Edwards bill basically said: We \nwere not attempting to go after employers. That is not what this is \nabout. Then in the fine print, yes, well, under certain limited \ncircumstances.\n  I think we know now that there is, indeed, extreme exposure as far as \nemployers are concerned and that it constitutes a significant part of \nthe effect of this bill. We are making progress. Now we can talk about \nthe extent to which employers should or should not have exposure and \nliability.\n  We have heard statements today that there are a lot of employers out \nthere that will do the wrong thing; that even though they are not \nrequired to have health insurance for their employees, apparently there \nare employers out there that will set up health care plans and then do \neverything they can to disadvantage their own employees, and that that \nconsideration is driving this provision of the bill. So we are, indeed, \nrefining the issue; the lines are being drawn.\n  The response to the issue of suing employers has always been: Don't \nworry about that. The main thing is we are going after the big bad \nHMOs. You don't have to worry about anything else. When times get \nreally tough, we bring out another picture of some poor individual who \nis used to demonstrate the evilness of managed care.\n\n  Our hearts go out to these people. These are people in need. But the \naverage observer in America must be watching this and asking \nthemselves: Why doesn't the Government just require these people to be \ncovered for anything all the time in unlimited amounts? Why doesn't the \nFederal Government just take care of it? Or if the Government doesn't \nwant to do it, why don't we make some insurance company pay somebody \nfor any claim they make, if it is a real need, at any time for any \namount? In fact, why didn't we pass the Clinton health care bill a few \nyears ago? The average person must be asking: If that is the only \nissue, taking care of sick folks, then why don't we nationalize this \nhealth care system of ours? That is the logical conclusion of all that \nwe have been hearing.\n  The answer, of course, is that in public policy matters, there are \ntradeoffs to be considered. There is never just one side of the coin.\n  We know, for example, that we set up managed care in this country \nbecause health care prices were rising up to the point of almost 20 \npercent a year. We knew that couldn't be sustained so we put in a \nmanaged care system. Some HMOs abused that and did some bad things. \nStates passed laws. Thirty some States passed laws addressing some of \nthese problems. The State of Tennessee has broader coverage than the \nbill we are considering today. It is not as though the States have been \nstanding still. They are covered. Health care costs are going back up.\n  So here we come and we are going to lay on another plan that, if \npassed in the current form, without question, will drive up health care \ncosts again.\n  My heart goes out to these poor people who are being used in this \ndebate to demonstrate the necessity for the passage of this \nlegislation. But I want to refer to a group of individuals myself. In \nfact, I want to refer to 1.2 million individuals. I don't have the \nspace or the time or the resources to bring in pictures of the 1.2 \nmillion people who, the most conservative estimates say, will be thrown \noff of insurance altogether if this bill passes.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says that at a minimum--and there are \nother estimates, but that is the lowest one I have seen--1.2 million \npeople will lose insurance altogether. Who is going to bring their \npictures in here to demonstrate to the American people that they are \ndisadvantaged by the bill we might pass that will drive health care \ncosts up so great that these small employers that some would like to \ndemonize or large ones, for that matter, that some would like to \ndemonize don't have to provide health care at all?\n  What is going to keep them from just saying, as has been pointed out \nthis morning, that the costs are too great, the liability is too great? \nWe want to do the best we can. We are not perfect. We might make \nmistakes. But instead of setting up a system to rectify those mistakes, \nwe will be opened up to unlimited lawsuits at any time, anywhere in the \ncountry, in any amount. Why should we have that aggravation? Why not \njust give the employees X number of dollars and say, you take care of\nit--and they may or may not take care of it with that money--or if you \nare a small employer, to drop insurance coverage altogether. Who is \ngoing to speak for that 1.2 million people who they say will wind up \nwithout any insurance at all?\n\n[[Page S6875]]\n\n  There won't be any arguments with any HMOs because there won't be any \ninsurance at all.\n  So the lines have been drawn in this debate. We have people over here \nneeding help, needing assistance. We have set up a review process to \nget independent people to look to determine whether or not these \nemployers are taking advantage of people. So far so good.\n  Then the proponents of this bill want to lay in a system of lawsuits \non top of that. We draw the line in there and say that, yes, let's have \nan administrative process to see whether or not employers are taking \nadvantage of folks. Let's have an independent doctor look at it. After \nthat, let's not lay on unlimited lawsuits against employers who do not \nprovide the health care and expose them to liability, when we say that \nwhat we are going after is the big bad HMOs. Why expose these people \nwho are providing health insurance? They are not providing health care, \nso why expose them to liability?\n  The question remains, Do we want to sue employers? Do we want to have \nthe right to sue employers or not? The proponents of this bill say yes, \nbut only with regard to when they directly participate in \ndecisionmaking. This gets a little technical, but it is very important. \nThere is a certain resonance of the proposition that if somebody does \nsomething wrong, they ought to be held accountable. I have tried a few \ncases myself, and I believe in that principle. I think that is right. \nBut the problem in the context of this health care debate, which we \nnationalize to a certain extent with ERISA for a portion of the \npopulation, and now we are going to nationalize the rest of it with \nthis bill, the problem is we are setting it up so that, by definition, \na large group of employers are going to be considered to be directly \nparticipating because they are self-insured and they have employees who \nare on the front end of these claims processes. They tell me that these \nself-insured plans are some of the best plans that we have. They don't \ngo out and hire an HMO. They try to do it themselves, in-house, with \ntheir own people, looking out for their own employees, who they don't \nhave to insure if they don't want to, but they do. I am told that they \nprovide more benefits than the other plans. They are some of our better \nplans. But by cutting out the middleman, so to speak, and doing it \nthemselves, they are going to be subject to liability under this bill.\n  The second point of exposure has to do simply with the fact that \nemployers have settlement value. What lawyer worth his salt, if he is \ngoing to sue anybody along the line here in this process, would not \ninclude an employer as a part of this lawsuit? An employer has a chance \nof deciding whether or not to go to court and stand on principle \nbecause he is not liable and spend several thousand dollars defending \nhimself or settle up front and pay the other side in order to get out \nof the lawsuit.\n  The other side says they don't want to sue employers unless they have \ncontrol. I mentioned direct participation. The other key words are ``or \ncontrol''--to exercise control of the health care plan. The only \nproblem with that is under ERISA law, by definition, employers are \nsupposed to have control over these plans. So if you just look at the \ndefinitional sections of the applicable law, on day 1 you have a large \nnumber of employers that are subject to this lawsuit. So let's not kid \nourselves about that.\n  The first part of this debate was that most employers are not \ncovered. Most employers are not covered. Now, we know that is not true. \nThe issue now is whether or not they should be. You say, well, what if \nthey do something wrong? That is a good point. Why should they be any \ndifferent? Why should they have immunity? We could ask the same thing \nabout treating doctors and about treating hospitals and about any \nnumber of entities around America, including U.S. Senators. Why do we \nhave protection for anything we say in this Chamber under the speech \nand debate clause? Is it because we are better than anybody else or \nbecause we don't ever go over the line and do something wrong or maybe \neven outrageous? No. It is because of the tradeoffs of public policy \nbecause there are other considerations, just as there are other \nconsiderations when we lash out and follow our natural instinct to sue \nan employer.\n  You are going to drive costs up; you are going to drive people out of \nthe system; and you are going to cause more uninsured. Besides, there \nis accountability. There is a sense of the Senate pending today that \ntalks about the importance of the independent evaluation that this bill \ncreates. The employer doesn't get to make a decision to cut somebody \noff under this bill, and that is the end of it. It goes through an \nindependent evaluation process. It goes through an external review \nprocess. Then, if it is a medical decision, it goes to an independent \nmedical reviewer.\n  This bill spends pages on pages in setting up these individual \nentities, protecting them, qualifying them, having the Federal \nGovernment look over their shoulders. They are the final word. If the \nemployer is wrong, they are the final word, and they don't have \nanything to do with the employer. There might be some hypothetical \ncases where some evil employer might sneak through the cracks \nsomewhere. All I am saying is it is our obligation to consider both \nsides of this coin. If in trying to do that, if in trying to reach that \nhypothetical extreme case we drive up health care costs and we drive \nsmall employers out of the health care business and we do wind up with \nover a million more people uninsured, we are making a bad bargain.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 37\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield myself 2 minutes. I want to remind my good \nfriend from Tennessee when he talks about the issues of cost, that we \nhave heard this issue raised before by the Chamber of Commerce \nregarding family and medical leave. They estimated that its cost would \nbe $27 billion a year. It has been a fraction of that. I don't hear \nMembers wanting to repeal it. We heard about the issue of cost when we \npassed Kassebaum-Kennedy, which permits insurance portability, and is \nused particularly by the disabled. We heard that Kassebaum-Kennedy was \nestimated to cost tens of billions of dollars. That cost has not \ndeveloped. Nobody is trying to repeal it.\n  We heard about costs when we passed an increase in the minimum wage. \nWe heard that it would lead to inflation and lost wages. We have \nresponded to that. The cost issue has always been brought up.\n  I will remind the Senator that we have put in the Record the pay for \nWilliam McGuire and United Health Group, the largest HMO in the \ncountry. The total compensation is $54 million and $357 million in \nstock options for a total compensation of $411 million per year. That \nis $4.25 per premium holder. The best estimate of ours is $1.19, and \nyou get the protections. We can go down the list of the top HMOs they \nare making well over $10 million a year and are averaging $64 million \nin stock options. We could encourage some of those who want to do \nsomething in terms of the cost, to work on this issue, Mr. President.\n  In the 1970s, we welcomed, as the principal author of the HMO \nlegislation, the opportunity to try to change the financial incentives \nfor decapitation, to keep people healthy. There would be greater \nprofits for HMOs. It is a good concept. To treat people and families \nholistically is a valid concept and works in the best HMOs.\n  What happened is that HMOs, and in many instances, employers, started \nto make decisions that failed to live up to the commitment they made to \nthe patient when the patient signed on and started paying the \npremiums. That is what this is about. The patient signs on and says: I \nam going to have coverage if I am in a serious accident. Then we have \nthe illustration of the person who broke their leg and the employer \nsaid: Absolutely not. We are cutting off all assistance. That person \nwas left out in the cold.\n\n  There is no reason to do that. The only people who have to fear these \nprovisions are those employers that make adverse decisions with regard \nto an employee's health. It seems to me they should not be held free \nfrom accountability any more than anyone else should be.\n  How much time remains? I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from North \nCarolina and that will leave me how much?\n\n[[Page S6876]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the Senator from North Carolina 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak after \nthe Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I want to speak to some of the concerns \nand comments that have been made by my friend and colleague from \nTennessee with whom I have been working over the course of the last few \ndays on this issue. There are a couple of issues he raised that deserve \na response.\n  First is the general notion that an appeals process, before going to \ncourt, is adequate in and of itself. There are two fundamental problems \nwith that logic. Remember, the way the system works under both pieces \nof legislation is if an HMO denies care to a patient, they can go \nthrough an internal appeal. If that is unsuccessful, they can go to an \nexternal appeal. If that does not resolve the issue and they are hurt, \nthey can then go to court.\n  There are two reasons the appeal by itself does not resolve the \nissue.\n  An HMO says to a family: We are not going to allow your child to have \nthis treatment. The child then suffers an injury as a result, and a \nweek later, or however long it takes to complete the appeals process, \nthe HMO's decision is reversed by an appeals board.\n  An independent review board says: Wait a minute, HMO, you were wrong \nto start with. Unfortunately, the only thing that independent review \nboard can do is give that child the test they should have had to start \nwith, but the child has already suffered a serious permanent injury as \na result. The treatment no longer helps.\n  The problem is if the HMO decides on the front end they are not going \nto pay for some care that should be paid for, and the child is hurt as \na result, and then 1 week or 2 weeks later the appeals board reverses \nthat decision and says, yes, they are going to order the treatment, \nthis child has nowhere to go and their family has nowhere to go.\n\n  That is the point at which--and I think the Senator and I may agree \non this--we believe the HMO should be held accountable. The independent \nreview board cannot fix the problem where the child has been injured \nfor life. The HMO that made the decision, just as every entity in this \ncountry, should be held responsible and accountable for what they did. \nThat is what we believe. We believe in personal responsibility.\n  The second reason the appeals process by itself does not solve the \nproblem: If there is nothing beyond the appeal, it creates an incentive \nfor the HMO, which is what I am talking about, to have a policy of when \nin doubt, deny the claim because the worst that is ever going to happen \nis they are going to finish this appeals process and some appeals board \nis going to order them to pay what they should have paid to start with. \nIf they take 1,000 patients for a particular kind of treatment and deny \ncare to those 1,000 patients, the majority of them are never going to \ngo through an appeal, so they save money. Then they go through the \nappeal and the worst that can ever happen to them is with 30 or 40 of \nthem, an appeals board orders them to go back and pay what they should \nhave paid.\n  The problem is fundamental. The appeals process alone does not create \nan incentive for the HMO to do the right thing.\n  On the other hand, if the HMO knows if they make an arbitrary \nwrongful decision and somebody is hurt as a result, injured as a \nresult--if that child suffers a permanent injury as a result--they can \nbe held responsible for that as everybody else who is held responsible, \nthen it creates an enormous incentive for the HMO to do the right \nthing.\n  That is what this legislation is about. Senator McCain, Senator \nKennedy, and I structured this legislation to avoid cases having to go \nto court, to create incentives for the HMO to do the right thing, \nsomething they are not doing in many cases around the country now.\n  The problem is, without both the appeals and the possibility of being \nheld responsible down the road, we do not create the incentive for the \nHMO to do the right thing. We know that today around the country many \nfamilies are being denied care they ought to be provided by an HMO.\n  There are fundamental reasons the system is set up the way it is. It \nis all designed not to get people to court and not even to get people \ninto an appeals process but to get the patient the correct care, to get \nthem the care for which they have been paying premiums.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator for addressing the issues I raised, \nand I ask this as a legitimate point of inquiry and not just a debating \npoint.\n  Mr. President, it occurs to me with regard to the Senator's first \npoint, and that is coverage might be denied initially but later \noverruled, and in the interim--I think he used the example of a small \nchild again--a child might be suffering damage, does not ERISA \ncurrently provide injunctive relief? It allows a person under those \ncircumstances to go into Federal court for mandatory injunctive relief, \nand would that not address the concern the Senator has?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator for his question. It is a perfectly \nfair question. The problem, of course, is that many times it could be a \nsituation where it would take entirely too long to go to court and get \ninjunctive relief. When there is a situation where they have to make a \ndecision about a family member, whether it be a child or an adult, and \nthe HMO says they are not paying for the care, and they are in the \nhospital, the last thing they are going to be talking about is: I need \nto hire a lawyer, go to court, and get injunctive relief. What they \nneed is care at that moment, and in many cases, as the Senator knows \nfrom his personal experience before coming to the Senate, during the \ninterim, during that short period of time, that window of opportunity \nto provide the care to that patient who may be hospitalized or may not \nbe hospitalized is the critical time.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If the Senator will----\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Excuse me. It is impossible during that period of time \nto get injunctive relief against an HMO, and I might add, the last \nthing in the world a family is thinking about when they have a member \nof their family who is in trouble and needs health care is going to \ncourt to get an injunction. Now I yield.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator. I could not agree more with that \nlast point. However, my experience has been that injunctive relief is \ndesigned by nature for very rapid consideration. You can get very rapid \nconsideration, but you do have to go to court to get it.\n  My question is, If we are not going to avail ourselves or require \nclaimants to avail themselves of the processes if they believe they \nhave been wronged, does that not necessarily lead to the conclusion \nthat we must grant all claims?\n  How does a person considering a claim know which one--let's assume \nthey are dealing in good faith. In every case where there is an injury \nor potential injury going to occur, is the logical conclusion that we \nshould see to it that all claims are granted regardless of whether or \nnot the person considering the claim thinks it is clearly not covered \nunder the agreement?\n  If we do not go through the processes that are in law for people to \navail themselves and to show to an independent arbiter or judge that \ntheir claim is meritorious, if we say we do not have time for that, \nthen doesn't that mean we have to grant all of them?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Reclaiming my time, my response to the Senator's \nquestion is simple and common sense. For a family in a bad situation \nneeding medical care immediately, the last thing in the world they are \nthinking of is hiring a lawyer, going to court and trying to get an \ninjunction. The Senator well knows that process by itself can take \nenough time for something serious to happen in the interim.\n  As to the second issue the Senator raises, all we are saying in our \nlegislation, in the structure of our system--internal appeal/external \nappeal--if that is unsuccessful and there has been a serious injury, \nthey can be treated and taken to court the same as everyone\n\n[[Page S6877]]\n\nelse. We expect the HMO, which, by the way, is in the business of \nmaking these health care decisions, although of course not to cover \nabsolutely everything, to make reasonable, thoughtful judgments about \nwhat is covered and what should not be covered.\n  Now back to the issue of employer liability. First of all, the answer \nto the Gramm amendment is that it is inconsistent with what the \nRepublican President of the United States has said regarding our bill \nand the President's principle: ``Only employers who retain \nresponsibility for and make final medical decisions should be subject \nto suit.'' This is the President's written principle. That is the way \nour bill is designed, that only employers engaged in the business of \nmaking individual medical decisions can have any liability or any \nresponsibility.\n  With that said, we are working, as I speak, with colleagues, \nRepublicans and Democrats across the aisle, to fashion language that \naccomplishes the goal of protecting employers while at the same time \nkeeping in mind the interests of the patient.\n  There are other legitimate issues raised. For example, one argument \nthat has been made is that employers may be subjected to lawsuits they \ndo not belong in, and there is a cost associated with being in those \ncases for too long. We are working as we speak to create better \nlanguage, better protection for employers so there is no question that \nemployers, No. 1, can be protected from liability, and No. 2, if they \nare named in a lawsuit improperly, they don't belong in the lawsuit and \nshouldn't be named, they have a procedural mechanism for getting out \nquickly.\n  The truth is, the Gramm amendment is way outside the mainstream. All \nthe work that has been done on this issue, including the work we are \ndoing with our colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, is a way to \nfashion a reasonable, middle of the road approach that provides real \nand meaningful protection to employers without completely eliminating \nthe rights of patients. That is what we have been working on. We are \nworking on it now and are optimistic we can resolve that issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield another 2 minutes. Does not the Senator agree \nthat the majority of employers now are doing a good job and are not \ninterfering with these medical decisions?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. At the present time, a small number of employers are \ninterfering with medical decisions. If the Gramm amendment is accepted, \nthis will put the good employers at a serious disadvantage in \ncompetition with others, does he not agree? Would not the others be \nable to formulate a structure so they could effectively cut back on \nexcessive costs for the health care system for their employees, while \nthe good ones who are playing by the rules would be put at a rather \nimportant competitive disadvantage? Does the Senator not agree that for \nthe employers working within the system and playing by the rules, this \nis an invitation to change their whole structure and to be tempted to \nshortchange the coverage and protection for their employees?\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. In response to the question, the answer is, of course we \nbelieve employers, the vast majority of employers, care about their \nemployees and want to do the right thing. Our legislation is \nspecifically designed to protect those employers, just as the President \nof the United States has suggested needs to be done.\n  What we have done in this legislation, what the President has \nsuggested, and in the work that continues as we speak on additional \ncompromise language, all is aimed at the same principle and the same \ngoal.\n  This amendment is outside that mainstream--different from our \nlegislation, different from the principle established by the President \nof the United States, and different from the compromise that is being \nworked on at this moment.\n  I remain optimistic we will be able to reach a compromise that \nprovides real and meaningful protection to the employers of this \ncountry we want to protect. We have said that from the outset. We stand \nby it. We want to protect them.\n  If I may say a couple of things about the issue of costs which was \nraised a few moments ago, the CBO has not said anybody will become \nuninsured as a result of this legislation. What the CBO has said is \nthere will be a 4.2-percent increase in premiums over 5 years because \nof our legislation and a 2.9-percent increase if the competing \nlegislation passes, roughly 4 percent versus roughly 3 percent. The \ndifference between these two pieces of legislation on cost is a very \nminuscule part related to litigation. I think the difference is less \nthan half of 1 percent related to litigation. Rather, the differences \nare related to quality of care. If people get better access to clinical \ntrials, better access to specialists, better emergency room care, a \nmore enforceable and meaningful independent review process, if those \nthings occur, there is a marginal cost associated with it.\n  We have real models. We don't have to guess about what will happen. \nThose models are Texas, California, and Georgia. In those States, the \nnumber of uninsured, while the patient protection laws have been in \nplace, has gone down, not up. We have some real, although short term, \nempirical evidence about what happens when this patient protection is \nenacted.\n  We have to be careful. A lot of arguments being made are the same \narguments that have been made by HMOs for years to avoid any kind of \nreform, to avoid any kind of patient protection. We are working in this \nlegislation to give real protection to somewhere between 170 and 180 \nmillion Americans who are having problems with their HMO. We want to \nput the law on the side of patients and doctors instead of having \nhealth care decisions made by insurance company bureaucrats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded has expired.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I ask to be yielded another 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 17 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina and \nthe Senator from Arizona the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, in summary, let me speak to the two \namendments we will next be addressing. First, the Gramm amendment is \noutside the mainstream, outside what the President of the United States \nhas suggested, outside of what we have in our legislation, and outside \nof what we are working on with Senators from across the aisle.\n  Second, as to the Grassley motion to commit, the problem is it sends \nit back to a number of committees and slows down the process. We need \nto do something about this issue and quit talking about it. The \nAmerican people expect us to do something about it. Thousands of \nAmericans each day are losing access to the care they have, in fact, \npaid for while this process goes on. We need to get this legislation \npassed and do what we have a responsibility to do for the American \npeople. This is an issue on which the Senate, the House, and the \nAmerican people have reached a consensus. It is time to act. As to \nthese two vehicles, I urge my colleagues to reject them.\n  Finally, I will talk about the story of a young woman in North \nCarolina. Her name is Shoirdae Henderson, from Apex, NC. At the age of \n12 she was diagnosed with a rare hip condition. It made it difficult \nfor her to walk. The Henderson family's HMO sent Shoirdae to a hospital \nto see specialists about her problem. The specialist in this HMO-\napproved hospital said she needed surgery to keep her hip from fusing \nand having to walk with a limp. Even though the family had taken \nShoirdae to the HMO specialist, the HMO refused to listen to her \ndoctors. They came in with excuse after excuse to keep her from getting \nsurgery. Every one of the HMO excuses proved over time to be \ngroundless. It looked as if she would finally get the operation her \ndoctors had recommended to begin with. Just 2 days before she was \nsupposed to have surgery, the HMO told her family they wouldn't pay for \nit. They wanted her to try physical therapy instead. Shoirdae's father \nspent hours dealing with the HMO, as so many families\n\n[[Page S6878]]\n\nhave, trying to get his daughter the care the doctors said she needed. \nHe made call after call and faxed them. He requested an appeal. He \nnever got an answer. The hospital finally had to cancel her surgery as \na result.\n\n  After several sessions of physical therapy, another HMO doctor took \none look at Shoirdae's x rays and sent her back to the hospital. She \nstill needed the surgery. The therapy had not worked. In fact, \nShoirdae's hip had gotten worse--so much worse during all of this time \nthat now the doctors told her the surgery wouldn't work. If she had \ngotten the operation her doctors said she needed when they recommended \nit, her hip would not have fused. She might today be able to walk, run, \nand play without a limp. Instead, she walks with a severe limp today \nand she has to wear special shoes because the HMO refused to pay for \nwhat was obviously needed--the surgery. The HMO refused to do what the \ndoctors recommended. In fact, they overruled what the doctors \nrecommended.\n  Her father wrote to me and said: This has been the most horrible \nexperience of my life. Imagine what it has done to my daughter.\n  This is what this debate is about. This debate is about the 170 \nmillion to 180 million Americans who have health insurance--HMO \ncoverage--but have no control over their health care.\n  The HMOs have had the law on their side for too long. It is time for \nus to finally do something to put the law on the side of patients and \ndoctors so that the Shoirdaes all over this country, when their doctor \nrecommends that they have surgery, can have the surgery they need; when \nthe doctor recommends a test, they can have the test they need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, how much time is remaining on the \nside of Senator Grassley and on the Gramm-Hutchison amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 9 minutes. Senator \nGramm has 7\\1/2\\.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I have 6 minutes allocated--4 minutes \nfrom Senator Grassley's time and 2 minutes from Senator Gramm's time. \nIt is my intention to yield 4 minutes to Senator Nickles of my 6 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Chair notify me at the end of 2 minutes?\n  Madam President, I want to speak on behalf of the Grassley motion \nwhich would send this bill to committee so that it could be marked up \nand fully debated because while we have had great debate, bypassing the \ncommittee process I think has caused us to have to write the bill in \nthis Chamber. I don't think that is a good way to pass legislation.\n  I think we all want to have a Patients' Bill of Rights that is well \nvented and well debated and that we know will have the intended \nconsequences because the last thing we want to do is have unintended \nconsequences when we are talking about the health care of most \nAmericans.\n  I hope we can commit the bill to bring it back in a better form.\n  Second, I hope people will support the Gramm-Hutchison amendment \nbecause this is the Texas law. Senator Harkin, on a news program this \nweekend, said: I would love to have just the Texas law for the entire \nNation. The Gramm-Hutchison amendment is the Texas law verbatim when it \napplies to suing a person's employer because what we don't want to do \nis put the employer in the position of standing for the insurance \ncompany. The employer wants to be able to offer insurance coverage to \ntheir employees. But if they are going to be liable for a decision made \nby the insurance company and the doctors, then they are put in a \nposition that is untenable. What we want is health care coverage where \nthe decisions are made by the doctors and the patients.\n  The Senator from North Carolina had a picture of a lovely young \nwoman. He said: This is what the debate is about. It is what the debate \nis about.\n  The Breaux-Frist plan would definitely address her concerns because \nit would give her the care she needs rather than going directly for a \nlawsuit and possibly delaying the health care she needs--and for other \npatients.\n  Madam President, I ask my colleagues to support the Gramm-Hutchison \namendment and support the Grassley motion. Let's get a good bill that \nwill have the effect of increasing coverage in our country and not \ndecreasing it.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield 4 minutes to Senator Nickles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison, for her comments. I also wish to thank the \nSenator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, for his leadership on the amendment, as \nwell as Senator Thompson.\n  I hope employers around the country have been watching this debate. I \nhave heard some of the proponents of the underlying McCain-Kennedy-\nEdwards measure say: It is not our intention to sue employers. We don't \nwant to do that. No. We will try to fix it. I have even heard on \nnational shows that: We don't go after employers under our bill. On the \n``Today Show,'' a nationally televised show, Senator Edwards on June 19 \nsaid: Employers cannot be sued under our bill. That was made on June \n19. Senator Harkin yesterday said: I would love to have the Texas law \nfor the entire Nation.\n  The Texas law that Senators Gramm and Hutchison have quoted says: \nThis chapter does not create any liability on the part of an employer \nor an employer group purchasing organization. There is no liability \nunder Texas law. Senator Edwards said: We don't sue employers. But if \nyou read the bill, employers beware; you are going to be sued.\n  The only way to make sure employers aren't sued is to pass the Gramm \namendment. To say we are not going to sue employers, but, wait a \nminute, if they had direct participation, and you take several pages to \ndefine direct participation, what you really find is that if any \nemployer meets their fiduciary responsibilities, they will have direct \nparticipation. In other words, employers can be sued for unlimited \namounts, with no limit on economic damages and no limit on noneconomic \ndamages. That means no limit on pain and suffering. That is where you \nget the large jury awards. You can be sued for that amount in Federal \ncourt. You can be sued for that amount in State court with no limits--\nwith unlimited economic and noneconomic damages.\n  Employers beware. If you want to protect employers, vote for the \nGramm amendment.\n  You always hear people say: Oh, we want to go after the HMOs; they \nare exempt from liability, and so on. But it is not our intention to go \nafter employers.\n  Employers are mentioned in this bill, and they are liable under this \nbill.\n  There was action taken in the bill to protect physicians. There is a \nsection exempting physicians. There is a section exempting hospitals \nand medical providers. We are exempting them but not employers.\n  Senator Harkin said, We want to copy the Texas law nationwide. Texas \nexempted employers. We can do that today. You can avoid going back to \nyour State and having your employer saying, Why did you pass a bill \nthat makes me liable for unlimited damages? You can vote for this \namendment and protect employers. You can vote for this amendment and \nnot only protect employers but employees because when employers find \nout they are liable for unlimited pain and suffering and economic and \nnoneconomic damages, the net result is, unfortunately, a lot of \nemployees--not employers--will lose their coverage.\n  I urge our colleagues to support the Gramm amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in favor of the Grassley motion to \ncommit this legislation to the Finance Committee, the HELP Committee \nand the Judiciary Committee.\n  The legislation before this body is one which will have an enormous \nimpact on medical providers, the health insurance industry, employers \nand, most important, the patients. As the ranking Republican of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, I have serious concerns with the liability \nprovisions of this bill and how they will be impact employers, medical \nproviders and patients. The McCain-Kennedy bill creates new causes of \naction, changes the\n\n[[Page S6879]]\n\ncareful balance of ERISA's uniformity rules, and has potential new \nadverse implications on our judicial system. Moreover, the liability \nprovisions have been crafted without the benefit of appropriate and \nnecessary review of the appropriate committees of jurisdiction. My \ncolleagues, this is not the way to legislate. At the very least, the \nJudiciary Committee should be afforded the opportunity to review the \nliability provisions that will clearly have a major impact on our legal \nsystem.\n  Just a few months ago, when the bankruptcy reform legislation was \nbrought to the Senate floor under rule 14, the legislation had been \nconsidered by the Judiciary Committee, the entire Senate and a \nbipartisan conference committee over the last 6 years. However, \nDemocrats raised objections then that the bill needed to be reviewed by \nthe Judiciary Committee before consideration on the Senate floor. As a \nresult, we followed regular order and the committee reviewed the bill \nafter which it was sent to the Senate floor for consideration.\n  Now the tactics of my friends on the other side is to bypass the \ncommittees altogether which is exactly what they vocally opposed on \nbankruptcy reform legislation just a few months ago. Moreover, we now \nhave the third iteration of the liability provisions which is less than \na week old. Clearly, the legal ramifications of these provisions are \nnot well known, and I think it would be in the best interest of this \nlegislation to craft language that is truly going to help patients \nwhich we all have been saying is our No. 1 priority.\n  The provisions in the McCain-Kennedy legislation make sweeping \nchanges that will affect our judicial system. This bill changes Federal \nlaw and permits various causes of action in both State and Federal \ncourts. It also changes the rules governing class action lawsuits, as \nwell as impacting punitive damages all the while exposing new classes \nof individuals to open-ended liability.\n  I want to emphasize that these are all critical important, legal \nissues that must be considered carefully. The regular process of the \nSenate should not be circumvented for the political expediencies of my \nfriends on the other side. Why rush this important bill through the \nSenate? According to the Congressional Budget Office, this legislation \nwill cause premiums to increase by at least 4.2 percent. As a result, \nit is estimated that 1.3 million Americans will lose their health \ninsurance because health premiums will become too expensive. Even \nworse, employers benefits altogether for fear of more expanded \nliability exposure under so-called bipartisan Democrat proposal.\n  Shouldn't we hear from experts and other legal scholars in an open \nforum before passing such a monumental bill that impacts so many \nAmericans? It is very apparent to everyone in this Chamber that the \ntrial lawyers have been principally involved in drafting these \nliability provisions and they have done so with their own interest in \nmind. And believe me, as a former medical malpractice attorney, I know \nwhat their tricks are, and I know what they are trying to do. This \nprovisions are simply not in the best interest of the American people.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support his motion to commit. It \nis incumbent upon us to do this right and to do this in the best \ninterest of patients, not trial attorneys. I am confident that with a \nlittle extra time, we can make these provisions legally sound. We have \nspent far too many years on this issue not to do it right. We have a \nreal opportunity to pass meaningful patients' rights legislation. Let \nus not squander this opportunity by acting expeditiously without the \nbenefit of more careful and thoughtful review.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, could you tell me how much time the two \nsides have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 4 minutes and a half. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has almost 12 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I would like my amendment to close out \nthe debate.\n  Does Senator Grassley have time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has 5 minutes. You have 9 minutes. The \nSenator from Massachusetts has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me just allow the majority to go ahead.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to the Senator from Texas, I think it is perfectly \nreasonable for you to have the last 5 minutes.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer that one of us be recognized so that the \nSenator from Texas has the final 5 minutes.\n  The Senator from Iowa wants----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Two minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reid). Did the Senator from Arizona \npropose a unanimous consent request that the Senator from Texas have \nthe final 5 minutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And that the Senator from Iowa have 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. That will \nbe the order.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have spoken twice on the issue of \ncommitting this legislation to the committees to express the point of \nview that there is a lot of turmoil in working out compromises on the \nfloor of the Senate. That is not a very good way to draft a piece of \nlegislation.\n  If the leadership had not immediately brought this bill to the Senate \nChamber, and the committees had done their work, this bill would have \nbeen handled in a much more expeditious way, but, more importantly, it \nwould have been in a way in which we would have had a lot of confidence \nin the substance of the legislation, with a lot fewer questions asked. \nI think when people see a product from the Senate, they want to make \nsure that product is done right.\n  So I offer to my colleagues the motion and hope that they will vote \nyes on the motion to commit the legislation to the respective \ncommittees--Health, Education, Labor; Judiciary; and Finance--for the \nfair consideration of this legislation and a final, good product that \nwe know serves the best interests of the people, which obviously is to \nmake sure that everybody is protected with a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona is now recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think it is important, because of the \nissue of what is happening or not happening in the State of Texas and \nTexas State law, that I take a few minutes to quote from a letter I \njust received from the President of the Texas Medical Association, Dr. \nTom Hancher, who also was a key player in the formulation of the \nlanguage and the legislation that passed the State of Texas in 1997.\n  I would like to quote from the letter that Mr. Hancher sent me:\n\n       I have been watching the debate over the Patients' Bill of \n     Rights and can understand the confusion over many of the \n     issues. We, in Texas, debated managed care reforms for over \n     two years culminating in the passage of a package of managed \n     care reforms in Texas in 1997. Because Texas' laws have \n     become the basis for evaluating certain aspects of proposed \n     federal reforms, I hope I can help to clarify some areas for \n     you. As Texas Medical Association worked closely with the \n     sponsors of these reforms, including the managed care \n     accountability statute, I would like to offer our experiences \n     on this issue. . . . I will focus on the three areas of \n     primary disagreement--employer exemption, medical necessity \n     standards for independent review, and remedies under Texas' \n     managed care accountability law.\n       Much as you are seeing in Washington, our lawmakers were \n     deluged with concerns about employers being legally \n     accountable for the actions of the managed care plan. We \n     believed that this was impossible given the construction of \n     our legislation. Both the definition of a managed care plan \n     and the action of that plan--making medical treatment \n     decisions--prevented such lawsuits from being brought. \n     Nevertheless, the insurers and employers continued to express \n     their concerns that our bill would cost hundreds of citizens \n     their medical coverage because of the fear of litigation.\n       We agree with your approach that any entity making medical \n     treatment decisions should be held accountable for those \n     decisions. Texas took a different approach in 1997, however, \n     because we knew that no state law could achieve that goal. \n     ERISA law in 1997 was such that no state law could hold \n     employers of large self-funded plans accountable for actions \n     related to their benefit plans. . . .\n       We were certain that small to medium sized employers in our \n     state were providing health benefits through fully insured, \n     state licensed products. Clearly, those employers\n\n[[Page S6880]]\n\n     were not making medical treatment decisions. While it was the \n     intent of the Texas Legislature to hold accountable any \n     entity making medical treatment decisions, it was our belief \n     that because of ERISA, a blanket exemption for employers in a \n     state law would have no practical impact on the large, self-\n     funded employers. Therefore, we provided a broad employer \n     exemption primarily to allay the fears of small and medium-\n     sized, fully-insured businesses over exposure to legal \n     liability for medical decisions.\n\n  The reason why I quote this is because that is basically the language \nwe are using in this legislation.\n\n       The Senate co-sponsor of the managed care accountability \n     bill said it best on the floor of the Texas Senate: ``If an \n     HMO stands in the shoes of the doctor in the treatment room, \n     and stands in the shoes of the doctor in the operating room \n     or the emergency room, then it should stand in the shoes of \n     the doctor in the courtroom.'' It is hard to argue why this \n     philosophy should not apply to anyone making those direct \n     medical decisions, HMOs or the very few employers who do \n     this. Any employer who decides not to make these decisions \n     very clearly is not subject to a lawsuit.\n       Our goal in constructing the independent review (IRO) \n     provision of our bill was a simple one: use independent \n     physicians to evaluate disputes over proposed medical \n     treatment. We require these physicians to utilize the best \n     available science and clinical information, generally \n     accepted standards of medical care, and consideration for any \n     unique circumstances of the patient to determine whether \n     proposed care was medically necessary and appropriate. Our \n     standards are virtually identical with the independent review \n     provisions in the McCain/Edwards compromise currently pending \n     before the Senate.\n\n  I repeat, the Texas Medical Association President says: Our standards \nare virtually identical with the independent review provisions in the \nMcCain/Edwards compromise currently pending before the Senate.\n\n       Review decisions were to be made without regard for any \n     definition of medical necessity in plan documents. The Texas \n     Department of Insurance reviews the plan contract for \n     specific exclusions or limitations (i.e., number of days or \n     treatments). If there is no specific contract provision to \n     exclude the eligibility for review, the case is submitted to \n     the independent review organization. Medical necessity is \n     often a judgment call. We wanted those judgments made without \n     any conflict of interest. Medical necessity definitions \n     created by plans will likely err in favor of the plan. An \n     IRO's decision should be a neutral one. Using a plan \n     definition would prevent that. Additionally, we do not define \n     ``medical necessity,'' but rather set forth broad standards \n     for reviewers to make an informed decision based upon all \n     available information. . . .\n       Finally, there has been a great deal of confusion over \n     damages in personal injury or wrongful death cases in our \n     state. Currently, Texas has no caps on economic or non-\n     economic damages. Punitive damages are calculated using the \n     following formula: two times the amount of economic damages, \n     plus an amount not to exceed $750,000 of any non-economic \n     damage award. We chose to treat managed care plans as any \n     other business. Therefore, they are accountable under general \n     tort law and not subject to the cap on damages in wrongful \n     death cases. The limitation on recovery in wrongful death \n     cases applies only to health care entities and is part of a \n     separate section of our law.\n       The debate in Texas over patient protections was long, \n     sometimes contentious, and ultimately successful. With over \n     1300 independent reviews (48% upheld the plans' determination \n     and 52% overturned the plans' decision) and only 17 \n     lawsuits--\n\n  I want to emphasize: Only 17 lawsuits--\n\n     I am proud of how our laws are working for the people of \n     Texas enrolled in managed care plans. On behalf of my \n     colleagues and our patients, I ask that you not take any \n     action that would undermine what we have done in our state. \n     Best wishes in your deliberations.\n\n  It is signed: Tom Hancher, MD, President of the Texas Medical \nAssociation.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to read this letter from Dr. Hancher. I \nthink it lays out the issues surrounding this particular amendment and \nremaining areas of dispute that we might have.\n  Mr. President, I cannot support the pending amendment because I \nbelieve that employers should be held accountable for medical decisions \nthey have made if those decisions resulted in a patient's injury or \ndeath.\n  I do not believe employers should be held liable for the decisions \nmade by insurers or doctors. Nor do I believe this legislation would \nsubject employers throughout the country to a tidal wave of litigation \nas our opponents claim.\n  But if an employer acts like an insurance company and retains direct \nresponsibility for making medical decisions about their employee's \nhealth care then they should be held accountable if their decisions \nharm or even kill someone.\n  If an employer is not making medical decisions, and very few \nemployers do, then they will not be held liable under our legislation.\n  Let me repeat--employers will not be held liable or exposed to \nlawsuits if they do not retain responsibility for directly \nparticipating in medical decisions.\n  I keep hearing from opponents of our bipartisan bill that our \nlanguage is vague and would subject employers to frequent litigation in \nstate and Federal court. I don't believe this is true.\n  Our legislation specifically states that direct participation is \ndefined as ``the actual making of [the] decision or the actual exercise \nof control in making [the] decision or in the [wrongful] conduct.'' \nThis language clearly exempts businesses from liability for every type \nof action except specific actions that are the direct cause of harm to \na patient.\n  The sponsors of this legislation are willing, however, indeed we \nwould welcome an amendment that helps further clarify the employer \nexemptions provided for in the bill. I know that Senators Snowe, DeWine \nand others are working on such an amendment.\n  But we cannot, in the interest of greater clarity, give employers a \nkind of blanket immunity when they assume the role of insurers and \ndoctors by making life and death decisions for their employees. That is \nwhat the pending amendment would do.\n  Let's just step back for a moment and reflect on how the employer \nbased health care system is structured and works. An employer contracts \nwith an insurer to provide health care coverage for their employees. \nThe insurer is then responsible for making the medical decisions that \ngo with managing health insurance. That is how the system typically \nworks and how employers want it to work.\n  Most businesses simply do not make medical decisions. Hank who runs a \nlocal plumbing company does not tell the HMO his company has contracted \nwith, ``We have clogged drains and need Joe Smith back at work. We \ncan't afford for him to be laid up waiting for surgery.'' And Hank \nwould not be held liable under our bill because he is not practicing \nmedicine--he is repairing plumbing.\n  Now, I admit there are a small group, of mostly very large companies \nthat have chosen to provide insurance to their employees themselves.\n  In these small number of cases, employers have made the decision to \nsell plumbing and act as an insurer that makes medical decisions.\n  And if the decisions they make harms or kills someone then why should \nthey have a blanket exemption from liability as this pending amendment \nwould provide them, a blanket exemption that we do not provide doctors \nor nurses or hospitals?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy have 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, let me yield myself the time. As I \nunderstand, the Senator from Texas is going to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this legislation is very simple. The \npoint of the overall Patients' Bill of Rights is to permit doctors to \nmake the final, ultimate decision on what is in the best interest of \nthe patient. Doctors, nurses, trained personnel, and the family should \nbe making that judgment. However, we find that the HMOs are overriding \nthem.\n  Now we have put this into the legislation. If it is demonstrated with \ninternal and external appeals that a HMO has overridden the doctors, \nthey are going to have a responsibility towards the patient. They are \ngoing to have to give that person, who might have been irreparably \nhurt, or the patient's family, if the patient died, the opportunity to \nhave some satisfaction.\n  What the Gramm amendment says is, if that same judgment is made by \nthe employers, they are somehow going to be free and clear. He can \ndistort, misrepresent and misstate what is in this legislation, but we \nknow what is in the legislation. What it does is hold the employer that \nis acting in the place of the HMO accountable. If the employer is \nmaking a medical decision that may harm an individual or patient, or \nmay cause that patient's life or serious illness, they should bear \nresponsibility.\n\n[[Page S6881]]\n\nUnder the Gramm amendment, they can be free and clear of any kind of \nresponsibility no matter how badly hurt that patient is.\n  That is absolutely wrong. I can see the case where the HMO is sued. \nThe HMO says: Don't speak to me; it was the employer that did it. And \nthen the employer says: Look, the Gramm amendment was passed. We are \nnot responsible at all. This amendment is another loophole. It is a \npoison pill. It is a way to basically undermine the whole purpose of \nthe legislation.\n  Doctors and nurses should be making medical decisions and not the HMO \nbean counters who are looking out for the profits of the HMOs. \nEmployers should not be making these medical decisions either. They may \nsay, every time my employee has some medical procedure that is over \n$50,000, call me, HMO. I don't want to pay more than $50,000. Then the \nHMO calls them up and the employer says, no way, don't give that kind \nof medical treatment to my employee. The HMO listens to the employer, \nthe patient does not get that treatment, and dies. Under the Gramm \namendment, there will be no accountability.\n  I hope his amendment is defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Iowa has 2 minutes, followed by the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Senator from Iowa has spoken. I assume if we add up \nthe time, I have 7 minutes. I would like to take it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, nothing in this amendment has anything to \ndo with HMOs. Nothing in the amendment that I have offered would in any \nway exempt any HMO from any liability. Both Senator Kennedy and Senator \nMcCain talked about HMO liability. Senator McCain talked about HMOs \nstanding in the shoes of doctors. This amendment I have offered is not \nabout HMOs.\n  Senator Kennedy talks about HMOs escaping liability by blaming it on \nthe employer. Nothing in the amendment I have offered in any way would \nallow that to happen.\n  The amendment I have offered has to do with employers. Why is this an \nissue? It is an issue because, in America, employers are not required \nto provide health insurance. Employers, large and small, all over \nAmerica provide health insurance because they care about their \nemployees and because they want to attract and hold good employees. But \nevery employer in America has the right under Federal law to drop their \nhealth insurance.\n  I am concerned, and many are concerned, that employers would be \nforced to drop their health insurance given the liability provisions in \nthe bill.\n  I have here a number of letters from business organizations endorsing \nmy amendment. I send to the desk and ask unanimous consent that these \nletters be printed in the Record: an NFIB letter designating this a \nsmall business vote; a letter from Advancing Business Technology \nrepresenting the AEA; the National Association of Manufacturers; the \nNational Council of Chain Restaurants; the National Restaurant \nAssociation; and the National Association of Wholesalers and \nDistributors, all letters endorsing the Gramm amendment; and finally, a \nwonderful letter from the Printing Industry of America talking about \nthe dilemma they would face if this amendment did not pass.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                   of Wholesaler-Distributors,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2001.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: Thank you for offering an amendment to \n     S. 1052, the McCain-Kennedy ``Bipartisan Patient Protection \n     Act,'' to shield employers from liability lawsuits authorized \n     by the bill. We write on behalf of the 40,000 employers \n     affiliated with the National Association of Wholesaler-\n     Distributors (NAW) to express our strong support for this \n     critically important amendment.\n       The vast majority of NAW-affiliated employers voluntarily \n     offer health insurance as an employee benefit. Those employer \n     sponsors of group health insurance benefits are already \n     alarmed by repeated annual increases in health insurance \n     premiums and the growing pressure health insurance costs are \n     placing on their bottom lines. These employers are deeply \n     concerned about the additional premium cost increases with \n     which they will be confronted if the McCain-Kennedy bill \n     becomes law. It is quite clear that many will manage these \n     cost increases by terminating or, at a minimum scaling back, \n     their plans.\n       NAW members are further concerned about the exposure to \n     costly lawsuits and liability they will face if the McCain-\n     Kennedy bill becomes law and they continue to voluntarily \n     offer health insurance as an employee benefit. Many will \n     manage the newly-acquired risk by terminating their plans \n     altogether.\n       The proponents of the McCain-Kennedy bill have repeatedly \n     claimed that S. 1052 shields employers from liability. As you \n     have so clearly demonstrated, it does not, and should S. 1052 \n     become law in its current form, the consequence of its \n     failure in this regard will leave many Americans who today \n     benefit from employer-provided medical coverage, without \n     health insurance coverage in the future. This dramatic \n     undermining of our employer-based health insurance system is \n     clearly adverse to the interests of employers, their \n     employees and their employees' families.\n       There are other serious weaknesses in the McCain-Kennedy \n     bill with which NAW members are concerned; however, adoption \n     of your amendment will at least mitigate one of the worst \n     excesses of the McCain-Kennedy bill. Therefore, NAW is \n     pleased to support your amendment, and we thank you for your \n     leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dirk Van Dongen,\n                                                        President.\n     James A. Anderson, Jr.,\n     Vice President-Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              National Restaurant Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2001.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: As debate continues on S. 1052, the \n     McCain-Kennedy-Edwards patients' rights bill, the National \n     Restaurant Association sincerely appreciates your amendment \n     to clarify the Senate's intent that employers will not be \n     subject to liability for voluntarily providing health \n     benefits to their employees. A vote in support of the Gramm \n     employer liability amendment will be considered a key vote by \n     the National Restaurant Association.\n       The majority of America's 844,000 restaurants are small \n     businesses with average unit sales of $580,000. Rather than \n     risk frivolous lawsuits and unlimited damages authorized \n     under S. 1052, many businesses will be forced to stop \n     offering health benefits to their employees. Even without the \n     effect of litigation risk economists predict at least 4-6 \n     million Americans could lose their employer-sponsored health \n     coverage as a result of the increased costs of S. 1052. We \n     urge you to avert this harmful situation.\n       By taking language from the Texas patients' rights bill, \n     your amendment will clearly define that employers would not \n     be subject to liability. This amendment is critical given \n     that S. 1052 currently exposes employer sponsors of health \n     plans to liability and limitless damages in the following \n     ways:\n       Lawsuits are authorized against any employer that has \n     ``actual exercise of control in making such decision.'' [p. \n     146] This broad phrase would generate lawsuits by allowing an \n     alleged action by the employer to constitute ``control'' over \n     how a claims decision was made. ERISA's fiduciary \n     responsibility obligates employers to exercise authority over \n     benefit determinations.\n       Lawsuits are authorized for any alleged failure to \n     ``exercise ordinary care in the performance of a duty under \n     the terms and conditions of the plan.'' [p. 141]. Under \n     ``ordinary care,'' simple administrative errors could become \n     the basis of a lawsuit alleging harm. Because all provisions \n     of S. 1052 would be incorporated as new ``terms and \n     conditions'' of the plan upon enactment, these new statutory \n     requirements would further expand employer liability.\n       Nothing in S. 1052 precludes a lawsuit against employers \n     who will be forced to defend themselves in state and federal \n     courts against allegations of ``direct participation'' in \n     decision making. [p. 145]\n       Thank you for your effort to protect employees' health \n     benefits by correcting the vague and contradictory language \n     in S. 1052. We urge the Senate to support your amendment to \n     ensure that employers will not be sued for voluntarily \n     providing health coverage to 172 million workers. The Gramm \n     employer liability amendment will be a key vote for the \n     Association. Thank you for your leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n     Steven C. Anderson,\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer.\n     Lee Culpepper,\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Government Affairs and Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: I write in strong support of the \n     amendment you have offered with your colleague from Texas, \n     Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, to the McCain-Kennedy \n     ``Bipartisan Patient Protection Act.''\n\n[[Page S6882]]\n\n     We hope that all Senators who agree that employers who \n     voluntarily sponsor health-coverage should be protected from \n     liability will support your amendment.\n       There should no longer be any dispute that the McCain-\n     Kennedy bill exposes employers to direct and indirect \n     liability costs for adverse benefit determinations. Whether \n     or not employers actively intervene into a given benefit \n     determination, they are charged with responsibility for all \n     aspects of plan administration under ERISA's fiduciary \n     responsibility standard (including benefit determinations). \n     Thus, an employer can either actively or passively meet the \n     McCain-Kennedy bill's standard of ``direct participation'' \n     (the act of denying benefits or the actual exercise of \n     authority over the act).\n       The Gramm-Hutchison Amendment is the Texas Health Care \n     Liability Act's unambiguous exemption of employers as adapted \n     to ERISA. We certainly hope a majority of senators will agree \n     on the need to protect employers from health care liability.\n       The National Association of Manufacturers will continue to \n     oppose the underlying McCain-Kennedy bill as adding too much \n     additional cost to the existing double-digit (13 percent on \n     average) health-care inflation. The rising cost of health-\n     coverage, together with the high cost of energy, is exerting \n     a significant drag on the economy. The Senate, however, \n     should be heard on the specific question of health-care \n     liability for employers.\n       Again, we urgently ask your support for the Gramm-Hutchison \n     Amendment (Senate Amendment 810) which will be considered for \n     designation as a key manufacturing vote in the NAM Voting \n     Record for the 107th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Michael Elias Baroody,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   National Retail Federation,\n\n                                                    June 25, 2001.\n     To the Members of the U.S. Senate:\n       Tomorrow morning, you will have the opportunity to vote on \n     a critically important amendment offered by Senator Gramm to \n     the Kennedy-McCain ``Patient Protection Act of 2001'' that \n     will exempt employers from new lawsuits authorized by the \n     legislation. On behalf of the National Retail Federation \n     (NRF), I strongly urge you to support this amendment. The \n     vote on the Gramm amendment will be a key vote for NRF.\n       At a time when retailers are struggling to deal with annual \n     double-digit increases in health costs, subjecting employers \n     to liability would be the breaking point for many businesses. \n     Many employers would be forced to terminate or significantly \n     scale back their health benefits programs rather than face a \n     lawsuit that could bankrupt their business--leaving many \n     working Americans without access to affordable insurance. The \n     Gramm amendment will unquestionably help to preserve the \n     ability of employers to provide valuable health benefits to \n     their employees and their families.\n       Although passage of the Gramm amendment would address one \n     of the most serious flaws in S. 1052, it is important to note \n     that we remain concerned and strongly opposed to the broader \n     liability provisions in the bill. Although NRF supports the \n     goals of the legislation to ensure that individuals have the \n     ability to address their disputes through an independent \n     appeals process, allowing broad new causes of action in state \n     and federal court for virtually uncapped damages would have \n     dire consequences on the employer-based health care system. \n     The costs of open-ended liability on health plans will \n     ultimately be borne by employers and employees alike.\n       As background, the National Retail Federation (NRF) is the \n     world's largest retail trade association with membership that \n     comprises all retail formats and channels of distribution \n     including department, specialty, discount, catalog, Internet \n     and independent stores. NRF members represent an industry \n     that encompasses more than 1.4 million U.S. retail \n     establishments, employs more than 20 million people--about 1 \n     in 5 American workers--and registered 2000 sales of $3.1 \n     trillion. NRF's international members operate stores in more \n     than 50 nations. In its role as the retail industry's \n     umbrella group, NRF also represents 32 national and 50 state \n     associations in the U.S. as well as 36 international \n     associations representing retailers abroad.\n       Again, we urge you to support the Gramm amendment, and to \n     support future efforts to remedy the onerous liability \n     provisions in S. 1052.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                            ------\n     Senior Vice President, Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Council of Chain Restaurants of the National \n           Retail Federation,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: On behalf of the National Council of \n     Chain Restaurants, I am writing to thank you for introducing \n     your amendment to protect employers from liability lawsuits \n     authorized by the Kennedy-McCain ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' \n     currently being debated by the Senate.\n       The National Council of Chain Restaurants (``NCCR'') is a \n     national trade association representing forty of the nation's \n     largest multi-unit, multi-state chain restaurant companies. \n     These forty companies own and operate in excess of 50,000 \n     restaurant facilities. Additionally, through franchise and \n     licensing agreements, another 70,000 facilities are operated \n     under their trademarks. In the aggregate, NCCR's member \n     companies and their franchises employ in excess of 2.8 \n     million individuals.\n       Although most of the nation's chain restaurant company \n     employers offer health care benefits to their employees, \n     these employers have become increasingly concerned with the \n     skyrocketing costs of providing such coverage. In fact, many \n     employers are already being forced to reevaluate whether they \n     can continue to afford providing health care insurance to \n     their employees. The Kennedy-McCain bill's imposition of \n     liability on health plans will exacerbate this problem even \n     further, as health insurers will simply pass on the costs to \n     employers in the form of higher premiums. As costs are driven \n     ever upward, many employers will assuredly be forced out of \n     the market, pushing even more working families into the ranks \n     of the 43 million uninsured.\n       But the Kennedy-McCain bill not only renders health plans \n     liable to suit, it also imposes liability on employers, \n     despite claims by bill proponents that employers are \n     shielded. The very notion that an employer could be sued for \n     generously and voluntarily providing health insurance to his \n     or her employees is outrageous. Indeed, if employers are \n     exposed to liability for their voluntary provision of health \n     insurance to their employees, in addition to the increased \n     premium costs resulting from health plan liability under the \n     Kennedy-McCain bill, many employers will have no choice but \n     to discontinue this important employee benefit.\n       The Kennedy-McCain bill threatens to undermine the nation's \n     employer-sponsored health care system at a time when the \n     economy is softening and millions of Americans are currently \n     without coverage. Although serious problems with S. 1052 \n     remain, your amendment would correct one of the numerous \n     excesses of this extreme legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  M. Scott Vinson,\n     Director, Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Advancing the Business\n\n\n                                                of Technology,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: I am writing on behalf of AeA (American \n     Electronics Association), the nation's largest high-tech \n     trade association representing more than 3,500 of the \n     nation's leading U.S.-based technology companies, including \n     235 high-tech companies in Texas, to thank you for offering \n     your amendment to exempt employers from the liability \n     provisions contained in S. 1052, the Bipartisan Patient \n     Protection Act.\n       An overwhelming majority of AeA member companies provide \n     their employees, their dependents, and retirees with quality \n     health care options. AeA and its member companies are \n     concerned that the liability provisions in S. 1052 would \n     threaten our member companies' ability to continue to offer \n     health insurance benefits. It only makes sense that exposing \n     employers who provide health insurance to their employees to \n     unlimited legal damages will result in fewer employers \n     offering their employees' health insurance. Unlimited damage \n     awards against insurance companies and employers will create \n     a powerful incentive for lawsuits against both. At a minimum, \n     companies that offer health insurance will see their \n     litigation costs increase. Health insurance premiums will \n     also increase, as litigation costs are passed through to both \n     employers and employees.\n       Higher health insurance premiums will mean fewer health \n     insurance options for employees, and in some cases, the loss \n     of insurance coverage for employees as companies drop health \n     insurance. The liability provisions in S. 1052 will also put \n     pressure on companies to drop their health insurance \n     benefits, primarily from individuals and institutions that \n     own stock in these companies. Shareholders will be reluctant \n     to permit companies to assume liability for employer-provided \n     health insurance and they may pressure companies to drop \n     their health insurance in order to protect the value of their \n     stock.\n       AeA and its members share Congress' concern about improving \n     the accessibility, affordability and quality of health care \n     services for all Americans. But AeA and its members believe \n     that S. 1052, especially the liability provisions in the \n     bill, will undermine that worthy objective, and ultimately \n     lead to more uninsured workers. AeA supports your amendment \n     to S. 1052, as the first in many needed steps to improve this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                William T.

Phil Gramm's amendment exempting all \n     employers from liability who voluntarily offer health care to \n     their employees.\n       The Kennedy/McCain version of the ``Patients' Bill of \n     Rights'' exposes small business owners to liability for \n     unlimited punitive and compensatory damages that will force \n     many small businesses to drop coverage. For\n\n[[Page S6883]]\n\n     most small business owners, it only takes one lawsuit to \n     force them to close their doors. In fact, 57 percent of small \n     businesses said in a recent poll that they would drop \n     coverage rather than risk a lawsuit.\n       Expanding liability in claims disputes could also increase \n     health care premiums by as much as 8.6 percent at a time when \n     small businesses are already experiencing annual cost \n     increases in excess of 15 percent. Such increases will only \n     force small businesses to drop coverage, adding many to the \n     ranks of the uninsured.\n       Both Republicans and Democrats have said that the Texas law \n     works. Now is the time to put those words into action. \n     Support Senator Gramm's amendment to exempt employers from \n     unlimited lawsuits! This will be an NFIB Key Small Business \n     Vote for the 107th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Federal Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Printing Industries\n\n\n                                             of America, Inc.,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, June 22, 2001.\n     Senator Phil Gramm,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: We are aware that the battle lines in \n     the Patients' Bill of Rights may be so sharply drawn that \n     there is little that can be done at this point to overcome \n     the political issues; however, I want to outline the real \n     world impact of passage of the Kennedy-McCain bill.\n       Our association is 114 years old. For a good portion of our \n     recent history we have provided health benefits to our \n     employees through a self-funded trust. We chose this option \n     because we are a safe workplace and we have very good claims \n     experience as well as a solid balance sheet. We purchase \n     stop-loss insurance for protection of the assets of the \n     organization above a specified limit. We provide benefits to \n     70 active employees, their dependents, and 14 retirees. Until \n     1974, we provided a retiree medical program for all our \n     employees but rising costs forced us to drop that program, \n     grand-fathering the employees who were hired prior to that \n     time. We require only $50 contribution per month for our \n     employees to include their dependents in our health care \n     plan. We cover medical, dental and eye care through a PPO \n     network or, at the option of the employee, a fee for service \n     arrangement. Our prescription drug program requires an \n     employee to pay $3.00 per generic prescription and $5.00 for \n     brand name prescriptions. This is about the best plan \n     available to any employee in the Washington area.\n       We are the ultimate decision maker in our plan. One of the \n     benefits to self-funding is that we can and do make decisions \n     affecting the health care of our employees. We have never \n     made a negative decision. We have made several very \n     significant positive decisions to help employees in very \n     difficult health situations.\n       If the Kennedy-McCain bill is passed, we likely will be \n     forced to terminate our plan and move to a fully insured \n     plan. We currently pay almost $600,000 per year for our plan. \n     We cannot pay any more. Moving to a fully insured plan will \n     almost certainly reduce the benefits for our employees as we \n     will lose the advantage of not having to pay overhead for an \n     insurance company. We anticipate losing 25% of our benefits. \n     Here are some of the things we will lose:\n       Our retiree program. When we renegotiated our plan this \n     past year, we received proposals from insurance companies for \n     our retiree program. We could not find one in the area who \n     would pick up the plan.\n       Our prescription drug benefit. While we would not lose it, \n     we would have to more than triple the price to $10/$20. This \n     also is based on the proposals we received last year.\n       Our ability to make decisions for our employees and their \n     dependents. We would have to be concerned that the ability to \n     make good decisions has the other side--turning down the next \n     employee. In other words, we could be sued for failing to \n     make a decision. Our organization cannot expose the assets of \n     the organization to that liability potential.\n       Our very small employee contribution. Employees share of \n     the benefits will go up. The $50 per month family coverage \n     will likely be increased to $200 per month. Co-pays and \n     deductibles will also rise. Some coverage may have to be \n     dropped altogether.\n       We have discussed this issue and other Patients' Bill of \n     Rights issues with our employees and member firms. Many \n     people do not understand the issues. They do not believe \n     Congress would do something like this. Our concern is that \n     you may not knowingly do something like this. But this is \n     real.\n       We would be pleased to discuss this and other matters \n     related to this legislation with you. We are not alone in the \n     impact this bill would have on our employees. I am aware that \n     we have many self-insured, jointly trusteed union plans in \n     our industry that would also be affected in this manner but \n     they do not understand the legislation.\n       Please feel free to contact me if you wish to discuss our \n     concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Benjamin Y. Cooper,\n                                            Senior Vice President.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me review very quickly where we are. Our colleagues \nwho support the pending bill say that the bill does not allow employers \nto be sued. If you look at the language of their bill, it clearly says \nit on line 7 on page 144, ``Causes of action against employers and plan \nsponsors precluded.'' Then it says:\n\n       Subject to subparagraph (B), paragraph (1)(A) does not \n     authorize a cause of action against an employer. . . .\n\n  That has been pointed to over and over again to say that employers \ncannot be sued. The problem is that on line 15, the bill goes on and \nsays:\n\n       Certain causes of action permitted.--Notwithstanding \n     subparagraph (A), a cause of action may arise against an \n     employer or other plan sponsor. . . .\n\n  Then the bill goes on for 7\\1/2\\ pages of ifs, ands, and buts about \nwhen employers can be sued. They can be sued if they have ``a \nconnection with;'' they can be sued if they ``exercise control,'' which \nis very interesting because under ERISA, which is the Federal statute \nthat governs employee benefits provided by the employer, every employer \nis deemed to exercise control over every employee benefit.\n  The bottom line is, despite all the arguments to the contrary, in the \nbill before us, employers can be sued.\n  The Texas Legislature faced exactly this same dilemma, and they \nconcluded that they wanted an absolute carve-out of employers. Why? Not \nthat they believed employers were perfect; not that they believed every \nemployer was responsible, but because they couldn't figure out a way to \nget at potential employer misbehavior without creating massive \nloopholes which would produce a situation where employers, large and \nsmall, could be dragged into a courtroom and sued because they cared \nenough about their employees to help them buy health insurance.\n  The Texas Legislature decided you ought not be able to sue an \nemployer.\n  Senator McCain read a letter from the Texas Medical Association \npresident, but he did not read the one paragraph in the letter that I \nwas going to read. It is a very important paragraph. Let me explain \nwhy. Opponents of this amendment say: You ought to be able to sue \nemployers if employers are making medical decisions. The point is, this \nbill--and the Texas law and every Patients' Bill of Rights proposal \nmade by Democrats and Republicans--has an external appeal process that \na panel of physicians and specialists, totally independent of the \nhealth care plan and totally independent of the employer, that will \nexercise the final decisionmaking authority.\n  How could an employer call up this professional panel, independent of \nthe health insurance company or the HMO, and in any way intervene? They \ncouldn't.\n  The line from the letter from the Texas Medical Association addresses \nexactly this point. It points out that the State couldn't reach into \nERISA. But another reason that it wasn't necessary or advisable to try \nto sue employers was, from the letter:\n\n       Additionally, we believed that utilization review--\n\n  And this is the review process--\n\n     agents were making the decisions regarding appropriate \n     medical treatment for employees of these self-funded plans. \n     We contended that these state-licensed utilization review \n     agents would be subject to the managed care accountability \n     statute--\n\n  Which is the Texas law.\n\n  The same would be true under this bill. Under this bill, no employer \ncan make a final decision. The final decision is made by this \nindependent medical review.\n  So what is this all about? It all boils down to the following facts: \nIf we leave this provision in the bill, which says employers can be \nsued and has 7\\1/2\\ pages of ifs, ands, and buts about suing them, and \nthen interestingly enough says you can't sue doctors, you can't sue \nhospitals, but you can sue employers in its conclusion, then what is \ngoing to happen is all over America businesses are going to call in \ntheir employees.\n  The example I used yesterday, and I will close with it today--am I \nout of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me wrap up by saying, all over America, small \nbusinesses are going to call in their employees and say: I want to \nprovide these benefits, but I cannot put my business at risk, which my \nfather, my mother, my family have invested their hearts and souls in; \ntherefore, I am going to have to cancel your health insurance.\n\n[[Page S6884]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I am prepared to yield back the minute \non the Grassley motion. As I understand it, Senator Grassley is going \nto yield back his time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on both the Grassley motion and the Gramm \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 810\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 6 \nminutes for closing debate, divided in the usual form, prior to a vote \non or in relation to the Gramm amendment No. 810.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand there are 3 minutes to a side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself a minute and a half and a minute and a \nhalf to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Madam President, we have just finished the education legislation. In \nthis legislation, we held students accountable, school districts \naccountable, teachers accountable, and children accountable. Now we are \ntrying to hold the HMOs accountable if they override doctors, nurses \nand trained professionals regarding the care for injuries of \nindividuals. That is the objective of this legislation.\n  However, if employers interfere with medical judgments, they ought to \nbe held accountable as well. The Gramm amendment says: No way; even if \nan employer makes a judgment and decision that seriously harms or \ninjures the patient, there is no way that employer could be held \naccountable.\n  We may not have the language right, but at least we are consistent \nwith what the President of the United States has said. We may have \ndifferences with the President of the United States and we do on some \nprovisions. However, the Gramm amendment is an extreme amendment that \nfails to protect the patients in this country and fails to provide that \nneeded protection.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I make a point of order that the Senate \nis not in order. Senator Edwards deserves to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, this is an issue on which we have \nconsensus. The President of the United States said, ``Only employers \nwho retain responsibility for and make vital medical decisions should \nbe subject to suit.''\n  Our bill provides exactly as the President describes. As Senator \nKennedy has indicated, we have consensus not only with the President of \nthe United States but in this body and in the House of Representatives \nbased on the Norwood-Dingell bill which was voted on before. This is an \nissue about which there is consensus.\n  We are continuing to work. Senator Snowe and others are leading that \neffort. We are working across party lines to get stronger and more \nappropriate language so that employers know that they are protected \nwithout completely leaving out the rights of the patients.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Gramm amendment, which is \noutside the mainstream, outside our bill, outside our position, outside \nNorwood-Dingell, and outside what the President of the United States \nhas said.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, throughout this debate, those who are in \nfavor of this bill have said our bill is just like the Texas bill. Look \nat Texas. No employers have been sued, and there have been a minimum \nnumber of lawsuits. Yet when you look at this bill, it says employers \ncan't be sued. Then it says they can be sued. And it has 7\\1/2\\ pages \nof ifs, ands and buts.\n  Are employers connected with the decision? Do they exercise control? \nERISA says that in any employee benefit the employer is deemed to \nexercise control, which would mean that every employer in America is \ncovered. The Texas legislature did not assume that every employer was \nperfect. They were worried about unintended consequences.\n  They also concluded that no employer can be the final decisionmaker \nbecause this bill, as in our bill, has an external review process that \nis run by independent physicians that are selected independently of the \nplan. They make the final decision, not an employer.\n  The Texas legislature decided what we should decide here; that is, if \nyou get into ifs, ands, and buts, what is going to happen all over \nAmerica is businesses are going to drop their insurance.\n  If we should pass the bill without this amendment in it, it is easy \nto envision that we could have a small business where the business \nowner calls in his employees and says, Look, we worked hard to provide \ngood health benefits, but my father and my mother worked to build their \nbusiness. I have worked. My wife has worked. We have invested our whole \nfuture in this business, and I cannot continue to provide benefits when \nI might be sued.\n  Think about the unintended consequences. That is what the Texas \nlegislature did. They concluded that employers should not be liable. \nThey cannot make the final decision under this bill. They cannot make \nthe final decision under Texas law because it is made by an external \ngroup of physicians. But when you make it possible to sue them, they \nare going to drop their health insurance, and you are going to have \nfancy reviews and stiff penalties, but people aren't going to have \nhealth insurance.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at Texas. If you want to take all the \nclaims of the benefits of Texas, do it the way they did it. They \nthought you created unintended consequences by letting employers be \nsued. They knew that employers could not make the final decision \nbecause they had external review, just as this bill and every other \nbill has. By doing an employer carve-out, they guaranteed that every \nsmall and large business in the State would know they cannot be sued.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 810. The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 43, nays 57, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6885]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 197 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--43\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--57\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  Mr. REID.

Shrink Missouri Government PAC, \nexpress great certainty that the Supreme Court will never allow our \nbill to take effect.\n  Well, in its decision yesterday morning in FEC v. Colorado Republican \nFederal Campaign Committee, the Court again dumped cold water on that \ncertainty. The court held that the coordinated party spending limits \nnow in the law--the so-called ``441a(d) limits''--are constitutional. \nIt ruled that the coordinated spending limits are justified as a way to \nprevent circumvention of the $1,000 per election limits on \ncontributions to candidates that the Court upheld in the landmark \nBuckley v. Valeo decision in 1976. In my view, the decision makes it \neven more clear that the soft money ban in the McCain-Feingold bill \nwill withstand a constitutional challenge.\n  The first thing to note about the Court's ruling is that it reaffirms \nthe distinction the Court has drawn between contributions and \nexpenditures and the greater latitude that the Court has given Congress \nin the case of restraints on contributions. The Court noted that the \nlaw treats expenditures that are coordinated with candidates as \ncontributions, and the Court has upheld contribution limits in previous \ncases with that understanding. It agreed with the FEC that spending by \na party coordinated with a candidate is functionally equivalent to a \ncontribution to the candidate, and that the right to make unlimited \ncoordinated expenditures would open the door for donors to use \ncontributions to the party to avoid the limits that apply to \ncontributions to candidates.\n  The Court rejected the Colorado Republican Party's argument that \nparty spending is due special constitutional protection. Instead, the \nCourt found that the parties are in the same position as other \npolitical actors who are subject to contribution limits. Those actors \ncannot coordinate their spending with candidates. The Court noted that \nunder current law and the Court's previous decision in the first \nColorado case, the parties are better off than other political actors \nin that they can make independent expenditures and also make \nsignificant, but limited, coordinated expenditures. The limits on \ncoordinated expenditures have not prevented the parties from organizing \nto elect candidates and generating large sums of money to efficiently \nget out their message, the Court noted.\n  After determining that limits on party coordinated spending should be \nanalyzed under the same standard as contribution limits on other \npolitical actors, the Court had little trouble in deciding that there \nwas ample justification for those limits based on the need to avoid \ncircumvention of the contribution limits in the federal election laws. \nIt pointed to substantial evidence of circumvention already in the \ncurrent system, and the near certainty that removing the 441a(d) limits \nwould lead to additional circumvention. The Court held:\n\n       [T]here is good reason to expect that a party's right of \n     unlimited coordinated spending would attract increased \n     contributions to parties to finance exactly that kind of \n     spending. Coordinated expenditures of money donated to a \n     party are tailor-made to undermine contribution limits. \n     Therefore, the choice here is not, as in Buckley and Colorado \n     I, between a limit on pure contributions and pure \n     expenditures. The choice is between limiting contributions \n     and limiting expenditures whose special value as expenditures \n     is also the source of their power to corrupt. Congress is \n     entitled to its choice.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I am pleased that the Court upheld Congress's \nright to limit the coordinated spending of the parties. But even more \nthan that, I am pleased at the way that the Court looked at the \nconstitutional issues in the case and the arguments of the parties. The \nCourt's analysis demonstrates an understanding of the real world of \nmoney and politics that gives me great confidence that it will uphold \nthe soft money ban in the McCain-Feingold bill against an inevitable \nconstitutional challenge.\n  As my partner and colleague, Senator McCain, pointed out to me prior \nto my taking the floor, of course this decision was about hard money; \nbut if you really read it, it isn't so much about hard money or soft \nmoney, it is just about money and the corrupting influence it has on \nour political process.\n  For example, the Court noted that ``the money the parties spend comes \nfrom contributors with their own interests.'' And the Court recognized \nthat those contributors give money to parties in an attempt to \ninfluence the actions of candidates. The Court said:\n\n       Parties are thus necessarily the instruments of some \n     contributors whose object is not to support the party's \n     message to elect party candidates across the board, but \n     rather to support a specific candidate for the sake of a \n     position on one, narrow issue, or even to support any \n     candidate who will be obliged to the contributors.\n\n  This is precisely the point that we who have fought so hard to ban \nsoft money have been making for years. These contributions are designed \nto influence the federal officeholders who raise them for the parties, \nand ultimately, to influence legislation or executive policy. The Court \nshows that it understands this use of contributions to political \nparties when it states:\n\n       Parties thus perform functions more complex than simply \n     electing candidates; whether they like it or not, they act as \n     agents for spending on behalf of those who seek to produce \n     obligated officeholders.\n\n  The Court also recognized that the party fundraising, even of limited \nhard money, provides opportunities for large donors to get special \naccess to lawmakers. The Court states:\n\n\n[[Page S6886]]\n\n\n       Even under present law substantial donations turn the \n     parties into matchmakers whose special meetings and \n     receptions give the donors the chance to get their points \n     across to the candidates.\n\n  In a footnote, the Court notes evidence in the record of the \nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee establishing exclusive clubs \nfor the most generous donors.\n  These special clubs and receptions are even more prevalent in the \nworld of soft money fundraising. Both parties sell access to their \nelected officials for high dollar soft money contributions. This week a \nRepublican fundraiser featuring the President and the Vice President is \nexpected to raise over $20 million.\n  The corrupting influence of soft money, or at least the appearance of \ncorruption created by the extraordinary sums raised by party leaders \nand federal officeholders and candidates, is an argument for the \nconstitutionality of a ban on soft money that those who support the \nMcCain-Feingold bill would have made even if the Colorado II case had \ncome out the other way. But the Court's decision itself is solid \nsupport for another independent reason that the soft money ban is \nconstitutional.\n  Corporations and unions are prohibited from contributing money in \nconnection with federal elections. And individuals are subject to \nstrict limits on their contributions to candidates and parties. The \nsoft money loophole allows those limits to be evaded. This is not just \na theoretical possibility, as in the Colorado case. There is a massive \navoidance of the federal election laws going on today, as there has \nbeen for over a decade. The evidence of this is overwhelming. Soft \nmoney is being raised by candidates for the parties, and it is being \nspent in a whole variety of ways to influence federal elections. In \nrecent years, the parties have used soft money to run ads that are \nvirtually indistinguishable from campaign ads run by the candidates. \nThat is what is going on in the real world.\n  A soft money ban will end the circumvention of these crucial limits \nin the law, limits that date back to 1907 in the case of corporations, \n1947 in the case of unions, and 1974 in the case of individuals. The \nSupreme Court's decision yesterday tells us that Congress can \nconstitutionally act to end that evasion.\n  The remaining question, of course, is whether we will do it. Our vote \nin this body on April 2 was the first step. When the House returns from \nthe July 4th recess it will take up campaign finance reform, and I am \nhopeful that it will act decisively to pass a bill that is largely \nsimilar to the McCain-Feingold bill. Then it will be up to the Senate \nto act quickly and send the bill to President Bush for his signature. \nWe are getting close, Mr. President, to finally cleaning up the corrupt \nsoft money decision. The Supreme Court's decision yesterday, unexpected \nas it was to many in the Senate and in the legal community, is a major \nboost for our efforts. The Court has spoken. Now Congress must act.\n  I yield the remainder of the time under my control to the Senator \nfrom New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I add my thanks and \ngratitude to my good friend from Wisconsin. He has been a leader on \nthis whole issue of campaign finance reform for so many years. He \nstarted as a young boy, and it has taken most of his life. I think \nprogress is being made from a most unlikely source. I applaud the \ncontinued perseverance and commitment of the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/26/senate-section/article/S6886-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6886-S6887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, we are in the midst of this very \nimportant debate about a Patients' Bill of Rights. I am hoping that \nbefore we break for the Fourth of July recess, the doctors, nurses, \npatients, and families of America will have the relief for which we \nhave all waited for a very long time: making it clear doctors should be \nmaking our health care decisions; that nurses, not bookkeepers, should \nbe at our bedsides; and that the Patients' Bill of Rights will be a \nreality.\n  I rise today because we have to consider our broad needs for health \ncare not only in our country but around the world. Today as we meet and \ndebate a Patients' Bill of Rights to make sure that Americans have \naccess to the best health care in the entire world, there are millions \nof people around the world who do not have that opportunity or that \nright. I speak specifically of those who are suffering from HIV/AIDS.\n  We should be supporting vigorously the United Nations General \nAssembly on Meeting the Global HIV/AIDS Challenge and urging them to \nconsider creative tools, such as debt relief, in efforts to combat HIV/\nAIDS.\n  As the general assembly is meeting in special session in New York to \ntry to come up with a strategic blueprint for fighting HIV/AIDS \nworldwide, it is imperative that we in America appreciate that this \nworldwide epidemic has nowhere near crested. Africa is ravaged. It has \njust begun to affect India, China, and Russia. This is an epidemic of \nhistoric proportions, and it needs a response that is historically \nappropriate.\n  Almost 60 million people worldwide have been affected by HIV/AIDS, \nand over 20 million men, women, and children have died. If current \ntrends continue, 50 percent or more of all 15-year-olds in the most \nseverely affected countries will die of AIDS or AIDS-related illnesses.\n  We are in the middle of summer vacation. We have many families and \nyoung people visiting our Capitol. We are always so happy to have them \nhere and for them to take a few minutes to see their Government in \naction, but it is just chilling to imagine American 15-year-olds facing \nbleak futures as orphans or victims because they were born to infected \nmothers.\n  Every American should be concerned with what is going on beyond our \nborders. We should also be concerned because when it comes to disease \ntoday, there are no borders. People get on jet planes, people travel \nall over the world. There is no disease that is confined to any \ngeographic area any longer. We have to recognize that for us to worry \nabout the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa and Asia is not only the right \nthing to do, it is the smart thing to protect ourselves and to protect \nour children.\n  It is also important to recognize that the groundbreaking drug \ntreatments that are keeping people with HIV/AIDS alive today are not \navailable to those who suffer elsewhere. Less than 1 percent of HIV-\ninfected Africans, for example, have access to life-extending \nantiretroviral medications. The challenges facing us are great, and we \nshould work together to combat this global emergency.\n  I strongly support the formation of a global fund for infectious \ndiseases such as AIDS, but also including tuberculosis and malaria. We \nare seeing tuberculosis and malaria in our own country. We are seeing \nthe spread of malaria, which used to be confined to a tropical belt, \nbeginning to move northwards, in part, I believe, because of global \nwarming and desertification, so the mosquitos can travel further north \nand find hosts who traditionally have not suffered from malaria.\n\n  Tuberculosis is becoming epidemic in many parts of the world. In \nRussia, drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major killer.\n  I believe we should have a global fund to combat these infectious \ndiseases, and I am very pleased the United States, private donors, and \nsome other nations have taken steps to address the need for money as \narticulated by Secretary General Kofi Annan. We need between $7 billion \nto $10 billion annually. It is my hope that through a public-private \npartnership we are able to continue to invest in promoting prevention, \ntreatment, and eventually a vaccine to prevent this devastating \ndisease.\n  I am old enough to remember polio as a scourge that affected my life. \nI can remember my mother not letting me go swimming in the local \nswimming pool because of polio. I remember as though it were yesterday \nwhen the announcement of a vaccine was made. What a sense of relief \nthat spread through my house and all of our neighbors, and we all lined \nup to get that shot we thought would protect us from what had been, up \nuntil then, such a serious, overhanging cloud in the lives of young \npeople, as well as older people.\n  HIV/AIDS extracts a severe economic toll on nations worldwide. The \ndisease spreads so rapidly. No one is immune from it. It has grave \nconsequences for societies, and it threatens the interest\n\n[[Page S6887]]\n\nof peace and prosperity around the world.\n  HIV/AIDS alone will reduce the gross domestic product of South Africa \nby $22 billion, or 17 percent, over the next decade. That is why I \nbelieve debt relief must also be part of any conversation about a \nbroader global HIV/AIDS strategy.\n  While most African countries spend less than $10 per capita on health \ncare, they spend up to five times that amount in debt service to \nforeign creditors. In fact, the burdens of debt repayment have come \ninto direct conflict with public health efforts in some instances. For \nexample, structural adjustment programs have sometimes required \ngovernments to charge user fees for visits to medical clinics, a \npractice that stands in the way of effective prevention and treatment \nprograms. As discussions of global HIV/AIDS prevention proceeds, \nconsideration should be given to the role of international debt relief \nin the overall plan to combat HIV/AIDS.\n  I have written to the U.N. General Assembly President Harri Holkeri \nto express my support for his efforts and to urge inclusion of debt \nrelief strategies in any effort that comes out of the general assembly.\n  I also urge our own Government to look more closely at what we can \ndo. In the last administration, we forgave a lot of our bilateral debt \nfor the poorest of the nations, but we should look at expanding beyond \nthe circle of the poorest of the poor to the next poorest of the poor, \nand we should also look at our multilateral debt.\n  I am hoping I will find support on both sides of the aisle for a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution I will be submitting to express the \npolicy view that debt relief can and should be an important tool.\n  I have visited African countries. I have visited Asian countries. I \nhave visited HIV/AIDS programs. I have been in places where 12-year-old \ngirls who were sold into prostitution by their families have come home \nto die in northern Thailand.\n  I have been in programs in Uganda which have done probably the best \njob I know of in Africa certainly to spread the message about how to \nprevent HIV/AIDS. I have listened to the songs that were taken out into \nvillages to tell villagers about this new disease that nobody really \nknows where it came from or how it arrived, but to warn people about \nits deadly consequences.\n  I was fortunate and privileged last year to participate in the United \nNations discussion about AIDS, and I sat with AIDS orphans: A young boy \nfrom Uganda whose father and then mother died of AIDS, leaving him \nresponsible for his younger brothers and sisters; a young boy from \nHarlem whose mother died of AIDS; a young boy from Thailand who was \nalso orphaned by this terrible disease.\n  In some parts of Africa now, one will only find children, and most of \nthem are orphans. The rate of infection ranges from 15 to 35 percent, \nand I am deeply concerned we are still in some parts of the world in a \nstate of denial about HIV/AIDS.\n  Certainly, both India and China face tremendous challenges to educate \ntheir population about this disease and to avoid practices that might \nspread it. It is commonplace in some parts of China for very poor \nvillagers to sell their blood to make a little money. In so doing, they \nare subjecting themselves to the possible transmission of this terrible \ndisease.\n  In other parts of Africa and Asia, even the best intentions to \nimmunize children against measles or other communicable diseases lead \nto tragedy because the sterilization is not up to par and needles are \nreused, leading to the infection of people with HIV/AIDS.\n  I have long maintained there is a deep, profound connection between \nthe economic health of a nation and the physical health of that \nnation's people. That is why we have to act now to address the HIV/AIDS \npandemic.\n  There is so much the United States can and should do. We have the \nfinest health care system in the world. We are the richest nation that \nhas ever existed in the history of the world. We not only should care \nabout people in other parts of the world because of this disease, but \nwe should act in our own self-interest because there will be many parts \nof the world where it will be difficult, potentially even dangerous, to \ntravel if the entire social structure and economy collapses because of \nthe strain of HIV/AIDS, where tourists and business people from America \nwill be told they should not go to do business. Suppose they are in an \naccident or suffer injury and might need medical care and that medical \ncare might not be deliverable because the health care system has \ncollapsed under the weight of HIV/AIDS.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and in our \nUnited States delegation to the United Nations General Assembly special \nsession on these and other desperately needed proposals to halt and \nreverse the social and economic damage caused by HIV/AIDS and the \ndirect and immediate threat this pandemic poses to America and \nAmericans. I urge my colleagues and I urge our Government and the \nUnited Nations to look deeply into the concept of forgiving debt in \nreturn for nations doing what we know works to prevent, treat, and \neventually find a vaccine for this terrible disease.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/26/senate-section/article/S6887-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the cornerstone of an effective patient \nprotection program is the right to timely, fair and independent review \nof disputed medical decisions. This amendment reaffirms a critical \nelement of that right--the right to an independent appeal process that \nis not stacked against patients by giving the HMO the right to select \nthe judge and jury.\n\n[[Page S6888]]\n\n  This is a critical difference between our approach to that issue and \nthe approach of the alternative legislation before the Senate. Under \ntheir bill, the HMO gets to select the so-called independent appeals \norganization. Under our bill, neither the HMO nor the patient selects \nthe appeals organization. Instead, it must be selected by a neutral and \nfair appeals process. This amendment puts the Senate on record as \nsupporting that fair and impartial appeal process.\n  The approach of allowing one party to a dispute--in this case the \nHMO--to select the judge and jury to a dispute is so inherently unfair \nthat it has been rejected out of hand by virtually every expert who has \nconsidered the issue. It flies in the face of every principle and \nprecedent founded on fair play.\n  We don't allow it in our civil court procedures. We don't allow it in \nour criminal procedures. Doesn't a child with cancer whose HMO has \noverruled her doctor deserve at least the same basic fairness we \nprovide for rapists and murderers?\n  The unfair approach of allowing one party to the dispute is not only \nalien to our court system, it is prohibited under the Federal \nArbitration Act. It is unacceptable under the standards of the American \nArbitration Association. It is rejected by the standards of the \nAmerican Bar Association. Of the 39 States that have created \nindependent review organizations, 33 do not allow it; neither should \nthe Senate.\n  Do we understand, in the 39 States that have created independent \nreview organizations, 33 do not allow the HMO to select and pay the \nindependent reviewer; and neither should the Senate.\n  Under the fair external review approach we have in Medicare and in \nmost States, the reviewer decides the plan is right about half the time \nand decides the patient is right about half the time. In the financial \nservices industry, the industry gets to select the reviewer in \ndisputes, and the industry wins 99.6 percent of the time. No wonder \nHMOs want that system: it makes a mockery of the whole idea of \nindependent review. A vote for this amendment is a vote against making \nthis bill a mockery of everything that a true Patients' Bill of Rights \nshould stand for.\n  And how ironic it is that the sponsors of the competing proposal are \nvociferous supporters of the President's principle that we should \npreserve good State laws. But under this amendment, the 39 State \nexternal appeals systems currently in place would be wiped out. Do we \nunderstand? There is one provision in the two major pieces of \nlegislation before us; that is, the McCain-Edwards bill and the Breaux-\nFrist bill. In the Breaux-Frist bill, their appeals provision \neffectively preempts all of those 39 States. They have to follow what \nis in their legislation. As I pointed out, that is the process by which \nthe HMO selects the independent reviewer. They would be null and void, \neven where they provide greater consumer protections than the Federal \nstandard. In all of these instances, the consumer has greater \nprotection than even under the underlying proposal of the McCain-\nEdwards bill.\n\n  We have heard a lot of tragic examples of HMO abuse during the course \nof this debate and through the extensive discussions in the press over \nthe last 5 years. We heard of children denied lifesaving cancer \ntreatment by their HMO. It is wrong to let that same HMO choose the \njudge and jury that could decide whether those children live or die. \nAnd our amendment says it is wrong.\n  We have heard of women with terminal breast and cervical cancer \ndenied the opportunity to participate in clinical trials that could \nsave or extend their life. It is wrong to give that same HMO that \noverruled the treating physician and denied the care the right to chose \nthe judge and jury that could decide whether that woman has a real \nchance to live to see her children grow up or is guaranteed to be dead \nwithin 3 months.\n  We have heard of a young man whose HMO decided that it was cost-\neffective to amputate his injured hand instead of providing the surgery \nthat could restore normal functioning. It is wrong to give the HMO that \nmade that heartless decision the right to choose the judge and jury \nthat could decide whether that young man goes through life with one \nhand or two.\n  We have head of a policeman with a broken hip, whose HMO decided it \nwas better to give him a wheelchair than to pay for the operation that \nwould have restored his normal functioning. It is wrong to give the HMO \nthat put its profits so far ahead of that patient's interests the right \nto choose the judge and jury that will decide whether that man ever \nwalks again.\n  Last week, in discussing the issue of access to specialty care, I \nmentioned what had happened to Carley Christie, a 9-year-old little \ngirl who was diagnosed with Wilms Tumor, a rare and aggressive form of \nkidney cancer. Her family was frightened when they received the \ndiagnosis, but they were relieved to learn that a facility close to \ntheir home in Woodside, CA, was world-renowned for its expertise and \nsuccess in treating this type of cancer--the Lucille Packard Children's \nHospital at Stanford University.\n  The Christie family's relief turned to shock when their HMO told them \nit would not cover Carley's treatment by the children's hospital. \nInstead, they insisted that the treatment be provided by a doctor in \ntheir network--an adult urologist with no experience in treating this \nrare and dangerous childhood cancer. The Christies managed to scrape \ntogether the $50,000 they needed to pay for the operation themselves--\nand today Carley is a cancer-free, healthy and happy teenager. If the \nChristies had been less tenacious or had been unable to come up with \nthe $50,000, there is a good chance that Carley would be dead today.\n  Under our opponents' plan, the HMO that passed a possible death \nsentence on little Carley Christie would have the right to choose the \njudge and jury to determine whether that possible death sentence should \nbe upheld. No family should have to go through what the Christie's did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 more minutes, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No HMO should behave as the Carley's did. And that HMO \nshould certainly not have the right to choose the external review \norganization to decide whether Carley should get the care she needed.\n  Another case that I find particularly shocking is that of Melissa \nYazman, right here in Washington. In May, 1997, Melissa Yazman was a \nsecond year law student at American University, going to school full-\ntime, living in suburban Virginia, working part-time for an attorney in \nD.C., and taking care of her two kids while her husband traveled with \nhis job.\n  In the past 4 years, much has changed for Melissa. Her dreams of law \nschool and a career in the working world are gone, and her new career \nis focused on healing and living every day to enjoy the time she has \nwith her husband and her two sons--Ben who is 11, and Josh who is 8.\n  In the spring, in 1997, at the age of 36, she was diagnosed with \nstage IV pancreatic cancer at the age of 36. Pancreatic cancer is a \nfairly rare cancer, and, for the majority of patients like Melissa, \ndiagnosis is not possible until the cancer is in an advanced stage.\n  Melissa was told that she had 3 to 6 months to live. There are no \ncurative treatments for pancreatic cancer. For most pancreatic cancer \npatients clinical trials are their only hope.\n  Melissa was referred to a clinical trial at Georgetown University. \nHer insurer refused to cover the treatment. Melissa and her husband \nwere forced to go through lengthy and time consuming negotiations with \nthe insurer--negotiations that took her husband away from their \nchildren for 2 to 3 hours a day--negotiations that ultimately ended in \nfailure. She and her husband ended up paying for these costs themselves \nbecause they ran out of time waiting for a decision from her insurer.\n  Because she and her husband had enough money in their savings \naccount, they were able to pay for her routine costs--costs that her \ninsurer should have covered and would cover for a patient not enrolled \nin a lifesaving clinical trial.\n  Because of the therapy she received in a clinical trial, Melissa has \nbeen able to have 4 extra years with her family and with her young \nboys. Without the clinical trial, she would have\n\n[[Page S6889]]\n\nhad 3-6 months. Every patient with incurable cancer hopes for \nenrollment in a clinical trial that can save or extend their life. No \npatient should have their hopes dashed because their insurer simply \nsays no. And no patient like Melissa should have their right to a fair, \nimpartial appeal voided because the HMO that said ``no'' gets to choose \nthe organization that will decide the case.\n  For cancer patients, for women, for children--indeed, for every \npatient whose HMO denies critically needed cars--the right to a speedy, \nfair, impartial appeal should be a fundamental right. This amendment \nwill put the Senate on record as saying that this appeal should truly \nbe fair and impartial, that it will not load the dice and stack the \ndeck against patients. Every Senator knows that this amendment \nrepresents simple justice, and I urge every Senator to vote for what \nthey know to be right.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           RECORDING OF VOTE\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I want to indicate that on rollcall \nvote No. 197, I was present and voted ``no.'' The official record has \nme listed as absent. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the \nofficial record be corrected to accurately reflect my vote. This will \nin no way change the outcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded. How much time is on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining on the proponents' \nside, and there are 14 minutes 44 seconds on the opponents' side.\n  Mr. REID. I see nobody here of the opponents. If they require more \ntime, I will be happy to give them whatever time I may use here. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be allowed to speak, and if the opponents of \nthis sense-of-the-Senate amendment desire more time, they can have \nwhatever time I use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Did the Senator from New Hampshire hear the request?\n  Mr. GREGG. No.\n  Mr. REID. We have no more time left. You have 14 minutes. I said I \nwould like to speak. If you want more time, whatever time I use, you \ncan have that in addition to the 14 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am not aware of any speakers. We are waiting for people \nto return from the White House before we get really started.\n  Mr. REID. I want to direct a question to the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I say to my friend from Massachusetts, we heard a lot of \ntalk about how this legislation has an adverse effect upon the business \ncommunity. Has the Senator heard those comments?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I certainly have.\n  Mr. REID. I received an e-mail from Michael Marcum of Reno, NV. Here \nis what he said. I would like the Senator to comment on this \ncommunication I received from one of my constituents:\n\n       Dear Senator Reid, as a small business owner, and as a \n     citizen I urge you to support the upcoming bill commonly \n     known as the ``Patients' Bill of Rights.'' I also would like \n     to state that I support your and Senator McCain's version of \n     the bill. If the HMO's can afford to spend millions on \n     lobbyists and advertisements then they can afford to do their \n     job correctly, preventing the lawsuits in the first place . . \n     . .\n       I am willing to pay to know that what I am purchasing from \n     my HMO will be delivered, not withheld until someone is dead \n     then approved post mortem (AKA a day late and a dollar \n     short). While a believer in the market and freedom, I feel \n     that we need a better national approach to health care. As \n     the richest nation in the world, as the only real super-\n     power, why do so many Americans get third world levels of \n     health care, even when they have insurance.\n       Thank you for your time--Michael Marcum (Reno, NV).\n\n  Will the Senator acknowledge that Michael Marcum is one of the \nhundreds of thousands of small business people who do not have the \nmoney to run these fancy ads; that their only way of communicating with \nyou and me is through e-mails and communicating through the standard \nmeans, not through these multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns? In \nshort, will the Senator acknowledge there are a lot of Michael Marcums, \nsmall business people, in America who support this legislation?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for bringing two matters to the \nattention of the membership. One is the example the Senator referred \nto, and the other point is the fact we have heard so much during the \ncourse of the debate that if these protections are put in place, it is \ngoing to mean millions of insured individuals as a result of this \nlegislation will become uninsured.\n  Yet it is apparent, as the Senator has pointed out, that the HMOs \nhave millions of dollars to spend on these advertisements--millions of \ndollars that ought to be spent on either lowering premiums or giving \npatients the protections they need. Evidently, it is an open wallet for \nthe HMOs because they have been on the national airways and have been \ndistorting and misrepresenting the legislation, as the Senator has just \npointed out, distorting what its impact would be on average families in \nthis country.\n  I am wondering if the Senator is familiar with the Texas Medical \nAssociation letter we just received. It confirms that the Texas law \nmirrors the letter and spirit of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill. This \nis from the Texas Medical Association. They point out that the Texas \nMedical Association and President Bush agree that any entity making \nmedical decisions should be held accountable for those decisions. This \nis not only the position of the Texas Medical Association but is \nexactly what President Bush called for in a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n\n  We resolved that issue earlier today. The Texas Medical Association \nbelieves it is consistent with the intent of the Texas law to hold any \nentity, whether employer or insurer, accountable if they make a medical \ndecision that harms a patient or results in death. We upheld that \ntoday.\n  The Texas law was never designed to exempt from accountability \nbusinesses that made harmful medical decisions. It was suggested \nearlier, the Senator remembers, that it would be, rather, a \nclarification that the liability provisions did not apply to small- and \nmedium-sized businesses that purchased traditional insurance.\n  That is interesting to hear because we heard a great deal earlier \nabout where the Texas Medical Association was. This is a clarification.\n  The Senator is pointing out we spent a good deal of time trying to \ncatch up with the distortions and misrepresentations, but as the \nSenator from Nevada knows, what this is really about is doctors and \nnurses making decisions on health care for their patients and not \nhaving them overridden by the HMOs or by employers who put themselves \nin the place of HMOs.\n  That is what this legislation is about: letting our doctors and \nnurses practice their best in medicine. We have so many well-trained \nmedical professionals. They are highly motivated, highly committed, and \nhighly dedicated. What is happening in too many places, as the Senator \nhas pointed out in this debate, too many times those medical decisions \nare being overrun and overturned by the HMOs, and that is plain wrong. \nThat is what this battle is about. I thank the Senator for his comment.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Massachusetts, yes, I am familiar \nwith the letter from the President of the Texas State Medical \nAssociation. I believe that is his title.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I heard Senator McCain read the letter word for word. I was \nso impressed because what has happened the last few years is that \ndoctors, who in the past have been totally nonpolitical, have been \ndriven into the political field because they are losing their \npractices, they are losing their ability to practice medicine, their \nability to take care of patients they were trained to take care of. \nThey have come into the political field and have\n\n[[Page S6890]]\n\njoined together with the American Medical Association--all the \ndifferent specialists and subspecialists--they have joined together \nsaying: We as physicians of America need some help. If you want us to \nbe the people who take care of your sick children, your sick wife, \nhusband, mother, father, neighbor, then we need to have the ability to \ntreat patients and give them the medicine they need.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts read part of this letter. Senator \nMcCain read the full text of the letter earlier today. It confirms this \nlegislation is not being driven by a small group of fanatics but, \nrather, by the entire medical community. When I say ``medical \ncommunity,'' it is more than just doctors. It includes nurses. It \nincludes all the people who help render care to patients.\n  I say to my friend from Massachusetts, I commend him, Senator McCain, \nand Senator Edwards for their diligence in doing something the American \npeople need. We all have had the experience of having sick people in \nour families and seeing if care can be rendered. We know how important \na physician is. When a loved one of mine is sick, I want the doctor to \nhave unfettered discretion to do whatever that doctor, he or \nshe, believes is best for my loved one. That is what this Patients' \nBill of Rights is all about. When a doctor takes care of a patient, let \nthe doctor take care of the patient.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. He has summarized the purpose of \nthis legislation. As the Senator knows now, we are ensuring there will \nbe remedies for those patients if the HMO is going to make a judgment \nand overturn that medical decision with internal and external appeals.\n  Now the matter before the Senate is to make sure that appeal is truly \nindependent and not controlled by the HMO, not paid for by the HMO. As \nI mentioned earlier in my presentation, 33 States at the present time \ndo not permit the HMOs to make the determination and select the \nindependent reviewer. That is our position. That is in the McCain \namendment. We do not want to have an appeals provision that is rigged \nin favor of the HMO that may be making the wrong decision with regard \nto the patient's health in the first place and then be able to select \nthe judge and jury to get it to reaffirm an earlier decision which is \nclearly not in the interest of the patient.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Massachusetts, the manager of this \nbill, before I came to Congress, I was a judge in the Nevada State \nAthletic Commission for prize fights. As the Senator knows, Nevada is \nthe prize fight capital of the world. One thing they would not let the \nfighters do is pick the judges. They thought it would be best if some \nindependent body selected the judges to determine who was going to sit \nin judgment of those two fighters.\n  It is the same thing we have here. We simply do not want the \nparticipants picking who is going to make the decision. That should be \nmade by an unbiased group of people who have nothing to gain or lose by \nthe decision they make.\n  This is very simple. This sense-of-the-Senate resolution says that if \nthere are going to be people making a decision, they should be \nunbiased; they should be people who have nothing in the outcome of the \ncase. Is that fair?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I agree. Senator, as you may know, the language in the \nalternative legislation not only permits the HMO to select the reviewer \nand to pay that, but also it preempts all the other States that have \nset up their own independent review, and 33 of the 39 that have set up \ntheir reviews have chosen a different way from this process, a truly \nindependent review. They would effectively be usurped or wiped off the \nbooks.\n  We hear a great deal about State rights and not all wisdom is in \nWashington. This is a clear preemption of all of the existing State \nappeals provisions. It is done in a way that permits the HMO to be the \njudge and jury. That is why the McCain amendment--which says there will \nbe an independent selection of review, and we will not preempt the \nStates--makes a good deal of sense.\n  Mr. REID. If I could refer a question to the Senator from New \nHampshire, our time under the agreement is just about out. Are you \narriving at a point where you might offer the other amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. I hoped we would be. Some of the Senators involved in that \namendment are at the White House, so we are waiting for them to return. \nWhen they return, we will be ready to proceed.\n  Mr. REID. I have been told they probably won't return until about \n3:30.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest we divide the time between now and 3:30 between \nthe two sides equally.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I don't know at this time of other amendments on this \nside. We are making good progress dealing with this legislation. We are \neager to address these other matters. There are continued conversations \non some of the issues. We certainly welcome ideas that can protect the \npatients. Looking at this realistically, we have several Members who \nwant to address the Senate and have spoken to me several times that \nthey would like to make comments about the legislation. We can use the \ntime productively, but we indicate we are ready to deal with amendments \nand we look forward to receiving them. We want to continue business.\n  We thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his cooperation. I will \nnotify my colleagues who might want to speak.\n  Mr. REID. We have no objection to the request of the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask that the time between now and 3:30 be equally \ndivided between myself and Senator Kennedy, and any quorum calls be \ndivided between each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been reading into the Record names of \norganizations that support this legislation. I will read some of the \nnames into the Record. If someone from either side desires to speak, I \nwill cease.\n  I have been through the A's, B's and C's of organizations supporting \nthis legislation, hundreds of names. I begin with the D's:\n\n       Daniel, Inc.; Denver Children's Home; DePelchin Children's \n     Center in TX; Developmental Disabilities; Digestive Disease \n     National Coalition; Dystonia Medical Research Foundation; \n     Easter Seals; Edgar County Children's Home; El Pueblo Boys' \n     and Girls' Ranch; Elon Homes for Children in Elon, College, \n     NC; Epilepsy Foundation; Ettie Lee Youth and Family Services; \n     Excelsior Youth Center in WA; Eye Bank Association of \n     America; Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered; Families First, \n     Inc.; Families USA; Family & Children's Center Counsel; \n     Family & Children's Center in WI; Family & Counseling Service \n     of Allentown, PA; Family Advocacy Services of Baltimore; \n     Family and Child Services of Washington; Family and \n     Children's Service in VA; Family and Children Services of San \n     Jose; Family and Children's Services in Tulsa, OK; Family and \n     Children's Agency Inc.; Family and Children's Association of \n     Mineola, NY; Family and Children's Center of Mishawaka; \n     Family and Children's Counseling of Louisville, KY; Family \n     and Children's Counseling of Indianapolis; Family and \n     Children's Service of Minneapolis, MN; Family and Children's \n     Service in TN; Family and Children's Service of Harrisburg, \n     PA; Family and Children's Service of Niagara Falls, NY; \n     Family and Children's Services in Elizabeth, NJ; Family and \n     Children's Services of Central, NJ; Family and Children's \n     Services of Chattanooga, Inc. in TN; Family and Children's \n     Services of Fort Wayne; Family and Children's Services of \n     Indiana; Family and Community Service of Delaware County, PA; \n     Family and Social Service Federation of Hackensack, NJ; \n     Family and Youth Counseling Agency of Lake Charles, LA; \n     Family Centers, Inc.; Family Connections in Orange, NJ; \n     Family Counseling & Shelter Service in Monroe, MI; Family \n     Counseling Agency; Family Counseling and Children's and \n     Children's Services; Family Counseling Center of Central \n     Georgia, Inc.; Family Counseling Center of Sarasota; Family \n     Counseling of Greater New Haven; Family Counseling Service in \n     Texas; Family Counseling Service of Greater Miami; Family \n     Counseling Service of Lexington; Family Counseling Service of \n     Northern Nevada; Family Counseling Service, Inc.; Family \n     Guidance Center in Hickory, NC; Family Guidance Center of \n     Alabama; Family Resources, Inc.; Family Service Agency of \n     Arizona; Family Service Agency of Arkansas; Family Service \n     Agency of Central Coast; Family Service Agency of Clark and \n     Champaign counties in OH; Family Service Agency of Davie in \n     CA; Family Service Agency of Genesse, MI; Family Service \n     Agency of Monterey in CA; Family Service Agency of San \n     Bernardino in CA; Family Service Agency of San Mateo in CA; \n     Family Service Agency of Santa Barbara in CA; Family Service \n     Agency of Santa Cruz in CA; Family Service Agency of \n     Youngstown, OH; Family Service and Children's Alliance of \n     Jackson, MI; Family Service Association Greater Boston; \n     Family Service Association in Egg Harbor, NJ; Family Service \n     Association of Beloit, WA; Family Service Association of \n     Bucks County in\n\n[[Page S6891]]\n\n     PA; Family Service Association of Central Indiana; Family \n     Service Association of Dayton, OH; Family Service Association \n     of Greater Tampa; Family Service Association of Howard \n     County, Inc.

This list was \nprepared for me more than a week ago. It has grown since.\n  When I finish this list, I hope we will have completed this \nlegislation. But if we haven't, I will come back and read the new \nnames.\n  This is legislation that is supported by virtually every organization \nin America. It is opposed by one umbrella group--the HMOs. They are the \nones paying for these ads. They are the ones that are running the \nadvertisements in newspapers and television and now even radio ads the \nreason being that they have made untold millions of dollars while we \ndelay this legislation.\n  Every day that goes by is a lost opportunity for physicians to tell a \npatient what that patient needs and not have to refer to someone in an \noffice in Baltimore, MD, as to what a patient is going to get in Las \nVegas, NV.\n  When I have my income tax done, every year I have an accountant do \nthat. When myself or a member of my family needs to be taken care of, I \ndon't want an accountant doing that. I want a doctor to do that.\n  That is what this legislation is all about. I am so happy that we \nhave a bipartisan group that the HMOs are not going to be able to stop.\n  We are going to pass this legislation, send it over to the House, the \nconference committee will meet, and we will send a bill to the \nPresident that he will sign.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1052, the McCain-\nKennedy-Edwards Patients' Bill of Rights legislation. Minnesota, my \nhome State, has one of the largest concentrations of HMO providers in \nthe country. In fact, 90 percent of Minnesotans who are covered by \ntheir employers also receive their health care services through HMOs. \nAlso, historically, the HMO concept originated in Minnesota by a \nMinnesota physician who has now renounced what HMOs have become.\n  Originally, HMOs were going to herald in a new age of health care, \nwith greater emphasis on prevention, on primary care, more efficient \nreferrals, coordinated and integrated medical care, all leading to a \nbetter quality of medical services for patients at lower overall costs \nto our health care system.\n  Integral also to their arguments was their conceit that the private \nsector always does it better than the public sector, that the large \npublic health systems of Medicare and Medicaid, and other public \nreimbursement programs, were largely the ones to blame for these \nskyrocketing health costs, and that private-sector HMOs and insurance \ncompanies could manage health care dollars so much better than \nGovernment and provide better quality for less quantity of dollars.\n  However, once they got into the profession, they found that it was \nnot quite that easy, that quality care costs money. There is always \nsome con artist in this country who claims we can have something for \nnothing, or at least more for less. But the reality is, quality health \ncare costs money. Well-qualified, highly trained, life-saving doctors, \nnurses, and attendants deserve to be well paid; and that costs money. \nAdvanced lifesaving diagnostic equipment costs money. State-of-the-art, \nwell-staffed hospitals and clinics cost money. And providing enough of \nall of the above, to take care of all the patients across this Nation, \ncosts money, more money than most of these health care delivery or \ninsurance systems wanted to spend.\n  So HMOs became what I call them ``HNOs'': The way to save money \nbecame to say no; deny care; deny treatments; deny claims. Health care \nproviders became health care deniers. As these HMOs became larger and \nlarger, business operations--whether for-profit or nonprofit--their \n``no'' bureaucracies became bigger and more important. Stock prices, \nexecutive compensations, retained earnings all became dependent on \ntheir ability to grow and to say no, deny patient care to produce \nprofits at cost savings, to grow to produce ever more profits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the majority has expired.\n  Under a previous agreement, the time until 3:30 was to be equally \ndivided between the majority and minority. The time of the minority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator think he \nneeds to make his statement?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I say to the Senator from New Hampshire, another 10 \nminutes. But I will return to speak another time.\n  Mr. GREGG. No. We have no speakers at this time. I am happy to yield \n10 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota. And I ask unanimous consent \nfor 10 minutes to be added to our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wonder if I might be able to have the floor to speak.\n  Mr. GREGG. What amount of time does the Senator from West Virginia \nneed?\n  Mr. BYRD. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have no problem with that on my side, as long as our \nside will receive an equal amount of time. So that would be 40 minutes; \n10 minutes to Senator from Minnesota, 30 minutes to the Senator from \nWest Virginia; and then 40 additional minutes to be added to our side's \ntime. And the Senator from West Virginia be recognized after the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6892]]\n\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I would be happy to yield the floor to the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Minnesota wish to \nconclude his remarks?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both Senators.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the great Senator from West \nVirginia for his erudite discourse on the trade agreement which gives \nme remarks as I shall present them to my constituents in Minnesota. I \nthank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I thank him very much.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, to continue where I left off, a great \nAmerican once said that a house divided against itself cannot stand. \nOur Nation's health care providers unfortunately are fundamentally \ndivided against themselves. Their avowed purposes are to provide health \ncare to their members, their clients, and their patients. Yet their \nfinancial success depends increasingly on not providing health care to \ntheir members, their clients, and their patients, and their members, \nclients, and patients are increasingly the victims of their own health \ncare providers.\n  Why do we even need a Patients' Bill of Rights to protect us from our \nown health care providers?\n  The fact we even need this legislation, the fact we are debating it \nin the Senate today, says how badly our Nation's health care system has \ndeteriorated. A Patients' Bill of Rights, even if necessary, should \nconsist of two words: Doctors decide. Doctors decide what diagnostic \nprocedures, what treatments, what surgeries, hospitalizations, and \nrehabilitation therapies are needed. The health care providers provide \nthem, and the insurer pays for them. It is that simple. It is that \nsensible. It is that lawsuit free.\n  Our distance from it today is a measure of our social insanity. It is \nthe measure of our health care idiocy. But that is where we are today.\n  There is a term used in sports these days, trash talking. There is a \nlot of trash being talked about this legislation: It will explode the \ncosts of health care; it is going to cost employees their health care \ncoverage; it will drive businesses into bankruptcy. Those are the same \nsmears and scare tactics that were used against Social Security, \nagainst Medicare, against workers' compensation, against unemployment \ncompensation, and against family leave. Is there anything that is good \nfor the American people that is not bad for American business?\n  I don't entirely blame them, because those business men and women \nhave been talked trash to, as well, by their partners in these health \ncare enterprises. Many businesses across this country are bedeviled by \nincreasing costs of their health care. They want to do the right thing \nfor their employees, but they are not in the business of administering \nhealth plans. I am sympathetic to this. But I say to those big leaders, \nif you want to get out of the business of providing health care \ncoverage for your employees, then you need to actively support a better \nalternative, a separate system of true national health care which is \ndevoted to providing care, not to avoiding costs.\n  Last Saturday in Minnesota, along with my distinguished colleague \nfrom Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, and our majority leader, Senator \nDaschle, we heard from several families who expressed their support for \ntheir legislation and the critical need for it from their life \nexperiences. There was a father who spoke eloquently and powerfully \nabout his 4-year-old daughter named Hope. Hope was born with spina \nbifida. As part of her treatment, six doctors--six physicians--\nincluding one at the Mayo Clinic, prescribed certain physical therapy \ntreatments for her. Yet her HMO was unwilling to provide or pay for \nthose prescribed treatments. It took 8 months of banging their heads \nagainst this bureaucratic wall, paying for the treatments that they \ncould afford out of their own pockets, forgoing other treatments that \nthey knew were in the best interests of her young life, until they \nfinally were able to break through and get the care she needed.\n  A mother spoke of her 21-year-old daughter who died of an eating \ndisorder. As she so powerfully stated last Saturday in St. Paul, MN, \nyoung people aren't supposed to die of eating disorders. But her \ninsurance company refused to pay for the necessary evaluation of her \ndaughter's illness, it refused to refer her to a specialist who might \nhave made the correct diagnosis, and that young woman is dead today. \nHer life has been snuffed out, taken away from her family. Her mother \nset up a foundation just for this purpose, to advocate for the care \nthat should be provided for anyone else in that situation. What a \nhorrible way for a parent to be pulled into this debate, by losing a \ndaughter unnecessarily to a disease, an illness that should not have \nbeen fatal except for the lack of proper medical care, medical care \nthat was available in our country and was not made available to her by \nher insurer.\n\n  Finally, we heard from the wife of a husband and father of five \nchildren, a healthy, active, middle-aged man who suddenly, over the \ncourse of just a few months, was caught with some debilitating disease \nand confined to a wheelchair. For 8 months she and her husband tried to \nget their primary physician at an HMO to make a diagnosis that could \nlead to successful treatment. For 8 months this primary physician at \nthe HMO was unable to make the diagnosis and refused to refer this man \nto a specialist elsewhere for that evaluation. He finally said to this \npatient, father of five, devoted husband: ``Maybe there is something \nyou need to confess.''\n  Can you believe the absurdity of that? ``Maybe there is something you \nneed to confess''--as though there were some religious curse. This was \na primary physician at an HMO. They could not escape the vice, the trap \nof that bureaucracy.\n  Finally, on their own initiative, the wife was so desperate, they \ndecided to risk their entire life savings and drove to the Mayo Clinic \nin Rochester, world renowned clinic, and signed papers saying they \nwould pay personally for the costs of whatever treatments were \nnecessary. The physician there made a diagnosis of a viral disease, an \ninvasive disease, prescribed the necessary treatments, medications, and \nthis man is now at least partially recovered. He tires easily and \ncannot stand for extended periods of time but is out of a wheelchair \nand hopefully back to a full recovery. It cost this family $25,000 out \nof their own pocket to get the medical care they needed. The HMO \nfinally agreed to pay 80 percent of that cost.\n  This legislation is not about lawsuits, it is about lives. It is not \nabout trial lawyers but people, patients, mothers, fathers, children. I \nam not interested in lawsuits. I hope there is never a lawsuit as a \nresult of this legislation because that would mean there would never be \nthe need for them. It would mean all Americans were receiving the \nhealth care they need, the health care they deserve, the health care \nfor which they paid.\n  I support this legislation, and I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport this as well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we encourage and invite colleagues who \nhave amendments to come to the floor. Having talked with Senator Gregg \nand others, I anticipate we will have an amendment dealing with the \nissue of medical necessity. That is an issue which is of very \nconsiderable importance in the legislation. It was the subject of a \ngood deal of debate the last time we debated this legislation. It was \nthe subject of a good deal of debate when we were in the conference. It \nwas actually one of the few issues that were resolved in the \nconference.\n  At this time, we have language in the McCain-Edwards legislation, of \nwhich I am a cosponsor, as well as in the Breaux-Frist measure, which \nis virtually identical. There are some small\n\n[[Page S6893]]\n\ndifferences in there, but they are effectively very much the same. \nThere will be an amendment to alter and change that issue. I will take \na few moments now to speak about the importance of what we have done \nwith the underlying legislation, and hopefully the importance of the \nSenate supporting the construct we have achieved.\n  It is my anticipation that the amendment will probably be offered at \nabout 5 o'clock this evening. We will have debate through the evening \non that measure. Hopefully, we will have a chance to address it. There \nare several other amendments dealing with the issue of the scope of the \nlegislation, as well as on liability. I understand we may very well \nhave the first amendments on liability a little later this evening as \nwell.\n  This issue on medical necessity is of very considerable importance. I \nwant to outline where we are and the reasons for it for just a few \nminutes.\n  The legislation before the Senate closes the door against one of the \nmost serious abuses of the HMOs and other insurance plans, and the \nability of a plan to use an unfair, arbitrary, and biased definition of \nmedical necessity to deny patients the care their doctor recommends.\n  My concern is that the amendment we are going to see before the \nSenate is going to open that possibility again. We closed it with \nMcCain-Edwards and also with the Breaux-Frist measure.\n  The issue before us is as clear as it was when we started the debate \n5 years ago; that is, who is going to make the critical medical \ndecisions--the doctors, the patients, or HMO bureaucrats?\n  It is important for every Member of the Senate to understand how we \ngot where we are on this issue. We started out by placing a fair \ndefinition of medical necessity. The plan would have to abide by the \nPatients' Bill of Rights itself. It was a definition that was \nconsistent with what most plans already did.\n  Every Democratic Member of the Senate voted for that approach. I \nstill think it has much to commend it. But we heard complaint after \ncomplaint from the other side that putting a definition into law would \nbe a straightjacket for health plans, it would prevent them from \nkeeping pace with medical progress, and so on.\n  So Congressmen John Dingell and Charlie Norwood changed that \nprovision. They removed the definition of medical necessity from the \nlaw. Instead, they said, let the plans choose the definition that works \nbest for them. But if a dispute went to an independent medical review, \nthe reviewers would need to consider that definition. But they would \nnot be bound by it in cases involving medical necessity; that is, they \nwould be able to use in the review their own judgment in terms of the \nmedical necessity. They would make the decision based on the kind of \nfactors all of us would want for ourselves and our families--the \nmedical condition of the patient, and the valid, relevant, scientific \nand clinical evidence, including peer-reviewed medical literature, or \nfindings, including expert opinion.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand the Senator's time has expired. I ask \nunanimous consent that whatever time the Senator consumes, an equal \namount of time be added to our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at the time of these appeals, they would \nmake the decision based on the kinds of factors all of us would want \nfor ourselves and our families--the medical condition of the patient, \nand the valid, relevant, scientific and clinical evidence, including \npeer-reviewed medical literature, or findings, including expert \nopinion.\n  Those factors essentially say that the independent medical reviewer \nshould strive to make the same recommendation that the best doctor in \nthe country for that particular condition should make. It is a fair \nstandard. It is a standard all of us hope our health plan would follow.\n  The Senate should understand that this was not only a bipartisan \ncompromise between Congressmen John Dingell and Charlie Norwood, it was \na compromise on which every member of our conference signed off in the \nlast Congress, from Don Nickles and Phil Gramm to John Dingell and \nmyself. In fact, this concept of letting the external reviewer consider \nbut not be bound by the HMO's definition of medical necessity is also \nincluded in the Frist-Breaux bill endorsed by the President.\n  On this issue, the legislation before the Senate is clearly the \nmiddle ground. It is the fair compromise. But my concern is that the \namendment we will face will tilt us away from that compromise and more \nto the HMO's.\n  Now the authors of this amendment claim that they have just provided \na safe harbor for HMOs that want to be able to maintain a fair \ndefinition of medical necessity throughout the entire process. But our \nlist of the factors that must guide the external reviewers' decision is \nalready consistent with every fair definition of medical necessity. The \nfact is that this amendment may create a safe harbor for HMOs, but it \ntosses patients over the side into the storm-tossed seas. It would \nallow HMOs to adopt some of the most abusive definitions ever \nconceived. It ties the hands of the independent medical reviewers. It \nputs HMO bureaucrats in the driver's seat--and kicks patients and \ndoctors all the way out of the automobile and is not in the interest of \nthe patient.\n  Our concern is that the amendment we anticipate will be offered will \nsay that HMOs could adopt any definition used by a plan under the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program that insures Members of \nCongress and the President, by a State, or developed by a ``negotiated \nrulemaking process.'' Each of these approaches is fatally flawed, if \nour goal is to protect patients.\n  The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program plans can change their \ndefinitions every year. An administration hostile to patient rights can \naccept any unfair definition it chooses. To be perfectly frank, even \nadministrations that support a Patients' Bill of Rights have not paid \nmuch attention to these definitions, because they have so many other \ncontrols over the way the plans behave. And Senators and Congressmen \ncan always get the medical care they want, regardless of the \ndefinitions in the plan's documents, but ordinary citizens cannot.\n  So the Federal employees' plan can change these definitions. It is \nimportant that we establish the definitions so it is very clear to the \npatients about how their interests are going to be protected.\n  States often provide good definitions of medical necessity, but \nsometimes they do not. Do we really want, after the tremendous struggle \nwe have gone through to pass this legislation, for consumers to have to \nfight this battle over this definition again and again in every State \nin the country year after year? I do not believe so. Administrative \nrule-making is only as fair as the participants. An administration \nhostile to patients' rights and sympathetic to plans can appoint any \nunfairly stacked set of participants that it wants.\n  And finally, under the amendment, the plan gets to choose any one of \nthese options. That is what we anticipate of the format of the \namendment. So it could seek out the worst of the worst. But consumers \nget no comparable rights to demand the best of the best.\n  If we look at the options that would be immediately available to \nhealth plans under the amendment, it is obvious why the disability \ncommunity, the cancer community, the American Medical Association, and \nother groups who understand this issue are so vehemently opposed to \nthat as an alternative--and why it is supported by no one but the \nhealth plans.\n  There are no health groups that support that option--none, zero. All \nof the health groups effectively support what was worked out in the \ncompromise last year and has been included in the legislation before us \nwhich, as I mentioned, I think is the real compromise.\n  One Federal plan defines ``medical necessity'' as ``Health care \nservices and supplies which are determined by the plan to be medically \nappropriate.'' That is a great definition. If the plan determines the \nservice your doctor says you need is not appropriate, you are out of \nluck. There is nothing to appeal, because the plan's definition of \n``medical necessity'' controls what the external reviewers can decide.\n  Another plan uses different words to reach the same result. It says, \nmedical\n\n[[Page S6894]]\n\nnecessity is ``Any service or supply for the prevention, diagnosis or \ntreatment that is (1) consistent with illness, injury or condition of \nthe member; (2) in accordance with the approved and generally accepted \nmedical or surgical practice prevailing in the locality where, and at \nthe time when, the service or supply is ordered.'' Doesn't sound so bad \nso far, but here is the kicker. ``Determination of `generally accepted \npractice' is at the discretion of the Medical Director or the Medical \nDirector's designee.'' In other words, what is medically necessary is \nwhat the HMO says is medically necessary.\n  Among those who have been most victimized by unfair definitions of \n``medical necessity'' are the disabled. Definitions that are \nparticularly harmful to them are those that allow treatment only to \nrestore normal functioning or improve functioning, not treatment to \nprevent or slow deterioration.\n  That is a key element in terms of the disabled community. Most of \nthese definitions, even for Federal employees, say that they will \npermit the treatment just to restore the normal functioning or to \nimprove functioning. So many of those who have disabilities need this \nkind of treatment in order to stabilize their condition, in order to \nprevent a deterioration of their condition; or if there is going to be \na slow deterioration, to slow that down as much as possible.\n  The only definition that really deals with that is the one which is \nin the McCain-Edwards and the Breaux-Frist legislation, which was \nagreed to because it does address that. That is why the disability \ncommunity is so concerned about this particular amendment.\n  Every person with a degenerative disease--whether it is Parkinson's, \nAlzheimer's, or multiple sclerosis--can be out of luck with this kind \nof definition.\n  For example, in the clinical trials, you have to be able to \ndemonstrate that the possibilities, by participating in the clinical \ntrial, are going to improve your condition. There are other kinds of \nstandards as well, but that happens to be one of them: to improve your \nkind of condition. We find that the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram uses language that is very similar to that.\n  As I mentioned, when we are talking about those that have some \ndisability--when you are talking about Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's \ndisease, multiple sclerosis--you have the kind of continuing challenge \nthat so many brave patients demonstrate in battling those diseases, but \nyou want to make sure that your definition of ``medical necessity'' is \ngoing to mean that really the best medicine that can apply to those \nparticular patients, based upon the current evolving development of \nmedical information, is going to be available to those patients.\n  Another issue which should be of concern to every patient, but \nespecially to those with the most serious illnesses, is the allowing \ncost-effectiveness to be a criterion for deciding whether medical care \nshould be provided. The question is always, cost-effectiveness for \nwhom, the HMO, or the patient? It was cost-effective for one HMO to \nprovide a man with a broken hip a wheelchair rather than an operation \nthat would allow him to walk again. It was cost-effective for another \nHMO to amputate a young man's injured hand, instead of allowing him to \nhave the more expensive surgery that would have made him physically \nwhole. It may be cost-effective for the HMO to pay for the older, less \neffective medication that reduces the symptoms of schizophrenia but \ncreates a variety of harmful side effects rather than for the newer, \nmore expensive drug that produces better cures and less permanent \ndamage--but is it cost-effective for the patient and her family? Is \nthis really the criterion we want applied to our own medical care or \nthe care of our loved ones?\n  And on a practical level, how in the world is an independent review \norganization ever supposed to judge cost-effectiveness. Its members \nunder all the bills are health professionals, not economists. They have \nthe expertise to decide on the best treatment for a particular patient, \nbut they cannot and should not be asked to evaluate its cost-\neffectiveness. To paraphrase our opponents, when your child is sick, \nyou want a doctor, not an accountant. But here we have one of the State \nplans saying, in its definition of medical necessity, ``cost-effective \nfor the medical condition being treated compared to alternative health \ninterventions, including no intervention.''\n  I urge my colleagues to stay with us on this definition and to resist \nan amendment to alter and change it. The amendment that we anticipate \nwill reverse a bipartisan compromise broadly supported by Members of \nboth parties. It is included in the bill the President has endorsed. \nThe anticipated amendment will stand the whole goal of this legislation \non its head.\n  I think this is very likely to be a litmus test on the whole issue \nfor the Senate. What we want to do is to make sure ultimately that it \nis the doctors who are going to make the best medical decisions, based \non the information that they have available to them. That is what this \nlegislation does, the McCain-Edwards, as well as in the Breaux-Frist. \nWe do not want to change that. That has been basically supported by the \nPresident. It was supported in the conference. It represents basically \nthe mainstream of the views of the Members of this body. We should \nresist any alteration or change of that particular provision.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nspeak as in morning business on the time of the Republicans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me begin by thanking my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, for his extraordinary leadership on this critical \nissue for our country with respect to the Patients' Bill of Rights. \nThat is without any question the most important business before the \ncountry and the most important business before the Senate. I will \nreturn to the floor of the Senate either later today or tomorrow to \nshare some thoughts with respect to that.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kerry are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. KERRY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have some time to speak on the bill on \nthis side; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority controls the next 41\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we have been on this bill now, it seems, for a very \nlong time. It is very important, and indeed we should be on it. On the \nother hand, we also ought to be making some progress. It appears we are \nnot. We hear all this talk about how we can get together, let's put it \ntogether, and we can agree. But I see nothing of that nature happening. \nIt seems to me we continue to hear the same things coming forth. I hear \na recitation of a great many people who are opposed to the bill listed \noff name by name. I suppose we can do that for the rest of the day.\n  Here is a list of people opposed to the Kennedy bill. There are over \n100 names of businesses and organizations. I could do that, but I don't \nknow that there is great merit in doing that. We have talked about what \nwe are for, and I think, indeed, we Republicans have certain \nprinciples, and we have talked about that: Medical decisions should be \nmade by doctors; patients' rights legislation should make coverage more \naccessible, not less; coverage disputes should be settled quickly, \nwithout regard to excessive and protracted litigation.\n  Most of us agree that employers that voluntarily provide health \ncoverage to employees should not be exposed to lawsuits. That is \nreasonable. Congress should respect the traditional role of States in \nregulating health insurance. That is where we have been and what works. \nWe intend to stand by those principles. I don't think that is hard to \nagree with. We have talked about the President's conversations with \nsome of the people on the other side of the aisle who apparently say he \nwants a bill and they think we can get together. But I don't see any \nevidence of that.\n\n[[Page S6895]]\n\n  It seems to me if we are going to do that, we ought to do it. \nInstead, it seems we are in this kind of bait and switch sort of thing \nthat we hear. I think the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, as described by \nthe sponsors, is a far cry from what is written. How many times have we \nbeen through that? The sponsors promise it would shield employers from \nlawsuits, that it would uphold the sanctity of employer health care \ncontracts, and require going through appeals before going to court. \nHowever, when you look at the language of the bill, that is not what is \nthere.\n  One of the sponsors says: We actually specifically protect employers; \nemployers cannot be sued under the bill. Yet you find in the bill \nitself exclusions of employers and other plan sponsors, and it again \ngoes into causes of action. And then, unfortunately, the next provision \nsays certain causes of action are permitted, and then it goes forward \nwith how in fact they can be sued. They say, first of all, we \nspecifically protect employers from lawsuits. Then it says in the bill \nthat certain causes of action are permitted to sue them.\n  So we don't seem to be making progress and meeting the kinds of \nagreements we have talked about. What we simply do is continue to get \nthis conversation on the one hand, which is endless, and it isn't the \nsame as what is in the bill. I don't know how long we can continue to \ndo that.\n  I am hopeful we can come to some agreement. I think people would like \nto have a Patients' Bill of Rights that ensures that what is in the \ncontract is provided for the patient. I think we can indeed do some of \nthose things. However, I have to say it seems to me if we intend to do \nit, we need to get a little more dedicated to the proposition of \nsaying, all right, here is where we need to be on liability and let's \nsee if we can work out the language to do that. We have been talking \nabout it now for a week and a half. It is not there. All right. We are \ntalking about the opportunity for holding to the contract, not going \noutside the contract. We need to have that language.\n  So I think most of us are in favor of getting something done here, \nbut we are getting a little impatient at the idea of continuing to \nrecite the same things over and over again when in fact the bill does \nnot say that. We ought to be making some propositions to be able to \nmake the changes that indeed need to be made if that is our goal.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I hope that it is.\n  I see other Members in the Chamber. I will be happy to yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield back such time as I might have at \nthis point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is yielded back.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for a brief statement, there are \nefforts being made now to work out what some deem to be better language \non the McCain amendment. If that is not possible, the Senator from New \nHampshire and I have said we might be able to voice vote that anyway. I \npersonally do not expect a recorded vote on that, but time will only \ntell.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the McCain amendment be set aside and \nthe Senator from Missouri be recognized to offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 816\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 816.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: to limit the application of the liability provisions of the \nAct if the General Accounting Office finds that the application of such \n     provisions has increased the number of uninsured individuals)\n\n       On page 179, after line 14, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. ANNUAL REVIEW.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 24 months after the general \n     effective date referred to in section 401(a)(1), and annually \n     thereafter for each of the succeeding 4 calendar years (or \n     until a repeal is effective under subsection (b)), the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services shall request that the \n     Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences \n     prepare and submit to the appropriate committees of Congress \n     a report concerning the impact of this Act, and the \n     amendments made by this Act, on the number of individuals in \n     the United States with health insurance coverage.\n       (b) Limitation With Respect to Certain Plans.--If the \n     Secretary, in any report submitted under subsection (a), \n     determines that more than 1,000,000 individuals in the United \n     States have lost their health insurance coverage as a result \n     of the enactment of this Act, as compared to the number of \n     individuals with health insurance coverage in the 12-month \n     period preceding the date of enactment of this Act, section \n     302 of this Act shall be repealed effective on the date that \n     is 12 month after the date on which the report is submitted, \n     and the submission of any further reports under subsection \n     (a) shall not be required.\n       (c) Funding.--From funds appropriated to the Department of \n     Health and Human Services for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide for such \n     funding as the Secretary determines necessary for the conduct \n     of the study of the National Academy of Sciences under this \n     section.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is clear that all of us agree that \nprotection for patients of health care delivery systems is very \nimportant. Patients need to get quick, independent second opinions when \ntheir insurance company or their HMO denies care. Women need unimpeded \naccess to obstetricians or gynecologists. Children need pediatric \nexperts making decisions about their care and providing them care. \nPatients need to go to the closest emergency room and be confident that \ntheir insurance company or HMO will pay for the care.\n  Those things ought to be understood as the basis on which we all \nagree. To say, as some have, that those of us on this side of the aisle \nare not concerned about patients is just flat wrong.\n  I have spoken in the past about patients who are employees of small \nbusiness, who are owners of small businesses, who are the families of \nsmall business owners. They do not get patient protection because they \ncannot afford insurance. They cannot even be patients because they do \nnot have the care.\n  We need to figure out how we can assure patient protections, get more \npeople covered by health care insurance, health care plans, HMOs, and \ngive them the protections they need within those plans.\n  This bill is about balance. As we provide patient protections, we \nneed to be concerned about how much we increase the cost of care \nbecause at some point these costs will start to bite. At some point, \nemployers, particularly small business employers, will not be able to \noffer coverage to anyone so their employees cannot be patients. In \naddition, as prices go up, the employees or patients may not be able to \nafford their share of the insurance costs. The results: Fewer people \nwith health care.\n  It is generally understood that for every percent increase in the \ncost of health care, we lose about 300,000 people from health care \ncoverage. It is a fact of life. No matter what we do here, no matter \nhow much we expound and gesticulate and obfuscate, we cannot repeal the \nlaws of economics. When something gets more expensive, you are going to \nget less of it. The question is, How far do you go? How much is too \nmuch?\n  The folks on my side of the aisle have said we need to give patients \nbasic, commonsense protections, such as the ones I mentioned in the \nbeginning: Independent second opinions, access to emergency care, \naccess to OB/GYN care, access to pediatric care, and many more. But \nthat is not enough. Some of our friends on the other side have insisted \non going forward. In addition to the consensus patient protections, \nthey want to add an expensive new right to sue that poses a huge threat \nto runaway health care costs.\n  There are some people who are very interested in the right to sue. \nThose\n\n[[Page S6896]]\n\npeople are called trial lawyers, and they do really well at bringing \nlawsuits. They get a lot of fees from winning those lawsuits, \nparticularly if the judgment is high and they have a good contingency \nfee contract. At the same time, those costs ultimately can deny people \nhealth care coverage because to pay these judgments, the companies \ninvolved have to raise costs.\n  As we have debated this legislation, I have tried to focus on what \npatient protections are needed and on the other crucial questions: What \nwill this bill do to employers' ability to offer health care insurance \nto their employees? How many health care patients might lose their \ncoverage?\n  I know proponents of this version of the bill do not want to talk \nabout the people across America, the patients, who will lose their \nhealth insurance because this bill as a whole, including the new \nlawsuits, may cost more than a million people their health care \ncoverage. We need to talk about it. We need to focus on it because over \n1 million people who have health insurance today--men and women who are \ngetting their annual screenings, mothers-to-be who are receiving \nprenatal care, and parents whose children are getting well-baby care--\nwill be losing care because of this bill, and how many of them can we \nafford to lose?\n  We will be losing health care coverage for seniors who are taking \narthritis medicines, men and women who are being treated with \nchemotherapy or kidney dialysis, families waiting for a loved one to \nhave heart bypass surgery. These are the lives that will be disrupted, \neven devastated, as a direct result of this bill. Whom will they have a \nchance to sue then? What good is the right to sue a health plan if I \nhave lost my health plan in the first place? It does not do me much \ngood.\n  I have said in the past we know there are going to be people who lose \ntheir insurance coverage as a result of this bill. In the past several \ndays, I have brought to the Chamber a chart that keeps a running total \nof the number of patients who will lose their health care coverage \nbecause their employers have told us that if the provisions of the \ncurrent McCain-Kennedy bill with the right to sue employers are enacted \ninto law, they will have no choice but to drop health care. They want \nto provide health benefits to their employees. They are important \nbenefits, they are attractive benefits and ensure the employers get \ngood work from employees, and they take care of the patients who are \nthe employees and the families of the employees.\n\n  These small businesses have told me if they are faced with lawsuits \nfrom one of their employees or dependents who do not get the right kind \nof health care, they cannot afford to take that risk. Health care costs \nare too much already. Health care costs are going up. They are seeing \nmore and more of the costs burdening their ability to provide health \ncare.\n  In the past, I have read from letters from small businesses in \nMissouri that are fearful of losing health care coverage for their \nemployees and their employees' dependents. These are real life examples \nof people who have written in, saying they are very worried about the \nprovisions of the McCain-Kennedy bill.\n  I read yesterday a letter from a fabricator company. Today I have a \nletter from an accounting group. They are a small business, currently \ninsuring four employees at a cost of $1,935 a month; they pay 100 \npercent of the premiums. Last year, their health care coverage costs \nwent up 21 percent. They note there has been a steady increase over the \npast few years. They have had to pass these costs on to clients to \ncover the charges for their employees. At this rate, providing health \ninsurance may become impossible. If the new Patients' Bill of Rights \nproposed by Senator Kennedy expands liability and results in employers \nbeing held responsible for medical court cases, they will certainly be \nforced to cancel this employee benefit.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       I do small business accounting every day.\n       These are small mom-and-pop businesses that cannot exist if \n     they are treated in the same way as large businesses with \n     regard to employee benefits. Sometimes Congress forgets that \n     mom-and-pop businesses of America are simply people who are \n     working hard, day in and day out, just to maintain a moderate \n     lifestyle. While they are not poor, they are not employers in \n     the same sense as major corporations.\n       Please help us keep our businesses and try to provide for \n     our employees.\n\n  That is one thing we need to remember. As we look at things on a \ngrand scale and look at large employers, we cannot forget the mom-and-\npop businesses providing a living for mom and pop, their families, \ntheir employees, and their employees' families. We want all of them to \nbe able to get good health care coverage. We want them to have rights \nthat they can exercise if the HMO or the insurance company denies them \ncoverage. But we certainly don't want to throw them out of health care \ncoverage.\n  Here is another company in Missouri. They write:\n\n       I have been doing business in Missouri for over 15 years \n     and have been providing health insurance to my employees \n     since November of 1993. At that time, counting myself, I \n     insured four employees at an average cost of $78.50 a month. \n     I now insure five at a monthly cost of $199.60, with the same \n     high deductible coverage. My cost has increased over 250 \n     percent, way beyond the rate of inflation and way beyond the \n     growth of my business. I have just had to absorb this \n     increased cost in the bottom line. This bill Senator Kennedy \n     has now in committee looks like a disaster ready to happen. I \n     am not alone as a small business owner wondering if I might \n     be able to continue to offer this benefit to my employees in \n     view of the rising costs of the policies. If I would be \n     legally responsible for medical court cases, I might as \n     well just toss in the towel and close my business.\n\n  Those are the mom-and-pop operations, the small businesses, the \nlifeblood of our economy, the dynamic, growing engine of our economy \nthat provides the jobs and the well-being and meets our needs for \nservices and goods that everybody wants to talk about and everybody \nloves as the small businesses. But we need to be sure we are not \npricing them out of business or even costing them the ability to cover \ntheir employees' health care costs.\n  Right now, our toll is 1,895 Missourians losing their health care \ncoverage from what their employers have told us about the burdens they \nexpect from the McCain-Kennedy bill. One can argue they may be wrong. I \ncan make an argument based on reading the pages I have read before of \nexceptions under which an employer can be sued. But they would be well \nadvised, if they cannot stand the costs of a lawsuit, to give up their \nhealth insurance. You can argue about it one way or the other, but \n1,895--almost 1,900--employees will be thrown out of work, according to \ntheir employers who have communicated directly to us, if this measure \nis unamended and goes into effect.\n  What are we going to do about it? I hope we can work on the liability \nsections. I have heard people want to compromise. I haven't seen that \ncompromise yet. So I will offer a very simple proposal. My amendment \nsays one simple thing: At a certain point, enough is enough. If more \nthan one million Americans lose health care coverage because of this \nbill, the most expensive part of this bill, the right to sue, should be \nreevaluated.\n  The beautiful thing about this amendment is, all of the disagreements \nthat exist about how much the McCain-Kennedy bill will increase costs \nand how many people will lose coverage won't matter. We will never get \nan agreement on this floor, I don't believe, on just how many people \nwill be knocked out. So we won't rely on predictions. All that will \nmatter is what actually happens.\n  Health economists assure this analysis can be done, they say, over a \n2-year period, and we will look at employment patterns, inflation, \nhealth regulations, or policy measures other than patient protections \nand other factors that affect employers and employees' ability to \npurchase coverage. Economists can estimate how many people lose \ncoverage due to a major piece of health legislation. The Institute of \nMedicine has more than enough expertise and brain power at its disposal \nto do this.\n  The amendment I have proposed says not later that 24 months after the \neffective date, and thereafter for each of the 4 succeeding years, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services shall ask the Institute of \nMedicine of the National Academy of Sciences to prepare and submit to \nthe appropriate committees of Congress a report concerning the impact \nof the act on the number of individuals in the United States with \nhealth care insurance.\n  Then, if the Secretary, in any report submitted, determines more than \none\n\n[[Page S6897]]\n\nmillion individuals in the United States have lost their health \ninsurance coverage as a result of the enactment of this act as compared \nto the number of individuals with health insurance coverage in the 12-\nmonth period preceding the act, then the liability section shall be \nrepealed, effective on the date 12 months after the date on which the \nreport is submitted. The Department of Health and Human Services is \nauthorized to get funding for the conduct of the study, the National \nAcademy of Sciences.\n  It is very simple. If it throws more than a million people out of \nhealth care coverage, then we repeal the liability section. Then \nCongress comes back and looks at it and says: Can we do a better job? \nWe don't have to rely on any estimates or predictions. We can find out \nhow many people have lost their coverage. I think a million people is a \nlot. But granted, anything we do is going to have a cost. What \nconstitutes too much? I propose that as a starting point we say that 1 \nmillion people losing coverage is too much.\n  The two key issues in this debate are:\n  First, access to care; second, access to coverage.\n  Patients need access to care without undue managed care interference. \nThus, we need a patient protection bill. That is the external appeal. \nThat is the right to see certain specialists, and the very important \nprovisions we have in it. But the patients also need access to \ncoverage. Are we going to get more people covered? Are we going to \nknock more people out of coverage?\n  The ability to sue HMOs sounds nice. But at what price? If the \nability to sue HMOs and the ability to sue employers is too high, and \nif the price is 1 million Americans who lose coverage, then that price \nis too high.\n  I urge my colleagues to accept this amendment. I believe it is one \nway to make sure that we have a fail-safe mechanism to make sure that \nwe observe that basic principle of medicine: first do no harm. I think \na million individuals losing health care coverage is harm. That is why \nI suggest that we should agree to the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the excellent idea of \nthe Senator from Missouri.\n  One of the big concerns that has been heard expressed throughout this \nentire debate has been the effect especially of the plethora of \nlawsuits which would be created under the present bill as it is \nstructured on employers, especially small employers, and their \nwillingness to continue to offer health insurance to their employees.\n  The real issue for most people is, first, do they have health \ninsurance. When someone goes to find a job, one of the key conditions \nthat most people look at is if that job has a decent health insurance \npackage that is coupled with it. This is an extraordinarily big problem \nfor not only people working at high-level jobs but especially people \nwho work at entry-level jobs and in between.\n  You can take large employers in the retail industry or large \nemployers in the manufacturing industry. In all of these areas, \nemployees see as one of their primary benefits the pay they receive, \nobviously, but additionally the fact that they have good health \ninsurance from their employers.\n  Then with the smaller employers, people who run small restaurants or \nsmall gas stations, or small mom-and-pop manufacturing businesses, the \npeople who work for those folks also appreciate greatly the fact that \nthey might have a health insurance package that is coupled with their \nemployment. This is especially true for families. I don't think there \nis anything a family fears more than having a child get sick and not \nhaving adequate coverage, and not being able to get that child into a \nsituation where they can be taken care of, or alternatively having \ntheir savings wiped out by the need to do something to take care of \nthat child who has been sick, or a member of the family.\n  Quality insurance is absolutely critical.\n  We should not do anything that undermines the willingness of \nmanufacturers, of employers, of small businesspeople, of mom and pop \noperators to offer insurance to their employees. It should almost be a \nblack letter rule for this bill that we do not do something that is \ngoing to take away insurance because, as I have said before in this \nChamber, there is no Patients' Bill of Rights if a person does not have \ninsurance. They have no rights at all because they do not have any \ninsurance.\n  So what the Senator from Missouri has suggested is a very reasonable \napproach. If this bill, as it has been proposed, is such an \nextraordinarily positive vehicle in the area of giving people rights \nfor their insurance and is such a positive vehicle in the area of \nallowing people who interface with their health agencies to get fair \nand adequate treatment from their health agencies, then the authors of \nthis bill should have no objection to the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  Because the Senator from Missouri isn't suggesting that the bill \nshould be changed in any way. He is simply saying, if the effects of \nthe bill are that people are thrown out of their insurance and no \nlonger have the ability to hold insurance because their employer says, \n``We are not going to insure you anymore; we can't afford it because of \nthe number of lawsuits that are going to be thrown at us as a result of \nthis bill,'' if that is the case, and more than one million people in \nAmerica--and that is a lot of people--lose their insurance, then the \nliability section of this bill will not be effective. It does not \naffect the underlying issues of access and does not affect the \nunderlying issues of the ability to go to your own OB/GYN or your own \nspecialist or the various other specific benefits which are afforded \nunder this bill, most all of which there is unanimous agreement on in \nthis Senate.\n  All it simply says is, listen, if the liability language in the bill \nsimply isn't going to work because it throws a million people out of \ntheir insurance and, therefore, a million people lose their rights \nversus gain rights under this bill, then we basically do not enforce \nliability provisions until that gets straightened out. The Congress can \ncome back at that time and take another look at the liability \nprovisions and correct them. At least nobody else will be thrown out of \nthe works because of the liability provisions; they will essentially be \nput in a holding pattern by this amendment.\n  That is an entirely reasonable approach. Instead of saying we are \ngoing to function in a vacuum in this Chamber, where essentially we \nthrow out ideas that we think are good but don't know what is going to \nhappen, this is essentially saying, all right, if we think we have \nideas that are good, we are going to hold those ideas to \naccountability.\n  We heard the Senator from Massachusetts talking about accountability \nin another section of this bill. He brought up the education bill, \nwhich we talked about for the last 7 weeks before we got to this bill. \nAnd the issue was accountability. Does it work? The education bill we \npassed has language in it that essentially took a look at what had \nhappened in order to determine what would occur in the future. What \nSenator Bond has suggested is that we do that under this bill. It is a \nvery practical suggestion. He is saying if a million people lose their \ninsurance, then we will put the liability language in the bill on hold \nuntil we can straighten it out. Actually, it would be sunsetted.\n  The practical effect of that is, I presume, Congress would come back \nand say, listen, we didn't intend to have a million people lose their \ninsurance. Our purpose in this bill was to give people more rights, not \nto give them less rights. You give people less rights if they lose \ntheir ability to have insurance.\n\n  So by taking this language we will be in a position of being sure \nthat what we are doing in this Chamber, and what we are doing in the \nisolation of the legislative process--although we get input, we never \nreally see the actual events--will have a positive impact. We will know \nthat if it isn't having a positive impact, there will be a consequence. \nThe consequence is that that part of the bill, which has created the\n\n[[Page S6898]]\n\nnegative impact--throwing people out of their insurance--will be held \nup or stopped or sunsetted until we can correct it.\n  So the Senator's concept in this amendment makes a huge amount of \ncommon sense. It is truly a commonsense idea. I guess it comes from the \n``show me'' State. Nobody has used that term today on this amendment. I \ndo not think they have described it that way. This is a classic ``show \nme'' amendment. This says: Show me how the bill works. If the bill does \nnot work, OK, we are going to change it to the idea of having this \ntrigger, which establishes whether or not the bill is positive or \nwhether the bill is negative. If the bill is negative--``negative'' \nmeaning over a million people losing their insurance as a result of the \neffects of this bill--then we sunset the liability language.\n  I do think it is important to stress that this amendment does not \nsunset the whole bill. It just focuses on the liability sections within \nthe bill, which sections I have severe reservations about and have \nreferred to extensively in this Chamber, which I think are going to \nhave unintended consequences which will be extraordinarily negative on \nemployees in this country where a lot of people are going to lose their \ninsurance.\n  This amendment just goes to that section of the bill. It doesn't go \nto the positive sections of the bill that there is general agreement \non. It does not even go to those sections of the bill where there isn't \ngeneral agreement on, such as the scope issues of States' rights or the \ncontract sanctity issue, for that matter.\n  But it does go to this question of, if you have people losing their \ninsurance because their employers are forced to drop that insurance \nbecause it has become so expensive as a result of the liability \nprovisions of this bill, then, in that case, where that happens to a \nmillion people--a million people, by the way, is essentially the \npopulation of the State of New Hampshire. It is not the population of \nMissouri, but essentially we have 1,250,000 people in New Hampshire, so \nwe are talking about not an inconsequential number of people; it is \npretty much the whole State in New Hampshire. So it is a reasonable \nthreshold.\n  If a million people lose their insurance because employers cannot \nafford it, because the liability costs have driven them out of the \nability to ensure their employees, then we should stop that; we should \nend that liability language and take another look at it as a Congress \nand correct it.\n  So I congratulate the Senator from Missouri for offering this classic \n``show me'' amendment. It is very appropriate that is has been offered \nby the Senator from Missouri, from the ``show me'' State. It makes \nincredible common sense. I also would say it is a ``Yankee \ncommonsense'' amendment. So we shall claim it for New England also. I \njoin enthusiastically in supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bond amendment. \nI commend the Senator for standing up and trying to mold patient \nprotection legislation to comply with a fundamental principle that he \nhas repeated many times today: The first order of business in medicine \nis to do no harm. And building on this principle, as I continue to \niterate so many times when I come to this Chamber to speak, we cannot \nafford to ignore what I believe to be the No. 1 problem in health care \ntoday: the fact that we have anywhere between 42 and 44 million people \nwho do not have health insurance.\n  I will state again for the record--and I am happy for anyone to come \nforward and tell me differently--there is not one thing in this bill \nthat increases the number of insured people in America, not one thing. \nThis is a pretty good-sized bill. It has 179 pages to it. Not one page, \nnot one paragraph, not one sentence, not one word will cover one \nadditional person in America.\n  For many of the people who are the greatest critics of the health \ncare delivery system in this country, the paramount feature of which \nthey are most critical is the number of uninsured in our society. If \nthere is a criticism levied by people around the world against \nAmerica's health care system, it does not have to do with quality of \ncare. I think everyone will agree that America pretty much sets the \ngold standard in terms of the quality of care delivered to patients. I \nthink most people say, yes, the best health care in the world is \navailable here in the United States. But the critics around the world \nwill say, it may be the best system but you have 42 to 44 million \npeople in this country who are not insured.\n  Do you think the first health care bill we are considering here in \nthe Senate should consider what most people see as the greatest problem \nwith America's health care system? Most people in this country would \nsay, yes, that is what we should be considering. But this bill doesn't \ndo that. Interestingly enough, what does this bill do? It provides \npatient protection. That is great. I am for that. There are a group of \npeople in this country, people who have health insurance plans that are \nregulated solely by the Federal Government, who have very few patient \nprotections afforded to them because they are not covered under State \npatient protection laws. So we should pass a Federal Patients' Bill of \nRights to cover those people. I am all for that, and we should have \nadequate protection.\n  But what this bill does, what the Senator from Missouri is trying to \nreally focus on, is it does a whole lot of other things that will cause \nat least one million more Americans to become uninsured. Now, I am \npleased that the President of the United States has vowed to veto this \nlegislation should it come to his desk in its present form for \nsignature. But if for some reason it is enacted into law, maybe over \nthe President's objections, this will result in millions more being \nuninsured.\n  You can put all the benefits aside. Let's assume this is the greatest \npatient protection bill in the history of the world, that as a result \nof this bill, patients will be supremely protected, a notion, of \ncourse, with which I take issue. I don't believe that will occur. But \nlet's assume it does. The result of this bill will be millions more \nuninsured. In particular, if the liability provisions of this bill are \nenacted, which allow employers to be sued--and that is really the issue \nthat is at heart of the Bond amendment, if it allows employers to be \nsued, to practically an unlimited extent--you won't have a million or 2 \nmillion people who won't have insurance as a result of this bill. You \nwill have tens of millions of people who will lose their insurance. \nWhy? Do I say I am against employer liability because I love employers? \nNo. Employers are nice people. Employees are nice people. They are all \nnice people. The question is, What is the effect of holding employers \nliable? The effect of holding employers liable is employers who \nvoluntarily provide health insurance as a benefit, will simply stop \nproviding that benefit because it will jeopardize their entire \nbusiness. If they can be sued for a decision that is made with respect \nto a benefit they voluntarily provide one of their employees, the \nprovision of which is not the core function of their business, they are \nsimply going to stop providing that benefit.\n  That is what the Senator from Missouri is trying to get at. If we \ncause, as a result of the employer liability provisions, and some of \nthe general liability provisions, and some of the contract provisions, \nwhich basically allow outside entities to rewrite contracts in \nlitigation and in appeals, if we open up this Pandora's box of problems \nfor employers to continue to provide insurance to their employees, \nemployers will do what employers must do: first, protect the survival \nof their business. And this will be a direct threat to the survival of \ntheir business.\n  What is now a pleasant benefit that you can provide to your employees \nand something that you can help to attract employees with by providing \ngood health care insurance will become a serious liability risk that a \nbusiness simply cannot afford to take.\n  The Senator from Missouri is saying, very simply: We have a great \npatient protection bill here, but we have the\n\n[[Page S6899]]\n\nvery real potential of having a tremendous downside, in really hurting \npeople.\n\n  I am very sympathetic about all the cases being brought forward, \nabout the need for patient protection. I think you will find fairly \nuniversal agreement on this side that we want to provide those \nprotections. But the first protection should be to preserve the \npossession of insurance in the first place. If we deny them that \nprotection, all these other protections don't matter, really, if they \nlose their insurance. This could be a great bill, but if you don't have \ninsurance, then this bill doesn't help you. In fact, it can hurt you \nbecause it can cause the loss of your insurance.\n  What the Senator from Missouri is saying is: Let's go through, and we \nwill work on some more amendments. We will try to get this thing honed \ndown until we have a good patient protection bill. If we can't fix the \nliability provisions, which I don't know whether we will be able to or \nnot, at least let's say that if the liability provisions are what we \nbelieve they are, in other words, problematic to the point of causing \ndevastation to millions or at least a million people in losing their \ninsurance, then we should have a trigger.\n  You are seeing all of these kinds of comments by folks who are \nsupportive of this bill and supportive of the liability provisions in \nthe bill saying: Hey, this isn't going to hurt anybody. We are not \ngoing to cause any problems with this. No, no, no, employers aren't \ngoing to drop their coverage. Health care costs are not going to go up. \nMillions more won't be uninsured.\n  They will make that statement and have made that statement over and \nover again. Fine. They may be right.\n  What happens if they are wrong? What happens? What happens if past \nexperience is any guide, if we are right and millions do become \nuninsured? Should we have to wait for an act of Congress for this body \ngenerally to realize that we made a mistake and have to come back \nthrough this whole legislative process to repeal the problem here? \nShould we have to wait for that? Or should we just simply have a \ntrigger that says, look, if we made a mistake, if we made a mistake, if \nwe were wrong, then we are going to immediately cancel that portion of \nthe bill that is causing the problem upon recognition that we have a \nproblem of a million uninsured.\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire said, a million people is a lot of \nfolks, a lot of children, a lot of families. It is a lot of people who \nare going to go without health care. If what we really care about is \nproviding good, quality health care, the first thing we should care \nabout is to get them an insurance policy in the first place.\n  One of the things that strikes me most about this bill is blithe \nreferences as to how we are going to go out and get the HMOs. These \nHMOs are a bunch of bean counters who don't care about people. There is \nall these horrible cases about HMOs.\n  My understanding is that the liability provision that allows you to \nsue your employer, that allows you to sue your insurance company, does \nnot just apply to HMOs. It applies to PPOs. It applies to all insurance \ncontracts. Obviously, if it is a fee-for-service contract and there is \nno limitation on what provider you want to go to, that is one thing. \nBut in most insurance plans today that are not HMOs, there is some \nlimitation of some sort, certainly some limitation on procedures that \nare covered. But that is not what is talked about here, folks. What we \ntalk about, when they talk about this liability provision, they are \ntalking about these nasty HMOs.\n  What they don't tell you is that it ain't just the nasty HMOs that \ncan be sued under this bill, it is any insurance company who provides \nany insurance product and any employer that provides any insurance \nproduct.\n  Oh, that is a different story, isn't it? You don't hear them up there \nrailing against those nasty fee-for-service plans or those nasty PPO \nplans because they don't poll as well as going after those nasty HMOs. \nBut this isn't just about nasty HMOs, this is about all insurance \nproducts. There is no way out of this liability provision unless, of \ncourse, you just want to say to your employees: We will cover \neverything. Doesn't matter what you want, where you want to go, we will \njust pay for everything you want. Of course, we all know what an \nexorbitant cost of that would entail, and so this is neither practical \nor realistic.\n  The point is, this bill has serious consequences for millions of \npeople who are on the edge, whose employers are sitting there right now \nsaying: Well, I have a 13 to 20 percent increase in my premiums this \nyear. The economy is flattening out a little bit. I am looking forward. \nI will tighten my belt a little bit more, and we will continue to \nprovide health insurance to our employees. Then this bill comes along, \nwhich will increase costs more and potentially expose them to liability \nfor doing what is right by their employees and providing insurance to \nthem.\n  I haven't talked to an employer yet, I have not talked to an employer \nyet who told me that if this bill passes and they are liable for \nlawsuits simply because they are providing a health benefit to their \nemployees, I haven't talked to one employer who has told me that they \nwill keep their insurance.\n  They can't. How can they? In good conscience to their shareholders or \nthe owners of the company, how can they keep providing a benefit that \nsimply opens up a Pandora's box of liability, 200 causes of action, in \nState court, Federal court, unlimited damages, unlimited punitive \ndamages, and allow clever lawyers to forum shop all over the country so \nas to find that good court down in Mississippi in a small county there \nthat is used to handing out $40 million or $50 million jury awards.\n  I ask you, whether you are an employer or employee, put yourself in \nthe shoes of a small businessperson who has 20 employees, barely making \nends meet, running a small business--maybe a family business--their \nemployees are like members of the family. You have lots of businesses \nlike that across America. They want to do well by their employees \nbecause they are like family. So they provide good benefits, good pay, \nand even before family and medical leave, they gave time off when their \nemployees were sick or they needed to take care of their children who \nwere sick at school.\n  Now comes this bill that says if one person has a problem with the \nhealth care system and the insurance policy that employer offered \ndidn't give them everything they wanted, and some savvy lawyer decides \nhe or she can get you everything you want and more, and all of a sudden \nthat family business that employs 20 or so people in the community all \nof a sudden that business is on the hook. And maybe they may even \nprevail against a lawsuit, but how many tens of thousands of dollars is \nit going to take, or hundreds of thousands, simply to defend the \nlawsuit? We are talking about big awards. I can tell you that a lot of \ncompanies are just going to be worried about fighting the lawsuit in \nthe first place, about being dragged into court to prove positive \nagainst the liability ambiguities in this legislation?\n  I am just telling you that what the Senator from Missouri has put \nforth is a reasonable amendment. We will have amendments on the floor \ndealing with employer liability. We must do something about it. I \nbelieve if we allow this employer liability provision to stand, we will \ndestroy the private health care system in this country--the employer-\nprovided health care system. It will go away.\n  I know there are some Members on the floor right now who are against \nthe private health care system, who want a Government-run, single-payer \nhealth care system. Fine.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield, I advise Members that it is \nvery possible we will have a vote around 6 o'clock. So Senators should \nbe aware of that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. As I was saying, I know there are many people in this \nChamber who believe a single-payer health care system is the best way, \nthe most efficient way, the most compassionate way--to use these \nwonderful, glorious terms--to provide health insurance in this country. \nObviously, I disagree, but it is a legitimate point of view. I think we \nshould have that debate.\n  We had that debate in 1994 with the Clinton health care proposal, and \nwe had a good debate on the floor of the Senate about the kind of \nhealth care delivery system we should have. But it was a deliberate \ndebate about how we can change the health care system by a direct act \nof the Congress. The problem\n\n[[Page S6900]]\n\nwith this legislation is that we are going to severely undermine one \nhealth care system, which is a health care system that is principally \nfunded through employer contributions, and we are not going to replace \nit with anything.\n  You see, as many of my colleagues well know, if employers stop \nproviding health insurance, then people are going to have to go out \nwith their aftertax dollars and buy health care, and the costs will be \nprohibitive. If you don't believe me, I would ask any of my colleagues \nto drop their federal health insurance plan today, and to endeavor to \npurchase health insurance with aftertax dollars. It is very difficult.\n  One of the things I hope to accomplish--and maybe we can work on this \nin this bill--is to create refundable tax credits for those who do not \nhave access to employer-provided health insurance, so they can get help \nfrom the Government equivalent to the subsidy that the government \noffers for employer-provided health insurance. We give a deduction for \nthe business. In other words, if I am an employer and I provide health \ninsurance to my employees, I get to deduct the cost of that off of my \nearnings, my income. We also subsidize it on the other end. If you are \nan employee and you have employer-provided health insurance, you don't \nhave to pay taxes on the money that your employer uses to purchase that \ninsurance. In other words, let's say it is a $5,000 family policy. That \nis a benefit to you. That is compensation to you. It is $5,000 of \ninsurance costs that your employer pays for you, but you don't have to \npay taxes on it. It is tax-free compensation to you. So, in that sense, \nwe subsidize you by not taxing you on that benefit. So the employer \ngets subsidized and the employee gets subsidized.\n  But if you are an individual who does not have access to employer-\nprovided health insurance, you have to take the money that is left \nafter you pay all your taxes--after you pay Social Security taxes, \nincome taxes, State taxes, local taxes, and Medicare taxes--and then \nyou can take your money and try to buy health insurance.\n  That is a pretty rotten system. If we are going to do anything about \nthe problem with the millions of uninsured in this country, we are \ngoing to have to start treating people who don't have access to \nemployer-provided insurance the at least as well as we do with those \nwho do have it. None of that is in this bill, there is no tax equity.\n  I will say it again. There isn't one paragraph in this bill that will \nincrease the number of insured in this country. There are, \nunfortunately, pages and pages and pages and pages in this bill that \nwill result in more and more and more people losing their insurance. \nBut we can mitigate that--or at least a big part of it--if we adopt the \nBond amendment.\n  The Bond amendment says if we have a problem, let's not wait for an \nact of Congress to admit our mistake. I know those who are listening \nmight find this hard to believe, but sometimes Congress is a little \nslow in admitting we made a mistake. Sometimes we don't own up to the \nfact that it was our fault. I know some within the sound of my voice \nwill find that to be almost an incredible proposition on my part--that \nsomehow Congress doesn't immediately come in and say, yes, we \nunderstand we made a mistake; we are sorry America, we blew it. \nEverything I said the year or two before about how this wasn't going to \ncause a problem, you are right; it did. My mistake; we are going to \nrepeal this.\n\n  I just ask my colleagues, when was the last time that happened? I \nknow some in this room will remember the last time it happened. My \nrecollection is that it happened back in 1988, when it came to Medicare \ncatastrophic coverage. Congress tried to pass catastrophic prescription \ndrug coverage for seniors, and quickly found out that seniors really \ndidn't like what Congress did. Seniors rose up and screamed and \nhollered, and within a year or so--I wasn't there at the time, but I \nrecall Congress repealed it. That was about 12 years ago. I can't think \nof any instance since and, frankly, I can't think of anything before \nthat.\n  So let's just assume--I think it is a pretty safe assumption--that \nthe people who are saying that this liability provision will not cause \na problem are wrong. They will be in very good company if they go on to \ninsist that they aren't wrong in the future--that even though we may \nhave evidence of millions more uninsured as a result of this provision, \nsomehow or another they will avoid blame and will point to something \nelse that caused this problem, not the liability provisions. So it will \nbe some sort of contest here as to whether we even take up this issue \nagain.\n  The Bond amendment avoids all that. It says, look, if the GAO says \nthis provision, the liability provision, has caused a problem of \ncausing more than million additional uninsured, then that part of the \nbill sunsets, the rest of the bill stays in place. Patient protections \nstay in place.\n  Patient protections stay in place. It affects just the liability \nprovisions. The internal-external reviews stay in place so there is \npatient protection. What does not stay in place are the provisions that \nare causing massive damage to millions of American families.\n  I am hopeful, No. 1, we can fix these liability provisions because we \nshould not pass a bill that is going to cause this kind of severe \ndislocation, this kind of trouble for millions of American families. We \nshould not consciously do harm to people, particularly when we \nunderstand it is the No. 1 problem facing our health care system today, \nwhich is the lack of insurance for 42 to 44 million people.\n  We should not do this. We should not pass flawed liability \nprovisions. I know the Senator from New Hampshire and Senators on both \nsides of the aisle are trying to see if we can get a good provision. \nBut should we not get a good liability provision, the Bond amendment is \na very prudent stopgap measure so as to ensure that we do not go down \nthe road of making what is the worst problem facing health care today \neven worse.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for \nmaking a very compelling argument. I very much appreciate his support \nbecause we are talking about something that should be of concern to \nevery American who wants to be sure that they and their families are \ncovered by health insurance. If you price it out of range and lose your \nhealth care, it does not matter how many independent reviews might be \nprovided in the law. If you do not have a plan, they do not do you any \ngood.\n  The basis for our trigger, our safety valve, is, let's just see if \nthis bill has a cost. We say that the Institute of Medicine within the \nNational Academy of Sciences can figure it out. It has been indicated \nthey can rely on work that has already been done by the General \nAccounting Office, CBO, and other congressional bodies. But for \nconstitutional purposes, the ultimate responsibility of this study has \nto be in the executive branch, and that is why it is in the Institute \nof Medicine. We know from our work with the GAO and CBO the kind of \nformat, the kind of approach that can be taken. We move that function \ninto an executive branch area.\n  We say if this bill throws more than 1 million people out of their \nworkplace health care coverage or their own health care coverage, then \nwe sunset the most expensive part, the liability part.\n  I said earlier that the general rule of thumb is that 300,000 people \nwill lose their health care coverage if health care costs go up 1 \npercent. I ought to be a little more specific and explain something. As \nI understand it, when the costs of this bill are calculated, it is \nimpossible to determine how many dollars will be added to the health \ncare costs from the liability provisions themselves. Basically, the \nadditional responsibilities that go into the bill--setting aside the \nliability questions--the Congressional Budget Office estimated a \nprevious and substantially equivalent form of this bill would raise \nprivate health insurance premiums an average of 4.2 percent. That comes \nfrom the mandates in coverage, external review, and all those other \nthings.\n\n  This 4.2 percent would mean that over 1 million people will be thrown \nout of work. But that does not deal with the number of people who would \nlose their health care coverage because of the exposure to liability or \nbecause of the costs of liability judgments.\n\n[[Page S6901]]\n\n  We probably will not have liability judgments in the first couple of \nyears. It will take some time for cases to work their way through the \ncourt system. But you can bet if a couple of juries come in with the \nbillion-dollar judgments that some juries are coming in with now, those \ncosts are going to have to be factored into the health care premiums \nfor everybody, whether it is an employer, whether it is the employee-\npaid provision of it, and there are going to be a lot of people who are \nnot going to be patients because they are going to lose their health \ncare coverage.\n  Then there are those, such as the small businesses I have referenced \nfrom Missouri, who say: I cannot take the chance; I cannot put my \nbusiness at risk of one of these multimillion-dollar judgments, a tort \naction or contract action--tort action most likely--brought against me \nas an employer because I provide health care insurance or health care \ncoverage or a health care plan; I am going to drop the plan.\n  We know what happens when they drop the plan. Most of the time the \nemployee cannot pick up health insurance for her or his family and \nself. They are going to be out of business. They are going to be out of \nthe health coverage that their employers provided. That is over and \nabove the directly calculated costs CBO comes up with to say that a \nsimilar bill would increase health care costs by 4.2 percent.\n  The cost of this bill is 4.2 percent plus whatever the impact of the \nliability exposure would be, and we think that is much more significant \neven than the costs of the mandates in the bill. That is why we say if \n1 million people are thrown out of health care coverage as a result of \nthis bill--the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine will \nmake that report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services--then \nthe liability provisions sunset in 12 months and Congress gets to \nreview this measure and say: How can we make it work better?\n  That is a reasonable approach. It does not require us to make \njudgments, but it does say if 1 million people are thrown out, we need \nto revisit our work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I voted against the Bond amendment. If \nthis legislation is enacted, as I hope it will be, I believe we should \nreview it periodically and make changes to ensure that it is working to \nprotect Americans against the outrageous practices of some HMOs. An \nannual review, as required by the amendment, would be a good thing. It \nwould give us insight into what is working and what may not be.\n  However, this amendment goes beyond an annual review. If the number \nof uninsured individuals increases by more than 1 million, the Bond \namendment gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the \nauthority to take away a person's right to sue an HMO.\n  One unelected individual should not have the unilateral power to take \naway every American's right to hold an HMO accountable for its bad \ndecisions. I am very supportive of efforts to increase the number of \npeople with insurance. I think we need to address that issue. But this \namendment does not do that. The problem of the uninsured will not be \nsolved by allowing a single unelected government official to let HMOs \noff the hook for their actions.\n\n[[Page S6902]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

None of us wants that \nresult. As a result, we are trying to do our best to work with the \nsponsors of the bill to make some changes that would make it palatable \nto both the President and to most of us in this Chamber.\n  My concerns include the fact that it will undoubtedly raise premium \ncosts due to new lawsuits and increased regulation, that it will \nundermine the States' traditional role of regulating the health \ninsurance industry and make employers who voluntarily provide health \ncare coverage to their employees vulnerable to frivolous lawsuits, and \nthat it will violate the terms of the contract between the employer and \nthe health plan. This latter issue is\n\n[[Page S6903]]\n\nthe one the Nelson-Kyl-Nickles amendment is intended to address.\n  Under S. 1052, the external reviewer is ``not bound by'' the \n``medical necessity'' definition contained in the plan document. And \nthere is no substitute definition provided, so there is really no \nstandard for review.\n  Let me put in context what this means. What we have provided for here \nis a method by which people will actually get the care they believe \nthey have contracted for and deserve. The object is not to create a \nlawsuit to try to pay the money after the fact for some injury they \nsuffered but, rather, to get the care for them upfront. That is what \nthis should all be about.\n  So we have a review process by which first somebody within the \ncompany, and then an external reviewer, takes a look at the case and \nsays: All right, this is what the contract means. This is what medical \ncare would require under this circumstance as called for under the \ncontract, and therefore the patient is entitled, or is not entitled, to \nthis particular procedure.\n  That review process is supposed to occur quickly so that the patient \nreceives the care he or she has contracted for and deserves under the \ncircumstances.\n  In order for an external reviewer to know whether or not a particular \nprocedure or treatment is called for, there has to be some standard by \nwhich to judge that. The Presiding Officer and the other lawyers in \nthis body will know that anytime you ask some reviewer to determine \nwhether or not something has to be done, you need to provide some \nstandard upon which that reviewer can base a decision.\n  The bill right now contains no standard, and it needs such a \nstandard. Our amendment supplies that standard. We believe it supplies \na very fair and reasonable standard. The language in S. 1052 gives the \nexternal reviewer a free hand to disregard the definition of ``medical \nnecessity'' contained in the contract and, as I say, supplies no \nsubstitute definition.\n  As in all of the bills, this external review requirement is the last \nprocess prior to going to court. But, as I said, the external reviewer \nis ``not bound by'' the contract's key definition of ``medical \nnecessity'' or ``experimental and investigational.'' As a result, the \nexternal reviewers can simply make up their own definition of ``medical \nnecessity.''\n  Private contracts negotiated between the parties--insurers and \nemployees, or insurers and individual consumers--would become virtually \nmeaningless in this circumstance, and the financial obligations of the \nhealth plan could become totally unpredictable.\n  The plan or insurer could become obligated to pay for items or \nservices based on definitions outside the contract, even potentially \nincluding contractually excluded items that were deemed to be medically \nnecessary by the reviewer. The ``not bound by'' provision, therefore, \nwould have the effect of eliminating the ability of the parties to \nnegotiate the key terms and conditions of health insurance contract \nagreements.\n  Madam President, in addition to vitiating legal contracts, the ``not \nbound by'' language would have the following negative effects.\n  First, inconsistent standards: The standards used by reviewers would \nvary with each review panel and with each case within the same plan. We \nare trying to create some degree of uniformity with this legislation, \nbut under the bill you could have the potential for a wide variety of \nvery arbitrary decisions because of the lack of a standard.\n  Second, quality of care: The mere threat of contract nullification \ncould prompt some plans to pay for all claims regardless of the cost \nand the impact on the quality of patient care.\n  Solvency and stability: The use of unpredictable outside definitions \nof medical necessity will impose costs for unanticipated treatments not \nreflected in actuarial data used to determine the amount of the health \ncare premium.\n  And finally, cost increases: Solvency concerns would result in \nincreased cost for employers and increased premiums for employees.\n  The net result of that, of course, will be to remove more people from \nthe rolls of the insured.\n  Under S. 1052 as written, these contracts, negotiated between the \nparties and often approved by State insurance regulators, will be \nvoidable, not by a judge or a court of law but by an unrelated \nnonjudicial third-party reviewer. This will undermine the principles of \nthe contract as well as due process.\n  So, as I said, to address this problem we have sponsored an amendment \nthat would allow the plan to adopt a widely accepted safe harbor \ndefinition of medical necessity as its contract definition. If a plan \nutilized this safe harbor definition, then the external reviewer would \nbe bound by it when hearing a patient's appeal of denial of coverage.\n  Safe harbor definitions contained in the amendment are basically at \nthree different levels. First, we take the definition from the Federal \nEmployee Health Benefits Plan that currently covers about 73 percent, \nas best we can calculate it, of the employees under the Federal \nEmployee Health Benefits Plan. Over 6 million Federal employees and \nMembers of Congress are covered by this definition.\n  It is important to recognize--I think some of our friends on the \nother side misunderstood and thought we were offering an amendment that \nhad been offered a couple years ago; I want to make it very clear--this \ndefinition is not the FEHBP or Office of Personnel Management \ndefinition for managed care plans, for HMO plans.\n  This definition is the definition for the fee-for-service plans. As a \nresult, it is a more strict definition. The insurance companies are \ngoing to have to provide a higher quality of care under this definition \nthan they would under the HMOs that provide some coverage to roughly \none-fourth of the people served under the FEHBP program.\n  So, first of all, we have this definition. I will actually read it in \njust a moment.\n  Secondly, there are going to be some States that already have a \nbinding State statutory definition. There are 13 of them. Of course, a \nlegally binding State definition of medical necessity would apply to \nclaims filed in those States. That would constitute a safe harbor for \nthe companies that use that definition. Obviously, it would be only \nprospective, not an after-the-claim adoption of the definition. So \nobviously that would have to apply.\n  Third, if there is a question about whether this first FEHBP \ndefinition works or that people like it, we have established a \nnegotiated rulemaking process under the bill which would involve all of \nthe stakeholders involved--the plans, the employers, providers, and \nconsumers--and they could arrive at a definition that is different if \nthey felt that it could be improved.\n  If the rulemaking failed to arrive at a definition, then, again, you \neither have a State definition or the FEHBP definition we provide. But \nif the rulemaking did achieve a definition that all agreed to, that \nthen would supplant the FEHBP definition we have.\n  I will ask staff to give me the actual language now since I gave the \ncopy of my legislation to the clerk. I would like to read the elements \nof this definition now. This is the definition, as I say, that already \napplies to, we know, about 49 percent of the employees, and we think it \napplies to another 23 or 24 percent as well.\n  First of all, the determination provides whether services, drugs, \nsupplies, or equipment provided by a hospital or other covered provider \nare, No. 1, appropriate to prevent, diagnose, or treat your condition, \nillness, or injury--obviously, very straightforward and, No. 2, \nprobably the most important point, consistent with standards of good \nmedical practice in the United States. That is the key. If the employee \nargues that something is being denied in the way of treatment or care \nand good standards of good medical practice in the United States would \ncall for that treatment, then that treatment will have to be provided \nunder this definition. So standards of good medical practice is the \nsame standard essentially that would be used in a court case. It is the \nsame standard that is used for most of the Federal employees. It is \nobviously a good standard to use.\n  There are three other aspects of it. I will read each of the three. \nThey deal with very specific situations: Not primarily for the personal \ncomfort or convenience of the patient, the family, or the provider; No. \n4, not part of or associated with scholastic education or vocational \ntraining of the patient; and No. 5, in the case of inpatient care,\n\n[[Page S6904]]\n\ncannot be provided safely on an outpatient basis. That would enable the \ntreatment to be provided on an outpatient basis if it could be done.\n  It is a very straightforward definition. It is one that has been used \nliterally hundreds of times. It covers a significant portion of the 6 \nmillion people covered, and we think it is a good definition to be \nincluded in this legislation.\n  We think it represents a reasonable compromise on the one hand \nbetween requiring an external reviewer to be bound by a too narrow \ndefinition in a ``rogue'' plan contract and, on the other hand, \naffording a majority of the plans that operate in good faith the \nopportunity to adopt a widely accepted safe harbor definition of \nmedical necessity to which the external reviewer would be bound.\n  Madam President, we think this is a good compromise. It is clearly \nimportant for us to include some kind of definition in the legislation. \nWe had hoped that the sponsors of the legislation would be willing to \nwork with us to include this definition. So far they have declined to \ndo so. But I am hopeful that we can continue to talk with them, and \nperhaps we can reach some understanding that would enable us to \nsubstitute this definition for the lack of a definition in the \nlegislation right now.\n  At this point, I yield time to the cosponsor of the amendment, Ben \nNelson, the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I rise today to offer, along \nwith my colleague and friend from Arizona, Senator Jon Kyl, an \namendment to protect the sanctity of health insurance contracts, to \nprovide certainty and clarity so that both the issuer and the insured \ncan know what coverage they have.\n  This amendment will preserve a patient's right to receive the health \nbenefits that they paid for while keeping insurance premiums \naffordable. In more colloquial terms, this amendment is what is needed \nto see that the people who pay for health care coverage get it. It may \nsound extraneous, and this is anything but exciting language, but I \nknow from my experience as a State insurance commissioner in Nebraska \ntwo decades ago that this amendment is essential for the preservation \nof what I believe is an extraordinarily fundamental patient right.\n  Before I elaborate further on this point, let me state that I think a \nPatients' Bill of Rights is not only a good idea; it is an excellent \nidea. I believe Congress should be acting in the best interests of all \nAmericans to enact such legislation.\n  We need a Patients' Bill of Rights to ensure that doctors make \nmedical decisions. We need a Patients' Bill of Rights to protect \npatients and federally regulated health care plans that are currently \nunprotected and have been unprotected for more than two decades. We \nneed a Patients' Bill of Rights to guarantee patients' access to \nindependent and external medical review and, only as a last resort, to \nguarantee them access to the courts.\n  There is no shortage of reasons why this legislation merits passage.\n  But before my support for a Patients' Bill of Rights is misconstrued \nas an ``anything goes'' approval, I want to be clear that while I \nbelieve the Senate should approve a Patients' Bill of Rights, I think \nthat some improvements are justifiable. And right now, we have the \nopportunity to make those much-needed improvements which will \nultimately increase the effectiveness of the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I believe the bill needs to carefully consider matters such as the \nissue addressed by this amendment pertaining to the sanctity of health \ninsurance contracts. And I hope that the sponsors of the legislation \nwill look very favorably on this matter and that we will be able to \nwork out an arrangement or agreement to get it included as part of the \nbill.\n\n  First, this amendment would ensure that patients receive the care \nthat they are entitled to under the plans to which they subscribe. \nExternal reviewers would be required to assess treatment options based \non the contract that exists between the patient and the plan.\n  Patients would be entitled to the care outlined as a provided benefit \nwithin the contract that exists. External reviews would not be able to \ncircumvent the contract to force employers to expand coverage for any \nparticular patient unless the patient was entitled to the care as \nspecified by the care contract.\n  This will help keep down the high cost of health care and, at the \nsame time, will enable employers to continue to provide their employees \nwith the best care possible.\n  More importantly, this amendment will provide three safe harbors for \nemployers with respect to protecting them against unnecessary \nlitigation over treatment. While patients will have the right to sue \nunder this bill, this amendment will more clearly define the parameters \nby which treatments can be determined as ``medically necessary'' and \nthus will provide a safeguard of medically necessary standards for \nemployers that administer their own health plans.\n  The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill contains something that I think would \ncurrently require external reviewers to abide by the standard for the \ndetermination of medical necessity included in the bill, but it doesn't \nbind the reviewers by the insurers' definitions for medical necessity. \nThis is problematic as it relates to the existing contract between \npatient and provider and provides a great deal of unclarity and \nuncertainty.\n  So to remedy this situation, this amendment proposes to identify \nthree separate and distinct sources of definitions that employers could \nchoose to use in the contract by which reviewers will be bound. The \nthree options that we create for the plans are:\n  One, a definition that plans are required to use by State law. This \nwould protect the previously existing and any newly created State laws \nthat require plans to use a definition put forward by the State.\n  Second, any definition used by a plan which is codified by the \nlanguage in the fee-for-service agreement that is currently covering \nmaybe 50 to 75 percent of the Federal employees under the FEHBP, or the \nFederal Employees Health Benefit Program, would be used by the plans \ncovering those who would be covered under these ERISA plans. What that \nmeans is, if it was good enough for Members of Congress and Federal \nemployees, this certainly ought to be good enough for everyone else.\n  Three, a definition that is to be developed through negotiated \nrulemaking. This option requires the Secretary of Labor to develop a \nrulemaking committee that will seek public comment to develop a \ndefinition of ``medical necessity.'' In other words, State laws will be \nrecognized and respected. Secondly, there will be a definition that is \nnow included as a fee-for-service definition in the current Federal \nEmployees Health Benefit Program. And in the event that a rulemaking \nprocess is negotiated through the Department of Labor, the rulemaking \ncommittee will seek public comment to develop a definition of what is \n``medical necessity.''\n  The negotiated rulemaking committee, the third item of this three-\npronged approach, will consist of at least one individual representing \neach of the following groups: Health care consumers, small employers, \nlarge employers, physicians, hospitals, other health care providers, \nhealth insurance issuers, State insurance regulators, health \nmaintenance organizations, third party administrators, the Medicare \nProgram, the Medicaid Program, the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nand the Agency For Health Care Research and Quality. That is quite a \nlist of individuals for public comment and public input.\n  This committee would have until 1 year after the general effective \ndate of the bill's implementation to propose a rule to the Secretary. \nThe Secretary, then, would be required to publish the rule within 30 \ndays of the receipt.\n  Madam President, our goal is to ensure that all patients have access \nto all treatment options available under their plans. We need to \nprovide this access without undermining the integrity of the contract \nbetween the patient and the provider. Without some standard for a \ndefinition on ``medical necessity,'' these objectives would be \nimpossible to obtain. Both parties are entitled to certainty and \npredictability.\n\n[[Page S6905]]\n\nThis will provide it. Without passage of this amendment, there will be \nboth uncertainty and a lack of predictability and neither party will be \nbenefited.\n  I ask my friends and colleagues to consider this amendment as one \nthat will improve the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy HMO reform bill. I ask for \ntheir support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I reluctantly have to rise in order to \noppose the amendments of my good friends on the issue of medical \nnecessity. I outlined earlier in the day the basic judgment and basic \nhistory of how we reached the language that we have included in our \nbill.\n  First, let us look at what will be the standard that is in both the \nMcCain-Edwards bill, as well as in the Frist-Breaux bill. Effectively, \nboth treat this particular issue of medical necessity the same. This is \na result of the fact that this issue had been debated 2\\1/2\\ years ago \nwhen we considered the Patients' Bill of Rights here and in the House \nof Representatives. We tried to define the test on medical necessity \nduring that period of time. What we resolved is to permit, at the time \nof the external review, the kind of test that we have included in our \nlanguage here and in the Frist-Breaux language. This was actually the \nlanguage which was agreed to in the conference last year, a conference \nthat never resulted in an overall outcome of the legislation. \nNonetheless, we had agreed on a handful of different areas of dispute. \nThat was agreed to by my colleagues, Phil Gramm, Don Nickles, myself, \nand others, after a good deal of negotiation.\n  It seems wise to continue that particular proposal because basically \nthis is what we are doing. At the time of the appeal of any of these \nmedical necessity issues, we are permitting for the standard of \ndetermination in our bill, on page 35: ``The condition shall be based \non the medical condition of the participant.'' That is obvious. No. 1, \nwhat is wrong with the patient? And then it talks about ``valid, \nrelevant, scientific evidence and clinical evidence, including peer-\nreviewed medical literature and findings, including expert opinion.''\n  Basically, the reason for that is to allow for the possibility that \nwe find out there are new kinds of discoveries, new kinds of \ntechniques, new kinds of treatments for various health conditions. In \norder to not use a stagnant kind of proposal, we included that \nlanguage. This language which was agreed to is supported by the \nAmerican Medical Association and other medical groups.\n  So in the legislation that we have here in the McCain-Edwards \nproposal, which I support, and the Frist-Breaux proposal, which others \nincluding the President of the United States support, and in the \nagreement that was made by Republicans and Democrats alike, we agreed \neffectively to this language. This agreement occurred after considering \nall the different kinds of proposals. It raises questions of why we are \ntoday attempting to alter that particular proposal.\n  The argument is, first of all, that we can offer three different \noptions. One would be that the administration can propose an \nadministrative group, a commission that can make some recommendations \nabout what that standard would be.\n  That may work out, but it may not work out very well if we have an \nadministration that is not as sympathetic to the protection of \npatients' and doctors' decisions as we have tried to be in this \nundertaking. That is one way of doing it.\n  Second, the results of State actions can be the criteria. In some \nStates the protections have been very good, and other States have left \na lot to be desired.\n  I understand the basic thrust of this legislation is to establish \nminimum standards. If States want to have higher protections for \nconsumers, they are welcome to do it. What we are trying to do is \nensure that all Americans, all American families are protected.\n  In the area of scope, all Americans being protected--actually, every \nRepublican proposal that was considered in the House of Representatives \nincluded all Americans--we were attempting to ensure that there was \ngoing to be a minimum standard. However, we can use another standard, \nsuch as the good Federal employee standard to which the Senator just \nreferred.\n  It is interesting, though, that the Office of Personnel Management \ndoes not use the Federal employee standard on their reviews. What do \nthey do? They do something very similar to what we have done. They \npermit the doctor to make the ultimate decision and not be bound by \nsome definition. The reason for this is because they do not believe \nthat that should to be the restrictive definition for all appeals.\n  In turn, there is a Federal employee program of which all of us are a \npart. In our program if there is going to be an appeal, this is a \ndifferent standard. Basically, it is a standard that permits the \ndoctors to make the judgments and decisions.\n  I find it difficult to be convinced at this hour. We waited a good \ndeal of time. I know we were all pressed with the different proposals. \nI have had a chance to talk to my friend and colleague, Senator Nelson, \non a number of different provisions. From personal experience, I can \ntell that this is a Senator who has spent a good deal of time on this \nlegislation and has been willing to spend a great deal of time visiting \nwith me and with others, and also talking extensively with the House \nMembers who are interested in various provisions. I know a good deal of \nthought has gone into this matter.\n  My final point is the underlying commitment of this legislation to \nmake sure that doctors are going to make the decisions. Trained medical \npersonnel and families are going to make these judgments and decisions. \nIt seems to me that when we have included in the legislation's \nlanguage--in fact, insisted on--permitting the doctor to use the best \nmedical information and judgment of this decision making and will \npermit them to also take advantage of the latest ideas, new \nconclusions, new consensus of the treatment of various medical \nconditions, this is the best way rather than a review being bound up in \nsome process.\n  We do not know tonight, for example, whether the board is going to be \noverly sensitive to the consumers and patients. There is a wide variety \nof interpretations in many of the States.\n  This is unlike other parts of this legislation where there is a \ndifference between what we have proposed, what is included in Breaux-\nFrist, and what the President has recommended. In these areas, the \nMcCain-Edwards proposal, the Breaux-Frist proposal, the conference \ncommittee by Republicans and Democrats alike, and the President have \nreached similar conclusions. This is one of the most important areas of \nthe legislation. It seems to me what we have in the underlying \nlegislation is completely consistent with what the President has \nindicated would be key to this legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I start by thanking my two colleagues, \nthe Senator from Arizona, my good, dear friend from Arizona, for his \nwork on this issue, and now my friend from Nebraska, with whom I have \nhad occasion on this specific bill to work many days and many hours. As \nthe Senator from Massachusetts has suggested, he has great expertise in \nthis area, both in his time as insurance commissioner and his time as \nGovernor. He and I have worked together on a number of issues, such as \nemployer liability which we will be offering an amendment on hopefully \ntomorrow. We have talked about a number of other issues, such as the \nscope of the legislation, and medical necessity is another issue in \nwhich the Senator has been actively involved.\n  I specifically thank him for his work on this issue on behalf of the \npeople of Nebraska whom he represents. He has been extraordinarily \ndiligent and involved in this very important issue of the Patients' \nBill of Rights and patient protections. I thank him very much for all \nof his work and will continue to work with him. He has had terrific \nideas all the way through the discussion.\n  As to this specific amendment, I announce to my colleagues that we \nhave negotiated during the course of the day with other Senators \nbesides the sponsors of this amendment and have reached an agreement on \na compromise\n\n[[Page S6906]]\n\nthat we believe accurately and adequately reflects a balance between \nrecognizing the sanctity of the contract language while at the same \ntime giving medical reviewers the flexibility they need to order care \nin those cases where the care needs to be ordered.\n  Tomorrow we anticipate an amendment being offered by Senators Bayh, \nCarper, and perhaps others, that will reflect the results of those \nnegotiations. We feel very pleased we were able to resolve that issue \nwith some of our colleagues.\n  For that reason, we will not be able to support this particular \namendment, but I believe our amendment goes a long way toward \naddressing the same issues that my colleagues are trying to address \nwith this amendment. Their work is helpful and productive, and we \nappreciate it very much.\n  Tomorrow morning we will be offering the results of the work we have \ndone with Senators Bayh, Carper, and others which, as I indicated, \nproperly reflects the balance between the importance of the language of \nthe contract and showing deference to that language while at the same \ntime recognizing that in some cases the medical reviewers will need \nsome more flexibility to do what is necessary for a particular family \nor for a particular patient.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Presiding Officer let us know when we have 5 \nminutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand it, and I can be corrected, under one of \nthe provisions, HHS establishes a board. At some time the board tries \nto work out the definition, but we do not know how that will work out, \nwhat the framework will be, or how many patients, consumers, and HMO \npersonnel will be on the board. That board will have a meeting, and \nthey will work out some definition of ``medical necessity'' which \ncreates a degree of uncertainty.\n  Second, we have questions about the States, some of which have \nadopted various criteria about what is medical necessity.\n  Third, we have the Federal employees health program, which, as I \nmentioned, is not the standard which is used on review by the Office of \nPersonnel Management. They don't use that. They use a standard much \ncloser to what we have. Even on that standard, many cancer groups are \nvery concerned about possible restrictions on palliative care, care \nwhich is enormously important to cancer patients. We have heard from a \nnumber of cancer organizations about their serious concern regarding \nthis particular point. On the other hand, they are in support of the \nlanguage we have included in the Edwards bill.\n\n  First, we know we have something that the American Medical \nAssociation, the medical professionals, patients, the doctors, and the \nhealth care delivery system have said is a good standard. Our opponents \noffer a standard that may turn out to be fine in the future but we \ndon't know. And secondly, as another standard which has serious \nproblems with the cancer community because it raises questions, doesn't \nthe Senator agree with me, we ought to use what is now agreed to by \nRepublicans, by Democrats? Most importantly, ought we not use the \nstandard endorsed by those within the medical profession? If this \nstandard does not work, we will have an opportunity to take a look down \nthe road in terms of altering and changing. Is that a preferable way to \nproceed?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I agree with the Senator.\n  As the Senator knows, the legislation offered by the Senator, myself, \nand Senator McCain, this specific language is supported by the medical \ngroups from around the country involved with this issue on a daily \nbasis that have a first-hand understanding of what works and what \ndoesn't work. We have been working with those groups to fashion this \nlanguage. That is the reason that language exists. We know from the \nAmerican Medical Association and all the health care groups around the \ncountry that they support the language we have in the bill.\n  That having been said, I say to the Senator, in order to try to \naddress some of the concerns raised, my colleagues who are the sponsors \nof this amendment have been working with a group of Senators today to \nfashion an alteration to this language that makes it clearer that the \ncontract language will be respected but balances that against the need \nfor flexibility with the review panel. I believe we will have an \namendment tomorrow to offer on that subject.\n  I end by thanking my colleagues from Arizona and Nebraska. While I \nwill not be able to support their amendment, we understand the issue. \nWe believe our bill is adequate on this issue, but we will have an \nalternative to propose tomorrow. Ultimately the point of this, of \ncourse, is to protect patients, make sure patients get the care they \nneed. I think the language in our bill plus the language in the \namendment will accomplish that purpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment and I \nurge my colleagues to support it. I will make a couple of comments \nabout some of the statements that were made.\n  I appreciate Senator Edwards' comments saying we are willing to have \nan amendment tomorrow to try to fix part of the problem. We heard that \nearlier today when we had an amendment to exempt employers.\n  There were statements made by many proponents of the language, \nemployers can't be sued under this bill. That is a direct quote. So \nearlier today we tried to make sure employers couldn't be sued, and \npeople voted against the amendment. But we heard: Well, there is an \namendment coming that will protect employers.\n  We understand this bill language, and there is a section that deals \nwith employers that says employers shall be excluded from liability, \nand then there is an exception. As a matter of fact, on page 144, \ncauses of action against employers and plan sponsors are precluded, \nparagraph (A).\n  Paragraph (B) says:\n\n       Certain causes of action permitted.--Notwithstanding \n     subparagraph (A), a cause of action may arise against an \n     employer or other plan sponsor. . . .\n\n  We tried to make sure employers would be exempted, and unfortunately \nthat amendment didn't pass. But we did hear assurances from some of the \nsponsors, we have an amendment and we will protect employers. But, yes, \nemployers can be sued because obviously the Gramm amendment didn't \npass. So I just mention that.\n  We raised the point, and it was raised well by Senator Kyl from \nArizona and Senator Nelson of Nebraska, that said we are not bound by \ncontracts, and there is all kinds of language here dealing with \ncontracts. You don't have to have coverage for excluded benefits. That \nsounds very good, but there is language ``except for,'' language that \nsays you have to cover benefits that are excluded from a contract. Then \nI heard my colleague from North Carolina say we will have an amendment \ntomorrow to take care of that.\n  There are several major provisions with this bill that are wrong, one \nof which is the liability is far too generous and one which says the \ncontracts don't mean anything. So we are wrestling with the liability.\n  We tried to exempt employers today and were not successful. Now we \nare working on contract sanctity. I hope all Democrats and Republicans \nwill look at the language that is in the bill and realize how far it \ngoes and think about what is getting ready to happen. I use for an \nexample President Clinton's appointment of a bipartisan commission to \nmake recommendations on this issue. They said in the report:\n\n       The right to external appeals does not apply to denials, \n     reductions, or terminations of coverage or denials of payment \n     for services that are specifically excluded from the \n     consumer's coverage as established by contract.\n\n  In other words, the report to the President by the Advisory \nCommission on Consumer Protection and Equality in Health Care says if \nit is excluded in the contract, you don't have the right to even have \nan appeal. That is not appealable. In other words, if the contract says \ndon't cover it, it shouldn't be covered.\n  Yet in the language in the bill, did we adhere to the President's \ncommission? No. If you look at the language on page 35 of the bill:\n\n       No Coverage for Excluded Benefits.--Nothing in this \n     subsection shall be construed\n\n[[Page S6907]]\n\n     to permit an independent medical reviewer to require that a \n     group health plan, or health insurance issuer offering health \n     insurance coverage, provide coverage for items or services \n     for which benefits are specifically excluded or expressly \n     limited under the plan or coverage in the plain language of \n     the plan document--\n\n  If it stopped there, it would be great, but it doesn't stop there, if \nyou read the additional language:\n\n     and which are disclosed under section 121(b)(1)(C) except to \n     the extent that the application or interpretation of the \n     exclusion or limitation involves a determination described in \n     paragraph (2).\n\n  In other words, you don't have to pay for an excluded benefit \n``except for.''\n  Wait a minute, you have a contract, and a medical provider says, I \nwill provide this list of contracts and I will charge so much per month \nto provide these contracts, and this bill says we are not going to \noverturn that exclusion. That is what the first part of the paragraph \nsays. And the second part of the paragraph says ``except for,'' and you \nhave to ask, well, what do you mean ``except for''? Start reading: \nexcept for medically reviewable decisions, and it turns out anything is \na medically reviewable decision.\n  So anyone can say it is medically reviewable if the denial is based \non medical necessity and, appropriately, denial based on experimental \nor otherwise based on evaluation of medical facts. The net result is, \nbingo, anything is covered. You have a lottery.\n  I heard my colleague from Massachusetts--and I have great respect for \nhim--say we had an agreement last year and basically Senator Nickles in \nthe conference committee agreed to this language.\n  We did not. I will make a few comments to get specific on the \nlanguage. We came close in a lot of areas. But I will refresh my \ncolleagues on things we did agree to that do not appear in the bill \ntoday.\n  I have a document, agreed-to elements of the external appeals \nsection, dated April 13, 2000, 6 o'clock. We agreed to many items which \nwere not in the underlying bill. I don't think you can say we agreed to \none provision--whoops, we forget to say we agreed on a lot of other \nthings.\n  We agreed that a patient should have access to independent reviews \nfor any denial of claim of benefits, No. 1, if the amount of such item \nor service exceeds a significant financial threshold or, No. 2, if \nthere is a significant risk of placing the life, health, or development \nof the patient in jeopardy.\n  I see in the bill we have before us there is no such thing as a \nfinancial threshold. This clearly violates the so-called agreement that \nwas entered into last year.\n  Further, the language regarding the ``denial creates a significant \nrisk of placing the life health or development of the patient in \njeopardy'' is not in the bill before us. It is not in the McCain-\nKennedy-Edwards bill.\n  It is interesting; that language was in the original Senate bill, S. \n6. It was also in President Clinton's report on quality. But it is not \nin the bill that we have before us. It is not in the McCain-Kennedy-\nEdwards bill. My point is, before we had included some language to try \nto make sure we would have some protections and that was disregarded.\n  In addition, last year we agreed to a $50 filing fee to discourage \nfrivolous filings. I see this particular agreement was also absent from \ntoday's version. The bill before us has a $25 filing fee. One of the \nreasons why we had a $50 filing fee was because we did not want \nfrivolous filings. We didn't want people to say:\n  I will appeal. Maybe I will get lucky; maybe I will have extra \nbenefits, more coverage; maybe I can lay a predicate for lawsuits in \nthe future. What do I have to lose? If you had a little more of a \nthreshold, it may discourage frivolous suits.\n  We also agreed at one time to consider expert opinion if it was by \ninformed, valid, and relevant scientific and clinical evidence. The \nlanguage we have before us on page 35 talks about the standard for \ndetermination. It says we are going to review:\n\n       . . . valid relevant scientific evidence and clinical \n     evidence, including peer-reviewed medical literature and \n     findings including expert opinion.\n\n  But it did not include everything we had agreed to in the past.\n  What I do recall is last year we did agree that both sides maintained \nthere was a goal to maintain the sanctity of the contract and not \nestablish appeals which allowed for the coverage of any excluded \nbenefit. In fact, the very basis for today's debate is ensuring that \npatients are not denied promised benefits. It is not a debate to create \na process to resolve and order unpromised benefits.\n  I think the language we have before us in the McCain-Kennedy-Edwards \nbill does just that. It is the legislative process that we would make \nwhere people could get unpromised benefits, to get items that in some \ncases are contractually prohibited to be covered benefits.\n  That is a stretch. Federal employees do not have that; Medicare does \nnot have that; Medicaid doesn't have it. There is a list of covered \nbenefits and there is also a list of excluded benefits.\n\n  I will give an example and I will put this in the Record. This is \nfrom CHAMPVA. It has a list of about 25 items that are excluded, \nspecifically, from VA coverage. I will mention a couple of them: \nacupuncture, air conditioners, humidifiers, exercise equipment, \neyeglasses, and contact lenses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for another 6 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Health club memberships, hearings aids or hearing aid \nexams, homemaker services, hypnosis, massage therapy, physical therapy \nconsisting of general exercise programs, plastic and other surgical \nprocedures primarily for cosmetic purposes, smoking cessation programs, \nand several others.\n  My point is, here is a Government plan for veterans that has \nspecifically excluded items that should not be covered. I will venture \nto say every private health care plan has excluded items as well. Under \nthe bill we have before us, it says you don't have to cover excluded \nitems except for--and then it opens the door. That, to me, says do not \npay any attention to the contract. Contracts do not mean anything.\n  What is the net result of that? If people who have contracts are not \nbound by the contracts, then the cost of providing health care is going \nto go way up. There is no real definitive way of knowing how much the \ncoverage is going to cost because it is not defined coverage. There is \nnothing you can bank on.\n  I compliment my friends and colleagues from Arizona and Nebraska for \ntheir leadership in putting this amendment together. This amendment is \nequally as important--maybe not quite as easy to understand but very \nmuch as important--for containing the cost of health care as anything \nwe have considered so far. Are we going to allow people to have \ncontracts? Are we going to live by those contracts? Or are we going to \ntake the language in this bill and say: Contracts? We don't care. Are \nwe going to violate what the President's Commission on Health Care \nsaid? They said you should not cover items that are excluded from \ncontracts. Are we just going to ignore it as does the underlying \nMcCain-Kennedy-Edwards bill? Are we going to have a medical necessity \ndefinition that is the same thing Federal employees have on their fee-\nfor-service plans, which is a quality plan which most all of us are in \nand most all of us are happy with? Isn't that good enough? Can't we \ngive some assurances that those are things that people can rely on?\n  Again, I compliment my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Nelson, for \nhis expertise. He brought this to my attention when I was discussing \nthis legislation. He was exactly right. He said this has to be fixed. \nWe are working to fix it. We can fix it.\n\n  I urge my colleagues, let's not just be voting on remote control, on \nhow some leaders tell us how to vote. Let's look at the language. Do \nyou really want to have language that basically abrogates contracts, \nignores contracts, no telling how much it can cost and also, \nincidentally, have liability?\n  You could have, under the McCain-Kennedy bill, a situation where \nsomebody doesn't provide a service that is contractually prohibited and \nthey can be sued because some expert might determine it is medically \nnecessary. This expert might be a acupuncture specialist and they might \ndetermine that what you need to solve your back problem is acupuncture \nand even though\n\n[[Page S6908]]\n\nyour contract, as VA's, says you do not have to cover it, you have to \ncover it because that is a solution and under the bill it says expert \nopinion. So maybe it should be covered.\n  If you think that is a stretch, it is not a stretch. You can find \nexperts to say almost anything in the medical field and sometimes in \nthe legal field.\n  My point is this bill undermines contracts in a way in which I think \nwe should be very, very wary. We should not do this. My colleagues from \nNebraska and Arizona have come up with a good fix, a good solution. I \nappreciate that the Senator from North Carolina said he is amenable to \nfixing this problem. The way to fix it is to pass the Kyl-Nelson \namendment. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment tomorrow \nmorning.\n  I thank the indulgence of my colleagues I yield the floor, and ask \nunanimous consent the CHAMPVA list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Other Medical Services . . . What Is Not Covered\n\n              (Not all-inclusive--see Specific Exclusions)\n\n       Acupuncture.\n       Acupressure.\n       Air conditioners, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and \n     purifiers.\n       Autopsy.\n       Aversion therapy.\n       Biofeedback equipment.\n       Biofeedback treatment of ordinary muscle tension or \n     psychological conditions.\n       Chiropractic service.\n       Exercise equipment.\n       Eyeglasses, contact lenses,and eye refraction exams--except \n     under very limited circumstances, such as corneal lens \n     removal.\n       Foot care services of a routine nature, such as removal of \n     corns, calluses, trimming of toenails, unless the patient is \n     diagnosed with a systemic medical disease.\n       Health club memberships.\n       Hearing aids or hearing aid exams.\n       Homemaker services.\n       Hypnosis.\n       Medications that do not require a prescription (except for \n     insulin and other diabetic supplies which are covered).\n       Massage therapy.\n       Naturopathic services.\n       Orthotic shoe devices, such as heel lifts, arch supports, \n     shoe inserts, etc., unless associated with diabetes.\n       Physical therapy consisting of general exercise programs or \n     gait analysis.\n       Plastic and other surgical procedures primarily for \n     cosmetic purposes.\n       Radial Keratotomy.\n       Sexual dysfunction/inadequacy treatment related to a non-\n     organic cause.\n       Smoking cessation programs.\n       Transportation services other than what is described for \n     ambulance service under What Is Covered in this section.\n       Weight control or weight reduction programs, except for \n     certain surgical procedures (contact HAC).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 12\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, we have had a good discussion coming back, once again, \nto what I think is one of the fundamental aspects of this bill. We have \ngone through this. I have taken the time to go through this evening \nwhat the criteria were going to be for the medical officer at the time \nof the external appeal. Those criteria have been supported today by the \noverwhelming majority of the medical profession because they understand \nthat, with those criteria, we are going to get a medical decision that \nwill be in the best interests of the patient. That is really not \nchallenged.\n  What is being suggested are three different options that might be \nused. The one we offer has the support of the medical community. It has \nthe overwhelming support of the medical community. That is the first \npoint.\n  With all respect to my friend and colleague from Oklahoma, regarding \nthe provisions, when it comes down to what is and is not going to be \npermitted, clearly if there is an exclusion in the contract there will \nnot be the right of the medical officer to alter and change that. Let \nme give an example on the issue of medical necessity under the criteria \nthat we have, where it might very well be interpreted by a medical \nofficer. Say a particular HMO excluded cosmetic surgery.\n  The question came down to a child that had a cleft palate, and the \nmedical officer said: Well, they are excluding cosmetic surgery, but a \ncleft palate for a child is a medical necessity. That medical officer, \nI believe, ought to be able to make that judgment. Under the language \nthat we have, that medical officer would be able to do it.\n  If, on the other hand, the HMO had put in the contract that they will \nnot permit a medical procedure for a cleft palate, then clearly that \nwould be outside of the medical judgment, and outside of medical \nnecessity.\n  That is the example that is really reflected in the language which we \nhave included. But the fact is those are exceptional cases. They are \nnot unimportant. But the most important aspect of the case is that the \njudgment that is going to be made by the medical officer is going to be \nbased on the medical needs of the particular patient and the best \nmedical information that is available.\n  That is what has had the broad support. There may very well be a new \ncommission established under HHS made up of a number of different \nstakeholders which may come up with some recommendation that may be a \nbetter one. That might be so. If that is the case down the road, maybe \nwe can have the opportunity to consider it and bring some change to it. \nBut as we have heard earlier, and as we have seen, the Federal \nemployees standard that is used is not permitted to be used in terms of \nappeals procedure. The reason, evidently, is because they believe the \nmedical officer ought to be able to use the criteria which brings into \nplay the latest information and the latest scientific information that \nis available, and the best information that would be helpful to that \nmedical profession.\n  Finally, there is the question, What are we going to do? Are we \nreally going to ultimately let their judgment and decision be made by \nthe medical professional with enough flexibility so that they can bring \nto bear medical judgments on this, and also consider the best \ninformation that is available to them and apply that best medical \ninformation available to benefit the patient?\n  I think we have a good process and a good way of proceeding. That is \nwhy I believe that we ought to stay the course with what is included in \nthe legislation and resist the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I know we have another amendment that we are going to \ndebate this evening. If there are others who want to speak on this, we \nwelcome them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if this side has run out of time, I ask \nunanimous consent to speak for what time I might consume. But I don't \nexpect it will be over 10 or 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I don't intend to object. Is this in favor of the \namendment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. I am sorry I didn't say that. I am in favor of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to address what I believe is a \nvery fundamental, fatal flaw in the legislation before us. That flaw \nrelates to how the bill treats health plan contracts, and the \nprecedents that this treatment sets for all contracts, not just those \nbetween health plans and employers.\n  As currently drafted, the bill states that specific definitions and \nterms in health plan contracts can be entirely thrown out in favor of \nanother definition made up by a third party charged with reviewing a \nplan's decision to deny care.\n  This basically invalidates all contracts between health plans and \nemployers and makes them non-binding.\n  Putting the terms of health plan contracts on the chopping block \nundercuts the very purpose of the health plan contract itself.\n  If these contracts are not binding, the health plan will have no way \nof knowing what standard it should follow in making coverage decisions, \nthe employer will have no way of knowing what its costs will be, and \nthe patient will have no way of knowing what kinds of items and \nservices are covered.\n  In short, the contract won't be worth the paper its printed on.\n  How do you do business without a contract? Quite frankly it's almost \nimpossible to imagine doing business at all without a binding \nagreement.\n\n[[Page S6909]]\n\n  The Kennedy-McCain bill forces managed care plans to do business in a \nway that no other industry is forced to do--by that I mean without a \nbinding and valid contract.\n  Now, let me stop here for a minute and talk about these health plan \ncontracts.\n  First, contracts between health plans and employers are actually \nnegotiated with all parties involved.\n  Employers, usually with the help of unions and other worker \nrepresentatives, bargain for specified coverage in order to meet the \nunique needs of different employees. Every contract is different.\n  What's more, these contracts are typically reviewed and approved by \nstate insurance regulators before they become effective. The whole \nprocess is deliberative, time consuming and, all told, is truly a \n``meeting of the minds.''\n  The Kennedy-McCain bill says, in effect, to heck with that meeting of \nthe minds. The bill gives unrelated third parties reviewing patient \ncomplaints unprecedented authority to take out contract terms that were \nbargained for in good faith and literally throw them in the trash.\n  This authority to override contracts at any time and for any reason \ngoes far beyond the authority given even to judges, who in all but the \nrarest instances are obliged to apply the terms of a contract.\n  And where judges must explain their rationale in opinions and are \ngenerally accountable as public officials, these third party reviewers \nas outlined in the Kennedy-McCain legislation are private citizens and \nare not accountable to anyone at all.\n  I do believe that every patient should have a right to an \nindependent, external review of a health plan's decision to deny care. \nBut that right cannot be without some rationality and accountability.\n  Third parties charged with reviewing patient complaints should have \nbroad discretion to thoroughly assess, and even overturn, a plan's \ndecision so long as that authority is exercised within the four corners \nof the contract.\n  Kennedy-McCain authorizes third parties to veer far, far away from \nthose four corners, and to tear up the contract altogether.\n  I encourage my colleagues to think about what it would be like if the \ncontracts that they live by everyday contracts for life insurance, home \nmortgages, even car leases could be torn up and rewritten by an \nunaccountable third party at any time.\n  Moreover, I encourage my colleagues who know small business owners or \nwho were themselves small business owners, to think about doing \nbusiness without the security of a binding contract.\n  I believe that those of my colleagues who do think about this will \ncome to understand that the consequences of allowing contract terms to \nbe thrown out could be disastrous, and that all contracts, whether \ninvolving a health plan or not, deserve the deference that our laws \ntraditionally give them.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Kennedy-McCain approach to health \nplan contracts and to support the Kyl-Nelson amendment--which is an \napproach that honors both the integrity of the contract itself, as well \nas the intent of the parties to it. In the end, it is the patient who \nwins under this amendment.\n\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nColorado is to be recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 817\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 817.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard], for himself, Mr. \n     Bond, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. Nickles, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 817.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To exempt small employers from causes of action under the \n                                  Act)\n\n       On page 148, between lines 23 and 24, insert the following:\n       ``(D) Exclusion of small employers.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this paragraph, in addition to excluding certain physicians, \n     other health care professionals, and certain hospitals from \n     liability under paragraph (1), paragraph (1)(A) does not \n     create any liability on the part of a small employer (or on \n     the part of an employee of such an employer acting within the \n     scope of employment).\n       ``(ii) Definition.--In clause (i), the term `small \n     employer' means an employer--\n\n       ``(I) that, during the calendar year preceding the calendar \n     year for which a determination under this subparagraph is \n     being made, employed an average of at least 2 but not more \n     than 50 employees on business days; and\n       ``(II) maintaining the plan involved that is acting, \n     serving, or functioning as a fiduciary, trustee or plan \n     administrator, including--\n\n       ``(aa) a small employer described in section 3(16)(B)(i) \n     with respect to a plan maintained by a single employer; and\n       ``(bb) one or more small employers or employee \n     organizations described in section 3(16)(B)(iii) in the case \n     of a multi-employer plan.\n       ``(iii) Application of certain rules in determination of \n     employer size.--For purposes of this subparagraph:\n\n       ``(I) Application of aggregation rule for employers.--All \n     persons treated as a single employer under subsection (b), \n     (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 shall be treated as 1 employer.\n       ``(II) Employers not in existence in preceding year.--In \n     the case of an employer which was not in existence throughout \n     the preceding calendar year, the determination of whether \n     such employer is a small employer shall be based on the \n     average number of employees that it is reasonably expected \n     such employer will employ on business days in the current \n     calendar year.\n       ``(III) Predecessors.--Any reference in this paragraph to \n     an employer shall include a reference to any predecessor of \n     such employer.\n\n       On page 165, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       ``(D) Exclusion of small employers.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this paragraph, in addition to excluding certain physicians, \n     other health care professionals, and certain hospitals from \n     liability under paragraph (1), paragraph (1)(A) does not \n     create any liability on the part of a small employer (or on \n     the part of an employee of such an employer acting within the \n     scope of employment).\n       ``(ii) Definition.--In clause (i), the term `small \n     employer' means an employer--\n\n       ``(I) that, during the calendar year preceding the calendar \n     year for which a determination under this subparagraph is \n     being made, employed an average of at least 2 but not more \n     than 50 employees on business days; and\n       ``(II) maintaining the plan involved that is acting, \n     serving, or functioning as a fiduciary, trustee or plan \n     administrator, including--\n\n       ``(aa) a small employer described in section 3(16)(B)(i) \n     with respect to a plan maintained by a single employer; and\n       ``(bb) one or more small employers or employee \n     organizations described in section 3(16)(B)(iii) in the case \n     of a multi-employer plan.\n       ``(iii) Application of certain rules in determination of \n     employer size.--For purposes of this subparagraph:\n\n       ``(I) Application of aggregation rule for employers.--All \n     persons treated as a single employer under subsection (b), \n     (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 shall be treated as 1 employer.\n       ``(II) Employers not in existence in preceding year.--In \n     the case of an employer which was not in existence throughout \n     the preceding calendar year, the determination of whether \n     such employer is a small employer shall be based on the \n     average number of employees that it is reasonably expected \n     such employer will employ on business days in the current \n     calendar year.\n       ``(III) Predecessors.--Any reference in this paragraph to \n     an employer shall include a reference to any predecessor of \n     such employer.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment to S. 1052 that \nwould prevent frivolous, unnecessary, and unwarranted lawsuits against \nsmall employers. That is what my amendment is all about. It exempts \nsmall employers that have 50 or fewer employees in their firm. I think \nthis is an important provision. I plan on sharing with my colleagues in \nthis Senate Chamber some of my experiences as a small businessman.\n  I have had the experience of having to start my business from \nscratch. I worked with fewer than 50 employees. Believe me, from \npersonal experience, I know what happens when you are a small employer \nand you have too many mandates on your business and you do not have all \nthe staff and accountants and lawyers in your firm to help you along, \nand you have to go to an attorney or accountant outside your business. \nI know the impact it can have as far as cost is concerned.\n  Believe you me, I know what it feels like to have taxes increased on \nyou as a small businessman because you are in the dollar game; every \ndollar makes a difference on what your bottom line is going to be.\n\n[[Page S6910]]\n\n  Contrary to what many Members of the Senate are trying to argue, S. \n1052 does not exempt small employers from lawsuits. Under S. 1052, \nemployees could sue their employers when an employer--and I quote--\n``fails to exercise ordinary care in making a decision.'' That is from \npage 140 of the bill.\n  Mr. President, 72 percent of small employers in the United States \nprovide health care that Americans need. They do not have to provide \nthat coverage, but they choose to on their own. The Senate should honor \nthat. The Senate should respect that. S. 1052, however, undermines \nthat.\n  Allowing small employers to be liable for health care decisions would \nunduly burden a small employer. It would force them to drop health \ninsurance coverage for millions of America's small business employees. \nAt the very least, it adds a new burden to the businessperson who \nalready spends too much time dealing with Government mandates and \npaperwork.\n  Without our amendment, S. 1052 places medical treatment decisions in \nthe hands of lawyers and judges and will trigger a plethora of lawsuits \nagainst small employers, in my view, creating a field day for trial \nlawyers. The Senate should not support legislation that allows \nunwarranted lawsuits that hurt small employers.\n  This year, employers are trying to cope with a 12-percent increase in \nhealth care costs that employers experienced last year. Now, as we move \nforward into another year, they are looking at somewhere around a 13-\npercent increase.\n  I have a recent survey that was jointly put together with the \nconsulting firm Deloitte & Touche and the industry of business and \nhealth that reveals that health premiums increased more than 12 percent \nlast year and are expected to increase 13 percent in both 2001 and \n2002. So this is a burden with which small employers are faced.\n  With the passage of this bill, the Congressional Budget Office has \nestimated it would increase premiums another 4 percent. That would have \na very adverse impact on small employers. We have heard it is likely we \nwill have an additional 1 million who are uninsured with the passage of \nthis Patients' Bill of Rights. I suggest to the Members of the Senate, \na large part of that million is going to come from the very small \nemployers, those with 50 employees or fewer.\n  S. 1052, as it is currently written, would cause further increases in \nhealth care costs for American families, workers, and businesses across \nthe board. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the \nprevious version of S. 1052, which is substantially identical to the \ncurrent bill under consideration, would increase the Nation's health \ncare costs, as I mentioned earlier, by more than 4 percent. This is \nabove and beyond the additional 13-percent increase in health care \ncosts employers will face this year. Moreover, this year's increase \nwould be the seventh annual increase in a row.\n\n  If S. 1052 passes, many small employers will stop providing health \ncare for their employees and the number of uninsured Americans will \nincrease. The country cannot afford this. The small businesses of \nAmerica cannot afford this. The country cannot afford S. 1052 in its \ncurrent form.\n  I personally know the costs of providing health care to employees. As \nI mentioned earlier, for 20 years I practiced veterinarian medicine and \nprovided health care insurance to my employees. I can speak from \npersonal experience: Providing health care was costly. If I were still \npracticing veterinarian medicine as a private employer, I could not \nbegin to imagine the burden S. 1052 would place on me, my employees, \nand everybody's families involved in that business.\n  I believe we should pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, not a lawyers' \nright to sue. Our bill should focus on expanding access to affordable \nhealth care for the Nation's 43 million uninsured, not on taking steps \nthat will cause more Americans to lose their health insurance and \nfurther burden small business.\n  I also bring up the point that in this particular piece of \nlegislation there are four exemptions. There is an exemption for \nphysicians, an exemption for hospitals, an exemption for a \nrecordkeeping function in health care, as well as an exemption for some \ninsurance providers.\n  The point I make is that if you are beginning to provide an exception \nfor certain businesses, then why not provide that exception for those \npeople who are going to be most adversely impacted by this particular \npiece of legislation? Those 1 million or so that will be uninsured are \ngoing to come out of that small business sector because small employers \nwill have to make the tough decision as to whether they can afford it \nor not, and many of them are going to say: We can't afford it, so we \nare going to have to make some adjustments.\n  One of the major adjustments because of the threat of a lawsuit--and \nI point out to the Presiding Officer that not only is it the lawsuit \nitself when you happen to get a judgment against you that is such a \nproblem; it is the threat of a lawsuit because your margin of profit is \nso narrow that you cannot afford to pay for the professional help, the \nattorneys to defend you. So small employers will make the decision not \nto provide health care insurance.\n  My amendment to S. 1052 would exclude small business employers from \nbeing the victims of frivolous lawsuits. I urge my colleagues to \nconsider the consequences of the small employer liability provisions in \nS. 1052 and to support this amendment.\n  I think at a time when our economy in this country is struggling, and \nat a time when I think everybody in this Chamber understands how \nimportant it is to have a vital small employer sector--it is the small \nemployers that have come up with new ideas; it is the small employers \nthat are the backbone of economic growth in many of our small \ncommunities, particularly in rural areas; it is the small employers \nthat so many of us look to, to be the leaders in our communities--I \nhope there remains a sensitivity to what the small employer contributes \nin the way of competition, in the way of developing new ideas, and in \nthe way of making sure we have stronger family-oriented communities. It \nis a pool of leadership that not only strengthens our communities and \nour States and our Nation, but it is something around which our whole \neconomy evolves because the importance of competition, and using the \ndollar and the marketplace to allow the consumer to predict the best \nservices is an important concept in this country.\n  I don't want to see us lose that by moving constantly towards larger \nbusinesses and a corporate-type of society. There is no doubt that \nsmall business is important to this country. I hope Members of the \nSenate will join me in making sure the small employer, those with 50 \nemployees or less, is exempted from the liability provisions in S. \n1052. I ask for their support of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the good Senator for his \namendment and his thoughtful explanation of it. I will oppose the \namendment. I will state briefly why this evening.\n  Basically, we have a number of definitions of small business. We are \ntaking now the definition of 50 employees or less. That is about 40 \npercent of the workforce. It might be as high as 43 percent. So with \nthis amendment, effectively we are undermining 40 to 43 percent \ncoverage for all those employees across the country. If we believe in \nthe protections of this legislation, that is a major exclusion.\n  What are those protections? Those protections are very simple. They \nare very basic and fundamental. For example, doctors ought to be making \nthe decisions on medical care and not the HMOs. The employees who work \nin these businesses and where the HMOs are selling these policies are \nbeing hurt just as those who are above the 50. Excluding them from \nthese kinds of protections is unacceptable.\n  Their children are going to be hurt. Their children should be able to \nget the kind of specialty care that others can. The wives of those who \nwork in those plants and factories ought to be able to get into \nclinical trials if they have breast cancer. They ought to be able to \nhave an OB/GYN professional as a primary care physician, if that needs \nto be so. They ought to get the prescription drugs they need, if a drug \nis not on the formulary. They ought to be able to get the continuity of \ncare they need.\n\n[[Page S6911]]\n\nThis care protects expectant mothers from losing a doctor during the \ntime of their pregnancy, if the employer drops the coverage with an \nHMO. These are very important kinds of protections we are discussing.\n  If we accept the Senator's amendment, we are effectively excluding 40 \npercent of the population.\n  The Senator makes a very good point about cost, particularly for \nsmall business. I am always amazed in my State of Massachusetts. You go \ndown to 15, 20 employees and still the small businessmen are providing \nhealth care coverage. What is happening, they are paying anywhere from \n30 to 40 percent more in premiums every single year. This occurs \nbecause they are not able to get together with other kinds of groups \nand get the reductions that come from the ability to contract with \nlarge numbers of employers. They are getting shortchanged in those \ncircumstances. Many of the firms they work with are in the business one \nyear and out of the business a second year.\n  The point the Senator makes about the particular challenge for small \nemployers to offset health coverage for their employees is very real. \nWe ought to help them. There have been a number of different proposals \nwhich I have supported and others have supported in terms of \ndeductibility and helping those companies. That is an important way of \ntrying to get about it. But the suggestion that is underlying the \nSenator's presentation is that the cost of this particular proposal is \nwhat is really going to be the straw that breaks the camel's back.\n  He talks about a 4-percent increase in premiums. That is a percent a \nyear, as we have learned. The alternative percent is around 3 percent. \nIt is 3 percent over the period of 5 years. The CBO points out that the \ncost of the various appeals provisions and the liability provisions are \neight-tenths of 1 percent over the 5 years. And in the alternative \nbill, it is four-tenths of 1 percent.\n  I mentioned earlier in the day that the largest CEO salary of an HMO \nwas $54 million a year, and $350 million in stock options. This \nconstitutes a benefits package of $400 million. That adds $4.25 to \nevery premium holder, small business premium holder, $4.25 a month. Our \nproposal adds $1.19 a month. That is just one individual. I am sure, in \nthis case, he does a magnificent job. But when you are talking about \nthe cost of this, we have also brought in the fact that the average \nincome for the 10 highest salaried HMO CEOs is $10 million a year. \nTheir stock options are in the tens of millions of dollars a year. The \nprofits are 3.5 percent a year, $3.5 billion last year in profits. And \nstill they ratcheted up their premiums 12 percent to maintain their \nprofit margin. They made $3.5 billion.\n  Yet they cannot make sure that we are going to be able to provide \nprotections for their employees. They cannot make sure that they are \nnot going to overrule doctors in local hospitals and community \nhospitals, in the urban hospitals, and in rural hospitals trying to \ngive the best medical attention to the children and the women and their \nworkers? We can't say that we want to provide that degree of protection \nfor them?\n  I just can't accept that. I would welcome the opportunity to work \nwith the Senator in the area of small business. But that isn't what we \nare about this evening. The Senator's amendment, as I said, would \neffectively exclude 40 percent, 43 percent of all the employees. It \nmakes the tacit assertion--more than tacit, explicit assertion--that \nthe increased premiums that are going to be included in this bill are \njust going to be unbearable. I suggest there are ways of getting cost \nsavings on this.\n  We have 50 million Americans now that have the kinds of protections \nthat we are talking about. They have the liability protections. We \ndon't see their premiums going up. We see the right to sue in the \nStates of Texas and California, and the premiums aren't going up. There \nis very little distinction between the 50 million Americans now who \nhave the liability provisions and those who do not.\n  We are talking about a major assurance to families all over the \ncountry. When this bill passes and families go in and pay their \npremiums for health insurance, they will know they are getting coverage \nfor the kinds of sickness, illness, and serious disease. Without this \nlegislation, they may think they are covered. Then, at a time of great \ntension and pressure--they may have cancer for example--they are told \nby their primary care doctor that even though there is a specialist, an \noncologist down the street who is the best in the country and is \nwilling to treat that child, they are told they cannot have that \nspecialty care.\n  They are also told that they can't appeal that once the HMO makes \nthat decision. They are being denied that, when we know what a \ndifference it can make in terms of saving that child's life and in \nterms of that child's future.\n  We want to make sure every parent knows that when they sign onto an \nHMO, they are going to be able to get the best care that is available \nfor their child, for their wife, for their mother, for their son, for \ntheir grandparent, and not have these medical decisions overridden by \nthe HMO.\n  So it seems to me that those protections ought to be there for the 40 \npercent of the workers, as well as to the other 60 percent. We ought to \nget to the business of paying attention to, helping, and assisting the \nsmaller businesses. One of the best ways is for these major HMOs to \nstop spending the millions and millions of dollars they are spending \nevery single night, right now, in distorting and misrepresenting the \ntruth. Evidently, they are flooded with money because they are spending \nso much of it in order to defeat this legislation.\n  This isn't an industry that is hard pressed. They are ready to open \nup all of their wallets and pocketbooks to distort and fight this \nlegislation. And, they have the resources to be able to do it. They are \nnot short on those resources. We do not see cutbacks on executive pay. \nWe do not see cutbacks on stock options and the other hefty perks of \nbeing an HMO CEO. The idea that this particular legislation is going to \nbe the straw that breaks the camel's back doesn't hold up. It is a \nsmokescreen. It is not an accurate representation!\n  I think that those 40 percent of American workers are entitled to \ncoverage and protection.\n  (Mr. CORZINE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I listened to the Senator from Colorado present his \namendment on behalf of small businesses and employers. I recall, before \nmy election to Congress, running a law office and buying health \ninsurance for myself and my employees. I recall the experience when I \nwent to one of the larger health insurance companies to cover my \nemployees. So the belief that small businesses only do business with \nsmall insurance companies I am not sure is an accurate description. I \nthink that small businesses often do business with large insurance \ncompanies.\n  If I understand the Senator from Massachusetts and the amendment of \nthe Senator from Colorado, if one employer has 49 employees here and is \ndoing business with a large insurance company, that large insurance \ncompany doesn't have to offer the same protections to the small \nbusiness' employees that it might offer to the business next door with \n60 employees. So the people who are losing are not the small business \nowners but the small business employees who don't get the benefit of \nthe same protections that we are trying to guarantee to all Americans. \nIs that how the Senator from Massachusetts sees it?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct on this. That, of course, \nraises competitive situations. You are going to have competition on the \ndumbing down of protections for employees, rather than establishing a \nstandard in competition in terms of the quality of the product. It is a \nrace to the bottom, so to speak.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So this will, in fact, limit the protections for \nemployees of small businesses across America so that if you go to work \nfor a small business, you just won't have the right to specialty care, \nto the drugs your doctor thinks are necessary to cure your disease, the \nright to a specialist in a critical circumstance, access to emergency \nrooms--all the things we are trying to guarantee in this bill. What the \nSenator from Colorado does is say we are not going to provide those \nprotections if you are one of the 40 percent who works for a small \nbusiness in America. Is that what the Senator understands?\n\n[[Page S6912]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. I will make the case tomorrow, \nbut it is my judgment that you will find that there are greater abuses \nin the areas of these smaller companies, smaller HMOs, appealing to \nsmaller companies, rather than some of the larger HMOs which are tried \nand tested and have the reputation within a community to try and \ndefend. We have had many that do a credible job, but you are going to \nfind, I believe--and I will get to this more tomorrow morning--that the \nworkers who are the most vulnerable are going to be workers in these \nplants.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask another question of the Senator from \nMassachusetts?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. While I listened to the Senator from Colorado explain the \nincrease in premiums, he suggested premiums had gone up 12 percent last \nyear, and they anticipated they would come up 13 percent nationwide \nthis year and the following year, which suggests that in a 3-year \nperiod of time, the Senator from Colorado tells us, we are going to see \na 38-percent increase in health insurance premiums.\n  Going back to a point earlier, how much will the Kennedy-Edwards-\nMcCain bill increase premiums each year over the next 5 years if we are \ngoing to have 38 percent in 3 years, just the natural increase in \nhealth insurance; how much will this legislation we are debating add to \nthat cost?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, according to the Congressional Budget Office and \nOMB it will be less than 1 percent a year over the next 5 years--much \nless, closer to 4 percent. So, effectively, it is 4 percent.\n  As we pointed out earlier in the debate, under the alternative \nproposal that the President supports, it is effectively 3 percent over \n5 years. As the Senator is pointing out, it is somewhat less than 1 \npercent a year against what the Senator from Colorado mentioned--12 \npercent last year and 13 percent this year. That is what is happening \nalready, without these kinds of protections.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think that really addresses the issues raised by the \nSenator from Colorado. First, we are saying to employees of small \nbusinesses that you are not going to receive the protection of others \nwith health insurance. Secondly, even though the cost is less than 1 \npercent a year to give these added protections, we are not going to ask \nthe small businesses to accept this, even in the face of an increase in \npremiums, which the Senator from Colorado tells us was 38 percent over \n3 years.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for his helpful comments.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senator is in a rush. I just want to make two \nbrief comments. First of all, to make it plain English so somebody from \nSearchlight, NV, where I was born, understands it, the Congressional \nBudget Office says S. 1052 would result in a premium increase of only \n4.2 percent over 5 years. The cost of the average employee would be \n$1.19 per month. This would be 37 cents per month more than the \nlegislation that really gives no coverage at all on the other side.\n  I want to say one last thing to my friend. We were here on the floor \nearlier today. We know one of the things that is trying to be injected \ninto this is that this is a terrible thing for small business. That is \nwhat this amendment is all about--that the Kennedy-Edwards-McCain \nlegislation is bad for small business. I read to the Senator earlier \ntoday--and I am going to take 1 minute to read a communication I got \nfrom a small businessman in Nevada today:\n\n       As a small business owner--\n\n  Less than 50 employees--\n\n     and as a citizen, I urge you to support the upcoming bill \n     commonly known as the ``Patients' Bill of Rights.'' I also \n     would like to state that I support your and Senator McCain's \n     version of the bill. If the HMOs can afford to spend millions \n     on lobbyists and advertisements, then they can afford to do \n     their job correctly, preventing the lawsuits in the first \n     place . . .\n       . . . I am willing to pay to know that what I am purchasing \n     from my HMO will be delivered, not withheld until someone is \n     dead, then approved postmortem. While a believer in the \n     market and freedom, I feel that we need a better national \n     approach to health care. As the richest nation in the world, \n     as the only real superpower, why do so many Americans get \n     Third World levels of health care, even when they have \n     insurance?\n       Thank you for your time. Michael Marcum, Reno, NV.\n\n  This is a small businessperson. He doesn't have millions of dollars \nto run TV ads, radio ads, and newspaper ads, but he has the ability to \ncontact me, as hundreds of thousands of other small businesspeople can \ndo. This legislation that you are supporting is good for small \nbusiness, and this is only one of the other ploys to try to distract \nfrom the true merits of this legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator because in his statement he has \nreally summarized the importance of resisting this amendment. Those 40 \npercent of workers deserve these kinds of protections. These are not \nvery unique or special kinds of protections.\n  They are the commonsense protections we have illustrated during the \ncourse of this debate--access to emergency room care based upon a \nprudent layperson standard, protections of speciality care, clinical \ntrials, OB/GYN, continuity of care and point of service. So patients \nare able to get the best in specialty care and formulary, the new \nmedicines, and making sure their doctors, American doctors, are the \nbest trained in the world. These doctors have committed their lives to \nbenefit patients, and they are trained to do so trained to make the \nmedical judgments.\n  That is what American families believe they are paying for when they \npay the premiums, but we have a group of HMOs that feel they can put \nthe financial bottom line ahead of patient interests and shortchange \nmillions of Americans. We should not let the 40 percent that will be \naffected by this amendment be excluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to respond to some of the comments \nthat were just made. The fact remains if you survey employers, half say \nthey will drop employee coverage if exposed to lawsuits. I can \nunderstand that having been a small businessman, and I understand how \none tries to deal with the bottom line of that business, usually a very \nmarginal business.\n  Again, I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts when he says we \nare talking about 40 to 45 percent of the workforce in this country. It \npoints out how important that small business sector is. Those were 50 \nemployees or less. They are a vital part of our economy. We want to \nmake sure they have an ability to attract employees into their \nbusiness. We want to make sure they can meet the bottom line. We want \nto make sure they stay in business.\n  I want to share a quote with the Members of the Senate made by \nWilliam Spencer, who is with the Associated Builders and Contractors, \nInc. We all know many times builders and contractors are small \nbusinesspeople, sometimes, at least in my State, frequently 4 and 5-man \noperations, rarely over 10, particularly in the subcontracting area:\n\n       Many of the ABC's member companies are small businesses, \n     and thus the prospect of facing a $5 million liability cap on \n     civil assessments is daunting. Financial reality is that if \n     faced with such a large claim, many of our members could be \n     forced to drop employee health insurance coverage rather than \n     face the potential liability or possibly even shut their \n     business down.\n\n  I think he is right on, and I agree with him. The question is, how do \nyou respond as a small employer when you are faced with an untenable \nexposure from a lawsuit or costs or regulatory burden? You try to \nfigure out a way you can move out of that liability you are facing. \nWhat I did, and I think many small employers will do, is go back to \ntheir employees and say: Look, there is no way we can cover your \nmedical insurance. There is no way we can work with a program, whether \nit is an HMO or whatever, to provide you with medical insurance.\n  If you are a small employer such as I was--I had part-time employees \nworking for me. Many who came to work for me had never held a job in \ntheir life. They were just out of high school, in many instances, and \ngoing to college. I was going to give them their first experience in \nthe workplace.\n  I had to make a decision as to what we were going to do in a case \nwhere I had increasing costs in my small business. Many of them were as \na result of\n\n[[Page S6913]]\n\ninsurance premiums. I decided that I was going to approach my employees \nand say: I would much rather pay you extra to work in my business and \nleave it up to you to line up your own health care coverage.\n  Again, they were part-time employees who we expected, in many cases, \nto work for us for 3 months, sometimes 2, 3 years, and then they would \nbe moving on.\n  By taking this approach, I also gave them portability. In other \nwords, when they left my business, they were not faced with the issue \nof what is going to happen with my insurance when I get to a new \nemployer; what is going to happen, from the employee's perspective; \nwhat am I going to do when I am no longer working for my current \nemployer as far as health coverage is concerned.\n  That is how I decided to handle it. I think most small employers will \nview it the same way I did. When they see that untenable exposure, they \nare going to decide not to have coverage for their employees. In order \nto stay competitive, they might decide to pay them more or some other \nway to compensate them for that loss in health care coverage.\n\n  The fact remains, from my own personal experience, it is not hard for \nme to believe that many small employers, as many as half, will elect \nnot to provide health care coverage for their employees.\n  We need to do everything we can to encourage the small business \nsector to survive. This is not the only place where we draw a bright \nline, where we recognize how important the small business sector is to \nus. In other places in the law, we have tried to define what a small \nbusiness is. In some cases, we drew it at 150 employees or less; in \nsome cases, 100 employees or less; or maybe, in some cases, 50 \nemployees or less. In fact, in some cases, they even tried to define \nthe very small employer of 15 employees or less.\n  It is not an unusual policy for the Senate in legislation to draw a \nbright line to define what a small employer would be. In this \nparticular instance, it is entirely appropriate to make that at 50 \nemployees or less, and if you have 50 employees or less, you would be \nexempted from the provisions of the Senate bill that is before us.\n  Small businesses are important for the economic growth of this \ncountry. Small businesses are important to generate new ideas. When an \nAmerican has a great idea, many times they go into business for \nthemselves, and they try to market that idea. If it works, it may \neventually grow into a large business. If it does not work, they may \neventually end up having to work for another employer. But many times \nthey are contributors to their communities. They are contributors to \nthe employee base. They are contributors to the leadership within that \ncommunity and help make that community a better place in which to live.\n  I believe we need to be sensitive to what small employers can \ncontribute to our economy and the vital role they play. I believe this \nmandate, this bill will make it much more difficult to stay in \nbusiness, and, consequently we will begin to lose that pool of talent \nthat is so vital to the health of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the order that is now before the \nSenate, if the Senator from Colorado yields back his time, we will do \nso and finish this debate in the morning under the time that is \nscheduled.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Is the Senator from Nevada yielding back his time?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I will yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. We will complete the debate in the morning.

Mr. President, I am very much concerned about our loss of \ndirection with regard to Presidential trade negotiating authority. Many \nMembers of the House, and some of my colleagues here in the Senate, \nadvocate a wholesale surrender--a wholesale surrender--of Congress' \nconstitutional authority over foreign commerce, as well as the \nevisceration of the normal rules of procedure for the consideration of \nPresidentially negotiated trade agreements.\n  I am talking about what is commonly known as ``fast-track,''--fast \ntrack--though the administration has chosen the less informative \nmoniker--the highfalutin, high sounding ``trade promotion authority.'' \n``Trade promotion authority'' sounds good, doesn't it? ``Trade \npromotion authority,'' that is the euphemistic title, I would say--\n``trade promotion authority.'' The real title is ``fast-track.''\n  What is this fast-track? It means that Congress agrees to consider \nlegislation to implement nontariff trade agreements under a procedure \nwith mandatory deadlines, no amendments, and limited debate. No \namendments. Get that. The President claims to need this deviation from \nthe traditional prerogatives of Congress so that other countries will \ncome to the table for future trade negotiations.\n  Before I discuss this very questionable justification--which ignores \nalmost the entire history of U.S. trade negotiating authority--I think \nwe ought to pause and consider--what?--the Constitution of the United \nStates. I hold it in my hand, the Constitution of the United States. \nThat is my contract with America, the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Each of us swears allegiance; we put our hand on that Bible up there. \nI did, and swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\n  Each of us swears allegiance to this magnificent document. As Justice \nDavis stated in 1866:\n\n       The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers \n     and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the \n     shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, \n     and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more \n     pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man \n     than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any \n     of the great exigencies of government.\n\n  Ex Parte Milligan, 71 U.S. 2 (1866). This was the case that refused \nto uphold the wide-ranging use of martial law during the Civil War.\n  Thus, Mr. President, let us review the Constitution to see what role \nCongress is given with respect to commerce with foreign nations. \nArticle 1, section 8, says that ``The Congress shall have power to . . \n. regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, \nand with the Indian tribes . . . .''\n  This Constitution also gives Congress the power ``to lay and collect \n. . . Duties, Imposts, and Excises.'' The President is not given these \npowers. Congress is given these powers. There it is. Read it. The \nPresident is not given these powers. These powers have been given to \nCongress on an exclusive basis.\n  Nor is this the extent of Congress's involvement in matters of \nforeign trade. It scarcely needs to be pointed out that Congress's \ncentral function, as laid out in the first sentence of the first \narticle of the Constitution, is to make the laws of the land. Were it \nnot for that first sentence in this Constitution, I would not be here; \nthe Presiding Officer would not be here; the Senator from the great \nState of Minnesota, Ohio, Florida, the great States, Alabama, we would \nnot be here. Congress makes the laws of the land. Some people in this \ntown need to be reminded of that.\n\n[[Page S6914]]\n\n  For example, Congress decides whether a particular trade practice in \nthe U.S. market is unfair. Congress decides whether foreign steel \ncompanies can use the U.S. market as a dumping ground, which they have \nbeen doing, for their subsidized overcapacity. Are we to give this \nauthority to the President and make Congress nothing more than a rubber \nstamp in the process of formulating important U.S. laws? As the great \nChief Justice of the United States John Marshall might have asked: Are \nwe ``mere surplusage''? Is the Senate mere surplusage?\n  The Founding Fathers' memories were not short. Those memories were \nnot occluded by real-time television news, nor were they occluded by \nthe proliferation of ``info-tainment.'' The Founding Fathers had a vast \nreservoir of learning, particularly classical learning, to draw upon \nand a treasure trove of political experience.\n  Our Founding Fathers were not enamored with the idea of a President \nof the United States who would gather authority unto himself, as had \nbeen experienced with King George III of England. Most of the \nadministrations that have occurred--there have been at least 10 \ndifferent Presidents with which I have served; I have never served \nunder any President, nor would any of those framers of the Constitution \nthink well of me if I thought I served under any President. The framers \ndidn't think too much of handing out executive power.\n  So this exclusive power to regulate foreign commerce was not centered \nupon the legislative branch by whim or fancy. There were weighty \nconsiderations of a system founded on carefully balanced powers.\n  The U.S. Congress tried to give away some of its constitutional \nauthority by granting the President line-item veto power a few years \nback. Fie on a weak-minded Congress that would do that, a Congress that \ndidn't know enough and didn't think enough of its constitutional \nprerogatives and powers and duties to withhold that power over the \npurse which it did give the President of the United States. Mr. Clinton \nwanted that power. Most Presidents want that power. Congress was silly \nenough to give the President of the United States that power. It was \ngiving away constitutional power that had been vested in this body of \nGovernment, in the legislative branch.\n  Thank God, in that instance at least, for the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. It said Congress can't do that. Congress can't give away \nthat power that is vested in it, and it alone, by the Constitution of \nthe United States.\n  So the U.S. Congress tried to give away some of its power. But, \nultimately, as I say, that serious error was corrected by the Supreme \nCourt. The Supreme Court saved us from ourselves. Hallelujah. Thank God \nfor the Supreme Court. Boy, I was with the Supreme Court in that \ninstance. Yes, sir. They saved us from ourselves.\n  The ancient Roman Senate, on the other hand, was successful in giving \naway the power of the purse. And when it did that, when the ancient \nRoman Senate gave away the power of the purse, first to the dictators \nand then to the emperors, it gave away an important check on the \nexecutive. First, Sulla became dictator in 82 B.C. He was dictator from \n82 to 80. Then he walked away from the dictatorship, and he became \ncounsel in 79. He died in 78 B.C., probably of cancer of the colon.\n  Then in 48 B.C., what did the Roman Senate do again? It lost its way, \nlost its memory, lost its nerve, and restored Caesar to the \ndictatorship, Julius Caesar, for a brief period. In 46 B.C., it made \nhim dictator for 10 years. Then in 45 B.C., the year before he was \nassassinated, the Roman Senate lost its direction, lost its senses and \nmade Caesar dictator for life.\n  Well, I don't know whether or when we will ever reach that point. But \nwe need to understand how extraordinary, how very extraordinary this \nfast-track authority is that President Bush is running around, over the \ncountry, asking for--fast-track authority, but he is not calling it \nthat. He is calling it something else.\n  From 1789 to 1974, Congress faithfully fulfilled the Founders' \ndictates. During those years, Congress showed that it was willing and \nable to supervise commerce with foreign countries. Congress also \nunderstood the need to be flexible. For example, starting with the 1934 \nReciprocal Trade Act, as trade negotiations became increasingly \nfrequent, Congress authorized the President to modify tariffs and \nduties based on negotiations with foreign powers. Such proclamation \nauthority has been renewed at regular intervals.\n  What happened in 1974? At that time we relegated ourselves to a \nthumb's up or thumb's down role with respect to agreements negotiated \non the fast track. Stay off that track. Congress agreed to tie its \nhands and gag itself when the President sends up one of these trade \nagreements for consideration.\n  Why on Earth, you might ask, would Congress do such a thing? What \nwould convince Members of Congress to willingly relinquish a portion of \nour constitutional power and authority? What were Members thinking when \nthey agreed to limits on the democratic processes by which our laws are \nmade? And why, in light of the fact that extensive debate and the \nfreedom to offer amendments are essential to effective lawmaking, would \nCongress decide that we can do without such fundamentally important \nprocedures when it comes to trade agreements?\n  The U.S. Senate is the foremost upper house in the world today. Why? \nThere are many reasons. But two of the main reasons are these. The U.S. \nSenate has the power to amend, and the U.S. Senate is a forum in which \nmen and women are able to debate in an unlimited way--they can limit \nthemselves; otherwise, in this forum, I can stand on my feet as long as \nmy feet will hold me and debate. And nobody--not the President of the \nUnited States, not the Chair--can take me off my feet, not in this \nbody. Nobody. And I am not answerable to anybody for what I say here. \nOur British forebears took care of that when they provided in 1689 that \nthere would be freedom of speech in the House of Commons.\n  Well, we are doing it to ourselves when we pass fast track. We are \nsaying: No amendments. You just either stamp up or down what the \nPresident sends up here.\n  Again, why, in light of the fact that extensive debate and freedom to \noffer amendments are essential to effective lawmaking, would Congress \ndecide that we can do without such fundamentally important procedures \nwhen it comes to trade agreements?\n  I submit that, in 1974, we had no idea of what kind of Pandora's box \nwe were opening. At that time, international agreements tended to be \nnarrowly limited. Consider, for example, the U.S.-Israel Free Trade \nAgreement of 1985. The implementing language of that agreement was all \nof four pages, and it dealt only with tariffs and rules on Government \nProcurement.\n  Fast track began to show its true colors with the 1988 U.S.-Canada \nFree Trade Agreement which, despite its title, extended well beyond \ntraditional trade issues to address farming, banking, food inspection, \nand other domestic matters.\n  The U.S.-Canada agreement required substantial changes to U.S. law, \naddressing everything from local banking rules to telecommunications \nlaw, to regulations regarding the weight and the length of American \ntrucks. These changes were bundled aboard a hefty bill and propelled \ndown the fast track before many Members of Congress knew what had hit \nthem.\n  Most ominously, the U.S.-Canada agreement established the Chapter 19 \ndispute resolution procedure. This insidious mechanism, which was only \nsupposed to be a stopgap until the U.S. and Canada harmonized their \ntrade laws, gives the so-called trade ``experts'' from the two \ncountries the authority to interpret the trade laws of the United \nStates. We are not talking about judges now. We are not talking about \npersons trained in the laws of the United States. We are talking about \ntrade ``experts,'' frequently hired hands for the industries whose \ndisputes are under consideration.\n  Moreover, unlike our domestic courts, there is no mechanism by which \nAmerican companies that are adversely affected by Chapter 19 panel \ndecisions might obtain appellate review. The system simply does not \nwork. It goes against fundamental American principles of fairness and \ndue process.\n  In short, the U.S.-Canada agreement was nothing less than a dagger \npointed at the heart of American sovereignty.\n\n[[Page S6915]]\n\nThat agreement--and the process by which it was concluded--undermined \nboth the legislative and judicial authority of the United States.\n\n  So where are we now? Today, American trade negotiators are faced with \na completely different reality from what it was in 1974. Our trading \npartners know the game--shut out the people and appeal to the elite \nconceptions of a smoothly functioning global economy. In 1993, Lane \nKirkland, then-president of the AFL-CIO, made an observation about \nNAFTA that is just as pertinent today as it was then, when I voted \nagainst it. Here is what he said:\n\n       Make no mistake, NAFTA is an agreement conceived and \n     drafted by and for privileged elites, with little genuine \n     regard for how it will affect ordinary citizens on either \n     side of the Mexican border . . . The agreement's 2,000 pages \n     are loaded with trade-enforced protections for property, \n     patents, and profits of multinational corporations, but there \n     are no such protections for workers.\n\n  In the new world of international trade negotiations, our trading \npartners, frequently assisted by their American trade lawyers, place on \nthe table their ideas for elaborate changes to U.S. law. For example, \nour free trade area of the American trading partners propose dozens of \npages of changes to our trade laws, modifications that are intended to \neviscerate those laws.\n  The American workers who would be displaced if those modifications \nwere implemented are given no role in this process. None. We, their \nrepresentatives, are given a minimal role, a little teeny-weeny \nportion. But we are not yet voiceless, not yet drowned out by the elite \nconsensus on the virtues of free trade. Well, I am for free trade - who \nwould not be--as long as it is fair, fair trade. But that is quite \nanother matter.\n  Let the free traders come to West Virginia. Come on down, Mr. \nPresident, and talk to those steelworkers over at Weirton. Come on down \nand talk to the steelworkers who are being laid off in Weirton, WV. \nDon't go over to Weirton and burn the flag. Those are patriotic \ncitizens over there. But they are losing their jobs. Let the free \ntraders come to West Virginia and talk to the steelworkers, talk to \ntheir families, talk to their neighbors. Let them talk to labor leaders \nfrom North America and Latin America. Let them try to explain why the \ndisintegration of ways of life that give both opportunity and security \nis good ``in the long run.''\n  As John Maynard Keynes once wrote, ``Long run is a misleading guide \nto current affairs. In the long run, we are all dead.'' I will add: \ndead, dead, dead.\n  I am getting sick and tired of these administrations, Democratic and \nRepublican, who run to West Virginia and want the votes there and turn \naround and fail to take a stand for American goods, American \nindustries, and American men and women workers.\n  John Maynard Keynes also wrote, ``Practical men, who believe \nthemselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are \nusually the slaves of some defunct economist.''\n  How many Washington Post editorialists will lose their jobs if our \ntrade laws are eviscerated? How many libertarian think tanks will be \nshut down when the free trade dystopia is established? Shall we take \ntheir views--the views of some defunct economist--as gospel, or shall \nwe listen to those who earn their living by the sweat of their brow?\n  When God evicted Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, they were told \nto earn their bread from the sweat of their brow, and that is why we \nare still doing it. I say listen to those who earn their living by the \nsweat of their brow. Go to Weirton to the steel town; go to Wheeling to \nthat steel town, at Wheeling-Pitt with over 4,000 workers. I believe \nthat is right. Go over there. Say to them: Boys, get in touch with your \nSenator and get in touch with your House Members and tell them to vote \nfor--they do not call it fast track. What is it they call it? It is a \nsugar-coated pill. Tell your Senator to vote for that, and actually \nthey will not say it out loud, but that is fast track. Tell your \nSenator to vote for that.\n  I am for expanding international trade. Who wouldn't be. But let the \ntrade be fair. Let us have a level playing field, and let us not \nneglect our responsibility in this Senate to participate meaningfully \nin the formulation and implementation of U.S. trade policy.\n  I am not saying the Senate ought to vote on every duty and every \ntariff on every little toothbrush and every little violin string that \nis sent into this country. I am saying there are some big questions \nthis Senate ought to be able to speak to and to vote on. At least on 2, \n3, 4, 5, or 6, let's have a vote by this Senate.\n  One way we can reassert our constitutional role with respect to \nforeign trade is to create a Congressional Trade Office modeled after \nthe Congressional Budget Office.\n  My colleagues might recall this was one of the many ideas discussed \nin the report of the U.S. Trade Deficit Review Commission. Senator \nBaucus and I are working on legislation that would give us a trade \noffice with the information resources and expertise necessary to permit \nus to properly discharge our oversight responsibilities.\n  That is what we need. We need to exercise our oversight \nresponsibility. We cannot do it if we gag ourselves, if we cannot \nspeak, if we cannot amend. We cannot fulfill our responsibilities under \nthe Constitution. We cannot fulfill our responsibilities to the people \nwho sent us here.\n  Can anyone guess how many trade agreements have been negotiated \nwithout fast track? The President is running around saying: Oh, I have \nto have this; I have to have this in order to enter into these trade \nagreements. Can anyone guess how many trade agreements have been \nnegotiated without fast track since that extraordinary authority was \nfirst granted to the President in 1974? The answer is in the hundreds. \nWe have had fast track on this Senate floor 5 times in the last 27 \nyears, but in the meantime, hundreds of trade agreements have been \nnegotiated, the most recent examples being the U.S.-Jordan agreement \nand the U.S.-Vietnam agreement.\n  I think we need an analysis of all the trade agreements concluded \nover the past 27 years. Let us try to determine if the Founding Fathers \nwere completely off the mark when they gave Congress authority over \nforeign commerce.\n  I believe that any impartial study of this history will demonstrate \nthat we can have trade agreements without surrendering our \nconstitutional authority over foreign commerce. If negotiation of trade \nagreements is in the interests of other nations, they will be at the \ntable. They will be at the table, in my judgment, Congress or no \nCongress. Is there any serious argument to the contrary?\n  Let me be clear. I am thinking of a Presidential nominee some years \nago who said this. For the moment I have forgotten his name. He said \nthis: I didn't say that I didn't say it; I said that I didn't say that \nI said it.\n  And then he said: Let me be clear. I didn't say that I didn't say it; \nI said that I didn't say that I said it.\n  He said then: Let me be clear--after the audience had laughed.\n  Let me be clear. I am not suggesting that we noodle away at a \nPresidentially negotiated trade agreement by considering myriad small \namendments. No, Congress should not focus on the minutiae. There may, \nhowever, be a small number of big issues in such an agreement that go \nto the root of our constituents' interests. We must have the authority \nto subject those issues to full debate and, if necessary, amendment.\n  In closing, I reiterate that we should put our trust in this document \nwhich I hold in my hand, the Constitution of the United States--not in \nfast track but in the Constitution of the United States and in the \npeople for whom it was drafted and ratified: the people of America.\n  Let us not give away even one piece of our national birthright, the \nConstitution, without at least demanding hard proof that its tried and \ntrue principles must be modified.\n  Let us preserve our authority as Members of Congress to participate \nfully in the process of concluding international trade agreements. Let \nus not permit the globalization bandwagon to roll over us, to weaken \nour voices, to sap the vigor of our democratic institutions, and to \nblind us to our national interests and the needs of our communities.\n  If we cannot uphold this banner--the Constitution of the United \nStates which I hold in my hand--if we cannot uphold this banner, the \nbanner of our\n\n[[Page S6916]]\n\nmore than 200-year-old constitutional Republic, if we cannot play a \nconstructive role in taming the free-trade leviathan, then we are \nunworthy of our esteemed title.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/26/senate-section/article/S6916-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN RECOGNITION OF RAYMOND BOURQUE\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment that I know \nmy colleague from Massachusetts shares with me to pay special \nrecognition and tribute, celebrating the career of one of New England's \nmost beloved sports figures, Raymond Bourque, who announced his \nretirement today.\n  Over the course of a 22-year career in the National Hockey League, \nthis future-certain Hall-of-Famer set a standard for all athletes--\nplaying with a special kind of determination and grit and, above all, \nclass that has been recognized by his fellow players and by sports fans \nall over this country and indeed the world.\n  He came to us in Boston from Canada as a teenager to play for our \nbeloved Boston Bruins, earning Rookie of the Year honors for that first \nyear in 1979 to 1980.\n  Many make a large splash with a lot of headlines in the first year, \nbut Ray proved, even as he won Rookie of the Year, to be more marathon \nthan sprint. Through perseverance and a deep dedication to his craft, \nhe played his way into the hearts of sports fans across the region and \nthroughout the league.\n  For over 20 years, touching literally four different decades for \nthose 20 years, he was the foundation on which the Boston Bruins built \ntheir teams and chased the dream of bringing the Stanley Cup back to \nBoston. Alas, that was not to happen.\n  The statistics, however, of his chase speak for themselves: The \nhighest scoring defenseman in league history; a 19-time All-Star; a \nfive-time Norris Trophy winner as the league's best defenseman. But in \nmany ways it was more than goals and assists and legendary defense that \nwon him the tremendous admiration of Boston fans. It was his \nperformance beyond the game itself.\n  December 3, 1987, is a day that remains indelibly imprinted in the \nhearts and minds of Boston sports folklore. It is next to Fisk's homer, \nHavlicek's steal, and Orr's flying goal. That day Bruin Hall-of-Famer \nPhil Esposito's No. 7 was retired and raised to the rafters of the old \nBoston Garden. Ray Bourque also wore No. 7 and most believed he was \ngoing to continue to wear his number for the remainder of his career.\n  That night, Ray touched generations of fans and nonfans by skating \nover to Esposito, removing his No. 7 jersey to reveal a new No. 77 that \nhe was to wear for the rest of his illustrious career. He handed the \nNo. 7 jersey to a stunned and emotional Esposito and said, ``This is \nyours, big fella. It never should have been mine.''\n  The Stanley Cup was the one thing that was missing during his years \nin Boston that continued to elude him and his teammates. In fact, Ray \nhad the most games played without winning a Stanley cup--1,825. \nHowever, that distinction did not diminish him in the eyes of his fans \nor his teammates, the teammates who were proud to call him captain. It \nonly made them all want to give him one last opportunity to prevail. \nWith that in mind, Boston gave Ray his leave and he set his sights on \nthat final goal--to win a Stanley Cup--only this time he set out to do \nit with the Colorado Avalanche.\n  Even after Ray left the Bruins in the midst of the 2000 season in \nsearch of that goal, the Boston fans never left him. His new Colorado \nteam immediately recognized his value as a leader and they awarded him \nthe moniker of assistant captain upon his arrival. When he finally \nraised the cup over his head in triumph this past season, all of New \nEngland cheered for him. In fact, in an unprecedented show of support \nfor another team's victory, over 15,000 Bourque and Boston fans joined \nin a celebration on Boston's City Hall Plaza when Ray brought home the \nStanley Cup earlier this month. It belonged to Ray and to Boston for \nthose moments as much as to Colorado and the Avalanche.\n\n  Today we learned that Ray Bourque has laced up his skates as a \nprofessional in competition for the final time. He will retire and come \nhome to Massachusetts to be with his wife, Christiane, and their three \nchildren, Melissa, Christopher, and Ryan. He will watch his eldest son, \n15-year-old Christopher, as he plays hockey at a new school.\n  It is both fair and appropriate to say that for all of his children, \nas well as all young children, you could not have a better role model, \nnot just in hockey but in life.\n  I have been privileged to share a number of charitable events with \nRay Bourque. He is tireless in his contribution back to the community \nand in the leadership to help to build a better community.\n  If Ray's career were only measured in numbers, he would be an \nautomatic Hall-of-Famer. But when you take the full measure of the man, \nhe has shown to be one of those few athletes who transcends sports. He \ncould have played a couple of years more. He could have made millions \nof more dollars. But he chose to go out on top and to return to his \nfamily. He felt his family had made enough sacrifices for him, and it \nwas time for him to be there for them.\n  In Massachusetts, and fans everywhere, I think there is a special \nsense of gratitude for his success, for his happiness, and we are \nappreciative of all of his years with the Bruins and proud to have him \nback home in Massachusetts.\n  We wish him and his family well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/26/senate-section/article/S6916-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6916-S6917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SOUTH DAKOTA NATIONAL PEACE ESSAY CONTEST WINNER\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am honored today to present to my \ncolleagues in the Senate an essay by Austin Lammers of Hermosa, SD. \nAustin is a student at St. Thomas More High School and he is the \nNational Peace Essay Contest winner for South Dakota.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the essay be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the essay was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                           Failure in Africa\n\n       Imagine how horrible living in a third world country would \n     be during a giant civil war, and the people that are supposed \n     to help allow death, famine and increased war. Death and war \n     is precisely what has happened in this past decade in the \n     warring countries of Somalia and Rwanda. Outsiders, such as \n     the United Nations, can occasionally help in violent civil \n     outbreaks but they are not consistent and rarely make the \n     situation much better. Third parties should not interfere in \n     civil conflicts unless they are well prepared, respond \n     quickly, and benefit the country they are interfering.\n       Drought and famine has been the reason for civil war in \n     Somalia since 1969, but the most recent civil war erupted \n     between rebel and governmental forces in 1991 (Fox 90). The \n     rebel forces seized Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, and \n     forced President Siad Barre to flee the country (Potter 12). \n     The takeover which destroyed the economy also began a famine \n     for about 4.5 million people who were faced with starvation, \n     malnutrition, and related diseases (Johnston 5). The UN \n     wanted to intervene; but according to the Charter, the UN can \n     only act to stop war between nations, not civil war within a \n     single country (Potter 26). Therefore, in December 1992 UN \n     Secretary General, Butros-Ghali, passed Resolution 794 that \n     permitted the UN to secure Somalia (Potter 27).\n       Following Resolution 794 the UN began the United Nations \n     Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) which monitored the new cease-\n     fire between the rebels and the government forces while \n     delivering humanitarian aid (Johnston 28). The cease-fire did \n     not last long, and soon the sides were fighting again, but \n     this time with UN peacekeepers caught in the middle (Benton \n     129). As the fighting grew worse, the UN soon abandoned \n     UNOSOM (Johnston 29). A U.S. led force; the Unified Task \n     Force (UNITAF) to make a safe environment for delivery of \n     humanitarian aid replaced UNOSOM (Benton 133). In May 1993, \n     UNOSOM II replaced UNITAF; but only starvation was relieved, \n     there was still governmental unrest (Benton 136).\n       The U.S. decided to leave Somalia when on October 3, 1993, \n     a Somalia rebel group shot down a U.S. helicopter, killing \n     eighteen American soldiers (Fox 19). the U.S. was evacuated \n     by 1994, and by 1995 all UN forces had left (Fox 22).\n       After the abandonment by UN in 1995, the new police force \n     created by the UN committed numerous human rights abuses \n     (Potter 17). Also bad weather, pests, and the UN ban on the \n     export of livestock to the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have \n     worsened the economy in Somalia (Johnston 56). The drop in \n     economy has caused lowered employment and increased \n     starvation (Johnston 60).\n       The UN should not have intervened in Somalia, but rather \n     let Somalia deal with their own internal problems. While the \n     UN was in Somalia, they made the war bigger and thus causing \n     more starvation. After the UN was\n\n[[Page S6917]]\n\n     removed, the police force abused citizens, and their economy \n     went crashing further down (Potter 30).\n       The United Nations should have learned from their mistakes \n     in Somalia, but instead ignored what had happened and tried \n     to help the civil war in Rwanda during 1994. Rwanda's \n     population is approximately 88% Hutu and 11% Tutsi. The two \n     groups have had bad relations since that 15th century when \n     the Hutus were forced to serve the Tutsi lords in return for \n     Tutsi cattle (Brown 50). Since the 15th century, a number of \n     civil disputes have begun between the Hutus and the Tutsis \n     (Brown 51). The latest civil war has resulted in mass \n     genocide (Prunier 38).\n       The latest civil war in Rwanda started on April 6, 1994, \n     when the plane carrying Rwandan President Habyarimana and the \n     President of Burundi was shot down near Kigali (Freeman 22). \n     That same day the genocide began, first killing the Prime \n     Minister and her ten bodyguards, then all Tutsi's and \n     political moderates (Freeman 27). This genocide, which has \n     been compared to the Holocaust, lasted from April 6 until the \n     beginning of July (Prunier 57). The Interahamwe militia \n     consisting of radical Hutus, started the genocide killing up \n     to one million Tutsis and political moderates, bragging that \n     in twenty minutes they could kill 1,000 Tutsis (Bronwyn 4). \n     However, militia was not the only faction to lead the \n     genocide. A local Rwandan radio broadcast told ordinary \n     citizens to ``Take your spear, guns, clubs, swords, stones, \n     everything--hack them, those enemies, those cockroaches, \n     those enemies of democracy'' (Bronwyn 13).\n       The United Nations was in Rwanda before and during the mass \n     genocide, but did not stop the killings or even send more \n     troops (Benton 67). In 1993, the United Nations Assistance \n     Mission to Rwanda, UNAMIR, oversaw the transition from an \n     overrun government to a multiparty democracy (Benton 74). As \n     the genocide broke out in 1994, the UN began to panic; and on \n     April 21, just days after the genocide started, the UN \n     withdrew all but 270 of the 2,500 soldiers (Freeman 44). When \n     the UN saw the gradual increase of the genocide they agreed \n     to send 5,000 troops, but those troops were never deployed \n     due to UN disagreements (Freeman 45). UNAMIR finally withdrew \n     in March 1996, accomplishing almost nothing (Prunier 145). \n     Jean Paul Biramvu, a survivor of the massacre, commented on \n     the UN help saying, ``We wonder what UNAMIR was doing in \n     Rwanda. They could not even lift a finger to intervene and \n     prevent the deaths of tens of thousands of people who were \n     being killed under their very noses . . . the UN protects no \n     one'' (Freeman 46).\n       Again, just as in Somalia, the United Nations failed to \n     bring peace in a civil war. Not only did the UN do almost \n     nothing to stop the genocide, they also knew that there was a \n     plan to start the genocide before it even happened (Bronwyn \n     12). On December 16, 1999, a press conference about the \n     genocide brought to light new information that the United \n     Nations had accurate knowledge of a plan to start a genocide, \n     three months before the killings occurred (Bronwyn 13). The \n     UN had ample time to stop a large-scale slaughter of almost a \n     million innocent people, and did not even send more troops \n     that could have prevented the deaths of thousands of Tutsis \n     (Bronwyn 13). Two reasons for the reluctance to do anything \n     in Rwanda was that Rwanda was not of national interest to any \n     major powers, and since the problems in Somalia, the UN did \n     not want to risk being hurt again (Bronwyn 18). The United \n     Nations work in Rwanda is a pathetic example of how peace \n     missions should work.\n       The United Nations and other international communities can \n     intervene and help prevent violent civil conflicts in many \n     ways. The first way to improve intervention is that the \n     International Community needs to keep a consistent stand on \n     how to protect victims in civil disputes. The most important \n     step to take when war is apparent is to protect people's \n     lives.\n       Second, the International Community should establish a \n     center that informs them of any early signs of war using \n     human right monitors to decide if conditions might worsen. \n     The genocide in Rwanda would have been prevented if the UN \n     notices early signs of war, and listens to reports of a \n     genocide.\n       Third, make better the criminal court for genocide, war \n     crimes, and other human right infractions so the criminals \n     are punished right away with a sentence that fits the crime. \n     Many times people who commit war crimes are not punished, or \n     do not get a harsh enough sentence.\n       Fourth, violent methods by the International community may \n     only be used after non-violent methods have failed, and the \n     government is unwilling to help. The UN in Somalia tried to \n     use military force immediately instead of trying to use non-\n     military force when war broke out and they were in the middle \n     (Benton 107).\n       Fifth, International Communities need to have stand-by \n     troops ready when a war is apparent, and impress on the \n     warring country that if more problems arise, more troops will \n     be sent in to stop the war. The UN did have troops ready in \n     case of war, but when the war did break out in Somalia, they \n     did not send more troops to secure the situation (Fox 28).\n       Sixth, every country, no matter how much power or relevence \n     in the world, needs to be helped equally. The United Nations \n     during the Rwandan genocide did not worry about helping the \n     victims because Rwanda did not have much international power \n     in the world such as valuable exports or strong economies. \n     The UN cannot be worried how they will benefit but rather how \n     the country warring will benefit (Bronwyn 18).\n       Third parties such as the United Nations are not consistent \n     in their fight to keep peace in civil conflicts, especially \n     conflicts that have been going on for hundreds of years. In \n     some instance, such as Somalia and Rwanda, the UN hurt the \n     people more than they helped by causing death and famine. The \n     International community needs to come together and create new \n     policies that help the countries that they are trying to keep \n     peace instead of hurting them and sending them deeper into \n     war.\n\n\n                              Works Cited\n\n       Adcock, Bronwyn.

Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the countries \nof Ecuador and Peru within the context of the Andean Regional \nInitiative, ARI, the FY-2002 follow-on strategy to Plan Colombia. \nAlthough the ARI encompasses 7 South American counties, I want to focus \ntoday on these two important United States allies. Our hemispheric \ncounterdrug efforts must be viewed within a regional context, or else \nany successes will be short-term and localized, and may produce \noffsetting or even worse conditions than before we started. Narcotics \nproducers and smugglers have always been dynamic, mobile, innovative, \nexploitative, and willing to move to areas of less resistance. I am \nconcerned that spillover, displacement, or narcotrafficker shifts, from \nany successful operations within Colombia, has the real potential to \nnegatively affect Peru and Ecuador. I want the United States actions to \nhelp--and not hurt--our allies and this important region of our own \nhemisphere.\n  The State Department's June 2001 country program fact sheet reports \nthat ``Ecuador has become a major staging and transshipment area for \ndrugs and precursor chemicals due to its geographical location between \ntwo major cocaine source countries, Colombia and Peru. In recent \nmonths, the security situation along Ecuador's northern border--\nparticularly in the Sucumbios province, where most of Ecuador's oil \nwealth is located--has deteriorated sharply due to increased Colombian \nguerrilla, paramilitary, and criminal violence. The insecurity on \nEcuador's northern border, if not adequately addressed, could have an \nimpact on the country's political and economic climate. Sucumbios has \nlong served as a resupply and rest/recreation site for Colombian \ninsurgents; and arms and munitions trafficking from Ecuador fuel \nColombian violence.''\n  The Ecuador fact sheet continues ``[n]arcotraffickers exploit \nEcuador's porous borders, transporting cocaine and heroin through \nEcuador primarily overland by truck on the Pan-American Highway and \nconsolidating the smuggled drugs into larger loads at poorly controlled \nseaports for bulk shipment to the United States and Europe hidden in \ncontainers of legitimate cargo. Precursor chemicals imported by ship \ninto Ecuador are diverted to cocaine-processing laboratories in \nsouthern Colombia. In addition, the Ecuadorian police and army have \ndiscovered and destroyed cocaine-refining laboratories on the northern \nborder with Colombia. Although large-scale coca cultivation has not yet \nspilled over the border, there are small, scattered plantations of coca \nin northern Ecuador. As a result, Ecuador could become a drug producer, \nin addition to its current role as a major drug transit country, unless \nlaw enforcement programs are strengthened.'' Finally, the\n\n[[Page S6918]]\n\nState Department concludes that ``Ecuador faces an increasing threat to \nits internal stability due to spillover effects from Colombia at the \nsame time that deteriorating economic conditions in Ecuador limit \nGovernment of Ecuador, GOE, budgetary support for the police.''\n  The State Department's March 2001 country program fact sheet reports \nthat ``Peru is now the second largest producer of coca leaf and cocaine \nbase. Peruvian traffickers transport the cocaine base to Colombia and \nBolivia where it is converted to cocaine. There is increasing evidence \nof opium poppy cultivation being established under the direction of \nColombian traffickers.'' The fact sheet continues ``[f]or the fifth \nyear in a row, Peruvian coca cultivation declined from an estimated \n115,300 hectares in 1995 to fewer than an estimated 34,200 hectares in \n2000 (a decline of 70 percent since 1995). The continuing [now-\nsuspended] U.S.-Peruvian interdiction program and manual coca \neradication were major factors in reducing coca leaf and base \nproduction.'' In addition, ``[t]hese U.S. Government supported law \nenforcement efforts are complemented by an aggressive U.S.-funded \neffort to establish an alternative development program for coca farmers \nin key coca growing areas to voluntarily reduce and eliminate coca \ncultivation. Alternative development activities, such as technical \nassistance and training on alternative crop production, are provided as \nlong as the community maintains the coca eradication schedule. In Peru, \nactivities include transport and energy infrastructure, basic social \nservices (health, education, potable water, etc.), strengthened civil \nsociety (local governments and community organizations), environmental \nprotection, agricultural production and marketing, and drug demand \nreduction.''\n  With respect to Peru, I also encourage the Department of State to \nquickly report to Congress the findings on the tragic shootdown on \nApril 20 of this year and the intended future of the air interdiction \nprogram.\n  I encourage my colleagues, and the public, to be sensitive to the \ncurrent delicate conditions and future developments in these countries. \nIn addition, while I support the additional United States aid for \nEcuador and Peru, as requested in the President's FY-2002 budget, for \nboth law enforcement and many needed social programs, I remain \nconcerned that our current efforts lack coherence or clear-sightedness. \nI will say again that I fervently want the United States actions to \nhelp--and not hurt--Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, on this complicated \nand critical regional counterdrug issue. The goal is to make a \ndifference--not make things worse or simply rearrange the deck chairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/26/senate-section/article/S6918-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PENDING FISCAL YEAR 2002 DEFENSE BUDGET REQUEST\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, here we go again. Late last week, senior \nAdministration officials indicated that the Bush Administration plans \nto submit to Congress, several months late, a budget request for the \nDepartment of Defense that increases the already bloated fiscal year \n2001 spending level for that department by $18.4 billion.\n  I find it interesting that the Administration has yet to provide the \ndetails of this request to the Congress, to the dismay of both parties, \nbut that the dollar amount increase over last year's $310 billion \nappropriation is already being widely reported.\n  This is in addition to the $6.5 billion supplemental appropriations \nrequest that the Senate may consider later this week, most of which is \nfor the Department of Defense.\n  Where will it end, Mr. President?\n  While I commend Secretary Rumsfeld for undertaking a long-overdue \ncomprehensive review of our military, I also urge him to consider \ncarefully the impact that any proposed defense increases will have on \nthe rest of the federal budget.\n  We are already feeling the impact left by the $1.35 trillion tax cut \nthat this Administration made its number one priority. That tax cut \nvirtually ensures that there can be no defense increases without making \ndeep cuts in other parts of the budget. And the top priorities of the \nAmerican people, such as saving Social Security and Medicare and \nproviding a Medicare prescription drug benefit, will be that much \nharder to accomplish.\n  But it appears that the Administration will propose an increase in \ndefense spending.\n  I fear that this pending request, coupled with the massive tax cut \nthat has already been signed into law, will lead us down a slippery \nslope to budget disaster.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/26/senate-section/article/S6918-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A TRIBUTE TO GOLD STAR MOTHERS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I take this opportunity to call to \nthe attention of our colleagues the national convention of the American \nGold Star Mothers which began on Sunday, June 24 and concludes \ntomorrow, June 27, 2001, in Knoxville, TN.\n  The Gold Star Mothers is an organization made up of American mothers \nwho lost a son or daughter while in military service to our country in \none of the wars. The group was founded shortly after the First World \nWar for those special mothers to comfort one another and to help care \nfor hospitalized veterans confined in government hospitals far from \nhome. It was named after the Gold Star that families hung in their \nwindows in honor of a deceased veteran. Gold Star Mothers now has 200 \nchapters throughout the United States, and its members continue to \nperpetuate the ideals for which so many of our sons and daughters died.\n  Over this past Memorial Day weekend, I participated in the Rolling \nThunder rally on the National Mall to honor our Nation's veterans and \nremember those missing in action. During that time, I personally met \nsome of the Gold Star mothers and was moved by their compassion, their \ncommitment and the sacrifices they and their families have made for our \ncountry.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Gold Star Mothers \nfor their many years of dedicated service and congratulating them on \nthe occasion of their national convention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/26/senate-section/article/S6918-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6918-S6919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            OUTSTANDING SCHOOLS HONORED FOR SERVICE LEARNING\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to recognize a \nnumber of schools that are doing an excellent job of encouraging \ncommunity service by their students. The Nation has always relied on \nthe dedication and involvement of its citizens to help meet the \nchallenges we face. Today, the Corporation for National Service works \nwith state commissions, non-profits, schools, and other civic \norganizations to provide opportunities for Americans of all ages to \nserve their communities.\n  Learn and Serve America, a program sponsored by the Corporation for \nNational Service, supports service-learning programs in schools and \ncommunity organizations that help nearly a million students from \nkindergarten through college meet community needs, while improving \ntheir academic skills and learning the habits of good citizenship. \nLearn and Serve grants are used to create new programs, replicate \nexisting programs, and provide training and development for staff, \nfaculty, and volunteers.\n  This year the Corporation for National Service has recognized a \nnumber of outstanding schools across the country as National Service-\nLearning Leader Schools for 2001. The program is an initiative under \nLearn and Serve America that recognizes schools for their excellence in \nservice-learning. These middle schools and high schools have earned \ntheir designation as Leader Schools. They serve as models of excellence \nfor their exemplary integration of service-learning into the curriculum \nand the life of the school. I am hopeful that the well-deserved \nrecognition they are receiving will encourage and increase service-\nlearning opportunities for students in many other schools across the \ncountry.\n  The 2001 National Service Leader Schools are: Vilonia Middle School, \nVilonia, AR; Chico High School, Chico, CA; Evergreen Middle School, \nCottonwood, CA; Telluride Middle School/High School, Telluride, CO; \nSeaford Senior High School, Seaford, DE; Space Coast Middle School, \nCocoa, FL; P.K.

On \nJune 30, 2001, Hugh will be honored by the City of Crab Orchard, \nKentucky, for his dedication to our Nation, and I know my colleagues \njoin me in expressing our gratitude for his many contributions.\n  Hugh Grundy is a true American hero and has dedicated much of his \nlife to the cause of freedom. During World War II, he served as a Major \nin the U.S. Army Air Corps/Air Force. After that, Hugh went on to serve \nconcurrently as president of the Civil Air Transport and Air America. \nSecretly owned by the Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, these two air \ntransport organizations were staffed by civilians who conducted \nundercover missions in Asia and other parts of the world in support of \nU.S. policy objectives. Often working under dangerous conditions and \nwith outdated equipment, CAT and Air America crews transported scores \nof troops and refugees, flew emergency medical missions, and rescued \ndowned airmen. Hugh and the brave people he commanded played a vital \nrole in the war against Communism and their commitment to freedom will \nnever be forgotten.\n  Hugh Grundy is a native Kentuckian. Born on his parents' farm in \nValley Hill, KY, he grew up helping his father raise and show yearling \nsaddle horses. While Hugh's love for aviation and his service to our \nNation caused him to be away from the Commonwealth for many years, he \nreturned to the Bluegrass to retire. Hugh and his wife of 58 years, \nElizabeth, or ``Frankie'' as she is known to her friends, now live on \ntheir family farm, called Valley Hill Plantation. After many years on \nthe go, Hugh and Frankie are very content with the peace and quiet \nassociated with farm life.\n  Although Hugh Grundy is now retired, his record of dedication and \nservice continues. On behalf of this body, I thank him for his \ncontributions to this Nation, and sincerely wish him and his family the \nvery best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/26/senate-section/article/S6919-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN P.

Kelty of Hampton Beach, NH, for his heroic service \nto the United States of America during World War II.\n  On July 30, 2001 I will present John with the medals he so bravely \nearned while serving his Nation in battle. John was wounded in action \nwhile serving in the Marshall Islands where he volunteered to evacuate \nfallen comrades while under machine gun fire.

Our silicon \nforest has grown by leaps and bounds; unemployment has dropped, and our \nwelfare rolls have been reduced by half. But this prosperity has not \nreached all Oregonians. Oregon has the appalling distinction of having \nthe highest rate of hunger in the nation, according to the USDA. That \nmeans that per capita, more people in Oregon go without meals than in \nany other State. I think that it may surprise some of my colleagues to \nlearn that many of their home States suffer from severe hunger problems \nas well.\n  Perhaps the most tragic aspect of America's hunger problem is that it \ncan be prevented. Federal programs,\n\n[[Page S6922]]\n\nlike Food Stamps and WIC, can help families fill the gap between the \nsize of their food bill and the size of their paycheck, but too many \npeople don't know that they qualify for the help available to them \nthrough these programs. This is especially true in the rural areas of \nOregon, which is also home to most of my State's hungry citizens. Help \nexists for hungry people, and I want to make sure every American knows \nabout the resources the Federal Government has already made available \nto them.\n  The Food Stamp Act of 1977 authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to \nprovide states with up to 50 percent of the costs of informational \nactivities related to program outreach; however, because the remaining \n50 percent of the funds for these limited outreach activities must be \nsupplied by the State, most States do not participate.\n  To ensure that more Oregonians and hungry people across the country \ntake advantage of the resources available to them, the SHARE Act will \nprovide additional funds to the 10 hungriest states, as named by the \nUSDA, to help those in need learn about and sign up for federal food \nassistance programs. The SHARE bill authorizes the Secretary of \nAgriculture to make grants of up to $1 million to these states for 3 \nyears. States can use these flexible funds for outreach--anything from \ndistributing informational flyers at community health clinics to \nfunding staff to help people fill out application forms. In addition, \nthe bill will allow the Secretary of Agriculture to make grants \navailable to States with particularly innovative outreach demonstration \nprojects, so that we can find the best ways to combat hunger.\n  In a country as blessed with abundance as ours, no family should go \nhungry simply because they lack the information they need to get help. \nWhen passed, the SHARE Act will give Oregon and other states an \nopportunity to devise new and innovative programs that will allow the \nneedy in our states to get the help they so desperately need. The idea \nbehind this legislation is not very complicated--I simply want to make \npeople aware of the food assistance already available to them--but I \nbelieve that this bill is as important as any we will consider in the \nSenate this year. With the help of my colleagues, we can stem the tide \nof this very preventable tragedy.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, extreme forms of hunger in American \nhouseholds have virtually been eliminated, in part due to the Nation's \nnutrition-assistance safety net. Less severe forms of food insecurity \nand hunger, however, are still found within the United States and \nremain a cause for concern. The Food Stamp Program provides benefits to \nlow-income people to assist with their purchase of foods that will \nenhance their nutritional status. Food stamp recipients spend their \nbenefits, in the form of paper coupons or electronic benefits on debit \ncards, to buy eligible food in authorized retail food stores. Food \nstamp recipients, or those eligible for food stamps, cross the life \ncycle. They include individuals of all ages, races and ethnicity in \nboth urban and rural settings.\n  As a result of the National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research \nAct of 1990, the nutritional state of the American people has been \nclosely monitored at State and local levels. We know that food \ninsecurity is a complex, multidimensional phenomenon which varies \nthrough a continuum of successive stages as the condition becomes more \nsevere. As the stage of food insecurity and hunger progresses, the \nnumber of affected individuals decreases. It is important for us to \nidentify the stages of food insecurity and hunger as early as possible \nand, thus, continue to avoid the more severe stages of hunger. This \nmeans that we will need to focus on a much larger population base with \na less dramatic stage of the condition which may be more difficult to \nidentify. Fortunately, current tools to document the extent of food \ninsecurity and hunger caused by income limitations are sensitive and \nreliable.\n  We must continue developing tools to document the extent of poor \nnutrition attributable to factors other than income limitations, like \ninadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables and overconsumption of \nsugar, fat, and empty calories. In the meantime, The State Hunger \nAssistance in Response to Emergency Act of 2001 (SHARE) would take \ninformation which is already being collected by the Department of \nAgriculture and allow the 10 States with the greatest rate of hunger to \naccess funds to perform enhanced outreach activities for the food stamp \nprogram.\n  The goal of the food stamp nutrition education program is to provide \neducational programs that increase the likelihood of all food stamp \nrecipients making healthy food choices consistent with the most recent \ndietary advice. States are encouraged to provide nutrition education \nmessages that focus on strengthening and reinforcing the link between \nfood security and a healthy diet. Currently USDA matches the dollars a \nState is able to spend on its Food Stamp nutrition education program. \nThis nutrition education plan is optional but participation has \nincreased from five State plans in 1992 to 48 State plans in FY 2000.\n  This bill expands the allowable outreach activities for the States \nwith the worst statistics and would allow up to $1 million per State \nwith 0 percent match requirement. In exchange for this unmatched money, \nthe State must submit a report that measures the outcomes of food stamp \ninformational activities carried out by the State over the 3 years of \nthe grant. In addition, up to five States with innovative proposals for \nfood stamp outreach could be selected by the Secretary of Agriculture \nfor a demonstration project to receive the same amount of money over 3 \nyears.\n  I have always been proud to represent my home State of New Mexico in \nthe United States Senate. Unfortunately New Mexico has one of the worst \nhunger statistics in the nation. I think it is my duty to advocate for \nthe New Mexicans that I represent as well as all Americans who are at \nrisk for experiencing hunger, including those from Oregon, Texas, \nArkansas and Washington who share similar statistics.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1099. A bill to increase the criminal penalties for assaulting or \nthreatening Federal judges, their family members, and other public \nservants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, one of the important tasks we \nhave in Congress is to ensure that our laws effectively deter violence \nand provide protection to those whose careers are dedicated to \nprotecting our families and also our communities.\n  With this in mind, today I rise to reintroduce the Federal Judiciary \nProtection Act with my esteemed colleague, Senator Leahy. This bill \nwill provide greater protection to Federal law enforcement officials \nand their families. Under current law, a person who assaults, attempts \nto assault, or who threatens to kidnap or murder a member of the \nimmediate family of a U.S. official, a U.S. judge, or a Federal law \nenforcement official, is subject to a punishment of a fine or \nimprisonment of up to 5 years, or both. This legislation seeks to \nexpand these penalties in instances of assault with a weapon and a \nprior criminal history. In such cases, an individual could face up to \n20 years in prison.\n  This legislation would also strengthen the penalties for individuals \nwho communicate threats through the mail. Currently, individuals who \nknowingly use the U.S. Postal Service to deliver any communication \ncontaining any threat are subject to a fine of up to $1,000 or \nimprisonment of up to 5 years. Under this legislation, anyone who \ncommunicates a threat could face imprisonment of up to 10 years.\n  Briefly, I would like to share several examples illustrating the need \nfor this legislation. In my State of Oregon, Chief Judge Michael Hogan \nand his family were subjected to frightening, threatening phone calls, \nletters, and messages from an individual who had been convicted of \nprevious crimes in Judge Hogan's courtroom. For months, he and his \nfamily lived with the fear that these threats to the lives of his wife \nand children could become reality, and, equally disturbing, that the \nindividual could be back out on the street again in a matter of a few \nmonths, or a few years.\n  Judge Hogan and his family are not alone. In 1995, Mr. Melvin Lee \nDavis threatened two judges in Oregon, one judge in Nevada, and the \nClerk of the\n\n[[Page S6923]]\n\nCourt in Oregon. The threat was carried out to the point that the front \ndoor of the residence of a Mr. John Cooney was shot up in a drive-by \nshooting. Unfortunately for Mr. Cooney, he had the same name as one of \nthe Oregon judges who was threatened.\n  In September 1996, Lawrence County Judge Dominick Motto was stalked, \nharassed, and subjected to terrorist threats by Milton C. Reiguert, who \nwas upset by a verdict in a case that Judge Motto had heard in his \ncourtroom. After hearing the verdict, Reiguert stated his intention to \n``point a rifle at his head and get what he wanted.''\n  These are just several examples of vicious acts focused at our \nFederal law enforcement officials. As a member of the legislative \nbranch, I believe it is our responsibility to provide adequate \nprotection to all Americans who serve to protect the life and liberty \nof every citizen in this Nation. I encourage my colleagues to join us \nin sponsoring this important legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend from Oregon \nto introduce the Federal Judiciary Protection Act. In the last two \nCongresses, I was pleased to cosponsor nearly identical legislation \nintroduced by Senator Gordon Smith, which unanimously passed the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate, but was not acted upon by the House \nof Representatives. I commend the Senator from Oregon for his continued \nleadership in protecting public servants in our Federal Government.\n  Our bipartisan legislation would provide greater protection to \nFederal judges, law enforcement officers, and United States officials \nand their families. United States officials, under our bill, include \nthe President, Vice President, Cabinet Secretaries, and Members of \nCongress.\n  Specifically, our legislation would: increase the maximum prison term \nfor forcible assaults, resistance, opposition, intimidation or \ninterference with a Federal judge, law enforcement officer or United \nStates official from 3 years imprisonment to 8 years; increase the \nmaximum prison term for use of a deadly weapon or infliction of bodily \ninjury against a Federal judge, law enforcement officer or United \nStates official from 10 years imprisonment to 20 years; and increase \nthe maximum prison term for threatening murder or kidnaping of a member \nof the immediate family of a Federal judge or law enforcement officer \nfrom 5 years imprisonment to 10 years. It has the support of the \nDepartment of Justice, the United States Judicial Conference, the \nUnited States Sentencing Commission and the United States Marshal \nService.\n  It is most troubling that the greatest democracy in the world needs \nthis legislation to protect the hard working men and women who serve in \nour Federal Government. Just last week, I was saddened to read about \ndeath threats against my colleague from Vermont after his act of \nconscience in declaring himself an Independent. Senator Jeffords \nreceived multiple threats against his life, which forced around-the-\nclock police protection. These unfortunate threats made a difficult \ntime even more difficult for Senator Jeffords and his family.\n  We are seeing more violence and threats of violence against officials \nof our Federal Government. For example, a courtroom in Urbana, Illinois \nwas firebombed recently, apparently by a disgruntled litigant. This \nfollows the horrible tragedy of the bombing of the federal office \nbuilding in Oklahoma City in 1995. In my home state during the summer \nof 1997, a Vermont border patrol officer, John Pfeiffer, was seriously \nwounded by Carl Drega, during a shootout with Vermont and New Hampshire \nlaw enforcement officers in which Drega lost his life. Earlier that \nday, Drega shot and killed two state troopers and a local judge in New \nHampshire. Apparently, Drega was bent on settling a grudge against the \njudge who had ruled against him in a land dispute.\n  I had a chance to visit John Pfeiffer in the hospital and met his \nwife and young daughter. Thankfully, Agent Pfeiffer has returned to \nwork along the Vermont border. As a Federal law enforcement officer, \nAgent Pfeiffer and his family will receive greater protection under our \nbill.\n  There is, of course, no excuse or justification for someone taking \nthe law into their own hands and attacking or threatening a judge, law \nenforcement officer or U.S. official. Still, the U.S. Marshal Service \nis concerned with more and more threats of harm to our judges, law \nenforcement officers and Federal officials.\n  The extreme rhetoric that some have used in the past to attack the \njudiciary only feeds into this hysteria. For example, one of the \nRepublican leaders in the House of Representatives was quoted as \nsaying: ``The judges need to be intimidated,'' and if they do not \nbehave, ``we're going to go after them in a big way.'' I know that this \nofficial did not intend to encourage violence against any Federal \nofficial, but this extreme rhetoric only serves to degrade Federal \njudges in the eyes of the public.\n  Let none of us in the Congress contribute to the atmosphere of hate \nand violence. Let us treat the judicial branch and those who serve \nwithin it with the respect that is essential to preserving its public \nstanding.\n  We have the greatest judicial system in the world, the envy of people \naround the globe who are struggling for freedom. It is the independence \nof our third, co-equal branch of government that gives it the ability \nto act fairly and impartially. It is our judiciary that has for so long \nprotected our fundamental rights and freedoms and served as a necessary \ncheck on overreaching by the other two branches, those more susceptible \nto the gusts of the political winds of the moment.\n  We are fortunate to have dedicated women and men throughout the \nFederal Judiciary and Federal Government in this country who do a \ntremendous job under difficult circumstances. They are examples of the \nhard-working public servants that make up the Federal Government, who \nare too often maligned and unfairly disparaged. It is unfortunate that \nit takes acts or threats of violence to put a human face on the Federal \nJudiciary, law enforcement officers or U.S. officials, to remind \neveryone that these are people with children and parents and cousins \nand friends. They deserve our respect and our protection.\n  I thank Senator Smith for his leadership on protecting our Federal \njudiciary and other public servants in our Federal Government. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Federal Judiciary Protection Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 1101. A bill to name the engineering and management building at \nNorfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia, after Norman Sisisky; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nredesignate Building 1500 at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, \nVirginia, as the Norman Sisisky Engineering and Management Building. I \nam joined by my Virginia Senate colleague, George Allen.\n  As a Navy veteran of World War II, Congressman Sisisky was proud to \nbe a part of one of the most extraordinary chapters in American \nhistory, when America was totally united at home in support of our 16 \nmillion men and women in uniform on battlefields in Europe and on the \nhigh seas in the Pacific, all, at home and abroad, fighting to preserve \nfreedom.\n  During our 18 years serving together, Congressman Sisisky's goal, our \ngoal, was to provide for the men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies.\n  The last 50 years have proven time and again that one of America's \ngreatest investments was the G.I. Bill of Rights, originated during \nWorld War II, which enabled service men and women to gain an education \nsuch that they could rebuild America's economy. The G.I. Bill was but \none of the many benefits that Congressman Sisisky fought for and made a \nreality for today's soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines.\n  His strength in public life was supported by his wonderful family; \nhis lovely wife Rhoda and four accomplished children. They were always \nby his side offering their love, support, and counsel.\n  He worked tirelessly throughout Virginia's 4th District, however, \nthere was always a special bond to the military installations under his \ncharge. As a former sailor, the Norfolk Naval Shipyard was high among \nhis priorities. He\n\n[[Page S6924]]\n\nknew the workers by name and the monthly workload in the yard. In \nconsultation with his family and delegation members, we chose this \nbuilding at the shipyard as a most appropriate memorial to our friend \nand colleague.\n  I waited until the special election was concluded so the entire \nVirginia delegation could join together on this legislation.\n  Norman Sisisky was always a leader for the delegation on matters of \nnational security. We are honored to join in this bi-partisan effort to \nremember Congressman Norman Sisisky and his life's work; ensuring the \nnation's security and the welfare of the men and women in uniform and \ntheir families.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1101\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1. DESIGNATION OF ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT \n                   BUILDING AT NORFOLK NAVAL SHIPYARD, VIRGINIA, \n                   AFTER NORMAN SISISKY.\n\n       The engineering and management building (also known as \n     Building 1500) at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, \n     Virginia, shall be known as the Norman Sisisky Engineering \n     and Management Building. Any reference to that building in \n     any law, regulation, map, document, record, or other paper of \n     the United States shall be considered to be a reference to \n     the Norman Sisisky Engineering and Management Building.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Daschle, Mr. Murkowski, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1100. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to provide trade \nadjustment assistance to farmers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nbring fairness to farmers in an important element of our trade policy. \nI am very pleased to be joined in this effort by the ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, who has been a true champion \nof this effort over the past several years.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would amend the Trade Act of \n1974 to make farmers eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance, TAA, so \nthat they can get assistance similar to that provided to workers in \nother industries who suffer economic injury as a result of increased \nimports.\n  When imports cause layoffs in manufacturing industries, workers \nbecome eligible for TAA. Under TAA, a portion of the income these \nworkers lose is restored to them in the form of extended unemployment \ninsurance benefits while they adjust to import competition and seek \nother employment. When imports of agricultural commodities increase, \nthough, farmers do not lose their jobs. Instead, the increased imports \ndrive down the prices farmers receive for the crops they have grown. \nThis drop in prices can have an impact that is every bit as devastating \nto the income of a family farmer as a layoff is to a manufacturing \nworker. In fact, it can be even more devastating. In many cases, the \ncheck that farmers get for all the hard work of growing crops or \nlivestock for the year may not only leave the farmer with no net \nincome, it may not even cover all the input costs associated with \nproducing the commodity, leaving the farmer with thousands of dollars \nin losses. But, because job loss is a requirement for getting cash \nassistance under TAA, farmers generally don't get benefits from TAA \nwhen imports cause their income to plummet.\n  Trade is very important to our overall economy, and trade is \nespecially important to our agricultural economy. For example, we \nexport over half the wheat grown in the United States. That is why, \nhistorically, agriculture has been among the leading supporters of \ntrade liberalization. However, today many farmers believe their incomes \nare hurt by free trade, and they have nowhere to turn for assistance \nwhen this happens.\n  Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers can not only provide badly \nneeded cash assistance to the devastated agricultural economy, it can \nre-ignite support for trade among many family farmers. By giving \nfarmers some protection against precipitous income losses from imports, \nthis legislation will strengthen support for trade agreements.\n  The Conrad-Grassley TAA for Farmers Act would assist farmers who lose \nincome because of imports. Farmers would get a payment to compensate \nthem for some, but not all, of the income they lose if increased \nimports affect commodity prices.\n  The eligibility criteria are designed to be analogous to those that \napply currently to manufacturing workers. First, just as the Secretary \nof Labor now decides whether there has been economic injury to workers \nin a given manufacturing firm by determining whether production has \ndeclined and significant layoffs have occurred, the Secretary of \nAgriculture would decide whether there has been economic injury to \nproducers of a commodity by determining if the price of the commodity \nhad dropped more than 20 percent compared to the average price in the \nprevious five years. Second, just as the Secretary of Labor determines \nwhether imports ``contributed importantly'' to the layoffs, the \nSecretary of Agriculture would determine whether imports ``contributed \nimportantly'' to the commodity price drop.\n  In order to be eligible for benefits under this program, individual \nfarmers would have to demonstrate that their net farm income had \ndeclined from the previous year, and farmers would need to meet with \nthe USDA's extension service to plan how to adjust to the import \ncompetition. This adjustment could take the form of improving the \nefficiency of the operation or switching to different crops.\n  Farmers who are eligible for benefits under the program would receive \na cash assistance payment equal to half the difference between the \nnational average price for the year (as determined by USDA) and 80 \npercent of the average price in the previous 5 years (the price trigger \nlevel), multiplied by the number of units the farmer had produced, up \nto a maximum of $10,000 per year.\n  In most years, the program would have a modest cost, as few \ncommodities, if any, would be eligible. But in a year when surging \nimports cause prices to drop precipitously, this program would offer a \ncash lifeline to give farmers the opportunity to adjust to this import \ncompetition. This legislation sends a strong signal to farmers that \nthey will not be left behind in our trade policy, that agriculture must \nbe a priority.\n  We need to be sure that we don't leave American farmers behind. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in supporting American family farmers \nas they compete in the global market place.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 1102. A bill to strengthen the rights of workers to associate, \norganize and strike, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto strengthen the basic rights of workers to organize and to join a \nunion. This legislation, the ``Right-to-Organize Act of 2001,'' \naddresses shortcomings in the National Labor Relations Act, NLRA, that, \nover the years, have eroded the framework of worker empowerment the \nNLRA was designed to ensure.\n  The NLRA, also known as the Wagner Act, was enacted to ``protect the \nexercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization \nand designation of representatives of their own choosing for purpose of \nnegotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other \nmutual aid or protection.'' Its proponents envisioned that the commerce \nof the Nation would be aided by workplaces that respected and empowered \nworkers' voices about the terms and conditions of their own employment. \nIts proponents envisioned that supporting workers' right to organize \nwould help lay the basic platform for healthy economies, healthy \ncommunities, and healthy families.\n  Grounded in lofty notions of ``full freedom of association'' and \n``actual liberty of contract,'' the promise of the NLRA was a \nfundamentally democratic one: participatory processes as a way to \nguarantee basic protections and to give those affected a role in \ndecision-making about issues of paramount concern to them.\n  That was the promise of the NLRA. Unfortunately, today that promise \nis far from being realized. Indeed, today\n\n[[Page S6925]]\n\nthe democratic foundation we have attempted to erect for our workplaces \nis crumbling beyond recognition.\n  Today, instead of celebrating the participatory voice of workers, we \nare faced with the stark reality that in all too many cases, workers \nwho do participate, workers who choose to organize, workers who choose \nto voice their concerns about the terms and conditions of their \nworkplace live in fear. They live in fear of being harassed, of losing \nwages and benefits, of being put on leave without pay, and ultimately \nfear of losing their jobs. In a country that celebrates democracy and \nfreedom, the land of the free, it is unconscionable that hard working \nmen and women can be placed in fear of losing their livelihood because \nthey choose to exercise their legal rights to associate for the \npurposes of bargaining collectively and participating in decision-\nmaking about their own workplaces.\n  Today, as one organizer told me, all too many times you have to be a \nhero when you try to organize your own workplace. That's true. The men \nand women who do this--who step up to take some ownership for what's \ngoing on in their own workplaces--are doing heroic work. But that \nshouldn't have to be the case. That wasn't the promise of democracy and \nparticipation--of the associational and liberty of contract values this \nNation endorsed in the National Labor Relations Act.\n  It's urgent that we take action here. Estimates are that 10,000 \nworking Americans lose their jobs illegally every year just for \nsupporting union organizing campaigns. The 1994 Dunlop Commission found \nthat one in four employers illegally fired union activists during \norganizing campaigns. Estimates are that one out of 10 activists is \nfired.\n  This is unacceptable. This is truly one of the most urgent civil \nrights and human rights issues of the new millennium. Working Americans \nare harassed, threatened and fired simply for seeking to have a voice \nand be represented in their workplace. According to the Dunlop \nCommission, the United States is the only major democratic country in \nwhich the choice of whether workers are to be represented by a union is \nsubject to such confrontational processes.\n  As Chair of the Employment, Safety, and Training Subcommittee with \njurisdiction over the National Labor Relations Act, NLRA, I am \nintroducing the ``Right-to-Organize Act of 2001'' to shore up the \ncrumbling foundation of democracy in the workplace that the NLRA was \nintended to promote. The Act will target some of the most serious \nabuses of labor law that unfortunately have become all too common in \nrecent years.\n  First, employers routinely monopolize the debates leading up to \ncertification elections. They distribute written materials in \nopposition to collective bargaining. They require workers to attend \nmeetings where they present their anti-union views. They talk to \nemployees one-on-one about the dire consequences of unionization, such \nas the possibility that the individual employee or all employees could \nlose their jobs. All too often, at the same time that this flagrant \ncoercion, intimidation, and interference is taking place often on a \ndaily basis--union organizers are barred from work sites and even \npublic areas.\n  Second, as noted above, employers too frequently are firing employees \nand engaging in other unfair labor practices to discourage union \norganizing and union representation. They are doing this sometimes with \nnear impunity because today's laws simply are not strong enough to \ndiscourage them from doing so. As the report, Unfair Advantage noted \njust last year, employers intent on frustrating workers' efforts to \norganize can, and do, drag out legal proceedings for years, at the end \nof which they receive a slap on the wrist in the form of back pay to \nthe worker illegally fired and a requirement that they post a written \nnotice promising not to repeat their illegal behavior. ``Many \nemployers,'' according to this report `` have come to view remedies, \nlike back pay for workers fired because of union activity as a routine \ncost of doing business, well worth it to get rid of organizing leaders \nand derail workers' organizing efforts.'' We need to put teeth into our \nability to enforce the legal rights that are already on the books.\n  Third, as part of efforts to discourage organizing, employers are \nable today to drag out election campaigns, giving themselves more time \nin some cases to harass workers through methods such as those I have \ndescribed. Their hope may be that the climate of fear and intimidation \nwill encourage workers to vote against the union seeking certification. \nWhile just across our border in Canada, elections take place on average \nwithin a week of the filing of a petition, here in the United States, \nit takes on average 80 days between petition and certification. That is \nan enormous amount of time for workers to live in fear of casting a \nvote to help empower their voice in the workplace.\n  Finally, there is a growing problem of employers refusing to bargain \nwith their employees even after a union has been duly certified. \nAchieving so-called ``first contracts'' can often be as harrowing as \nthe organizing effort itself.\n  I want to be clear. Most employers do not take advantage of their \nworkers in this way. Indeed, in tens of thousands of workplaces across \nthe country, employers are working together with employees and their \nunions, to create safe, healthy, productive, and rewarding work \nenvironments. I applaud the efforts these employers and workers are \nmaking.\n  Unfortunately, however, this is not universally the case. All too \nfrequently employers are disempowering workers and undermining their \nrights to organize, join, and belong to a union. That is why, that I \nsay this is one of the most urgent civil and human rights issues of the \nnew millennium. Civil rights and human rights is fundamentally about \nprotecting the dignity and well-being of the less empowered against \nexcesses of the more powerful. Nothing could be more important to \nprotecting workers' rights to advocate for themselves and their \nfamilies than securing a meaningful right to organize.\n  The Right-to-Organize Act of 2001 is a first step in tackling some of \nthe most serious barriers to workers' ability to unionize. In \nparticular, the Act would do the following:\n  First, it would amend the National Labor Relations Act to provide \nequal time to labor organizations to provide information about union \nrepresentation. Under this proposal the employer would trigger the \nequal time provision by expressing opinions on union representation \nduring work hours or at the work site. Once the triggering actions \noccur, then the union would be entitled to equal time to use the same \nmedia used by the employer to distribute information and be allowed \naccess to the work site to communicate with employees.\n  Second, it would toughen penalties for wrongful discharge violations. \nIn particular, it would require the National Labor Relations Board to \naward back pay equal to 3 times the employee's wages when the Board \nfinds that an employee is discharged as a result of an unfair labor \npractice. It also would allow employees to file civil actions to \nrecover punitive damages when they have been discharged as a result of \nan unfair labor practice.\n  Third, it would require expedited elections in cases where a super \nmajority of workers have signed union recognition cards designating a \nunion as the employee's labor organizations. In particular, it would \nrequire elections within 14 days after receipt of signed union \nrecognition cards from 60 percent of the employees.\n  Fourth, the bill would put in place mediation and arbitration \nprocedures to help employers and employees reach mutually agreeable \nfirst-contract collective bargaining agreements. It would require \nmediation if the parties cannot reach agreement on their own after 60 \ndays. Should the parties not reach agreement 30 days after a mediator \nis selected, then either party could call in the Federal Mediation and \nConciliation Service for binding arbitration. In this way both parties \nwould have incentives to reach genuine agreement without allowing \neither side to hold the other hostage indefinitely to unrealistic \nproposals.\n  The need for these reforms is urgent, not only for workers who seek \nto join together and bargain collectively, but for all Americans. \nIndeed, one of the most important things we can do to raise the \nstandard of living and quality\n\n[[Page S6926]]\n\nof life for working Americans, raise wages and benefits, improve health \nand safety in the workplace, and give average Americans more control \nover their lives is to enforce their right to organize, join, and \nbelong to a union.\n  When workers join together to fight for job security, for dignity, \nfor economic justice and for a fair share of America's prosperity, it \nis not a struggle merely for their own benefit. The gains of unionized \nworkers on basic bread-and-butter issues are key to the economic \nsecurity of all working families. Upholding the right to organize is a \nway to advance important social objectives, higher wages, better \nbenefits, more pension coverage, more worker training, more health \ninsurance coverage, and safer work places, for all Americans without \ndrawing on any additional government resources.\n  The right to organize is one of the most important civil and human \nrights causes of the new millennium. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nhelping to restore that right to its proper place.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1103. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to enhance \ncompetition among and between rail carriers in order to ensure \nefficient rail service and reasonable rail rates in any case in which \nthere is an absence of effective competition, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am happy today to join with my \ncolleagues Senator Dorgan and Senator Burns, in introducing the Rail \nCompetition Act of 2001. Very simply, the purpose of this legislation \nis to encourage a bare minimum of competitive practices among \nparticipants in the freight rail industry, which has undergone \nunprecedented concentration in recent years, to the detriment of \nvirtually all rail customers.\n  This legislation is a renewed effort on the part of my colleagues and \nme to address an issue that has amazed and shocked us for years. The \nmonopoly power of the railroads places pervasive burdens on so many \nindustries important to our states and to the national economy. No \nother industry in this country wields as much power over its customers \nas the railroad industry, and no other industry has as close an ally in \nthe agency charged with its oversight as the railroad industry has with \nthe Surface Transportation Board, known by the abbreviation STB. In \nfact, no other formerly regulated industry in this country continues to \nmaintain this level of market dominance over its customers and \nessential infrastructure.\n  Shippers of bulk commodities, like coal from mines in West Virginia \nand grain from the Plains states, must routinely deal with shipments \nthat move more slowly, and at rates much higher than would normally be \ncharged in a truly competitive market. Every company that ships its \nproduct by rail has a trove of horror stories regarding how high prices \nand poor service attributable to the lack of meaningful competition in \nthe freight rail industry has affected their ability to compete in \ntheir own industries. I know this because these companies have been \ntelling me the same types of stories since I came to Congress.\n  I know that other members of Congress have heard the stories, too. As \nmany of my colleagues will remember, the point was driven home last \nyear when more than 280 CEOs from companies covering the broadest \npossible spectrum of the American economy wrote to Senators McCain and \nHollings asking them to do something to insert real competition in the \nfreight rail industry. For the record, the STB has also heard the \ncomplaints. However, the Board's focus has been the railroads' still-\nweak financial health, rather than the continued service problems that \nare its root cause.\n  I want to give my colleagues an example from an industry that is very \nimportant to my State and the rest of the Nation, the chemical \nindustry. Throughout the country, approximately 80 percent of \nindividual chemical operations are ``captive'' to one railroad, meaning \nthey are served by only one railroad, and are subject to whatever \npricing scheme the railroad chooses to use. In my home State of West \nVirginia, where the chemical industry is one of the pillars of the \nState's economy, 100 percent of chemical plants are captive. Some might \nbe tempted to just write this off as the cost of doing business, but \nlet me impart another view: These plants produce bulk chemicals that \nother companies buy and turn into countless products in use in every \nhome and business in America.\n  Make no mistake, while the immediate beneficiary of this legislation \nwill be the Rail Shipper who will have the opportunity to operate with \nthe confidence that they are getting a fair deal the true beneficiary \nof this legislation is the retail shopper. Every purchase of every \nproduct that began its life in a chemical plant will be cheaper when \nthat chemical plant receives competitive rail service because of this \nbill. Every ingredient in your families' dinners will go down in price \nwhen the shippers of agricultural commodities see their costs go down \nbecause this bill has produced efficiencies that benefit both shipper \nand railroad. Every time you flip the switch, and the lights turn on at \na lower kilowatt-per-hour rate, it will happen because utilities \nthroughout the nation have a more reliable and inexpensive supply of \ncoal because of the Railroad Competition Act of 2001.\n  Congress deregulated the railroad industry with the passage of the \nStaggers Rail Act in 1980. Many of the predicted results of \nderegulation came to pass in relatively short order. The major freight \nrailroads, which were in pretty bad financial shape at the end of the \n1970's, put their fiscal houses in order. In the course of these \nimprovements, some weaker railroads were swallowed up by stronger \ncorporations. Our Nation's rail network, which was extensive but \ninefficient in some respects, became more streamlined. Unfortunately, \nsome of the benefits of competition that Congress was led to expect \nmost notably improved service at lower cost have simply not \nmaterialized for many shippers in several parts of the country.\n  Indeed, rather than improving over time, the situation has grown \nsteadily worse. The second half of the 1990's saw an unprecedented \nspate of railroad mergers, to the point now that the more than 50 Class \nI railroads in existence when I entered the United States Senate has \ndwindled to only six with four railroads carrying a staggeringly high \npercentage of the freight.\n  STB has considered these mergers to be ``in the public interest,'' \nand I will not dispute the possibility that some of them may have been. \nI tend to believe that the notion that fueled many of the mergers was \nthat somehow financially weak corporations with poor track records of \nservice could be transformed overnight into efficient, businesslike \nrailroads providing good service at lower costs. Meanwhile, rail \nshippers had to contend with newly merged railroads with monopoly power \nthat did not seem to care any more about customer service than the \nseparate companies that preceded them.\n  Before I complete my remarks, I want to address what I predict will \nbe some of the rhetoric bandied about by the railroad industry. This \nbill is not an attempt to re-regulate the industry. When Congress \npassed the Staggers Rail Act in 1980, it did not do so with only the \nfinancial health of the railroads in mind. The Interstate Commerce \nCommission, and its successor agency, the STB, were supposed to \nmaintain competition in the rail industry. Both agencies have failed \nmiserably to contain the anti-competitive behavior of the railroads. My \ncosponsors and I only seek to require railroads to quote a price for a \nportion of a route on which they carry a company's products. This bill \ndoes not seek to give the STB more regulatory authority over the \nrailroads, it only serves to remind the Board of the pro-competitive \nresponsibilities authorized by Congress in the Staggers Act.\n  Likewise, we do not offer this bill to hasten the demise of the \nindustry. The companies that have come to us time and again for help in \ngetting competitive rail service absolutely need a strong railroad \nindustry. Their products, for the most part, cannot be moved \nefficiently via trucks or barges. The competition that will be fostered \nby this legislation is intended to help the railroads as much as it is \nintended to help shippers. Some may dispute the fundamental economic \nlogic of this, to\n\n[[Page S6927]]\n\nwhich I respond: Giving the railroads relatively unfettered regional \nmonopolies with the right to engage in anti-competitive behavior has \nnot produced the strong railroad industry the Staggers Act sought to \nproduce. At the very least, perhaps it is time to give competition a \nchance to succeed.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a bill, the \nRailroad Competition Act of 2001, which, along with Senator Burns and \nSenator Rockefeller I hope will introduce a bit of competition and \nbetter service in our railroad industry. The truth is that our rail \nsystem is completely broken, deregulation has only led to a system \ndominated by regional monopolies and both shippers and consumers are \npaying the price.\n  Since the supposed deregulation of the rail industry in 1980, the \nnumber of major Class I railroads has been allowed to decline from \napproximately 42 to only four major U.S. railroads today. Four mega-\nrailroads overwhelmingly dominate railroad traffic, generating 95 \npercent of the gross ton-miles and 94 percent of the revenues, \ncontrolling 90 percent of all U.S. coal movement; 70 percent of all \ngrain movement and 88 percent of all originated chemical movement. This \ndrastic level of consolidation has left rail customers with only two \nmajor carriers operating in the East and two in the West, and has far \nexceeded the industry's need to minimize unit operating costs.\n  But consolidation has not happened in a vacuum. Over the years, \nregulators have systematically adopted polices that so narrowly \ninterpret the pro-competitive provisions of the 1980 statute that \nrailroads are essentially protected from ever having to compete with \neach other. As a consequence rail users have no power to choose among \ncarriers either in terminal areas where switching infrastructure makes \nsuch choices feasible, nor can rail users even get a rate quoted to \nthem over a ``bottleneck'' segment of the monopoly system.\n  The negative results of this approach have been astonishing. In North \nDakota it costs $2,300 to move one rail car of wheat to Minneapolis \n(approx. 400 miles). Yet for a similar 400 mile move between \nMinneapolis and Chicago, it costs only $310 to deliver that car. And \nmove that same car another 600 miles to St. Louis, Missouri and it \ncosts only $610 per car. Looking at it another way--An elevator in \nMinot, North Dakota pays $2.99 to the farmer for a bushel of wheat. The \ncost to ship that wheat to the West coast on the BNSF is $1.30 per \nbushel. At that rate, rail transportation consumes 43 percent of the \nvalue of that wheat. Not only is that totally unfair to the captive \nfarmer, but in the long run it is unsustainable.\n  How has this happened? Since the deregulation of the railroad \nindustry, it has been the responsibility of the Interstate Commerce \nCommission, later renamed, the Surface Transportation Board, to make \nsure that the pro-competitive intent of the law was being upheld. It is \nthe STBs charge to protect captive shippers through ``regulated \ncompetition.''\n  That clearly hasn't happened. In 1999 the GAO reported on how \ncomplicated it is for a shipper to get rate relief under the \n``regulated competition'' approach at the STB. The GAO found that this \nprocess takes up to 500 days to decide, and costs hundreds of thousands \nof dollars. Hundreds of thousands of dollars and about approximately \ntwo years--that's hardly a rate relief process. But it's about the only \nrelief shippers have under the law.\n  The Railroad Competition Act of 2001 will reaffirm the strong role \nthe STB should play in protecting shippers by: jump-starting \ncompetition by requiring railroads to quote a rate on any given \nsegment; facilitating terminal access and the ability to transfer goods \namong railroads in terminal areas; simplifying the market dominance \ntest; eliminating the annual revenue adequacy test; bolstering rail \naccess by making the rate relief process cheaper, faster and easier \nthrough a streamlined arbitration process, and requiring the railroads \nto file monthly service performance reports with the Department of \nTransportation, similar to what we require of the airline industry, so \nthat rail customers have access to the information then need to make \ngood railroad and transportation choices.\n  All Americans, whether they are farmers who need to ship their crops \nto market, businesses shipping factory goods, or consumers that buy the \nfinished product, deserve to have a rail transportation system with \nprices that are fair. It is time for Congress to stand up for farmers, \nbusinesses, and consumers by making it very clear that the STB has to \nbe a more aggressive defender of competition and reasonable rates.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Gramm, Mr. \n        Nickles, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. \n        Chafee):\n  S. 1104. A bill to establish objectives for negotiating, and \nprocedures for, implementing certain trade agreements; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Murkowski and \nour cosponsors to introduce the Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2001. \nWe have stepped forward because we believe that international trade is \nessential to increase opportunities for U.S. producers, to support U.S. \njobs, and to provide economic opportunities for trading partners who \nneed development.\n  Last month the Administration release its 2001 International Trade \nAgenda, which outlined the President's principles for renewed trade \npromotion authority, TPA. At the same time, I was working with a group \nof pro-trade Democrats to identify our key priorities. What we \ndiscovered is that our two sets of principles had much in common.\n  Over the last few weeks, Senator Murkowski and I have worked together \nto translate those two sets of principles into legislative language.\n  The trade debate has been virtually deadlocked for years, with voices \nfrom the ``end zones'' taking center-stage. In our view, this bill \nrepresents the basic architecture of a bipartisan bill on what we \nbelieve is the ``50 yard line.'' We also look forward to the \ncontribution that others will make before this bill is signed into law.\n  The fact that we introduced this bill with bipartisan support is \nparticularly significant because this is not just a set of ideas that \nhappened to be popular with both Democrats and Republicans. This bill \ntook real compromise on both sides.\n  For my part, my contributions to this bill were based on the trade \nprinciples developed by New Democrats led by Cal Dooley in the House \nand several of my colleagues in the Senate. The New Democrat trade \nprinciples we released in May are fully incorporated into this bill.\n  What we introduce today is not a trade agreement. Trade promotion \nauthority is an authorization to the President to begin negotiations. \nDetails of a trade bill will be developed through the process \nestablished by the grant of TPA. At the end of that process, Congress \nwill review the result of those negotiations and grant approval or \ndisapproval to the result.\n  Trade promotion authority puts the will of Congress behind our trade \nnegotiator, but it cannot and should not mandate a specific result from \nnegotiations. We must leave it to our negotiators to reach the most \nfavorable agreement they can.\n  A trade promotion authority bill is a way for Congress to communicate \nits negotiating priorities. Some of the priorities we put forward in \nthis bill include: negotiating objectives on labor and environment that \nreceive the same priority as commercial negotiating objectives; a new \nnegotiating objective on information technologies to reduce trade \nbarriers on high technology products, enhance and facilitate barriers-\nfree e-commerce, and provide the same rights and protections for the \nelectronic delivery of products as are offered to products delivered \nphysically; adoption of measures in trade agreements to ensure proper \nimplementation, full compliance and appropriate enforcement mechanisms \nthat are timely and transparent; and a stronger process for continuous \nCongressional involvement in the process before, during, and at the \nclose of negotiations so that the will of Congress is fully expressed \nin the final agreement.\n  I have been concerned by the views expressed by some Members that it \nmay be better to delay consideration of TPA until next year. This would \nbe a ``major league'' mistake. There is a real price to be paid for \ndelay.\n\n[[Page S6928]]\n\n  One hundred years ago the U.S. took an isolationist position with \nrespect to our economic relations with Latin America. The result of \nthis was that the Nations of Latin America adopted European technical \nstandards. This has been a handicap to the U.S. economic position in \nLatin America ever since.\n  We now are in danger of repeating this mistake. The best way to avoid \ndoing so is to negotiate and enter trade agreement with nations so that \nAmerican standards become the norm and American businesses and workers \ncan benefit.\n  Nothing is likely to occur in the next 12 to 24 months that will make \nreaching a consensus on trade promotion authority more likely. In fact \njust the opposite is true.\n  The best way to move forward is to put TPA in perspective. It seems \nthe debate on this issue moves quickly to being a referendum on whether \ntrade and globalization are good or bad. That, frankly, is not the \nquestion. We can't walk away from globalization and we can't shut the \ndoor to international commerce. We can't put the genie back in the \nbottle.\n  What we can do is try to shape these economic forces and define a \ntrade agenda that addresses our priorities. The real question is, ``can \nthe United States have more influence in the trade arena with TPA or \nwithout it.''\n  I am convinced that we will give the President a stronger negotiating \nposition, and get the country a better result, if we pass a grant of \ntrade promotion authority as soon as possible. That is not to say that \nI advocate giving the President a blank check to cash as he pleases. It \nalso does not mean that I believe in a ``free trade utopia'' either.\n  I recognize there will be issues with our trading partners and that \neveryone doesn't always play by the rules. The way to address concerns \nwith our trading partners is at the negotiating table. That makes it \nall the more important for us to have a strong negotiating position, \nand TPA is central to that.\n  We encourage others to contribute specific suggestions to enhance the \nbill's ability to contribute to its principle objective of opening \nmarkets to U.S. goods, creating new and better jobs for Americans, and \nallowing the world to benefit from U.S. goods and services.\n  Only 4 percent of the world's consumers live in the United States. If \nwe want to sell our agriculture products, manufactured goods, and \nworld-class services to the rest of the 96 percent around the world, we \nhave to do it through trade. Trade promotion authority is the best way \nfor the President to negotiate trade agreements that will open markets \nand improve standards of living at home and abroad.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, \nSenator Graham, in introducing the Trade Promotion Act of 2001. In my \nsix and a half years on the Finance Committee, on which Senator Graham \nand I both serve, there has always been a strong bi-partisan consensus \nin favor of open markets and free trade. In introducing the Trade \nPromotion Act of 2001 today, we continue that spirit.\n  This is a bill to which many members have contributed. Together, we \nbelieve that trade is the single most important catalyst for expanding \njobs and opportunities here at home and encouraging economic \ndevelopment abroad.\n  The United States has always been a trading Nation. We learned the \nlaw of comparative advantage very early in our history, and became the \nwealthiest Nation in history as a direct result. Economic theory tells \nus that trade between markets expands the opportunities and benefits in \nboth those markets. As far as trade is concerned, the whole is always \ngreater than the sum of its parts. Our Nation's history has been the \npractical embodiment of this theory. Without trade, this Nation would \nsimply not be the greatest on earth.\n  Yet no matter how many times we have learned this lesson, we forget \nit just as many times. Here we are in 2001, facing the same challenges \non trade we have faced on countless occasions in the past. The \nchampions of protectionism have become more sophisticated over the \nyears. Still: their arguments are the same old fear-mongering and \ndisinformation they have been peddling for 200 years.\n  Does trade lead to winners and losers? Yes, that's called \ncompetition, the bedrock of our society.\n  Does economic growth put pressures on underdeveloped societies in \nlabor and environmental areas? Yes, it can. It did in this country too.\n  But do the short-term pains of competition and other pressures on \nsociety outweigh the benefits of trade? No, not now, not ever.\n  The United States can be leaders on trade or we can be followers. We \ncan either shape the global economy or be shaped by it.\n  There are 134 free trade agreements in the world today. The United \nStates is party to only 2 of those. To my mind, that is a shameful \nrecord. We have done a disservice to our farmers, fishermen, businesses \nand the working men and women of this country.\n  I recognize there are those who are concerned about the broader \nimpacts of globalization. To them I say: you can't influence the \noutcome unless you are in the game.\n  Does government have a role in easing the plight of firms and \nindividuals negatively affected by trade? Absolutely. Sound economic \npolicy should ease the transition of individuals and their companies to \nmore competitive areas.\n  Can the United States help other countries overcome short-term labor \nand environmental problems resulting from rapid growth? No question at \nall. Through technology and other means we have many tools to help the \ndeveloping world.\n  But the only way to address these problems is for the United States \nto exercise leadership on trade. Without Trade Promotion Authority, \nsuch leadership will be impossible.\n  Senator Graham and I and our colleagues believe the Graham-Murkowski \nTrade Promotion Act of 2001 is the right vehicle to provide those \nleadership tools.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1105. A bill to provide for the expeditious completion of the \nacquisition of State of Wyoming lands within the boundaries of Grand \nTeton National Park, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today to \nauthorize the exchange of State lands inside Grand Teton National Park.\n  Grand Teton National Park was established by Congress on February 29, \n1929, to protect the natural resources of the Teton range and recognize \nthe Jackson area's unique beauty. On March 15, 1943, President Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt established the Jackson Hole National Monument \nadjacent to the park. Congress expanded the Park on September 14, 1950, \nby including a portion of the lands from the Jackson Hole National \nMonument. The park currently encompasses approximately 310,000 acres of \nwilderness and has some of the most amazing mountain scenery anywhere \nin our country. This park has become an extremely important element of \nthe National Park system, drawing almost 2.7 million visitors in 1999.\n  When Wyoming became a State in 1890, sections of land were set aside \nfor school revenue purposes. All income from these lands--rents, \ngrazing fees, sales or other sources--is placed in a special trust fund \nfor the benefit of students in the State. The establishment of these \nsections predates the creation of most national parks or monuments \nwithin our State boundaries, creating several state inholdings on \nfederal land. The legislation I am introducing today would allow the \nFederal Government to remove the state school trust lands from Grand \nTeton National Park and allow the State to capture fair value for this \nproperty to benefit Wyoming school children.\n  This bill, entitled the ``Grand Teton National Park Land Exchange \nAct,'' identifies approximately 1406 acres of State lands and mineral \ninterests within the boundaries of Grand Teton National Park for \nexchange for Federal assets. These Federal assets could include mineral \nroyalties, appropriated dollars, federal lands or combination of any of \nthese elements.\n  The bill also identifies an appraisal process for the state and \nfederal government to determine a fair value of the state property \nlocated within the\n\n[[Page S6929]]\n\npark boundaries. Ninety days after the bill is signed into law, the \nland would be valued by one of the following methods: (1) the Interior \nSecretary and Governor would mutually agree on a qualified appraiser to \nconduct the appraisal of the State lands in the park; (2) if there is \nno agreement about the appraiser, the Interior Secretary and Governor \nwould each designate a qualified appraiser. The two designated \nappraisers would select a third appraiser to perform the appraisal with \nthe advice and assistance of the designated appraisers.\n  If the Interior Secretary and Governor cannot agree on the \nevaluations of the State lands 180 days after the date of enactment, \nthe Governor may petition the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to determine \nthe final value. One-hundred-eighty days after the State land value is \ndetermined, the Interior Secretary, in consultation with the Governor, \nshall exchange Federal assets of equal value for the State lands.\n  The management of our public lands and natural resources is often \ncomplicated and requires the coordination of many individuals to \naccomplish desired objectives. When western folks discuss Federal land \nissues, we do not often have an opportunity to identify proposals that \ncapture this type of consensus and enjoy the support from a wide array \nof interests; however, this land exchange offers just such a unique \nprospect.\n  This legislation is needed to improve the management of Grand Teton \nNational Park, by protecting the future of these unique lands against \ndevelopment pressures and allow the State of Wyoming to access their \nassets to address public school funding needs.\n  This bill enjoys the support of many different groups including the \nNational Park Service, the Wyoming Governor, State officials, as well \nas folks from the local community. It is my hope that the Senate will \nseize this opportunity to improve upon efforts to provide services to \nthe American public.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            By Mr. DOMENICI:\n\n  S. 1106. A bill to provide a tax credit for the production of oil or \ngas from deposits held in trust for, or held with restrictions against \nalienation by, Indian tribes and Indian individuals; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce \nlegislation that would provide a Federal tax credit for oil and natural \ngas produced from Indian lands. This legislation will serve two \nimportant purposes. It will provide an immediate boost to tribal \neconomies, and it will provide additional domestic sources of energy to \nease our growing energy crisis.\n  Even though Indian lands offer a fertile source of oil and natural \ngas, many disincentives to exploration and production exist. For \nexample, the Supreme Court permits the double taxation of oil and \nnatural gas produced from tribal lands, which unfairly subjects \nproducers to both State and tribal taxation. Furthermore, tribal \neconomies are not sufficiently diversified to allow for tribal tax \nincentives for oil and natural gas development. Finally, Congress has \nenacted innumerable incentives for energy development on Federal lands, \nwhich has made production from this land far more profitable. As a \nresult, Indian lands are too often overlooked as a source of domestic \nenergy.\n  This legislation would remedy these disadvantages by providing \nFederal tax credits for oil and natural gas production on tribal lands. \nThese tax credits would be available to both the tribe as royalty owner \nand the producer. Tribes would benefit in two ways: they could broaden \ntheir tax base from substantially increased oil and gas production; and \nthey could market their share of the tax credit to generate additional \nrevenue. These additional revenues would allow tribes to strengthen \ntheir infrastructure and improve the vital services that they provide \nto their citizens.\n  Unfortunately, the recent economic prosperity has not been extended \nto many Indian tribes. This is the reason why these tax incentives are \nso crucial. They will provide a much-needed shot in the arm to tribal \neconomic development and will compensate for the discriminatory double \ntaxation that hinders energy production. In recent years, many people \nhave criticized the growth of the gaming industry on reservations. \nHowever, these critics have failed to suggest viable alternatives for \ntribal economic development. This legislation would supply strong \nopportunity for entrepreneurship in a vital national industry and would \nbring many more tribes into the economic mainstream.\n  Finally, this legislation would have the added benefit of creating an \nadditional source of domestic energy. In our efforts to craft a \ncomprehensive energy policy for the United States, we have been \nsearching for additional sources of domestic energy. In this search, we \nmust not overlook tribal oil and gas production. America's energy \nsupply is a patchwork of various domestic and international sources, \nand the addition of tribal lands will only strengthen the seams of this \npatchwork and decrease our risky reliance on foreign sources.\n  Therefore, I am proud today to introduce this legislation to boost \nthe production of oil and natural gas on Indian lands and to strengthen \nour domestic energy supply.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/26/senate-section/article/S6929-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 117--HONORING JOHN J.

Con. Res. 56\n\n       Whereas the Order of the Purple Heart for Military Merit, \n     commonly known as the Purple Heart, is the oldest military \n     decoration in the world in present use;\n       Whereas the Purple Heart is awarded in the name of the \n     President of the United States to members of the Armed Forces \n     who are wounded in conflict with an enemy force or while held \n     by an enemy force as a prisoner of war, and posthumously to \n     the next of kin of members of the Armed Forces who are killed \n     in conflict with an enemy force or who die of a wound \n     received in conflict with an enemy force;\n       Whereas the Purple Heart was established on August 7, 1782, \n     during the Revolutionary War, when General George Washington \n     issued an order establishing the Honorary Badge of \n     Distinction, otherwise known as the Badge of Military Merit \n     or the Decoration of the Purple Heart;\n       Whereas the award of the Purple Heart ceased with the end \n     of the Revolutionary War, but was revived out of respect for \n     the memory and military achievements of George Washington in \n     1932, the year marking the 200th anniversary of his birth; \n     and\n       Whereas the issuance of a postage stamp commemorating the \n     members of the Armed Forces who have been awarded the Purple \n     Heart is a fitting tribute both to those members and to the \n     memory of George Washington: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States Postal Service should issue a postage \n     stamp commemorating the members of the Armed Forces who have \n     been awarded the Purple Heart; and\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend \n     to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued not \n     later than 1 year after the adoption of this resolution.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President. I rise today to submit a concurrent \nresolution to express the sense of Congress that a commemorative \npostage stamp should be issued by the United States Postal Service \nhonoring the members of the Armed Forces that have been awarded the \nPurple Heart.\n  The Purple Heart, our nation's oldest military decoration, was \noriginated by General George Washington in 1782 to recognize \n``instances of unusual gallantry.'' Referred to then as the Badge of \nMilitary Merit, the decoration was awarded only three times during the \nRevolutionary War.\n  Following the war, the general order authorizing the ``Badge'' was \nmisfiled for over 150 years until the War Department reactivated the \ndecoration in 1932. The Army's then Adjutant General, Douglas \nMacArthur, succeeded in having the medal re-instituted in its modern \nform--to recognize the sacrifice our service members make when they go \ninto harm's way.\n  Both literally and figuratively, the Purple Heart is the world's most \ncostly decoration. However, the 19 separate steps necessary to make the \nmedal pale in comparison to the actions and heroics that so often lead \nto its award. The Department of Defense does not track the number of \nPurple Hearts awarded, but we do know that just over 500,000 of the \nveterans and military personnel that have received the medal are still \nliving. And we also know that every single recipient served this \ncountry in one form or another; a good number of the awardees even made \nthe ultimate sacrifice--giving their lives for the liberty and freedoms \nthat we all enjoy and often take for granted.\n  I am sure you will agree that these sacrifices deserve our respect \nand remembrance. This resolution, to express the sense of the Congress \nthat a postage stamp honoring Purple Heart recipients should be issued \nby the U.S. Postal Service, is a fitting place to start. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this effort to recognize those brave service \nmembers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/26/senate-section/article/S6930-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 813.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Human Germline Gene \n     Modification Prohibition Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC.   02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Human Germline gene modification is not needed to save \n     lives, or alleviate suffering, of existing people. Its target \n     population is ``prospective people'' who have not been \n     conceived.\n       (2) The cultural impact of treating humans as biologically \n     perfectible artifacts would be entirely negative. People who \n     fall short of some technically achievable ideal would be seen \n     as ``damaged goods'', while the standards for what is \n     genetically desirable will be those of the society's \n     economically and politically dominant groups. This will only \n     increase prejudices and discrimination in a society where too \n     many such prejudices already exist.\n       (3) There is no way to be accountable to those in future \n     generations who are harmed or stigmatized by wrongful or \n     unsuccessful human germline modifications of themselves or \n     their ancestors.\n       (4) The negative effects of human germline manipulation \n     would not be fully known for generations, if ever, meaning \n     that countless people will have been exposed to harm probably \n     often fatal as the result of only a few instances of germline \n     manipulations.\n       (5) All people have the right to have been conceived, \n     gestated, and born without genetic manipulation.\n\n     SEC.   03. PROHIBITION ON HUMAN GERMLINE GENE MODIFICATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting after chapter 15, the following:\n\n                ``CHAPTER 16--GERMLINE GENE MODIFICATION\n\n``Sec.\n``301.

Definitions\n\n       ``In this chapter:\n       (1) Human germline gene modification.--The term `human \n     germline gene modification' means the introduction of DNA \n     into any human cell (including human eggs, sperm, fertilized \n     eggs, (ie. embryos, or any early cells that will \n     differentiate into gametes or can be manipulated to do so) \n     that can result in a change which can be passed on to future \n     individuals, including DNA from any source, and in any form, \n     such as nuclei, chromosomes, nuclear, mitochondrial, and \n     synthetic DNA. The term does not include any modification of \n     cells that are not a part\n\n[[Page S6931]]\n\n     of or are not used to construct human embryos.\n       ``(2) Human haploid cell.--The term `haploid cell' means a \n     cell that contains only a single copy of each of the human \n     chromosomes, such as eggs, sperm, and their precursors; the \n     haploid number in a human cell is 23.\n       ``(3) Somatic cell.--The term `somatic cell' means a \n     diploid cell (having two sets of the chromosomes of almost \n     all body cells) obtained or derived from a living or deceased \n     human body at any stage of development; its diploid number is \n     46. Somatic cells are diploid cells that are not precursors \n     of either eggs or sperm. A genetic modification of somatic \n     cells is therefore not germline genetic modification.\n\n     ``Sec. 302.
