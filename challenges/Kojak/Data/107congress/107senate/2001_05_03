Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. 1 which the clerk will \nreport by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1) to extend programs and activities under the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Lo and behold, I believe we are actually ready to go to an \neducation bill after talking about it for months and working actively \non it for days. We are ready to proceed. I am pleased with that. I \ncommend all those Members involved in trying to make it work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the reporting of the \nsubstitute amendment, the time between now until 12 noon be equally \ndivided for debate between the chairman and the ranking member.\n  I also ask consent that prior to 12 noon and with the consent of both \nmanagers, Senator Collins may be recognized to offer an amendment \nregarding reading, and following that debate, the amendment be laid \naside with a vote to occur at 4 p.m. today.\n  I further ask consent that Senator Kennedy or his designee--and I \nunderstand that may be Senator Harkin--be recognized immediately \nfollowing the reporting of the Collins amendment to offer a first-\ndegree amendment; further, that the votes on or in relation to the \namendments occur in a stacked sequence at 4 p.m. Also, I ask that no \namendments referenced in this agreement be subject to second-degree \namendments, and, further, all debate time prior to the 4 o'clock vote \nbe equally divided in the usual form.\n\n[[Page S4188]]\n\n  I further ask consent that at 12 noon, notwithstanding receipt of the \nconference report, the Senate begin debate on the conference report \naccompanying H. Con. Res. 83, and the time under the provisions of the \nBudget Act begin accordingly. Finally, I ask consent if time remains \nunder the Budget Act following the 4 p.m. vote, the Senate resume \nconsideration of the conference report to accompany the budget \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I ask that the distinguished \nmajority leader delete the last paragraph. We understand the intent of \nthe leader. We are in agreement with the intent of the leader. We \nsimply don't have the report yet. A couple members want to look at it. \nThere will be no problem in doing that at a subsequent time.\n  I also say to the leader, in consultation with Senator Kennedy, we \nwould like also at an appropriate time to lock in the next two \namendments so we can move this legislation. We are very anxious to move \nforward with this legislation. We would ask that we, in fact, do that, \nlock in the amendment that will be offered by the distinguished manager \nof the bill, the Senator from Vermont, and that on our side, the next \namendment will be that offered by Senator Dodd and Senator Collins.\n  Mr. LOTT. Are you asking that we make that change at this point?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, several suggestions were made. I will \nrespond and accept most of the suggestions.\n  First of all, I had hoped to go ahead and get started on the budget \nconference report. It is very important, very urgent. We need to get \nthat completed. I understand Senators need to actually see the report. \nIt should be available within the hour. We are trying to get that to \nyou, as we speak. I hope we can come back then and get an agreement \nlater to go ahead and go to the conference report. However, following \nyour suggestion, I modify my unanimous consent to delete the \nlast paragraph.\n\n  Now, I do think it is also important to note that this agreement does \nnot lock in a vote on the Jeffords substitute. We have it. Senators \nwill have the next couple of hours to go through it. I hope we can \nenter an agreement in a reasonable period of time so we have the vote \non the Jeffords-Kennedy substitute at 4 p.m., also. We are not \nincluding that in the request.\n  In view of that, I don't think we should go ahead and lock in the \nnext two amendments at this time. Let's go ahead and get started on the \nagreement we have, get the debate on the Collins amendment and the \nKennedy amendment, or his designee, and then in the next sequence we \ncan get an agreement on the budget conference report, the vote on the \nsubstitute, and line up the next two amendments. I need to check with \nsome of our people to make sure these are the next two amendments we \nwant to consider. This is a step forward to get the process started.\n  I renew my unanimous consent request to include the first three \nparagraphs as read and delete the last one.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object--and I will not object--as \nfar as our side goes, we know it will be the Dodd amendment. Could we \nleave the discretion to your side as to what amendment you offer, but \ncould we at least have it in the consent agreement that the next \namendment from our side would be the Dodd amendment?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is up to that side as to what would be \nthe next amendment. I don't want to lock it in at this point because we \nneed to lock in both amendments. I think we are getting started here, \neverybody is trying to be cooperative, but we need to get the vote on \nthe substitute, then lock in the next two amendments and get an \nagreement on the conference report. I would rather not lock them in.\n  As far as that goes, if they are prepared, the next amendment would \nbe the Dodd amendment. We don't dictate that at all.\n  Mr. REID. We would accept that. If I could ask the Senator from \nMassachusetts to yield, that would be fine with us. We do want the Dodd \namendment to be our next amendment, in keeping with the agreement \nearlier in the day. It would be our second amendment. Whatever you want \ncould be your second amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. The Dodd-Collins.\n  Mr. LOTT. We will check on that, and hopefully well before noon we \ncan go ahead and lock in this next series of votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] offers an amendment \n     numbered 358.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this morning the Senate begins in \nearnest the consideration of S. 1, the Better Education for Students \nand Teachers Act.\n  I think it is fair to say that this is the most dramatic reform of \nFederal elementary and secondary education law since the enactment of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1965.\n  The only reason we are on the threshold of such change is that a \nremarkable consensus has developed over the past few years with regard \nto Federal education policy. Senators from both parties and across the \nentire spectrum of political views have come to the realization that if \nwe want to achieve real progress in our schools, we have to measure the \nprogress.\n  This is easier said than done, of course. Schools are not producing \nuniform widgets, but educating children. Children come into the public \neducation system with very different backgrounds and experiences. This \nresults in students performing at different achievement levels. \nHowever, as the leading States have found, after a lot of time and hard \nwork, you can assess students and use the results to constantly improve \nthe education that you provide them.\n  At the same time, if we are going to place high demands on our \nschools and teachers and students, we must give them the tools they \nneed to do the best job possible. That means extra help for schools \nthat are struggling, high quality professional development for \nteachers, and choices for students in schools that persistently fail.\n  In early March, the HELP Committee reported the BEST Act by a \nunanimous vote 20-0 vote. The bill before us reflects the work of every \nmember of the committee. Each one has contributed in significant ways \nto improving this bill and education in our country.\n  Since the bill emerged from the committee, we and our staffs have \nbeen meeting with Senators on and off the committee to reach agreements \non further improvement to the legislation.\n  The substitute I am offering this morning reflects the results of our \ndiscussions over the past few weeks, incorporating the suggestions of a \ndozen Senators and contributions by the White House throughout the \nprocess.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, let me touch on a few of the \nchanges we are making in the substitute:\n  The first is accountability. At the heart of accountability is \nadequate yearly progress. Adequate yearly progress ensures that all \nstudents of each subgroup will make adequate yearly progress towards \nproficiency in reading and math over the next 10 years. The other key \ncomponent of accountability, is providing mechanisms for schools to \nimprove. S. 1, as amended, lays out a series of increasingly strong \ncorrective actions that impact schools, local educational agencies and \nStates that fail to meet the goals for adequate yearly progress.\n  I look forward to the debate and I especially look forward to passing \na bill that will enable every child in this nation to have a first rate \neducation.\n  Let me go to some other aspects of it.\n  The next one is supplemental services, a term you will hear over and \nover again. This is a new option for parents of children in \npersistently failing\n\n[[Page S4189]]\n\nschools. Supplemental services are educational services offered by \npublic or private organizations outside the regular school day that are \ndirected at providing such children with the knowledge and skills they \nneed to meet the State standards.\n  Another term you will hear is Straight A's. Up to 7 States and 25 \nlocal educational agencies will be allowed to enter into performance \nagreements with the Secretary of Education that will trade increased \nflexibility for strong accountability.\n  Regarding bilingual education, the amendment before us establishes a \ntrigger for converting the Bilingual Education Act from a set of \nfederally run programs into a single, State grant program focused on \nhelping all limited English proficient students attain fluency in \nEnglish and master the academic content.\n  For testing, S. 1, as amended, authorizes $400 million a year over \nthe life of the bill to pay for the cost of developing and implementing \nthe new assessments required by the bill.\n  I look forward to this debate and passing a bill that will give every \nchild a first-rate education.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the fact that we can finally \nturn to our work on reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, and during the course of the morning will begin debating \ntwo very important amendments. The first concerns the reading \nprovisions of this legislation, which I think are such a commendable \npart of our whole effort, and the second, on which Senator Harkin and \nSenator Hagel have worked very closely to craft, regarding the \nchallenges for our special needs children and local communities. The \nHarkin-Hagel amendment aims to strengthen the Individuals with \nDisabilities Act, particularly in providing additional relief in \nfunding. In many respects the reading and IDEA amendments address a \ncommon concern, since many children with special needs are also \neligible for the reading programs and title I assistance.\n  Now I will take just a few moments just to review some of the \nprovisions that I think should give heart to many parents when this \nlegislation is actually implemented, and that is the supplementary \nservices under title I, which increase the help available to children \nin troubled schools.\n  Students in schools that have failed for at least 3 consecutive years \nwill have the opportunity to receive the supplementary tutoring \nservices during non-school hours. Students in failing schools get extra \nacademic help after school while schools implement new reforms during \nthe day.\n  Under the supplementary service provisions, parents of children in \npersistently failing schools--those in corrective action or \nreconstitution--will have the option to enroll their children in \nbefore-school, after-school, weekend, or summer tutoring programs.\n  The compromise extends learning time for students most in need of \nadditional help. And the students in failing schools participate in a \nrevamped, full regular school program during the day and receive \nadditional help outside the school day.\n  The public funds remain in the control of the public schools. The \nsupplementary services provision does not provide vouchers for private \nschool tuition.\n  In contracting services, the school district pays State-approved \nproviders for tutoring services. So any of the agencies that are going \nto be permitted to provide those services are effectively going to have \nto have a certification in terms of their educational competence. That \nis enormously important and basic.\n  Parents then choose a provider for their children from a State-\napproved list of providers. The parents then will be able to make the \njudgment about which provider they want to choose in order to get the \nsupplementary services for their children. And with the information \nthat is available--with report cards and other information--it is the \nhope and the expectation that the parents will be able to choose \nwisely. It will give them an additional kind of involvement in their \nchildren's educational development. It is a small part of this \nlegislation, but as we have been talking about parental involvement in \nthese general discussions, this is the kind of effort that we were \ntalking about.\n  There is a cap on Federal funds available for supplemental services. \nDistricts can use no more than 15 percent of the title I funds, and are \nnot required to spend more than an equal amount to 15 percent of their \ntitle I allocation.\n  In addition, in order to provide tutoring services, the district \ncannot reduce the amount a failing school receives under title I by \nmore than 15 percent. They can draw down so they can use their own \nmoney, or they can use the supplementary services money that is \navailable at the State, or they can use funds under the Title V(4) \nprogram for which they will be eligible. That is our clear intention, \nthat those funds will be available. We will make that clear as we move \nthrough the debate as well as in the legislative history.\n  Currently, many title I school districts contract with outside \ntutoring providers. The supplementary service provision differs from \ncurrent law in that it requires failing schools to make after-school \ntutoring programs available. That is a requirement, not an option. It \nis a requirement. I think that gives additional kinds of protections to \nthe parents.\n  The tutoring programs must be research-based and of demonstrated \neffectiveness. Only tutoring providers who are pre-screened for quality \nby States are eligible to receive the Federal funds.\n\n  Providers that fail to maintain a high quality of services and meet \ntheir annual performance goals will be removed from the State list of \neligible supplemental tutoring providers. And tutoring services must be \nfocused on academics and tied to the State standards and assessments.\n  The tutoring program ensures strong parental involvement. The parents \nand districts jointly develop specific performance goals for \nparticipating children and come to agreement on how individual student \nprogress will be measured. So parents and districts jointly determine \nhow parents will be informed of their child's progress. There will be \ninformation given to the parents and the schools so that they can \nmonitor where these children have additional needs.\n  Providers must give the parents the comparative information about the \nquality of the tutoring programs available.\n  I want to give just a brief summation on what we call the Straight \nA's compromise.\n  The performance agreements pilot provides seven States and 25 \ndistricts additional flexibility in how communities use funds to \nimplement public school reform. Funds can only be used for activities \nauthorized under the programs that are eligible to be consolidated. \nFunds must be focused on public school reform. No funds may be used to \nsupport private school vouchers. States and districts are required to \nensure the equitable participation of low-income students in private \nschools according to the requirements of the underlying bill. The \nperformance agreements pilot continues the national focus on students \nwith special needs. Migrant, homeless, immigrant, Indian education, and \nneglected or delinquent programs addressing students with special needs \ncannot be consolidated under the Performance Agreements Pilot Program.\n  In addition, the new Reading First Program cannot be consolidated.\n  The performance agreements pilot maintains targeting of Federal funds \nto the neediest students.\n  I hope our Members will pay attention to this. The title I funds \ncontinue to be targeted by poverty to the school level, maintaining the \nallocation formula in the underlying law. If a State wants to use an \nalternative formula, the formula must result in a greater percentage of \nthe funds going to districts with the highest concentration of low-\nincome children than under the current title I formula. It is a strong \ncommitment that the funds go to the neediest children.\n\n[[Page S4190]]\n\n  Other nontitle I funds allocated under the performance agreements \npilot might be targeted to the district based on the same proportion of \npoverty as the underlying law requires. If the State uses an \nalternative formula, districts with the highest concentrations of low-\nincome children must receive more funds than they would have received \nwithout consolidation.\n  So our pilot program assures that the funds, rather than being \nscattered across a particular State or a jurisdiction, will effectively \nbe focused on the children with the greatest needs. That is not all.\n  The States and districts must comply with the title I provisions that \nrequire the development and implementation of standards and \nassessments: accountability for failing schools, disaggregation of \nassessment data, parent involvement, and the release of report cards at \nthe State, local, and school level. So what we are giving is the \nassurance that there will be very strong and important accountability \nfor these programs as well which effectively had not been in existence \nin the past. I think that is an improvement.\n\n  States may not consolidate title I funds set aside for failing \nschools. States must ensure that failing schools get the extra help \nthey need to turn around by improving student achievement.\n  States and districts must also meet all the accountability provisions \nrelating to teacher quality and improving achievement for limited \nEnglish proficiency in title II and title III of the underlying bill.\n  States and districts must abide by title I provisions that require \nadequate yearly progress, school improvement, and corrective action. If \nachievement does not improve any performance agreement will be \nterminated. So there will be a termination of these agreements if we \nfind out there are not positive results with very strong \naccountability. I think that is enormously reassuring.\n  The States may only retain 1 percent of all consolidated funds for \nadministration. They may retain up to 5 percent of title I funds and up \nto 10 percent of nontitle I funds for State activities. All other funds \nmust flow directly to the local school districts.\n  Applications by the States and districts are subject to peer review. \nThe Secretary may only approve an application if it shows substantial \npromise for exceeding the State's AYP goals.\n  So you are going to have a peer review of the State's applications \nand findings. It will not be just at the discretion of the Secretary. I \nthink that is an enormous improvement.\n  The proposal requires a study of the effectiveness of the agreements, \nhow funds were used, and how funds were targeted under alternative \nformulas. We will gain a great deal of information.\n  Mr. President, since the Senate is poised to begin debate on the \nbudget in the very near future, I want to take just a few moments to \ndiscuss the funding that will be needed to make the policies in this \nbill realities for America's children.\n  If you don't have a well-trained teacher in a classroom, whatever we \ndo is compromised. Teachers need, and students deserve, the resources \nto teach. That is fundamental.\n  Republicans announced yesterday that they reached a deal among \nthemselves on the budget, and the result appears to leave education out \nin the cold. They know the Nation overwhelmingly supports real \nincreases for education, yet they boldly chose tax cuts over educating \nthe Nation's children.\n  Senators will recall that there were two points to the vote on the \neducation amendment offered by Senator Harkin. The first was to reduce \nthe size of the tax cut much closer to $1.2 trillion than $1.6 \ntrillion, and the conference has respected this decision, choosing the \nsmaller number. But the Harkin amendment had a second and equally \nimportant objective. It recognized that additional investments were \nurgently needed in our schools. All available evidence confirms this.\n  Only half of the eligible children have access to Head Start and its \npromise of school readiness for 3- and 4-year-olds. Only a third of the \nstudents in disadvantaged school districts are assisted with the broad \nrange of quality enhancements that I have discussed under title I. The \nFederal Government is meeting well under half of its funding commitment \nto disabled students under IDEA, nearly 1 in 5 children are in \noversized classes of 25 or more, and thousands of school buildings \nremain in such disrepair that they are unsafe or unfit for learning.\n  The basic improvements we're debating in this bill today will be \nimpossible without additional investments in low-income school \ndistricts, teacher quality, early learning, smaller class sizes, \nspecial education, school construction, and accountability.\n  Yet the conference report on the budget appears as if it will ignore \nthe will of the Senate on the core issue of education. In place of the \nmajor increases passed by the Senate, the budget proposes to freeze \neducation funding at current levels. Because it abandons American \nschool children and their parents, it does not deserve our support. I \nurge every one of my colleagues who recognizes the value of improved \neducation for the long-term future of the Nation to denounce the budget \nthat the conferees have produced, and ask them to try again.\n  Our current budget surplus means for once we have the resources \nneeded to make major education advances in the coming years. We only \nlack the commitment to put our money where our mouths are. Will we step \nup to the plate on this issue, or will we just have more talk?\n  Republican budget negotiators found room for 1.35 trillion dollars in \ntax cuts over eleven years, yet they decline to guarantee that 0.008 \ntrillion dollars (or $8 billion) will be available next year to fund \nthe education increases that passed the Senate last month in Senator \nHarkin's amendment. Their priorities are clear, and education is not \namong them, no matter what they say about education here on the floor.\n  The Nation can afford both tax cuts for everyone and real education \nimprovements. But we can't afford education reform and the massive tax \ncuts for the wealthy that Republicans seek. The tax cut that budget \nnegotiators appear set to adopt would allocate over $400 billion of the \ncurrent budget surplus to the wealthiest 1% of Americans--those with \naverage incomes of 1.1 million dollars per year--yet it provides only \nabout 21 billion dollars to improve education over the next ten years.\n  Last month, Senator Harkin won a Senate vote to shift $250 billion \nfrom tax cuts to education investments, still leaving over a trillion \ndollars on the table for tax cuts. Senator Harkin's effort put the \nSenate firmly on record in support of education investments over the \nmost extravagant of the tax cuts.\n  Republicans shut Democrats out of the conference on the budget, and \nthen apparently disregarded the Harkin education amendment. They \nincreased the size of the tax cut over the Senate level, and they \nvastly decreased education spending below the Senate level. The \nunfortunate result that Republicans now call a ``compromise'' is a \ncompromise only in the sense that it compromises the futures of \nAmerica's school children.\n  The Republican decision to ignore the Harkin amendment will have very \nreal and immediate consequences for America's school children and their \nparents:\n  350,000 fewer students in disadvantaged school districts aided under \ntitle I;\n  115,000 fewer safe, educational after-school opportunities for youth;\n  100,000 fewer teachers improved through access to training and \nmentoring;\n  50,000 fewer children in Head Start;\n  16,000 fewer teachers to reduce class sizes in the critical earlier \nschool years;\n  100 fewer crumbling and unsafe schools repaired; and\n  continued delinquency on the Federal Government's promise to help \nchildren with disabilities access a quality education under IDEA.\n  These are just the consequences for the next school year. Over the \nnext decade, the consequences of ignoring the vote on Senator Harkin's \neducation amendment will guarantee that we will fall further and \nfurther behind on the work before us, including:\n  19,000,000 fewer title I-aided classroom slots that dramatically \nimprove the quality of education available to students in disadvantaged \ndistricts;\n  7,000,000 fewer safe and educational after-school opportunities for \nyouth;\n\n[[Page S4191]]\n\n  2,750,000 fewer children in Head Start;\n  2,000,000 fewer opportunities for teachers to build skills by \ntraining and mentioning;\n  50,000 fewer teachers every year reducing class sizes in the critical \nearly grades; and\n  2,000 fewer crumbling and unsafe schools repaired.\n  Many of us on the Democratic side of the aisle point out that if we \ncan't or won't do the work before us in one year, we must at least make \na commitment to finish the work in a specific number of years. The key \nexample is our goal of full funding for title I within the next 4 \nyears.\n  The Republican response on this point is noteworthy. They say it's \nimpossible to commit to funding levels for specific education programs \nin any year except next year. But that's clearly not their position on \ntaxes. They're proud to say just how much they'll cut inheritance taxes \nfor the wealthiest 1% every year, all the way to 2011.\n  The policy changes that we enact during this ESEA reauthorization \ndebate will make no practical difference for children if massive tax \ncuts leave nothing but crumbs for education.\n  The bottom line for the budget now nearing completion is that it \nsquanders an historic opportunity to improve America's education system \nin favor of tax breaks that only the wealthy will ever notice. It is a \ndisgrace, and it reduces all of the education speeches we've heard from \nour Republican friends to empty platitudes. I will vote against this \nanti-education budget and I urge my colleagues to reject it as well.\n\n  If the budget we will be debating in just a few hours had not \neliminated the Harkin amendment, the children of the country would have \nreceived a major boost. You cannot educate children on the cheap. You \ncan't do it with a tin cup budget. We know what works and what doesn't.\n  The education proposal we are endorsing today is a framework, but \nwithout resources, it will not be successful. If you just have \nresources without reform, you jeopardize success. But if you have \nreform, given the current unmet needs, you guarantee failure. What we \nare challenging this President and this administration to do is to \nprovide the necessary resources.\n  This Senate went on record in a bipartisan way to say: These are the \ntypes of resources we believe are necessary for the children of this \ncountry over the next 10 years. The Budget Committee eliminated those. \nIt was wrong. We want the President to speak up. We want him to say, at \nleast in the area of Elementary and Secondary Education, and in \nparticular in title I, we want to have the funding that is necessary to \nsupport the policies that we both agreed to place in this legislation, \nso that the benefit of the supplementary services and other protections \nwill be available to these children. Otherwise, the words about \nreaching every child in this country within 10 years is a cliche. It is \na shibboleth.\n  That will be the crux of the debate over the next 2 weeks in the \nSenate. We will be debating issues of policy, but make no mistake about \nit, we will be debating the issue of need, of investment, of the type \nof future we are going to have in this country. That is what this is \nall about. Our children are the future. We know the results. If you \nhave children who don't learn algebra by the eighth grade, they're much \nless likely to go to college. That is a fact. Any educator will tell us \nthat.\n  When 80 percent of eighth graders lack trained math teachers, we can \nsee what is compromised in terms of the children of this country. At a \ntime when we need their talents, their involvement, and their help in \nleading the United States in the world community, we fail to provide \nthem the resources they need to build a strong educational foundation. \nThat is what this debate over funding is about. It is about our future.\n  We know what is out there. Twenty percent of the children in the \nUnited States live in poverty; 10 million children are eligible for \ntitle I services. We are only reaching a third of them. So if we are \ngoing to give life and meaning to ``leave no child behind,'' we ought \nto be out front finding ways to reach all of them, not skimping on the \n10 million children who are eligible under this legislation, and who \nlook to us for help.\n  We on this side of the aisle, without exception, believe we ought to \nfund the title I program fully and reach all 10 million children. We \nchallenge our fellow Senators on the other side of the aisle to join \nwith us and ensure that the promise and the pledge of this legislation \nwill be a reality, not empty words. The only way this is going to \nhappen is through a serious commitment to funding.\n  Nothing concerns me more than the reported absence of the Harkin \namendment from the final budget agreement. I don't know where it went. \nI can remember--maybe others can speak to it--when we were briefed by \nour Democratic budgeteers about how the budget conference came \ntogether. They were not allowed to take part in any of the \ndecisionmaking process. I asked them: Whatever happened to the Harkin \namendment? They said: You have to look through the numbers and try to \nfind it, but Republicans haven't released the numbers yet. We went over \nand talked to the staff.\n\n  Whatever happened to the Harkin amendment? We still want to know. \nWhen Senators are explaining the budget this afternoon, I hope they \nwill tell us what happened to it because you can't find it. It is not \nthere. It is not here; it is not there. It has just disappeared.\n  The need has not disappeared. The need for those Head Start Programs \nhas not disappeared. The need for the supplementary services on title I \nhas not disappeared. The need to do something about better trained \nteachers and assisting professional development remains today as it \nexisted on the day the Senate passed the Harkin amendment. Those \nschools that are crumbling; they haven't disappeared. The vote on \nSenator Harkin's amendment, and the significance of the vote, after a \nvery full and complete debate, has not disappeared. It is still there \nin the history books.\n  What has disappeared somewhere is the commitment of the Congress to \ntake action and reflect our Nation's priorities in the budget. We're \nfortunate to have the resources to say, ``All right, we are going to \nhave a tax cut, but we are not going to do it at the expense of the \nchildren of this country.'' But that is what evidently has happened. \nThat is the regrettable choice made by the GOP.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I certainly withhold.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we generally try to follow a format \nhere, where the Members file their amendments, and then those who were \nthe principal sponsors speak to them, and those others who are in \nsupport or in opposition get an opportunity to address it. I welcome \nthe opportunity to do so.\n\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I understand a number of colleagues are \non their way to the floor to lay down amendments. However, I thought \nthis might be a chance to speak for a short period of time about the \nsubstitute amendment that was laid down by Senator Jeffords but is the \nresult of negotiations among a number of Members of this body and the \nadministration that is presently under consideration.\n  As we consider the substitute, first of all, I give credit where \ncredit is due. First, I will give credit where it is due to my \ncolleagues from both parties and then raise questions about the result \nof these negotiations that we will consider in this substitute.\n  I say to Senator Kennedy, in particular, how aware I am of the \nyeoman's work that he and his staff have done to modify some of the \nmost troubling aspects of the issues that were under consideration, \nespecially the block-grant proposal that has been known as Straight \nA's. And, I know\n\n[[Page S4192]]\n\nthat Senator Jeffords and his staff have worked hard over the last few \nweeks as well. Other Senators have been part of those tough \nnegotiations as well and, in particular, I commend those Senators who \nworked to remove some of the most troubling aspects of the parts of \nthis amendment that were up for discussion.\n  This morning I just want to discuss two parts of the substitute \namendment: the so-called Straight A's proposal and the proposal to \nallow some Title I dollars to be used for supplemental services such as \ntutoring.\n  Straight A's is going in the direction of block-granted education \nmoney to up to seven states and 25 districts. I do recognize that a \nnumber of important programs, for example, the migrant program, \nhomeless, immigrant, Indian education, neglected or delinquent children \nprograms, the programs focused on students with special needs, will not \nbe consolidated. This is important and I thank my colleagues for their \nyeoman's work in protecting these crucial programs from consolidation. \nThis is important because we made a national commitment that those \nstudents coming from families and communities which are most \nvulnerable--take, for example, homeless children or the migrant farmer \nworker population. We said we would not all of a sudden leave to State \nand local communities whether or not they make a commitment in these \nareas. So, again, I thank my colleagues for the work they have done to \nmake sure that we continue with these commitments. I also appreciate \nthat, while title I is consolidated in those states and local districts \nthat are granted these performance agreements, tough negotiations have \nassured that these programs will remain targeted to the poorest \nchildren.\n  On the other hand, there are other additional programs, including \nafterschool programs and teacher quality that are block-granted here. \nMy own view is we are going down a dangerous path. We have moved away \nfrom an important commitment. The commitment we have made is we are a \nnational community, we are one Nation, and there are certain decisive \npriorities we have. Two of these are additional help for kids for \nafterschool programs and a national commitment to teacher training. I \nthink this is a slippery slope. It is a huge mistake to move away from \na national commitment to these priorities. I come to the floor to say \nthis part of the agreement is not a step forward. I have some deep \nconcerns about this move.\n\n  I know people negotiated in good faith and, as I have said, this part \nof the agreement is much better than any Straight A's proposal that \nwe've seen in the past. One thing I appreciate is that if local school \ndistricts can make the case vis-a-vis a statewide education agency that \nhas been named a block grant recipient that, as a local district, they \ndo not want to be part of the block grant, and if they want to continue \nto receive money for these important national programs, they can do so. \nHowever, I also understand that the State agency will ultimately be an \nimportant player in the decision about whether a local district can opt \nout.\n  As a former community organizer, when I think of grassroots politics \nin any State in the country, I don't think the grassroots level stops \nat the Governor's level. I don't think the grassroots is the Governors, \nI don't think the grassroots are Senators and representatives, I don't \nthink they are statewide education agencies. The grassroots are at the \nlocal level.\n  There are decisive priorities for our Nation, no matter where a child \ngoes to school, no matter where a teacher teaches. However, I far \nprefer that the designing and implementation and creativity is done at \nthe local level. So, this Straight A's concept fails both in \nrecognizing the national commitments and fails in encouraging truly \ngrassroots efforts in creative implementation. The state level is not \nthe place for the decisions about these issues to be made. So, this \nblock-grant proposal is my first concern with the agreement.\n  My second concern is that in consistently failing schools, up to 15 \npercent of the title I program dollars may be given to the parents of \nchildren in those schools for supplemental services such as tutoring. \nNow, this basic concept of providing parents with funds to pay for \nsupplemental services is not one that I fundamentally object to. \nBecause it promotes those students finding success in public schools, \nit is significantly different from a vouchers plan in which we promote \nstudents leaving public schools. And, once again, I recognize that my \nDemocratic colleagues and their staffs involved in the negotiations did \ngood work to build in a number of safeguards into this program. \nHowever, despite my basic support for the concept, I do have problems \nwith this particular scheme for providing supplemental services.\n  My main point is that I don't really understand why we are going to \ntake some money out of the title I program, which is already severely \nunderfunded at the 30 percent level, to provide additional help for \nkids in other settings, vis-a-vis tutoring done somewhere else, even \noutside the public school system.\n  This perhaps is where I register my strongest dissent from the \ndirection we are going at the moment. We don't yet have a final \nagreement on whether or not there is going to be a real investment of \nresources to back this bill up. As a result, we now find ourselves \ngetting into a situation where we are actually going to be taking money \naway from the title I program, which is the program that is there for \ndisadvantaged children. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. \nThere are other more specific concerns that I have with this proposal \nas well, but it is the taking funds out of disadvantaged schools when \nwe should be focused investing more in these schools that is my \nfundamental problem here.\n  Finally, there are some important civil rights issues and questions \nthat have been raised with the supplemental services program and with \nthe afterschool program as it has been revised in this agreement. They \nboth allow public funds to ultimately go to religious providers of \nthese services. I am someone who has supported that basic idea that \nreligious groups can play a key role in helping to solve social ills. \nAnd, I have seen the ways in which the religious communities can make a \nlot of very good things happen. But if we are going to put money in \nthis direction, we ought to have some guarantee, some language, that \nsays clearly that there can't be proselytizing in any of these programs \nfunded by tax dollars. It is my understanding that such language is not \nin this agreement.\n  In addition, I certainly would not want any public dollars going to \nany religious organization without some type of guarantee that there \nwould not be any kind of discrimination against any group of citizens \nin their hiring practices.\n  I actually think the religious community in many ways has done superb \nwork. That is my view. That is what I voted for in the welfare bill. \nBut I would raise these questions about protecting children against \nbeing proselytized to and about being sure that public dollars do not \nfund discrimination.\n  So I thought, as long as we are just at the beginning, that I would \nthank my colleagues for the negotiation. I thank my colleague Senator \nKennedy in particular for really being so strong and making sure we \nmake migrant education and education for homeless children and others a \nnational priority. That makes the block-granting portion of this \nagreement much stronger. I argue about some of the other programs that \npotentially could be block-granted. In general this is not what I think \nwe should be doing. I think we are moving away from an important \nnational commitment. And, as I mentioned, I think in some ways it is \nnot decentralized enough. I think the statewide agencies will have too \nmuch control, versus the school districts, in the implementation of \nthese programs.\n  Those are my comments on the substitute. Of course, I have other \nconcerns about the base bill that really were not part of these \nnegotiations. I will have an amendment that says we can go forward with \nthis testing if in fact it is done the right way. So, I will ask you a \nnumber of amendments there. In addition to making sure we do testing \nthe right way, certainly we should have a trigger amendment in this \nbill that says, when it comes to title I money, we must live up to our \ncommitment so we make sure all these kids can do well before the actual \nimplementation of testing takes place. The outcome of the vote on that\n\n[[Page S4193]]\n\namendment will be extremely important to me.\n  I think what we have in this compromise is an example of where we can \ngo amiss if we are not careful. Taking money out of title I to give \nadditional funds to kids outside the title I program doesn't make much \nsense when you have such a severely underfunded program.\n  So, these are words of dissent based upon respect for what my \ncolleagues have tried to do. Later on, as we get into this amendment \nand into other amendments, I know any number of us, including Senator \nHarkin who will have an important amendment on the IDEA program, will \nhave a lot of amendments. I look forward to really being in the thick \nof this debate. I am hoping--maybe I will even use the word \n``praying''--that some of the amendments I have that I believe will \nprevent the abuse of testing, will prevent teachers having to teach to \na standardized test, will actually encourage teachers to go into \neducation as opposed to discouraging teachers from going into \neducation, especially amendments that say we trigger this when we make \nan amendment to title I, will be accepted. I hope that we do the \ntesting in the right way and that we make sure these children and these \nschools and these teachers have the resources to do well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I have been discouraged at times about \nour Nation's willingness to deal with our fundamental educational \nproblems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Excuse me, Senator.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield the Senator 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Parliamentary inquiry: Is this the time divided earlier \nuntil noon? Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Of that time, I only have 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield that time.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Will the Senator from Vermont yield 5 minutes?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We are waiting right now for the first amendment which \nis in order, so I cannot yield this time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I do not have any objection to waiting \nfor the Senator from New Jersey as long as I still have adequate time \nto offer my amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. All right, the Senator will have that time, and I do \nyield to the Senator an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from Maine, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, and the Senator from Vermont--indeed, the entire New \nEngland delegation--for helping me to make these remarks.\n  Mr. President, I have been discouraged at times about, not simply the \nissue of education in America but about the willingness in public \npolicy to deal with these fundamental problems. The fact that so many \nSenators have given so much time, commitment, and energy to dealing \nwith this problem is one of the most encouraging things I have seen in \nyears. Perhaps the Nation is getting ready, in a fundamental way, to \ndeal with our educational problems.\n  It is none too soon, perhaps, because we all recognize the same \nthing: America's educational problems point like a dagger at the heart \nof our national prosperity--indeed, one day even our national security. \nAmerica cannot long endure with this standard of living without dealing \nin a major way, on a grand scale, with our persistent, almost endemic \nproblems of education.\n  Indeed, there are a plethora of problems. Who would believe, under \nthese economic and budgetary circumstances, that a great nation would \nallow its future leaders, the engines of its future economy, to attend \nclasses in trailers, hallways, or gymnasiums? Mr. President, 2,400 \nschools need to be built in the next 2 years to relieve overcrowding \nand accommodate rising enrollments--2,400. In some communities with the \nproperty tax base, they may get built. In others where there is not, \nthey will not get built. Every lost school, every child who will not \nmeet his or her potential, is a social, economic, and even a political \nproblem.\n  Our teachers, no matter how dedicated they might be, wage a battle \nwith old textbooks and a dearth of modern technology. While we have \nmade the Internet available to the smallest business and every \ngovernment agency, only 27 percent of public school classrooms can even \ntake advantage of this new asset of technology for learning even if \nthey have a teacher who knows how to use it.\n\n  After years of study, we all understand that the problem of children \nunattended, without supervision in the afternoons is a principal reason \nfor poor grades, dropouts from school, alcohol and drug use, and lives \nof crime. Indeed, violent juvenile crime triples in the hours after \nschool.\n  Rising enrollments, inadequate school construction, inadequate \ntechnology, these are things that we have known and understood not for \na year, not for a few years, but for a generation. Yet today we meet \nagain to discuss these issues, recognizing that this afternoon 15 \nmillion children will arrive to empty homes or spend their afternoons \non the streets when, indeed, they could have had supervision and used \nthe time productively.\n  The question is not whether or not we are making insufficient \nprogress. I believe the question is whether we are making any progress \nat all. The National Assessment of Educational Progress showed no \nimprovement from 1992 to 2000 in fourth grade reading ability. Less \nthan a third of the country's fourth graders read at a grade level that \nis appropriate, and the gap in reading skills between the highest \nperformance level and that of our lowest performing students is \nwidening.\n  I will recognize that during this debate, Senators will come with \nideas from the left or the right. They will have radical solutions or \nmodest solutions.\n  This much I believe about this debate. I hope that no Senator will \ncome to this floor believing that anyone has a monopoly on good ideas, \nand that no one will come to this floor and defend the status quo \nbecause the status quo does not deserve defense.\n  The Bush administration enters into this debate and understandably \nwants to plant their own mark on educational reform. They have a right \nto do so. And, indeed, the administration's view is that accountability \nand improvement of standards in testing is part of educational reform, \nand that is correct.\n  All the money in the world will not improve American education and \naccountability. Reform of almost every aspect of American education is \nrequired. But as certainly as money is not the entire answer, it is \ncertainly part of the answer.\n  Nine thousand schools nationwide have been identified as needing \nimprovement. The number of low-performing schools is rising each year. \nAccountability of those schools will matter. It will shoulder the other \nproblems that I mentioned. Accountability will not solve leaking roofs. \nAccountability alone will not bring technology to classrooms. \nAccountability alone will not retain good teachers.\n  There is a marriage of ideas of the left and the right, Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  Other aspects of the administration's plan should be supported. I \nhave fought for years for educational savings accounts for K-12. It is \ntime to enact them. It makes sense to bring private resources in to \nhelp with this growing national problem.\n  Charter schools are a tested and sometimes workable addition to the \nproblems of public education. And they should be supported.\n  But as I reach across the aisle and commend the Bush administration \non its ideas, I hope this much will be granted: There is no alternative \nto a large-scale, immediate national program of building new schools \nfor America. One-third of America's public schools need major repairs \nor total replacement. There is a $322 billion backlog to build and \nmodernize America's schools. This requires Federal resources. Local \ncommunities should not face a choice of ruinous property taxes or \ndeclining opportunities for their own children. We are the difference.\n\n[[Page S4194]]\n\n  In New Jersey today we are beginning the Nation's largest school \nconstruction program with $8.6 billion for school construction. I am \nproud of it. It is needed. It is a good bipartisan plan, and it is \nimpressive, unless you consider the scale of the problem. We are \nspending $8.6 billion. But New Jersey alone has a $22 billion need for \nschool construction.\n  This year, my State saw the largest increase in enrollment in 20 \nyears. Our fastest growing school districts need a new school \nconstructed every 3 to 5 years.\n  That is why I am supporting the Harkin amendment to fund new school \nconstruction. As much as we need the Harkin amendment, we need to \ncontinue with our program of adding 100,000 new teachers.\n  I believe in time that the Clinton administration's greatest \nachievement, at least for my State of New Jersey and I believe for the \ncountry, may be the reducing of class size. Every study that has ever \nbeen conducted and every review that we have ever chartered has made \nclear that the greatest variable in the performance of a America's \nstudents is to reduce class size. And the goal of a national class size \nstandard of 18 by adding 100,000 teachers, of which 30,000 are now \nemployed, is the greatest variable and can make the greatest \ncontribution.\n\n  I believe this marriage of ideas from Democrats and Republicans can \nmake a real difference. I begin now by endorsing the Harkin amendment \nand by strongly supporting the continuation of our program of hiring \nnew teachers.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleagues for yielding the time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-five minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to the Senator from Maine 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n\n                 amendment no. 359 to amendment no. 358\n\n              (Purpose: To improve the Read First Program)\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk as a \nsubstitute to the amendment that is before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 359 to amendment No. 358.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, first let me start by commending the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Jeffords, and the ranking minority member, Senator \nKennedy, for their extraordinary work on this important legislation. \nThey have shown real leadership in pulling the Senate together on what \nI believe may well be the most important legislation we consider this \nyear; that is, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  My amendment would make a series of improvements to an extremely \nimportant component of the bill, and that is Reading First. I have \nworked with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle as well as with \nthe administration, the Secretary of Education, and the President to \nensure that both the Early Reading First and the Reading First \ninitiatives are truly focused on our goal of helping every child to \nlearn to read.\n  We can do so much more to ensure that every child learns to read. \nReading First is based on the principle that the best way to ensure \nthat no child is left behind is to teach every child to read.\n  Reading First encourages States and school districts to take a \npreventive role when dealing with reading programs.\n  It would provide assistance to States and school districts to \nestablish reading programs for students in grades kindergarten through \nthe third grade to better ground specifically based reading research in \norder to ensure that every student can read at or above grade level by \nthe end of the third grade.\n  It would provide assistance to States and school districts to better \nprepare our teachers who are on the front line and who are so important \nin this crusade.\n  It would give them professional development and other support so that \nteachers can identify specific reading barriers facing the students and \nhave the tools that they need to assist their students in learning to \nread.\n\n  Reading experts tell us that children learn to read in many different \nways. This isn't a case where one approach serves the needs of every \nstudent. Some students may need to put their fingers on their mouths \nwhen they say certain words to understand the sounds that make up those \nwords. Others may need to clap out the syllables to understand how \nwords are constructed.\n  These are examples of the kinds of teaching tools that Reading First \nwill promote and that will assist teachers in learning.\n  The program would also provide assistance to States and school \ndistricts in selecting and developing diagnostic reading assessments \nthat document whether children are learning and will also help us to \nassess the effectiveness of the Reading First Program.\n  Reading First would require us to make a real commitment. We should \nnot require students to fail before providing assistance. And, yet, \nthat is often what we do.\n  The most common intervention is placement in special education which \nfor most children is simply not a solution. Special education services \nare not designed to solve a children's reading disability, and for the \nmost part they do not. Our Early Literacy Program is well documented. \nApproximately 2.8 million students in the United States have been \nidentified as having a learning disability. Of those, 90 percent have \ntrouble reading. The good news is with proper, effective, and early \nintervention a learning disability can be treated, and children with \nreading disabilities can have the potential to achieve their full \npotential. The bad news is that most States do not now have the \nresources to establish the kinds of reading programs and early \ninterventions that are most effective.\n  Reading First would address this problem. It provides a national \nfocus on early reading intervention. It simply does not make sense to \nwait until the third grade to test a child's reading ability, find out \nthat that child's reading skills are far below his or her peers', and \nknow that the chance of that child learning to read by grade level by \nthe end of elementary school is less than 25 percent.\n  By contrast, if a child is tested and receives help in kindergarten \nor first grade, that child has a 90- to 95-percent chance of becoming a \ngood reader.\n  Since reading is researched more easily and effectively during the \nearly years, identifying children who have problems with reading and \nproviding them with the help they need early on is very effective.\n  Reading First is a comprehensive approach to promoting literacy in \nall 50 States. It will support the efforts of States such as Maine that \nhave already made great strides under the Reading Excellence Act in \npromoting reading and literacy.\n  The Reading First initiative would provide $1 billion per year--that \nis triple our current commitment--to States and school districts to \nestablish and enhance reading partnerships and to develop early \nliteracy professional development programs for teachers.\n  We know that other than involved parents, a good teacher, with proper \nliteracy training, is the single most important prerequisite to a \nstudent's reading success. We also know that reading is the gateway to \nlearning other subjects and to future academic achievement. That is why \nit is so important that this bill make such a national commitment to \nreading programs.\n  The amendment I have proposed improves upon the Reading First section \nof the bill in a number of ways.\n  First of all, it would improve the targeting of funds so that more \nwould be allocated to those local schools that have the most \nschoolchildren who are reading below grade level.\n  Second, it would clarify that each State's educational agency would \nbe responsible for administering the program.\n\n[[Page S4195]]\n\n  Third, it adds greater detail to the criteria that will be used to \naward competitive grants to States by specifying that a State must be \nable to demonstrate improved reading achievement in those schools that \nare receiving Reading First funds.\n  It would require the Secretary to minimize the amount of new \npaperwork for States that have already applied for and received a grant \nunder the current Reading Excellence Act.\n  It would increase accountability by requiring States and local school \ndistricts to demonstrate improved reading achievement in schools that \nare receiving Reading First funds.\n  And it would require that, in carrying out the evaluation of this \nprogram, the Secretary assess whether it is having an impact on the \nidentification and referral of young students to special education \nservices under IDEA.\n  Let me just elaborate on this latter point. I firmly believe if we \ninvest in early reading programs, and identify children who are having \ndifficulty in learning reading early on, that many of those children \nwill not need special education. The reason this is important is, once \na child becomes part of special education, the chances of that child \never leaving special education are less than 5 percent.\n  We know that if we intervene early, 90 to 95 percent of children with \nlearning disabilities can be helped. But if those children become part \nof the special education system, the chances of their leaving special \neducation are less than 5 percent.\n  This is an investment that makes sense.\n  President Bush deserves enormous credit for placing reading at the \ntop of our education agenda and for being willing to work with us--with \nMembers on both sides of the aisle--to hammer out the best possible \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Rhode Island wanted 5 minutes \nto comment on this legislation. My statement is quite lengthy. What I \nwould like to do is ask unanimous consent to be able to yield 5 minutes \nto the Senator from Rhode Island and then reclaim my time so that I can \ncomplete my statement, if that is acceptable to the managers of the \nbill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will keep control of time, but I am \npleased to do as my colleague wishes, and I yield 5 minutes to Senator \nReed.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the chairman very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for the \ngracious yielding of time and for offering her amendment. She has \noffered a very admirable and very important amendment that will \nincrease literacy in the United States. It tracks closely President \nBush's proposals for increased literacy throughout this country. In \nfact, it builds on the Reading Excellence Act which this body passed in \n1998. I believe it is a measure that should be broadly supported.\n  I, too, also commend Chairman Jeffords and Ranking Member Kennedy for \ntheir efforts in the committee to bring this measure to the Chamber \nand, again, Senator Collins for her excellent amendment with respect to \nliteracy in reading. I want to use this opportunity to not only commend \nSenator Collins but also to suggest that as important as her amendment \nis, there is a piece I believe that could be added to make it even \nbetter. That piece is providing access to materials in school \nlibraries.\n  For years I have been advocating a return to Federal support for \nschool libraries. Back in 1965, with the original Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, the Congress passed an initiative that would \nallow--and did allow--school libraries to purchase library materials. \nIt was widely successful. In fact, I will suggest that my colleagues go \nto any school in their State--particularly those schools in rural or \nurban areas--go to the school library and look through the shelves. I \nam sure you will find books that are stamped ``ESEA, 1965.'' You \ncertainly will find many books with a 1966, 1967, or 1968 copyright. \nSadly, that is the status of our collections in school libraries \nthroughout this country: Many old and out-of-date books purchased \noriginally by ESEA. We can do better and should do better.\n  The thrust of Senator Collins' amendment and the President's program \nis teacher technique, teaching pedagogy, and teaching instruction. But, \nas I said, there is another aspect; that is, having the materials \navailable for young people to actually read.\n  Research clearly shows that the modern up-to-date library with new \nmaterial contributes significantly and positively to student \nperformance. The research consistently shows this. It suggests that we \nhave to do much more in terms of not only providing new technique, new \ninstruction, new pedagogy, we have to provide books and media for \nchildren so they can, in fact, practice what they are taught, and not \nonly practice what they are taught but become enthused about using \nlibraries and reading books. You cannot do that with some of the out-\nof-date collections we have in our school libraries today.\n  That is why, as soon as it is appropriate, I will suggest an \nadditional amendment. I was tempted, momentarily, to offer a second \ndegree to the Collins amendment, but I believe she deserves the \nopportunity to make her case undiluted by other proposals.\n  My proposal would, in fact, increase funding authorized for the \nPresident's program of reading and literacy so school libraries \nthroughout the country could actually buy materials as part of the \nReading First initiative and target these funds to the schools that are \nmost in need, the highest poverty schools.\n  It would also provide districts and schools with the flexibility to \nuse funding to meet local needs. There would be no preset list of books \nor materials. It would be a very local choice which they could use \nthemselves to acquire what they need in their particular circumstances.\n  It would also encourage resource-sharing initiatives such as those \nthat have been established in Ohio and Rhode Island, effectively \nlinking all the school libraries together with public libraries and \nwith academic libraries in higher education institutions, so that \nchildren can access, through computerized records, a vast array of \nmaterial. This modern, updated approach can be another additional \nimprovement in education throughout the United States.\n  Also, it would provide resources and support to train school \nlibrarians and those people who work in the libraries. Sometimes we \noverlook the fact that we have to have trained professionals in the \nlibrary. It is not sufficient simply to have a teacher walk a class in \nand say, pick a book, children, and go out. It helps immeasurably if \nthere is someone in that library who knows not only how to do research \nbut also how to use library materials to enhance the education of all \nthe children in that school.\n  This legislation I am proposing is based upon a bill I introduced \nalong with Senators Cochran, Kennedy, Snowe, Chafee, Daschle, and \nothers. It has been modified because, rather than being a separate \nstand-alone portion of the ESEA, this amendment that I will propose \nnext week will be part of the President's initiative, part of the \nReading First initiative.\n  It makes sense simply because we are all trying to focus in our \nresources and our attention. In addition, it responds to some \ncomplaints I have heard that this is not the time to embark on a new \nprogram. Let me, as a fundamental point, state that this is not a new \nprogram when it comes to school library support. In 1965, it was \nspecifically authorized and funded under the original ESEA. In 1994, we \nreauthorized this particular library program. Unfortunately, it was \nessentially defunded in previous Congresses, and it was made part of a \nlarger block grant. As a result, the resources have diminished \nsignificantly.\n  I commend the Senator from Maine. I look forward to her amendment. I \nask her to consider, along with others, this improvement which I will \noffer at the soonest possible moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont controls the time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. In the spirit of working together, I know we will have\n\n[[Page S4196]]\n\nvotes on these amendments. One thing I do want to get a chance to do is \nexamine the substitute amendment. It is a huge package which just \narrived recently. Before we have a vote on it, I want to get a chance \nto look at it so I understand it, and I want to be in touch with people \nin my own State. I suggest that we not vote on the substitute amendment \nuntil after Senators have had a chance to look at it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We are allowing time for that purpose. We understand \nthe Senator's concerns, and they will be accommodated.\n  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is true that probably 5 or 7 percent \nof this has just been drafted, but 85 percent of it had been drafted \nand completed 4 days ago. The Senator is quite within his rights, but \njust for the membership, those on the committees who are interested, 85 \npercent of that has been in draft form. It is still a sizable amount.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I will.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Minnesota and others, we want \neveryone to understand the underlying substitute. They should have all \nthe time they need to do that. In the meantime, we are constructively \nmoving forward on the bill. The Senator from Maine has offered an \namendment. The Senator from Iowa is waiting. It is my understanding you \nhave another Senator to offer an amendment. We have Senator Dodd ready \nto offer an amendment. We should be able to move forward on these \namendments subject to the adoption of the substitute.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator. I agree with him. I yield to the \nSenator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, now that the ranking Democrat on the HELP \nCommittee has joined us, I once again repeat my praise of his efforts \nas well as those of the chairman of the committee. Senator Jeffords and \nSenator Kennedy have done incredible work in bringing us together on \nthis important issue, as has the Presiding Officer, the Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Frist. I thank them for their efforts on what I believe \nto be such an important initiative.\n  To reach our goal of helping all children, of ensuring that every \nchild knows how to read, the reading programs authorized by this bill \ndraw on 30 years of research on reading and reading instruction. These \nprograms will enhance our ability to help every child succeed. We know \nthat we have a lot of work to do.\n  By way of background, I will share with my colleagues some of the \ntroubling statistics about reading in this country: 20 million children \nare at risk for reading failure; 75 percent of children with reading \ndifficulties who are now helped by the time they reach the age of 9 \nwill still have poor reading skills at the end of high school. That is \nwhy early intervention is so important.\n  Eighty to 90 percent of children identified with learning \ndisabilities have their primary deficits in reading and language-based \nprocesses. We know that fewer than a third of our fourth graders can \nread at grade level. We know that the reading scores on the national \ntests for reading have been flat for 30 years, and the recent release \nof the NAEP scores for this year would continue this flat line.\n  We need to do things differently. We need to increase the Federal \ninvestment. That is what this bill would do, by tripling funding for \nreading programs.\n  We also need a fresh approach. Fortunately, research provides \nreliable ways to determine whether children as young as age 4 are \ndeveloping the necessary skills to learn to read. Early identification \nand effective early intervention can dramatically reduce the numbers of \nstudents who fail to learn to read.\n  Teachers have told me of the excitement they feel when they watch a \nchild learn the strategies needed to crack the reading code. For some \nstudents it is a mysterious code, but teachers have proven over and \nover again that there are strategies and solid research that can bring \ntechniques into the classroom to help children discover that they can, \nindeed, become good readers.\n  The ability to read unlocks the doors to all other areas of the \ncurriculum. Children who can't read don't excel in other subject areas. \nIn fact, nonreaders pull away from other academic subjects if they \ndon't experience success in reading.\n  I find it so exciting that this country is now focused on reading. \nReading is finally getting the attention, the support, and the \nresources it deserves. It has taken years for the importance of reading \nto rise to national attention. I give our President and the First Lady \ntremendous credit in focusing national attention on the importance of \nreading.\n  I believe we are about to take a great leap forward for this Nation \ntoward increasing literacy. The amendment I put forth merely \nstrengthens the provisions of the reading initiative in this important \nlegislation. It will ensure that we have access to the information we \nneed to determine whether this program is a success.\n  The bottom line: If we act swiftly and effectively to teach reading \nin the early grades, we will provide our children with the solid \nfoundation they need for future academic success.\n  The Reading First initiative gives meaning to our commitment to leave \nno child behind by making certain that every child can read. This is \ncritical because our Nation is in the midst of a monumental global \nchange. Unlike previous generations who came of age when the United \nStates was primarily an agricultural or manufacturing based economy, \nthis generation coming to age now will need reading skills more than \never.\n  Information processing has become a required skill for so many jobs. \nThat is why reading is so important. It is the basic building block for \nparticipating fully in our society. In this country of opportunity and \npromise, we owe it to our children to make sure they learn to read and \nlearn to read well.\n  In closing, I thank the leaders of our committee and the National \nCenter for Learning Disabilities, as well as the Department of \nEducation and White House officials for working together with us to \nimprove the Reading First initiative in this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for a \nwonderful effort in making sure this bill will succeed. I commend her \non it.\n  I yield myself such time as I may consume for purposes of supporting \nthe amendment.\n  At a time when we are sending tourists into space, cloning animals, \nand integrating computers into every facet of our lives, reading \ncontinues to be one of the most important skills we learn in our \nlifetime. In fact, in this information age, reading has never been more \nimportant.\n  There are two programs in this legislation that have not received as \nmuch attention as some of the other provisions. Yet, these programs may \nbe the most important parts of the bill. Because--while reading is the \ngateway skill to further learning, academic achievement, and success in \nthe world--millions of school-age children are not learning to read \nwell enough.\n  Over the past two days, several Members have talked about how too \nmany of our children are not reading well. I have some charts that \ndisplay just how serious the problem is, and what an emergency it is \nfor our county.\n  Chart 1 gives an overall view. It is so discouraging, I want to take \na few moments to let everyone absorb the contents of it.\n  What we are looking at here is the reading results for fourth graders \nfrom the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress. This \nis a nationally representative study carried out by the Department of \nEducation.\n  The results from the assessment are divided into four categories: \nBelow basic, basic, proficient, and advanced. The proficient level is \nthe performance expected of students at this grade level. That is where \nevery child in America should be.\n  As you can see from the bar on the far left, 68 percent of all \nstudents are reading below proficiency in the fourth grade--68 percent \nare below proficiency in the fourth grade. A little less than 40 \npercent have not attained the basic level. That means 40 percent are \nreally seriously failing, which means they have not mastered even the \nrudimentary skills of reading. This is inexcusable.\n\n[[Page S4197]]\n\n  I will point out some other deficiencies in our educational system. \nWe are the only Nation of the industrialized world that does not \nprovide education paid for by the public sector for 3- and 4-year-olds. \nI point that out because that percentage of 40 percent is about the \npercentage of those who get no help in the 3- and 4-year level. That is \nour country. No other industrialized nation has that kind of a record.\n  As you look down the different bars on the chart, you can see that \nthis overall performance actually masks the performance of the \nsubgroups identified in the report. For example, only 12 percent of \nblack students in the fourth grade are reading at the proficient level.\n  Now I want to point out the deficiency of our Head Start Program. We \nwill be holding hearings on that later this year. The Head Start \nProgram is designed to give custodial care and help and nurturing to \nyoung children. There is little or no effective educational part of \nthat program. Therefore, we have to examine what we can do and note \nthat the only program we have that really is in the area of help really \ndoes not provide the kind of educational help that is necessary.\n  Also, nearly 60 percent of Hispanic children are reading below the \nbasic level.\n  Let us now turn to chart 2. If we look at the next chart, we can see \nthat poverty, which cuts across all the groups on the previous chart, \npredicts a great deal of the low performance. Again, we have the same \nproblem here with respect to percentages, and we find that our Nation, \nunlike any other industrialized nation, does not provide help to the \nyoung children, the preschoolers.\n  ``Eligibility for free and reduced lunch'' is based on the income of \na student's parents. As you can see, children living in families near \nor below the poverty line are much more likely to be reading at the \nbasic or below-basic level.\n  Overall, these numbers have not changed over the past decade. They \nhave not changed over the past decade. That means in the last 10 years \nwe have seen no improvement. I serve on the Goals panel, and I have \nbeen there since it was initiated in 1990. We have not seen any \nsignificant change in the levels of education since that time, when we \ncreated the Goals panel to see whether we were improving.\n  One of the most noticeable changes in the data over time has been a \ndecline in the scores for the lowest performing 10 percent. This means \nthat those students who are furthest behind have been losing ground. \nThat is totally inexcusable for this Nation.\n  What is so alarming about these statistics is that by the fourth \ngrade, students are expected to have learned how to read well. \nIncreasingly, they must read in order to learn about academic matter. \nThe emphasis on teaching reading declines, and the opportunities to \nmake up lost ground often disappear. There is clearly a relationship \nbetween the low reading scores for these groups of students, their low \nacademic achievement in later grades, and the high rate of dropping out \nof school.\n\n  I can point to another study done by the Glenn Commission and also \nthe stories we have with respect to improving in math. Even though our \nchildren, somehow, are average with respect to industrialized nations \nin the fourth grade in math, from that point, they slip down until they \nare last in the world by the time they graduate from high school. That \nis one of the most serious problems from which our Nation suffers. \nAgain, it gets back to the basics of reading as well as, of course, \nunderstanding math.\n  Of course, it should be no surprise that these students, when they \nleave school, become adults with low levels of literacy. For example, \nin 1993 the National Adult Literacy Survey found that 20 percent of all \nadults--or more than 40 million Americans--scored at the lowest level \nof literacy on the assessment.\n  Finally, to bring this full circle, a recent report from the \nDepartment of Education, ``The Kindergarten Year,'' found that the \nchildren of parents with less high school education arrived at \nkindergarten with far fewer language and literacy skills than their \npeers who had better educated parents. In fact, when these children \nleft kindergarten, they scored lower on these skills than when their \nhigher performing peers entered kindergarten.\n  This is the current situation:\n  Some young children fall behind their peers before they even enter \nschool; schools improve most students' reading skills, but they do not \nclose the gap; these students are much more likely to fail in school \nand, even worse, to drop out later on; children of parents who \nthemselves had difficulty learning to read, and who did poorly in \nschool, are more likely to have reading difficulties.\n  So you can see what we have is a cycle of low literacy in this \ncountry. Now you can see why I think the Reading First Program and its \ncompanion, Early Learning First, which gets down to the 3- and 4-year-\nolds, preschool-age children, are perhaps the most important parts of \nthis legislation that we will be passing.\n  I should add that the Even Start Family Literacy Program is also \nbeing reauthorized by S. 1. It is another important piece of our \nnational literacy effort. That is working with both the parents and the \nchildren at the same time to make sure the family becomes literate \ntogether.\n  I commend the President for his leadership in proposing these reading \nprograms and asking for funds to make them a reality. He provided \nsimilar leadership on this issue as Governor of Texas, with good \nresults in Texas. I praise the President for bringing that experience \nto this body so that all of the country may share from it.\n  I also want to mention our First Lady, Laura Bush, who I know is also \nvery interested. I have been with her at times when she has \ndemonstrated that. She is deeply involved in the reading issue. She \nprovided leadership on reading and literacy as the first lady of Texas \nand has taken special interest in the development of language and \nliteracy skills in preschool-age children, as reflected in the Early \nReading First initiative.\n  I believe very strongly that the only way we can close the gap \nbetween better performing and lower performing children in our own \ncountry and between American students and those in other industrialized \nnations is to:\n  Provide more opportunities for learning in the preschool \nyears; second, improve instruction in our schools and give adults an \nopportunity to improve their own literacy skills.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will support these important programs--Reading \nFirst, Early Reading First, and Even Start Programs--in the overall \nlegislation we are considering today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I congratulate my friend and colleague \nfrom Maine for an excellent statement and for her amendment. I am in \nstrong support of her amendment. I spoke to her briefly yesterday about \nauthorizing the Early Reading First Program at $75 million which \ncomplements the Reading First initiative by supporting effective \napproaches for improving the early language literacy skills of children \nage 3 to 5, and under the program, 4-year competitive grants may be \nawarded to school districts and nonprofit organization consortia, such \nas organizations that serve preschool children.\n  Her amendment is not only building on the Reading Excellence Act, and \nnot only provides funds for children in the early grades, but also for \nthe preschool children. That is an area of opportunity and need as \nwell.\n  I am hopeful we will, over a period of time, build on that program.\n  I thank the chairman of our committee. No one knows this issue better \nthan Senator Jeffords. He is the founder of the Everyone Wins Program \nin Washington, DC, and he is constantly urging Republicans and \nDemocrats to join him in reading to a child at the Brent School. He and \nI shared that experience on Tuesday. I welcome that opportunity.\n  I know when he speaks about reading and the importance of reading, it \nis a deeply held belief and one that is rooted in his soul because he \nlives those words very effectively. It has been a\n\n[[Page S4198]]\n\ngreat opportunity. I have enjoyed participating with him in that \nprogram, and I know a number of our colleagues do as well.\n  Anyone who has any question in their mind about the importance of \ndeveloping effective programs in reading, if they would spend a few \nhours--just an hour, actually, a week--they would be the most \nenthusiastic supporter of this program. It will have an enormous impact \non the children. Most important, it will enhance their ability to \nlearn. It will excite them about learning. It will give them countless \njoy in the future. It is a wonderful undertaking. The expansion of this \nprogram, which started a few years ago, will be enormously important. I \nlook forward to working with Senator Collins in giving additional focus \nand life to the earlier interventions for children because that is of \nmajor importance.\n\n  Finally, we have heard a great deal about what title I has not done \nover the years. For the benefit of the membership, this chart is NAEP \nreading scores over the past 25 years. These are the constant scores \nfor the same test. If you look at this chart from 1971 to 1999, you \nwill see there has been a very modest increase in 13-year-olds over \nthat period of time. There has been a very modest increase among black \nteenagers and Hispanic teenagers. There has been a very modest \nreduction in the difference between the races, which is encouraging.\n  It is interesting to note, if you look over what was happening to \nchildren during this period of time with increased poverty, an \nincreased number of immigrant children, non-English-speaking children, \nthat is also an indicator and has a significant impact on these \nnumbers.\n  One can see looking at this chart that there is a gradual improvement \nfor all 13-year-olds over that period of time.\n  The next chart is NAEP reading scores for 9-year-olds over the past \n25 years. We see the same: a very modest increase for 9-year-olds and \nsomewhat a closing of the gap among the other children as well, \nalthough it has been very modest.\n  The next chart is in the area of math. The significance of these \ncharts show, if one goes from 1973 to 1999, for 13-year-olds, the line \nis moving in a positive direction. That is a hopeful sign. These are \nNAEP scores. If one looks at the black children, we see the gap, which \nwas 46 points in 1973, has been reduced to 32 points in 1999 which is a \nvery sizable reduction. There have been some rather important gains \nmade in math.\n  Another chart, again the NAEP tests, the 1990 trends in academic \nprogress, shows the gap closing in math for 13-year-olds. It was a 35-\npoint gap in 1973, and it is down to 24 points. Again, those lines are \nmoving in a positive direction.\n  This chart is the older children, 17-year-olds, and one will see a \n52-point gap in 1971 down to a 29-point gap.\n  The point is we have a long way to go, but we have made some \nimportant progress.\n  The other important point about these charts is the schools that made \nthe greatest difference had both reform and resources. That is why we \ncome back to the basic point that is underlying this bill and why we \nhave been able to fashion a very good, effective bill. In a number of \nways, if I had been drafting it, I would have drafted it differently.\n  This is a very important bill, but it needs the resources to give \nthese trend lines a real boost in the future. That is what we want. We \nwant reform and resources. We are talking about investments in \nchildren, investments in the futures of children. Children are the \nfuture. We need those kinds of investments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask that the time be equally charged.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under Senator Kennedy's time--actually, \nunder Senator Harkin's time--I yield to the Senator from Michigan 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I first thank my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle who are working so hard on this important issue of \neducation: the chairman of the committee, Senator Jeffords, who is \nproviding such important leadership; the ranking member, Senator \nKennedy. I congratulate him and all of the Members who are so deeply \ninvolved in focusing on what I believe is the most critical issue \nfacing us in the future, not only of our children as it relates to \ntheir opportunities to succeed but to our economy as well.\n  We have all heard--as a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I \nheard time and time again in hearings--that we have an increased labor \nproductivity that is driving this economy. The basis of that increased \nlabor activity is an educated workforce. So the debate in front of us \nis critical.\n  I rise today in anticipation of an amendment that will be introduced \nlater that I will be cosponsoring. It relates to an important part of \nproviding resources and keeping the Federal Government's promise that \nwas made 25 years ago concerning funding for special education for all \nof our local communities.\n  We have many educational priorities. But as I have met with the \nleaders and parents in communities all across Michigan, they have said \nto me time and time again, if you just did one thing, if you just kept \nyour promise to fully fund your portion of special education, it would \nfree up dollars for us to serve the other needs of children in schools.\n  This is critical in Michigan. We have had numerous court suits that \nrelate to the State portion of special education. The lack of Federal \nsupport has caused a tremendous battle in Michigan over the resources \nfor special education.\n  We have the opportunity now, in the context of debating the budget \nand the vision for the next 10 years and in the context of this \nimportant education bill, to set it right. I hear over and over again \nfrom superintendents and teachers and parents: If we are talking about \neconomic good times, if we are talking about budget surpluses, why \ncan't you keep your promises? This is an incredibly important promise \nto our children and to our communities. It needs to be kept. We are \nnowhere near meeting the commitment that was made 25 years ago.\n  Let me give an example. I should say I have been deeply involved over \nthe years in the issue of advocating for our children in special \neducation. In Michigan, the cost for the 1999-2000 school year was $1.2 \nbillion for special education alone.\n  The Federal Government is supposed to provide 40 percent of that. But \ninstead the Federal Government's contribution to Michigan schools was \n$120 million. I am pretty good at math. I know that $120 million is not \n40 percent of $1.2 billion.\n  Unfortunately, the State has tried to make up part of those dollars. \nLocal communities in Michigan have shifted over $420 million into \nspecial education that is supposed to be available for other critical \nneeds in the schools: lowering class sizes for all children, putting \nmore technology in the classroom, upgrading our math and science \ncapabilities, and some issues that need to be addressed.\n  We have taken a large amount of resources in Michigan away from those \nneeds in order to address the very important need of special education, \none that the Federal Government agreed to help fund and has not yet \nkept its commitment.\n  Nationally, the Federal Government provides less than 15 percent of \nits commitment to IDEA, which is our special education funding. We are \nsupposed to be providing 40 percent. We are yet to hit 15 percent.\n  We can do something about it right now. We have it within our means. \nI am urging my colleagues to do that.\n\n[[Page S4199]]\n\n  I would like to share a couple of letters from parents, one from a \nteacher in Michigan, concerning this issue that has profoundly impacted \nthe children and the families and the schools in Michigan.\n  Richard Spring from Manchester, MI, working in the Webberville School \nDistrict, an important school district outside of Lansing in mid \nMichigan, wrote to me saying:\n\n       In small rural school districts, like the one where I work, \n     the high cost that is incurred by the school district for \n     special education makes it impossible to do a lot of the \n     other things that we know are critical to providing adequate \n     services to all students. For some kids, who don't \n     necessarily qualify for special education, the impact is \n     especially dramatic. For example, many students are on the \n     ``borderline'' in school--there are a year or so behind where \n     they should be for their age. Perhaps they were help back one \n     year. These children do not qualify for special education in \n     our district and there is no extra funding to provide \n     services to help these students who clearly are struggling. \n     This is because the district must carry such a high burden of \n     the special education costs.\n       Around the time these marginal children reach middle \n     school, they are no longer able to ``just get by'' in school \n     without any additional services. Often, these students are so \n     frustrated with school that they are diagnosed as emotionally \n     impaired. These are the children whose behavior becomes so \n     disruptive that it interferes with other children's \n     opportunities to learn and a teacher's ability to teach.\n       This problem could be easily prevented if the federal \n     government met its commitment of 40% funding for IDEA. This \n     would free up the critical dollars that school districts need \n     to provide other services, like assistance to students who \n     are on the borderline. Even something as simple as summer \n     school could make a difference in these children's lives. But \n     the cost of special education is so high, that my school \n     district has not been able to offer summer school in the \n     seven years that I have been there.\n\n  I very much appreciate Richard Spring's letter to me, and I think he \nspeaks very well to the struggles that are going on in our schools \ntrying to meet the important needs of children and not having the \nFederal Government coming forward with its promise. We are great at \nmandating. We are great at laying out what ought to be done providing \nrules and regulations, and even when they are important and ones that I \nagree with completely. If we do not keep our commitment on resources, \nwe are not keeping our commitment to children.\n  I also would like to read one other letter from a parent who wrote:\n\n       I am writing as a parent of a child with special needs. My \n     son Paul is 11 years old. He needs an aide at school to keep \n     him on track, organize his school work and home work and to \n     interpret non-verbal information. He is a very work \n     intelligent, sweet, easy-going child and this makes him one \n     of the many who could fall through the cracks if special \n     education funding is not improved.\n       The combination of growing enrollment and teacher shortages \n     is putting a strain on our communities to provide quality \n     education for our children. Our district . . . is especially \n     struggling because of its high percentage of autistic \n     students its very high percentage of severely afflicted \n     children.\n       The need for federal education funding is greater now than \n     ever before. I see how the special education teachers are \n     overwhelmed with work loads because we can't afford to hire \n     new teachers. Our special education budget is upwards of \n     $500,000 in the hole for next year. All of our students are \n     affected when we cannot provide services to our special needs \n     children. Without appropriate funding, we must pull funds \n     from other areas of our budget. Programs are being cut and \n     education, as a whole, suffers. . . . Please vote and fight \n     to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     and make its funding mandatory.\n\n  Mr. President, I could not say that better myself.\n  Again, this is the time for all of us on both sides of the aisle who \ncare deeply about the future of our country and deeply about the future \nof our children and families to take this unique time in history and \nkeep our commitment because the resources are now there to do so.\n  I ask, if we do not pass today an amendment to fully fund special \neducation, when will we? When will we have the opportunity again for \nour country to be able to step up and take a small portion of resources \nthat are currently in hand and keep our commitment to the children and \nfamilies of this country? Now is the time. We need to keep that \ncommitment to special education.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, be allowed to speak as if in morning \nbusiness for 10 minutes and that the time not be charged against either \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada very \nmuch for that courtesy.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bingaman are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business''.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time under \nthe quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, the debate we are having this week and \nnext week on education reform in this country may be the most important \ndebate we have in the Senate this year. Education is probably the most \nimportant thing we do as a government. We have the best military, the \nbest economy, and the best technology in the world. There is absolutely \nno reason that we should not have the best public schools in the world. \nWe are the leader in so many other areas, and we should be the leader \nalso in this area.\n  Whether you are talking to teachers, students, school administrators, \nor parents, you hear the same thing everywhere you go. I have townhall \nmeetings in North Carolina regularly. I visit schools there regularly. \nYou hear the same things every single place. No. 1, everyone wants to \nmake sure that every school is a high-performing school. In other \nwords, there is no excuse for there being a single low-performing \nschool in America.\n  Second, we need fine, quality teachers, and we need to pay them well \nand keep them.\n  Third, we need to make sure that the performance of every single \nstudent in America is improved. That is what this education debate is \nabout.\n  We should make this decade the education decade in America. My home \nState of North Carolina has served as a model for many of the reforms \nthat have been debated. A few weeks ago, the Secretary of Education, \nSecretary Paige, came and told the committee that many of the ideas \nthat this administration has proposed are, in fact, modeled after work \nthat has been done in North Carolina. A centerpiece of that reform \neffort was a sustained effort at identifying those schools that are not \nperforming and taking all the steps necessary to make sure those \nschools are turned around.\n\n  I am very pleased that we were able to insert in this bill, with the \nhelp of my colleagues, a specific provision, a proposal, a system that \nwe have used in North Carolina to turn around low-performing schools. \nThe concept is very simple, but it is very effective. Once the \nmeasurement and the testing has occurred and we identify a school that \nis low performing, we gather what is called a special assistance team, \na team that exists for the purpose of going into low-performing schools \nto turn the schools around. It is comprised of educators, experts in \nthe field, and people who know, based on their own education and \nexperience, how to turn around a low-performing school. Those special \nassistants go into the school and do what is necessary to turn it \naround. They evaluate the academics\n\n[[Page S4200]]\n\nof the school; they evaluate the personnel at the school; they make \nrecommendations about changes that need to be made to restore \neducational quality at the school.\n  Again, it sounds like a simple idea. You figure out a school is low \nperforming and you send in a group of experts to turn the school \naround. It is a simple idea, but it works. It has worked in North \nCarolina. Since 1997, we have identified 33 schools as low performing. \nInto those schools we have sent these special assistance teams; their \njob it is to turn the school around. Since 1997, 29 of the 33 schools \nidentified as low performing have now been turned around.\n  Now, there are, obviously, many things that have contributed to these \nschools being turned around, including a lot of work done in the local \ncommunity. But these special assistance teams have played a pivotal \nrole in turning these schools around. Their contribution is important. \nWhat we have been able to do, with the help of my colleagues on the \nHELP Committee, and with the able leadership of both the chairman and \nthe ranking member, Senator Kennedy, is to incorporate into this bill \nexactly at a national level what has been working in North Carolina.\n  There has been a lot of talk in Washington and nationally about \nreform. Reform is important. I support it--measurement, accountability, \nidentification of schools that are low performing, and doing what is \nnecessary to turn those schools around. That is the system. It is the \nsystem we helped start in North Carolina, and our North Carolina system \nhas served as a model for what we are talking about nationally.\n  The problem, though, is tough accountability, tough reform will not \nwork ultimately in many school districts unless the resources are \navailable to turn those schools around. In poor school districts, once \nyou go in and identify a school that is low performing, you test and \nmeasure, all of which are a good idea, and so is real accountability.\n  The problem is, if the special assistance team makes a \nrecommendation, if the school does not have the resources to do what is \nrecommended, it is impossible to turn those schools around. It gets to \nbe a very simple proposition: You identify a low-performing school, and \nyou send in the experts to tell them what needs to be done. But in \norder to change things, many times resources are needed because in \nthese poor school districts all over America, they simply do not have \nthe resources to do what needs to be done.\n  Without the resources, what you have is Washington, DC, telling \npeople in local communities what needs to be done in their schools \nwithout giving them any help in meeting the standards that are being \nestablished. It is an unfunded Federal mandate out of Washington. It is \nthe Washington people telling local people what they have to do and \nthen not providing any help to do it.\n  North Carolina is a perfect example of how critical this is. In North \nCarolina, we implemented very tough measurement, tough testing, tough \naccountability. We identified these schools that were low performing \nand went in and intensely made an effort to turn them around. The \ncritical component of that, though, was once those schools in North \nCarolina were identified, we made sure the resources were there to \nactually turn the school around.\n  That is why this debate over the course of the next 2 weeks is so \ncritical because what has worked in North Carolina will work \nnationally. There is no excuse for us having a single, not one, low-\nperforming school in this country. But the only way to get there is \nonce we have done the testing, once we have done the measurement, once \nwe have identified the schools that are not performing, the resources \nhave to be available to turn around those schools. That is what we did \nin North Carolina. It worked. That is what we should be doing at the \nnational level. It is what we are going to be talking about over the \ncourse of the next 2 weeks.\n  The budget debate, which is also ongoing in this Senate and will be \nongoing over the course of the next several months----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will be voting this afternoon on the Republican \nbudget. We will be able to debate that under the time limitations, but \nit is coming back now with a little over $1.2 trillion.\n  The Senator, I am sure, remembers the debate we had on the Harkin \namendment. This body, in a bipartisan way, gave instructions to the \nconference that there be $250 billion more committed to education. It \nis directly relevant to the matters about which the Senator has \nreferred: To take what is working in North Carolina--and we might come \nback to that in a minute or two--to take those very excellent examples \nof how North Carolina has taken schools which were seriously behind in \nacademic achievement and promoted those schools. I read where one or \ntwo of them are at the top in achievement.\n  As the Senator has pointed out, this is a blueprint we have which the \nSenator worked on in the committee and has been helping us fashion over \nthe past few days.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that if we have this blueprint, what \nis going to give life to this blueprint is resources? It is about the \nfuture.\n  We are going to be voting on the budget proposal. The Harkin \namendment had 19 million classroom slots for students. We are reaching \n3 million now. There are 10 million children who qualify. If we had the \nHarkin amendment, we could have gotten to full funding of title I. We \nwould have had 7 million more slots for afterschool opportunities for \nyouth; 2,750,000 fewer children in Head Start; 2 million opportunities \nfor teachers to build skills by training and mentoring; 50,000 more \nteachers every year and reducing class sizes in the critically early \ngrades; 2,000 fewer crumbling and unsafe schools. That is what we voted \nfor on a bipartisan basis.\n\n  We are not going to get a single one of those in the budget that \ncomes here. Doesn't this concern the Senator from North Carolina when \nwe are trying to take this bill we have all worked on in a bipartisan \nway and believe it is a fundamental building stone of the future of \nthis country because we are talking about our children, and 20 percent, \none out of five, are living in serious poverty in this country. We are \ntrying to at least move----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 more minutes. We are trying to make \nsure these children will not be disadvantaged in academic achievement \nand will be able to move ahead toward the American dream. That is what \nthis is about.\n  I am wondering whether the Senator agrees with me that what was \nachieved in North Carolina took resources, took commitment, took a \nblueprint and would not have happened without the resources. With the \nresources, they were able to do it and what a difference it has made to \nthose children.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. The answer to the Senator's question is simple. Without \nthe resources, it would have been impossible to turn those schools \naround in North Carolina. It could not have been done.\n  I will give the Senator another example. On his list, he has \n2,750,000 fewer children in Head Start. Every educator in North \nCarolina will tell you that a critical component of what we have done \nto improve the schools in North Carolina is our State program Smart \nStart. Without that, kids do not begin school ready to learn. They are \nnot prepared to learn.\n  All these other things are very important, but this early childhood \neducation is absolutely critical.\n  Another thing on Senator Kennedy's list: Opportunities for teachers \nto build skills by training and mentoring. We have focused in North \nCarolina not only on recruiting quality teachers but continuing to \ntrain them, keeping them, increasing their pay, increasing their \nincentive pay when they perform well. Teacher training and compensation \nis absolutely crucial to make this work.\n  It gets to be a pretty simple proposition: No. 1, our kids need to \nstart school ready to learn. That is what Head Start is about. That is \nwhat Start Smart is about. They need to have the best teachers \npossible. It does not do any good to have tough accountability,\n\n[[Page S4201]]\n\nwhich we support strongly. We are proud of what we have done in my \nState in that area, but you cannot turn the schools around if they do \nnot have the resources.\n  When those assistance teams come in and make recommendations, that is \ngreat, but if the recommendations cannot be followed because the \nresources are not there to follow them, it serves no purpose at all. \nThat is why it is so crucial that what we voted for in the Senate in a \nbipartisan way to help provide funding, $250 billion for our schools in \nthis country--there is nothing, as Senator Kennedy well knows; he has \nbeen a champion of this for a long time--there is nothing we do that is \nmore important than educating our young people.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for his response. As he knows, this \n$250 billion did not come back as $200 billion or $175 billion or $100 \nbillion or $50 billion. It came back as no dollars. I hope our \nRepublican friends are able to explain that.\n  I want to ask a final question of the Senator. The State of North \nCarolina, as I understand, is one of 12 or 13 States that uses its own \nmoney to enhance the Head Start Program. Otherwise, I imagine it would \nbe somewhat similar to Massachusetts where about 42, 43 percent of the \nchildren are in the Head Start Program. Some of the most urban areas \nand some of the poorest have lower percentages than that, 35 percent.\n  I was listening to a story about certain areas of the South Bronx are \ndown to 25 percent because they have not been able to get the programs \ndeveloped.\n  The State of North Carolina has a comprehensive approach. It has \nSmart Start and North Carolina also has the Head Start Program from \nwhich it is getting additional resources.\n  As I understand the position of the Senator from North Carolina, this \nought to be a continuum. We ought to have early intervention with \nchildren, help them build confidence, help them build their interests \nin learning, help to open up their minds a bit to the idea of working \nwith other students, as child psychiatrists point out, helping to \ndevelop a sense of humor so they can interact with other children.\n\n  They work in those areas, and also, in their Head Start Programs in a \nnumber of the North Carolina situations, they build into those programs \nthe development of some academic challenges that are suitable for those \nchildren as well, in an attempt to make sure that when they actually \nget to the schools, they can benefit.\n  This is a pathway. I know the Senator is committed to each step along \nthe way, as I am. But we are finding out that even if they take this, \nif North Carolina does what is necessary and they arrive at these \nschools, at the Federal level we are only funding a third of all those \nchildren, those who will be able to get the supplementary services, the \nother kinds of afterschool programs, the other kinds of help and \nassistance these children need. Does the Senator think this is \nimportant, that we try to build on what has happened in North Carolina, \nto meet our commitments to those children by covering all the eligible \nchildren in North Carolina?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. As the Senator well knows, there is nothing we do that \nis more important. These things all go together. I have been in these \nHead Start centers; I have been in these Smart Start centers; I see the \neffect they have on these kids' lives. It is absolutely amazing. You \nget children ready. Every study that has ever been done has shown the \nearly years are the critical years. Once you get kids ready nationally \nwith Head Start, Smart Start in North Carolina, then when they are in \nschool, they need to be with quality teachers, well trained, well paid, \ntreated as the extraordinary professionals and heroes they are. And not \nonly that, they are in classes that are small in size so they don't \nhave too many kids in the classrooms, particularly in those early \nyears. It is absolutely crucial.\n  I say to the Senator, I hope as we go forward with this debate we \nrecognize, while we strongly support real accountability, tough \nmeasurement, identification of schools that are low performing, going \ninto those schools and turning them around, that there are other \ncomponents to this process that are critical to making them work: Early \nchildhood education, quality teachers, the kids going to school in \ndecent buildings and classrooms, not sitting on top of each other in \nclassrooms, afterschool programs so the kids have a place to go where \nthey can be safe and off the street; that is what this is about. We \nhave an extraordinary opportunity to do great things, not only for \nAmerica but for our children and the future of this country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could ask the Senator one more question. As I \nunderstand it, North Carolina has this Teaching Fellows Program where \nit recruits talented high school students into the teaching \nprofession--those with a minimum 1100 SAT, 3.6 GPA, and in the top 10 \npercent of the class--with priorities given to males and minorities. \nThe program provides $5,000 a year for 4 years to 400 outstanding North \nCarolina high school seniors who agree to teach for 4 years following \ngraduation in one of North Carolina's public schools or U.S. Government \nschools.\n  This is a model program in North Carolina. The Senator has spoken to \nit. Has he found this is a program that has helped North Carolina get \nthe quality teachers who have made such an important difference to the \nchildren in North Carolina?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. This program has been extraordinarily effective. But the \nkey to this is, it is just one step in the right direction. We need to \nbe doing much more, much more to attract more quality students to the \nteaching profession, much more to hang on, retain the young people who \nare dedicated to teaching and want to do it for the rest of their \nlives. We need to make sure, No. 1, we get quality people, and, No. 2, \nonce we get quality young men and women in the teaching profession, we \nkeep them there with good training programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself another 10 minutes.\n  There is one final area about which I would like to inquire of the \nSenator. I have a report here that says 36 percent of North Carolina \nschools report that at least one building needs extensive repair or \nshould be replaced; 68 percent have at least one unsatisfactory \nenvironmental condition; 75 percent have crumbling roofs; 14 percent \nhave inadequate heating; 22 percent, bad plumbing; 23 percent, poor \nventilation; and 42 percent of the schools do not have sufficient power \noutlets and electric wiring to accommodate computers and multimedia \nequipment in classrooms.\n  You can use those figures. I think in my own State it would be higher \nthan these. The point is, the GAO has talked about over $120 billion of \nneeds out there in our schools. I am just wondering what the Senator \nfrom North Carolina believes. What sort of message do we send to our \nchildren if we send them to these schools in these conditions, when we \nhave the opportunity--and, Lord only knows the resources, with a $1.6 \ntrillion tax cut--that we are still not going to fix those schools up? \nWhat kind of message does that send either to the children of North \nCarolina or the children of Massachusetts who are facing these kinds of \nproblems in schools? Should we not try to be a partner with the State \nand local communities, trying to help that situation? Does the Senator \nnot believe, with me, that we are talking about these children, now, \nwith this bill, to try to help these children to make sure the \nfacilities they are learning in are going to be safe and secure--at \nleast to respond to the breakdown of some of these buildings \nthemselves?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. The Senator is right, we have made great strides, but I \nhave been in elementary schools where there are no bathrooms inside the \nbuilding, the roof is leaking, the floors are crumbling; they are \ncovered up with little pieces of carpet. To get them in the lunchroom, \nthey have to start going to lunch at 10 or 10:15 in the morning because \nit is so crowded, they can't get the kids through.\n  If you go down the road a few miles, there will be a brand new, shiny \nmall, new store buildings. The Senator is exactly right. What does it \nsay to our children when they go to a new mall with beautiful buildings \nand the next morning they get up and go to school and the building is \nfalling down? What does it say about what we care about, what our \npriorities are? This is all part\n\n[[Page S4202]]\n\nof the same issue we have been talking about.\n  We need to do all these things, and they are all critically \nimportant, from Head Start, in my case Smart Start, to getting quality \nteachers, keeping them trained, retaining them in the school system, \nhaving kids in smaller classes so they can learn more, having them in \nbuildings that are not falling apart, having afterschool programs and \ntechnology available to them--this is all critically important. There \nis nothing we do as a government that is more important than educating \nour young people. We have a remarkable opportunity here, and I hope we \ntake advantage of it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for his very helpful comments. \nVirtually all of us on this side of the aisle believe these investments \nin our children ought to receive a priority.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter sent \nby 43 different groups that have historically represented children and \nteachers and parents in schools, many of them for 75, 85, 100 years, \nurging full funding for the title I programs. Again, we are reaching a \nthird. This is in support of the full funding of the program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from the National Council of the Churches of Christ USA, \nwhere they are recommending that we have the full funding for these \nprograms because they understand what difference it makes to the \nchildren themselves.\n  I also ask to have printed in the Record the letter we have from the \nGovernors that indicates if we are going to move ahead with this \nlegislation, we should have funding for that program as well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 26, 2001.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Health, Labor, Education, and Pensions \n         Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: As you continue your negotiations on \n     the BEST Act (S. 1), the undersigned organizations write in \n     strong support of your efforts to make full funding of Title \n     I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) a top \n     funding priority.\n       Just as many of our groups support proposals to fully fund \n     IDEA as a mandatory program, we also believe securing a \n     similar and substantial increase for Title I is a critical \n     piece of this year's ESEA reauthorization. Providing full \n     funding for Title I is consistent with actions taken last \n     month by the Senate HELP Committee, which unanimously \n     approved increasing the Title I authorization level to $15 \n     billion in FY 02--a significant increase over the $8.6 \n     billion appropriated for FY 01.\n       As the cornerstone of ESEA, Title I supports instructional \n     activities that help students in high-poverty schools meet \n     high standards in core subjects. The program currently \n     reaches some 10.3 million poor students nationwide, providing \n     additional instructional time in reading and math and other \n     activities that help students meet the same high standards \n     set for all students.\n       Unfortunately, Congress has never met its obligation udner \n     ESEA to fully serve all children identified as eligible for \n     compensatory services under federal law. Over the last five \n     years the average yearly increase for Title I has been only \n     3.6 percent. After factoring in inflation and enrollment \n     increases, Title I has been flat funded. In addition, the \n     Congressional Research Service estimates that, in FY 01, \n     Congress provided local educational agencies with only one-\n     third of the resources needed to fully serve all eligible \n     students to help close the achievement gap.\n       Under existing law, school districts are eligible to \n     receive 40 percent of their state's average per pupil \n     expenditure (APPE) for each poor child within their \n     jurisdiction. For FY 01, this calculation would be $2,457. \n     However, because of the inadequate funding levels, school \n     districts received an average of only $762 on behalf of the \n     10.3 million students eligible to receive Title I services in \n     FY 00. In order to ``leave no child behind''--meaning all \n     eligible children would receive the full services Congress \n     authorized and for which they are eligible to receive--the \n     average yearly increase for Title I over the next four years \n     would have to be approximately $5.24 billion a year. The \n     cumulative Title I increase over four years (FYs 02-05) would \n     have to be $49.93 billion.\n       While we fully support measuring student achievement and \n     holding schools accountable for improving that achievement, \n     testing and accountability alone are not sufficient. Congress \n     also must provide resources to schools most in need to enable \n     them to implement reforms to increase student achievement, \n     such as supplemental instruction, after-school programs, \n     teacher and principal training, effective and research-based-\n     curricula, and other reforms that schools and communities \n     determine will help students. Fully funding Title I would \n     also provide significant additional resources to turn around \n     low-performing schools.\n       Given the projections of a growing budget surplus, we hope \n     that Congress and the Bush Administration will reach an \n     agreement that fully funds Title I over the next four years. \n     This increase is essential to meet the needs of America's \n     disadvantaged students, and accelerate current efforts \n     focused on closing the achievement gap and raising standards \n     for all children. We also urge that this increase in Title I, \n     as well as increase for other critical education programs \n     including after school, teacher quality, class size, and \n     school modernization, not come at the expense of other \n     important programs for children, but be funded by an overall \n     increase in domestic discretionary funding.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this issue and support \n     your efforts to secure additional funding for Title I during \n     this year's reauthorization of ESEA.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Association of School Administrators.\n       American Association of University Women.\n       American Counseling Association.\n       American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n     Employees.\n       American Federation of Teachers.\n       American Jewish Committee.\n       Americans United for Separation of Church and State.\n       Association of Educational Service Agencies.\n       California State Superintendent of Public Instruction.\n       Chicago Public Schools.\n       Consortium for School Networking.\n       Council for Exceptional Children.\n       Council of Chief State School Officers.\n       Council of Great City Schools.\n       Hadassah, The Women's Zionist Organization of America.\n       Hispanic Education Coalition.\n       International Reading Association.\n       International Society for Technology in Education.\n       National Alliance of Black School Educators.\n       National Association for Bilingual Education.\n       National Association of Elementary School Principals.\n       National Association of Federal Education Program \n     Administrators.\n       National Association of Secondary School Principals.\n       National Association of School Psychologists.\n       National Association of Social Workers.\n       National Association of State Boards of Education.\n       National Association of State Directors of Special \n     Education.\n       National Association of State Title I Directors.\n       National Black Child Institute.\n       Natioal Council of Teachers of Mathematics.\n       National Education Association.\n       National Hispanic Leadership Agenda.\n       National PTA.\n       National Rural Education Association.\n       National School Boards Association.\n       National Science Teachers Association.\n       New York City Board of Education.\n       New York State Education Department.\n       People for the American Way.\n       School Social Work Association of America.\n       Union of American Hebrew Congregations.\n       United States Conference of Mayors.\n       Women of Reform Judaism.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Council of the\n\n\n                                Churches of Christ in the USA,\n\n                                   Federal Way, WA, February 2001.\n       Dear Senator: As members of the National Council of \n     Churches of Christ Committee for Public Education and \n     Literacy we urge you to consider one of the great moral \n     issues facing the 107th Congress--the Reauthorization of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act. As people of faith, \n     we act in the awareness that children are a gift of God, made \n     in God's image. The prophetic call for justice for the poor \n     and excluded and Jesus' deep concern for ``the least of \n     these'' reminds us that there are no more vulnerable persons \n     than children in poverty. Because education is the only \n     possible escape from poverty for millions of these children, \n     Reauthorization of ESEA, especially of Title I, is a deeply \n     moral issue. As you consider options in the upcoming debate, \n     we urge you to keep several fundamental principles in mind:\n       Increase funding for Title I to at least $10.88 billion in \n     FY 2002.--Full funding for all eligible children would \n     require $24 billion, three times the current $8 billion \n     funding. We support full funding of Title I and believe it is \n     important to begin moving toward this target, because urban \n     schools with concentrated family poverty need to be investing \n     significantly more dollars to compensate for the ravages of \n     family poverty.\n       Avoid punitive accountability. We believe accountability is \n     important but it must not be accompanied by measures that \n     further jeopardize the students who are already at risk.--\n     While Title I has been criticized for failing to erase \n     achievement gaps in this nation, Education Week (1/26/2000) \n     reported that, ``Title I provides less than 3 percent of the \n     country's total expenditures for elementary and secondary \n     education. If Title I is expected to close the achievement \n     gap, then conditions must be placed on how states and\n\n[[Page S4203]]\n\n     school districts use the other 97 percent of the funds.'' \n     Schools serving poor children depend on Title I funding for \n     virtually all discretionary innovative programming, because \n     state/local funding is inadequate and inequitably distributed \n     across virtually all the states.\n       Maintain the overall objective of the federal Title I \n     program. Resist efforts to convert Title I into block grants \n     (Straight A's Plan or Charter States Plan) to any states.--\n     The federal Title I program was designed in 1965 to \n     compensate for what experts agree is the uneven and unfair \n     funding for education at the local level due to reliance on \n     property tax. State governments have done a poor job of \n     compensating for disparities in local tax valuations; \n     according to the U.S. General Accounting Office, across the \n     country school funding in wealthy districts in 1998 averaged \n     24% more than in poor districts, even though residents of \n     poor districts voted to tax themselves at higher rates.\n       Ensure that Title I funds continue to be targeted to the \n     schools serving the highest percentages of very poor \n     families, and to the poorest school districts.--Title I was \n     designed to address the correlation of low student \n     achievement with family poverty. A strong federal Title I \n     program is even more important during the 2001 \n     Reauthorization because during the past 36 years, the poor \n     have been increasingly abandoned in the urban core as the \n     middle class have moved to the suburbs. Declining student \n     achievement is correlated with the isolation and \n     concentration of families in poverty in specific districts \n     and specific schools, and with the virtual resegregation of \n     urban schools.\n       Emphatically oppose converting Title I funds into \n     ``portable'' vouchers of any kind.--Thank you for your \n     attention to Title I, our nation's strongest effort \n     historically to ensure that no child will be left behind.\n     Jan Resseger,\n                                          United Church of Christ.\n     Dave Brown,\n     Presbyterians USA, Committee Staff.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Reform Without Resources Won't Produce Results\n\n\n  Education leaders Urge Senate to not squander opportunity invest in \n                           kids and education\n\n       Washington, DC.--Education and civil rights advocates \n     joined forces to urge the Senate to continue the fight for \n     adequate education funding and not squander the opportunity \n     to improve public education for all children. Following is a \n     joint statement from the 16 groups:\n       ``Reform without White House support for resources, won't \n     produce results. There is no single piece of legislation that \n     is more critical to our nation's children than the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Reauthorization Act--now is the time \n     for the Administration and Senate to walk the talk of the `no \n     child left behind' campaign promise.\n       ``Despite White House and Senate pledges of support for \n     public education, accountability, programs that boost student \n     achievement and basic civil rights are all in jeopardy in \n     both the President's budget and a negotiated package under \n     discussion in the Senate. Funding levels, civil rights \n     protections, no vouchers, teacher quality, school repair and \n     class size reduction must be resolved before we can support \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Reauthorization Act.\n       ``Those children who need the most help are getting the \n     least support under President Bush's budget. For example, \n     under the Administration's plan, Title I would only fully \n     serve one-third of eligible children in low-income districts. \n     In contrast, the Senate bill approved in committee would \n     double the number of children currently served and provide \n     more than $500 million in additional funding to turn around \n     low-performing schools.\n       ``Glaring funding disparities between the Senate and White \n     House proposals exist in the most critical education \n     programs. The Senate authorizes a much-needed increase in \n     education funding of $10 billion. Despite insistence that \n     education is the number one priority of the new President, \n     the Administration's budget provides only $669 million in \n     increases for public education funding.\n       ``Finally, we insist on strong legislative protections in \n     the ESEA bill that would ensure that federally-funded after \n     school programs abide by current civil rights laws. Friends \n     of education and civil rights could never agree to a plan \n     that would use taxpayer dollars to subsidize discrimination \n     in any way. This is just simply unacceptable.

Kennedy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \n         Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott, Senator Daschle, Senator Jeffords, and \n     Senator Kennedy: The nation's Governors call for full \n     reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     (ESEA) and support efforts by Congress and the Administration \n     to see this important legislation enacted into law in the \n     coming year. The Governors' priorities in this \n     reauthorization are outlined below.\n       The overall structure of the major ESEA reauthorization \n     bills currently being debated is to provide funding to state \n     and local education entities but to hold states accountable \n     for performance. For this structure to work effectively, \n     there are four key areas of interest to the nation's \n     Governors.\n       It is critical that the federal government not create new \n     accountability systems, but utilize the existing systems in \n     states. Any system of bonuses and sanctions should be based \n     on state performance over time as indicated by the existing \n     state accountability system.\n       It is important that new testing requirements are workable \n     and build on the state's current testing system. What is \n     critical is that every child in grades 3 through 8 be tested, \n     not who administers the test.\n       The federal government should insist on a strong policy \n     consensus in each state on how ESEA is implemented. This \n     means that it should require both the overall plans as well \n     as major funding allocations to be jointly signed by both the \n     chief state school officer and the Governor.\n       There needs to be adequate funding of new accountability \n     provisions, including full funding for the new testing \n     requirements. This means a yearly appropriation for \n     developing and implementing new state testing requirements as \n     well as a yearly appropriation to cover the National \n     Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) test.\n       Key issues for the Governors include the following:\n\n\n                               Governance\n\n       Elementary and secondary education policy is broadly \n     defined in state constitutions, specified in state statutes, \n     and implemented by school districts. Current federal \n     education programs bypass the authority of the Governors to \n     determine education policy for these programs by sending the \n     funds directly to the state education agencies. Coordination \n     of state and federal funds allows states to fully leverage \n     education benefits to meet state reform and accountability \n     goals. Therefore, the state education agency and the Governor \n     should jointly sign all state education plans submitted to \n     the federal government.\n\n\n                                Testing\n\n       Governors support the annual assessment of students in \n     reading and math in grades 3 through 8 and believe that a \n     combination of state and local testing satisfies federal \n     assessments requirements. The Secretary of the U.S. \n     Department of Education should have the authority to approve \n     a state's assessment plan as being in compliance with any new \n     federal requirement for annual student assessment if the plan \n     meets the goals of federal accountability policy. In \n     addition, Governors strongly support the use of \n     accountability measures but these measures must be determined \n     at the state level. Therefore, federal rewards and sanctions \n     in any particular state should not be based solely on NAEP \n     results but should rely on the state's own accountability \n     system and should be shared between state and local education \n     agencies.\n\n\n                                Funding\n\n       In exchange for higher accountability for student progress, \n     the federal government must provide additional financial \n     support to states. The Governors support an annual flow of \n     funding of several hundred million dollars to be used to \n     assist low performing schools at state discretion and believe \n     that no more than 50 percent should be required to be passed \n     through to local education agencies. Both the chief state \n     school officer and the Governor should jointly determine how \n     these funds are spent.\n       Recognizing that development and administration of state \n     assessment systems and the NAEP create a financial burden on \n     states, local education agencies, and schools, Governors \n     believe the responsibility for funding any additional federal \n     testing requirements in all states should fall on the federal \n     government. Although federal mandates may reflect well-\n     intentioned policy goals, they often impose unfunded cost and \n     regulatory burdens on states. Federal action increasingly has \n     relied on states to carry out policy initiatives without \n     providing necessary funding to pay for these programs, \n     thereby limiting states of their right and responsibility to \n     set priorities and develop policies that best meet local \n     needs.\n\n[[Page S4204]]\n\n       Therefore, the federal government should appropriate two \n     separate funding streams to assist states in financing the \n     federal testing requirements as follows. First, a yearly \n     minimum appropriation of $400 million should be provided that \n     is allocated to states to cover the cost of developing and \n     implementing the new federal testing requirements for reading \n     and math in grades 3 through 8. Testing every child in grades \n     3 through 8 would require testing four additional grade \n     levels, for approximately 14.7 million students, beyond what \n     is required under current law. At a cost of abut $27 per \n     pupil, the total estimated cost of assessing all students in \n     grades 3 through 8, beyond current requirements, would be \n     about $400 million a year. In the first few years states, \n     regardless of size, will incur similar costs for development. \n     However, in the subsequent years the implementation and \n     ongoing development cost should be calculated on a per pupil \n     basis. Second, a yearly appropriation of $165 million should \n     be allocated to states to cover the full cost of the NAEP \n     test and incentives for local participation. Within this \n     amount, $55 million in federal funds should be provided to \n     compensate and/or provide for additional inducements to \n     facilitate state and school participation in NAEP and \n     other National Center for Education Statistics data \n     collections, as recommended by the National Education \n     Goals Panel's Measuring Success Task Force, and $110 \n     million for the administration of NAEP.\n       In addition, states that have already developed the \n     assessments and standards being discussed should receive \n     their equal share of funding and should be able to use the \n     funding they receive under this purpose for other activities \n     related to ensuring accountability for results in the state's \n     schools and local education agencies.\n       Any new overarching federal accountability requirements for \n     states' public schools must also include a significant new \n     federal investment. Governors believe that strong \n     accountability systems are essential to driving reform at the \n     state and local levels and call on Congress to recognize the \n     federal responsibility in funding education programs. In \n     light of that sanctions for any new federal education program \n     containing accountability standards should not apply if those \n     programs are not adequately funded by the federal government. \n     The federal government has an obligation to fully fund \n     education mandates on the states. Without providing states \n     and Governors flexibility, autonomy, and adequate funding, it \n     will be inappropriate and impossible to hold states and \n     Governors accountable for meeting education reform goals.\n\n\n                        Performance Partnership\n\n       The National Governors Association (NGA) supports giving \n     states the option to negotiate a performance partnership with \n     the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education. Under this \n     agreement, states could choose to consolidate one or more \n     federal programs and federal funds into a single performance \n     plan in exchange for being held to higher levels of \n     accountability for improving student performance. If Title I \n     funds are included in the partnership agreement, states would \n     have to continue the targeting requirements under current law \n     for Title I.\n\n\n                            Teacher Quality\n\n       Governors support and recognize the importance of having \n     qualified teachers in the classroom and are undertaking \n     efforts to address issues of teacher preparation, licensure, \n     induction, professional development, compensation, and \n     advancement. Through these efforts, states are making \n     progress toward recruiting and retaining qualified teachers. \n     A state's performance should be measured against its own \n     progress and need for improvement, giving consideration to \n     the efforts being made by the state to ensure a supply of \n     qualified teachers, the supply of qualified teachers \n     nationwide, and the circumstances of small rural schools. \n     States should, however, retain authority to establish \n     specific criteria for teacher licensing and alternative \n     certification.\n\n\n                21st Century Community Learning Centers\n\n       The Governors support providing students with extra \n     learning opportunities to ensure that students can reach high \n     standards. Extra learning opportunities provide school-age \n     children with recreational, academic, and development \n     opportunities that supplement the education provided during a \n     typical school day. Research indicates that such \n     opportunities improve the health of students and their \n     ability to learn. Through the 21st Century Community Learning \n     Centers program, the federal government has helped local \n     communities create such programs. However, many states are \n     now providing some type of extra learning opportunities for \n     students. The federal programs run parallel to the programs \n     that states and localities operate. In an effort to \n     coordinate these funds and programs with the states' extra \n     learning opportunities program. Governors believe that this \n     program should become a state-based program.\n\n\n               Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities\n\n       The Governors continue to place a high priority on making \n     schools safe and nurturing environments for students. States \n     have used federal Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities \n     Act funds for diverse prevention efforts and they call for \n     the continuation of a specific set-aside to assist Governors \n     in implementing school safety and drug abuse prevention \n     efforts.\n\n\n                                  IDEA\n\n       While not authorized through ESEA, we would like to take \n     this opportunity to remind you that full funding of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) has long \n     been a priority to the nation's Governors. When the law, \n     formerly known as the Education of the Handicapped Act, was \n     passed in 1975, full funding was defined as 40 percent. \n     States do not have the ability to limit their special \n     education programs to the funding available and are committed \n     to ensuring that every student is guaranteed a right to \n     public education. Currently, the federal government's \n     contribution amounts to only 15 percent and states are \n     funding the balance to assist school districts in providing \n     special education and related services. Although Governors \n     strongly support providing the necessary services and support \n     to help all students succeed, the costs associated with \n     implementing IDEA are placing an increased burden on states. \n     Therefore, Governors urge Congress to provide consistent and \n     stable long-term funding for the federal share of 40 percent \n     of Part B services as authorized by IDEA.\n       The Governors look forward to continuing to work with \n     Congress and the Administration in developing effective \n     bipartisan legislation to reauthorize federal education \n     programs. We believe that our priorities for reauthorization \n     of ESEA can serve as a road map to developing a strong \n     bipartisan measure. Please contact us if you have any \n     questions, or you may call Julie Manuel of the NGA staff at \n     202/624-7880.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Jim Hodges,\n                                          State of South Carolina,\n                              Chairman, Human Resources Committee.\n     Governor Bob Taft,\n                                     State of Ohio, Vice Chairman,\n                                        Human Resources Committee.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This, we think, is a very compelling case, particularly \njuxtaposed against what we are going to be voting on this afternoon. We \nfind it troublesome we are not able to get the strong support from the \nadministration for the funding.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have that remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, since 1971 the Nation's schools have \nfaced increased challenges, including higher poverty rates, an increase \nin children with special education needs, and steadily rising \nenrollment, with barely adequate resources.\n  Listen to this. From 1989 to 1995, the education expenditures for \nstudents grew by less than 1 percent. Between 1994 and 2000, during a \ntime of increasing standards, rising enrollment, increased diversity in \nschools per pupil, expenditures rose by only 6 percent during that \nwhole period.\n  From 1979 to 1998, the national child poverty rate increased by \nalmost 15 percent. The numbers are going up, and poverty is going up in \nterms of the children. The poor children are becoming poorer.\n  We hear a great deal about what happened to these poor children. We \nhaven't seen an enormous blossoming under the title I program when we \nspend about 1 or 2 cents in comparison to what is being spent by the \nStates. We find that in most instances, cities which have the highest \nnumber of urban poor don't have the ability really to address this.\n  If we look at what the projections are going to be, from 2000 to the \nouter 90 years, we are going to double our population. We reach only a \nthird of the children now. We ought to at least commit ourselves to \nreaching all of the eligible children now. If we are talking about the \nexpanding numbers and extrapolated on that, the figures would be a good \ndeal higher. We are just talking about trying to do what is necessary \nnow.\n  From 1972 to 1998, the percentage of public school students who are a \npart of minority groups increased from 22 percent to 37 percent. From \n1989 to 1997, the enrollment of limited-English-proficient students in \nour Nation's schools grew by 70 percent. During the same period, the \ntotal enrollment of students grew by 14 percent. In the year 2000, \nStates reported more than 864,000 immigrant students enrolled in \nschools during this period of time.\n\n  This is what is happening. The poorer schools are expanding. There is \na great deal more diversity. More languages are being spoken. In my \nState of Massachusetts, there are 43 different programs for different \nlanguages in the schools to try to help students.\n  There is the impact of the breakup of the family with all of the \nfallout that has on children. We see growth in substance abuse and \ngrowth of violence in our society. There has been very little done for \nthese children.\n\n[[Page S4205]]\n\n  With the fashioning and shaping of this legislation which is going to \noffer new opportunity and hope for these children, the principal \nquestion is, What is going to be the commitment of this body to make \nsure that it is going to reach the greatest number of children?\n  That is what we are distressed about at this time. If we are really \ninterested in no child being left behind, we can't say we are satisfied \nwith the funding commitment of this bill because it will only reach a \nthird of them. If we don't reach out to the other two-thirds, this bill \nis effectively a cliche, a shibboleth, a slogan; it isn't real. And \nthere has not been anyone on this floor since we have been debating or \ntalking about this bill who has made the case that these resources are \nadequate to reach all of the children; they are not.\n  Under the proposals that on this side we support and that we are \ngoing to hear about with the amendment of Senator Dodd and others, we \nmeet the challenge as well under IDEA. Under the Bush budget, from 2001 \nto 2005, we will cover 4.2 million children out of the 13 million. \nUnder our Democratic proposal, by the year 2005 we cover every child. \nAnd the $250 billion that went to the other side, if the budgeteers and \nif the leadership of the other side of the aisle had taken the \nposition, would have come back in support of covering every child. But \nno; we are still back covering only a third. That is wrong. It is the \nwrong priority for this country because we are talking about the future \nof this Nation.\n  It is a mistake for the administration not to understand that we are \ngoing to continue to fight for this every step along the way until we \nget the funding for this program.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for his leadership not only today but \nthroughout his career on the issue of education. I would like to ask \nthe Senator if he would be kind enough to help me understand some of \nthe elements.\n  When President Bush first took office, he invited a bipartisan group \nof Democrats and Republicans to come to the White House to talk about \nsetting national goals for education. I thought it was a very positive \nconversation and dialog.\n  I know the Senator has been working with those on the other side of \nthe aisle as well as the White House to come up with new ideas when we \ndeal with education, whether it is accountability standards, testing, \nor improving teacher skills and the like. But I wish the Senator from \nMassachusetts would be kind enough to tell us how these ideas which are \npart of the better education for students and teachers are affected \ndirectly by the funding levels because as I listen to the Senator's \ndiscussion on the floor today, he is suggesting that the ideas may be \ngood ideas but, if they are not funded, too few children will profit \nfrom them. If we are talking about values for American families, \ncertainly we can't ignore two-thirds of our children and only help a \nthird of them.\n\n  Can the Senator give us some idea whereas this lack of funding will \nhave a direct impact on the education children receive in America?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has asked the absolutely correct question. \nWe are making the reforms in this legislation. The question is, Who is \ngoing to benefit and who is going to be left out, left behind?\n  This chart is a reflection of the budget where the appropriation was \n$3.6 billion for 2001. Under the Bush budget, there is requested $1.669 \nbillion--a 3.5-percent increase. That was the request for this year--\n$3.6 billion, down to $1.669 billion.\n  We weren't reaching all the children. I wish we had. I wish the \nDemocrats had done more in terms of education and the allocation of \nresources.\n  It is interesting. If you take the last 5 years of the Democratic \nadministration, we averaged a 12.8-percent increase in education at a \ntime when we were having the deficits in this country. Now we have the \nsurpluses in this country and we are finding out that we are willing to \nrequest only a fraction of that. We are still only covering a third, \nwhich can bring you to only one conclusion, and that is that tax breaks \nfor the very wealthy individuals, the 1 percent--we could take a small \nfraction of the tax breaks that are going to the 1 percent of this \ncountry, the top millionaires of this country. Only .008 of the tax \nbreak could fully fund title I. Imagine that. We are not even asking \nfor 1 percent. We are not even asking for a half percent, a fraction of \nthat. But no. No. We have to have the tax break.\n  I do not think that expresses the values of the American people. That \nis translated, I say to the Senator, into the children who are sitting \nthere in those classrooms today--whether they are going to get the \nsupplementary services, whether their teachers are going to get \ntrained. Today in the classrooms across this country, in the urban \nareas, 80 percent of them do not have math teachers. If they do not get \nalgebra in the eighth grade, they are never going on to college and \nthey are never going to be a participant.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will my colleague yield for a final question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I see my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, is in \nthe Chamber. I will be brief.\n  The Senator spoke about the dropout rates that face students in \nschools. I think we have all read the recent census data that suggests \na substantial increase in the Hispanic, Latino population in America.\n  The dropout rate for white students in America is 7 percent. The \ndropout rate for African American students is 13 percent. The dropout \nrate for Hispanic, Latino students is 30 percent. It is higher among \nLatinos, Hispanic American women, than those Latino populations.\n  I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, how can we have this \ndramatic increase of people coming into this country and dramatic \ndropout rates in this population without terrible consequences for our \nNation? Could the Senator address, in this final question, what we can \ndo, and should do, on this dropout side that is not going to be done if \nwe do not receive adequate funding supported by the Bush White House?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. Last year, there were \nabout 450,000 to 500,000 children who dropped out. It is a challenge as \nto how we bring them back in. There are a number of very effective \nprograms that are doing it, but they are dramatically underfunded. They \nare not prioritized either. We will welcome the opportunity to join \nwith the Senator as this process moves forward to see what we can do to \nfund them.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Maryland?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. May I have 5 minutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator may have whatever time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I ask the Chair, then, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Harkin has 41 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, yesterday I talked about the three R's \nthat are needed in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. If we \nhave reform--which I am firmly in support of--plus resources, that \nequals results. But if we have reform minus resources, all we end up \nwith is rhetoric.\n  So I believe we need to practice the three R's that give us the right \nresults: reform, plus resources, equals the right results.\n  One of the ways that we can really help have reform is by really \nbacking what we need to do to help our special needs children. We are \ngoing to be debating very shortly the expansion of the funding for \nsomething called IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. \nSome years ago, under the leadership of a former colleague, Senator \nWeicker, we passed legislation that said every child in the United \nStates of America who had a special need required an individual \neducation plan.\n\n  We gave that as a mandate to States and local school districts. We \nalso said we would provide 40 percent of the money to help pay that \nbill.\n\n[[Page S4206]]\n\n  In over the 20-plus years that IDEA has been in existence, we have \nonly funded roughly 15 percent of the cost to local school districts to \npay for these individual education plans for our children.\n  I hope that as we continue the debate on the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, and as we work on the bill, that one of our tools for \nreally increasing the resources, without us becoming the new \nschoolmarms or a Federal school board, is to fund the mandate that we \nhave given local school districts--to meet the individual educational \nneeds of our special needs children.\n  Some of these services can cost as much as $75,000 a year. In my own \nState, the average cost to educate a special needs child is roughly \n13,000 and the costs are rising steadily.\n  I will tell you, funding for IDEA is not about being a Democrat or a \nRepublican. But I can tell you, everywhere in my own State--Democrats \nand Republicans, parents and teachers, doctors and school counselors, \ncounty executives, mayors, commissioners at the local level keep \nsaying: Please increase the funding for the IDEA.\n  I believe that if we pass the Harkin/Hagel amendment, we could \nincrease the percentage of Federal IDEA funds to school districts and \nby giving them greater flexibility--open up the opportunity to make \nsure we cross the digital divide, hire the right teachers, and reduce \nclass size.\n  I do hope we have reform, plus resources, to get the results. And one \nof the ways to do that is to dramatically increase the funding for our \nspecial needs children. I do believe there is very strong bipartisan \nsupport to be able to do this.\n  I look forward to supporting that effort and trying to find a way to \npass this bill in a way that we can be proud of and that the parents in \nAmerica can count on, so that the children in America will believe that \nthe Federal Government is on their side.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and any time I might have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent the time under the quorum call be evenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FITZGERALD). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time to the Senator from Nebraska?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand under the previous agreement \nthere is time on the Harkin-Hagel amendment; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Senator Harkin has 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is that the total time on the amendment, just 30 \nminutes? I ask unanimous consent that 15 minutes of that time be given \nto Senator Hagel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the total time. Without objection, it \nis so ordered. The Senator is recognized for 15 minutes.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 360 To Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Harkin, myself, and \nothers, I send an amendment to the desk to the education bill to amend \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Hagel], for Mr. Harkin, for \n     himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 360 to amendment No. 358.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to \nfully fund 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure for programs \n                       under part B of such Act)\n\n       At the end of title IX, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. HELPING CHILDREN SUCCEED BY FULLY FUNDING THE \n                   INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT \n                   (IDEA).\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) All children deserve a quality education.\n       (2) In Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children vs. \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (334 F. Supp. 1247)(E. Dist. Pa. \n     1971), and Mills vs. Board of Education of the District of \n     Columbia (348 F. Supp. 866)(Dist. D.C. 1972), the courts \n     found that children with disabilities are entitled to an \n     equal opportunity to an education under the 14th amendment of \n     the Constitution.\n       (3) In 1975, Congress passed what is now known as the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (referred to in \n     this section as ``IDEA'') (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) to help \n     States provide all children with disabilities a free, \n     appropriate public education in the least restrictive \n     environment. At full funding, Congress contributes 40 percent \n     of the average per pupil expenditure for each child with a \n     disability served.\n       (4) Before 1975, only \\1/5\\ of the children with \n     disabilities received a formal education. At that time, many \n     States had laws that specifically excluded many children with \n     disabilities, including children who were blind, deaf, or \n     emotionally disturbed, from receiving such an education.\n       (5) IDEA currently serves an estimated 200,000 infants and \n     toddlers, 600,000 preschoolers, and 5,400,000 children 6 to \n     21 years of age.\n       (6) IDEA enables children with disabilities to be educated \n     in their communities, and thus, has assisted in dramatically \n     reducing the number of children with disabilities who must \n     live in State institutions away from their families.\n       (7) The number of children with disabilities who complete \n     high school has grown significantly since the enactment of \n     IDEA.\n       (8) The number of children with disabilities who enroll in \n     college as freshmen has more than tripled since the enactment \n     of IDEA.\n       (9) The overall effectiveness of IDEA depends upon well \n     trained special education and general education teachers, \n     related services personnel, and other school personnel. \n     Congress recognizes concerns about the nationwide shortage of \n     personnel serving students with disabilities and the need for \n     improvement in the qualifications of such personnel.\n       (10) IDEA has raised the Nation's awareness about the \n     abilities and capabilities of children with disabilities.\n       (11) Improvements to IDEA in the 1997 amendments increased \n     the academic achievement of children with disabilities and \n     helped them to lead productive, independent lives.\n       (12) Changes made in 1997 also addressed the needs of those \n     children whose behavior impedes learning by implementing \n     behavioral assessments and intervention strategies to ensure \n     that they receive appropriate supports in order to receive a \n     quality education.\n       (13) IDEA requires a full partnership between parents of \n     children with disabilities and education professionals in the \n     design and implementation of the educational services \n     provided to children with disabilities.\n       (14) While the Federal Government has more than doubled \n     funding for part B of IDEA since 1995, the Federal Government \n     has never provided more than 15 percent of the maximum State \n     grant allocation for educating children with disabilities.\n       (15) By fully funding IDEA, Congress will strengthen the \n     ability of States and localities to implement the \n     requirements of IDEA.\n       (b) Local Educational Agency Eligibility.--Clauses (i) and \n     (ii) of section 613(a)(2)(C) of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1413(a)(2)(C)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(i) Notwithstanding clauses (ii) and (iii) of \n     subparagraph (A), for any fiscal year for which amounts \n     appropriated to carry out section 611 exceeds $4,100,000,000, \n     a local educational agency may treat as local funds, for the \n     purpose of such clauses, up to 55 percent of the amount of \n     funds it receives under this part that exceeds the amount it \n     received under this part for fiscal year 2001, except where a \n     local educational agency shows that it is meeting the \n     requirements of this part, the local educational agency may \n     petition the State to waive, in whole or in part, the 55 \n     percent cap under this clause.\n       ``(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), if the Secretary \n     determines that a local educational agency is not meeting the \n     requirements of this part, the Secretary may prohibit the \n     local educational agency from treating funds received under \n     this part as local funds under clause (i) for any fiscal \n     year, and may redirect the use of those funds to other \n     educational programs within the local educational agency.''.\n       (c) Funding.--Section 611(j) of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411(j)) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(j) Funding.--For the purpose of carrying out this part, \n     other than section 619, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated, and there are appropriated--\n       ``(1) $8,823,685,000 for fiscal year 2002;\n       ``(2) $11,323,685,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       ``(3) $13,823,685,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       ``(4) $16,323,685,000 for fiscal year 2005;\n\n[[Page S4207]]\n\n       ``(5) $18,823,685,000 for fiscal year 2006;\n       ``(6) $21,067,600,000 for fiscal year 2007;\n       ``(7) $21,742,019,000 for fiscal year 2008;\n       ``(8) $22,423,068,000 for fiscal year 2009;\n       ``(9) $23,095,622,000 for fiscal year 2010; and\n       ``(10) $23,751,456,000 for fiscal year 2011.''.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the amendment we are offering today would \nfully fund the Federal commitment to the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, IDEA. When Congress approved IDEA in 1975, which \nmandates that States provide an appropriate education to students with \nspecial needs, it pledged to provide 40 percent of the funding. \nCongress has repeatedly passed nonbinding resolutions supporting the \nfull funding of this commitment. However, even with large increases in \nfunding over the last 5 years, from $3.1 billion in 1997 to $6.3 \nbillion in 2001, the Federal portions of the funds for IDEA has not \nexceeded 15 percent. This leaves State governments and local school \ndistricts to pick up the tab for this federally mandated program, \ntaking away vital local education funds and options.\n  There is no question of the intent of this legislation. There was no \nquestion of the intent 25 years ago. Surely there is no question of the \nrightness of the intent of this program today. IDEA has proven to be a \ngreat success in ensuring all children, including those with special \nneeds, receive a free and appropriate education across the United \nStates.\n  Prior to its enactment, only 50 percent of students with disabilities \nwere receiving an appropriate education. Today the majority of children \nwith disabilities are receiving an education in their neighborhood \nschools in regular classrooms with their nondisabled peers. High school \ngraduation rates for special needs students have increased \ndramatically, and students served by IDEA are employed at twice the \nrate of older adults who did not benefit from this program.\n  Congress did the right thing in passing IDEA 25 years ago. Today we \nare calling on Congress to again do the right thing, to fully fund the \ncommitment Congress made to this program and to the people of this \ncountry.\n  It is typical in a way of some of the things we do here in Washington \nto mandate a program and then leave the State or the local governments \nto pay for it. Congress said when it passed IDEA that it would provide \n40 percent of the funding, but 25 years later we are providing barely \n15 percent. This amendment will fulfill that commitment we made 25 \nyears ago and increase Federal funding for this very important and \nrelevant program.\n  This amendment increases funding for IDEA in annual increments of \n$2.5 billion until the full 40 percent share of funding is reached in \nfiscal year 2007. With these annual increments the amendment provides \nan additional $120 billion for IDEA over 10 years. The amendment will \nalso free up at least $28.9 billion and up to $52.5 billion in \neducation funds for local school districts by 2007. School districts \nwill be eligible for additional flexibility if the State certifies they \nare meeting the requirements of the law. Forcing them to pick up the \nslack for Federal funding of IDEA has caused them to take funds away \nfrom other important priorities that they, the school boards, the \nteachers, the principals, and the parents think are most important--not \nwhat Washington thinks is most important but what those closest to \neducation in America think is most important.\n  This amendment will give local education authorities and taxpayers \nthe ability to spend these funds as they see fit to fulfill their own \neducation needs. They could hire more teachers, build new schools, and \nincrease the technology in their schools. There are so many areas where \nthey could use this funding to help our children everywhere achieve a \nbetter education. This amendment will give them the flexibility to do \nthat.\n  This amendment fulfills a commitment Congress made but has never \nkept. It increases funding for education. It frees up money for local \nschool districts. It gives the local school districts more flexibility \nand at the same time fulfills the commitment to our disabled children. \nIt restores local control to local dollars. This amendment will help \nour teachers and our State and local school officials to provide the \nbest education possible for our young people. That should be our goal.\n  In urging my colleagues to support our amendment, I point out it is \nbecause Senators Kennedy, Jeffords, and Harkin, and many others, both \nRepublican and Democrat, over many years have led this effort to assure \nquality education for our disabled children. This amendment \naccomplishes what we set out to accomplish 25 years ago and more. And \nthe ``more'' part of this amendment is to free up local school moneys \nto allow those local school districts to put that money where they \nbelieve their highest priorities are for education.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum, \nand I ask unanimous consent the time not be charged against this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 360 to Amendment No. 358, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is an amendment at the desk in \nbehalf of myself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, and others. I \nask unanimous consent to send a modification to of the amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title IX, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. HELPING CHILDREN SUCCEED BY FULLY FUNDING THE \n                   INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT \n                   (IDEA).\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) All children deserve a quality education.\n       (2) In Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children vs. \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (334 F. Supp. 1247)(E. Dist. Pa. \n     1971), and Mills vs. Board of Education of the District of \n     Columbia (348 F. Supp. 866)(Dist. D.C. 1972), the courts \n     found that children with disabilities are entitled to an \n     equal opportunity to an education under the 14th amendment of \n     the Constitution.\n       (3) In 1975, Congress passed what is now known as the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (referred to in \n     this section as ``IDEA'') (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) to help \n     States provide all children with disabilities a free, \n     appropriate public education in the least restrictive \n     environment. At full funding, Congress contributes 40 percent \n     of the average per pupil expenditure for each child with a \n     disability served.\n       (4) Before 1975, only \\1/5\\ of the children with \n     disabilities received a formal education. At that time, many \n     States had laws that specifically excluded many children with \n     disabilities, including children who were blind, deaf, or \n     emotionally disturbed, from receiving such an education.\n       (5) IDEA currently serves an estimated 200,000 infants and \n     toddlers, 600,000 preschoolers, and 5,400,000 children 6 to \n     21 years of age.\n       (6) IDEA enables children with disabilities to be educated \n     in their communities, and thus, has assisted in dramatically \n     reducing the number of children with disabilities who must \n     live in State institutions away from their families.\n       (7) The number of children with disabilities who complete \n     high school has grown significantly since the enactment of \n     IDEA.\n       (8) The number of children with disabilities who enroll in \n     college as freshmen has more than tripled since the enactment \n     of IDEA.\n       (9) The overall effectiveness of IDEA depends upon well \n     trained special education and general education teachers, \n     related services personnel, and other school personnel. \n     Congress recognizes concerns about the nationwide shortage of \n     personnel serving students with disabilities and the need for \n     improvement in the qualifications of such personnel.\n       (10) IDEA has raised the Nation's awareness about the \n     abilities and capabilities of children with disabilities.\n       (11) Improvements to IDEA in the 1997 amendments increased \n     the academic achievement of children with disabilities and \n     helped them to lead productive, independent lives.\n       (12) Changes made in 1997 also addressed the needs of those \n     children whose behavior impedes learning by implementing \n     behavioral assessments and intervention strategies to ensure \n     that they receive appropriate supports in order to receive a \n     quality education.\n       (13) IDEA requires a full partnership between parents of \n     children with disabilities and education professionals in the \n     design and implementation of the educational services \n     provided to children with disabilities.\n       (14) While the Federal Government has more than doubled \n     funding for part B of IDEA since 1995, the Federal Government \n     has never provided more than 15 percent of the\n\n[[Page S4208]]\n\n     maximum State grant allocation for educating children with \n     disabilities.\n       (15) By fully funding IDEA, Congress will strengthen the \n     ability of States and localities to implement the \n     requirements of IDEA.\n       (b) Local Educational Agency Eligibility.--Clauses (i) and \n     (ii) of section 613(a)(2)(C) of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1413(a)(2)(C)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(i) Notwithstanding clauses (ii) and (iii) of \n     subparagraph (A), for any fiscal year for which amounts \n     appropriated to carry out section 611 exceeds $4,100,000,000, \n     a local educational agency may treat as local funds, for the \n     purpose of such clauses, up to 55 percent of the amount of \n     funds it receives under this part that exceeds the amount it \n     received under this part for fiscal year 2001, except where a \n     local educational agency shows that it is meeting the \n     requirements of this part, the local educational agency may \n     petition the State to waive, in whole or in part, the 55 \n     percent cap under this clause.\n       ``(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), if the Secretary \n     determines that a local educational agency is not meeting the \n     requirements of this part, the Secretary may prohibit the \n     local educational agency from treating funds received under \n     this part as local funds under clause (i) for any fiscal \n     year, and may redirect the use of those funds to other \n     educational programs within the local educational agency.''.\n       (c) Funding.--Section 611(j) of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411(j)) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(j) Funding.--For the purpose of carrying out this part, \n     other than section 619, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated, and there are appropriated--\n       ``(1) $8,823,685,000 for fiscal year 2002;\n       ``(2) $11,323,685,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       ``(3) $13,823,685,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       ``(4) $16,323,685,000 for fiscal year 2005;\n       ``(5) $18,823,685,000 for fiscal year 2006;\n       ``(6) not more than $21,067,600,000, or the sum of the \n     maximum amount that all States may receive under subsection \n     (a)(2), whichever is lower, for fiscal year 2007;\n       ``(7) not more than $21,742,019,000, or the sum of the \n     maximum amount that all States may receive under subsection \n     (a)(2), whichever is lower, for fiscal year 2008;\n       ``(8) not more than $22,423,068,000, or the sum of the \n     maximum amount that all States may receive under subsection \n     (a)(2), whichever is lower, for fiscal year 2009;\n       ``(9) not more than $23,095,622,000, or the sum of the \n     maximum amount that all States may receive under subsection \n     (a)(2), whichever is lower, for fiscal year 2010; and\n       ``(10) not more than $23,751,456,000, or the sum of the \n     maximum amount that all States may receive under subsection \n     (a)(2), whichever is lower, for fiscal year 2011.''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank my colleagues, \nparticularly Senator Hagel, for working so hard to come to an agreement \non this important bipartisan amendment. We have had some good give and \ntake on a lot of issues, especially on this one. I believe we have \nproduced a proposal that is good for our future, good for our kids, and \ngood for our taxpayers.\n  This amendment is really quite simple and straightforward. It says \nthat the Federal Government is finally going to meet its full \ncommitment which we set in 1975. In fact, I remember it well. Senator \nJeffords, the chair of the health committee in the Senate, and I were \nfreshmen in the House that year. Both of us were interested in \neducation, especially in issues that dealt with people with \ndisabilities.\n  In 1975, when IDEA was passed in the House and Senate, there was an \nagreement made by the negotiators on the understanding that this would \ncost our local school districts more resources in the future. The \nnegotiators agreed that the Federal Government's goal would be to \nprovide at least 40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure in \neach local education area. There was no timeframe put on it.\n  So, for 25 years after 1975, we continued to put more and more money \ninto IDEA but never getting close to fully funding it, which would have \nbeen 40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure.\n  The amendment that we have at the desk says we are going to put our \nmoney where our mouth is. We are finally going to be full partners with \nState and local governments.\n  This amendment fully funds the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act. It appropriates funds for the next 10 years, gradually \nrising so that within 6 years we are at the level projected to equal 40 \npercent of the average per pupil cost.\n  That is what was promised. That is what this amendment will deliver, \nplain and simple.\n  Let me clarify what the amendment does not do. This amendment does \nnot create a new entitlement program. It provides advanced \nappropriations for the next 10 years. That amount would be set in law. \nIt does not create an uncontrolled tap on the Treasury, so that \nwhatever the 40 percent costs are we would match. If we did that, the \nincentive would be to shift costs from other education programs into \nIDEA, and the costs would then likely skyrocket. We don't want that. \nOur amendment does not allow for that.\n  As Senator Hagel and so many of us have said so many times, this is \nnot a partisan issue. Both sides have worked diligently over the years \nto ensure that children with disabilities and their families get a fair \nshake in life, and especially get a fair shake in our educational \nsystem.\n  This really is a win-win-win amendment. With this advanced \nappropriation, students with disabilities will get the public education \nthey have a constitutional right to receive.\n  Second, school districts will be able to provide these services \nwithout cutting into their general education budgets. And in cases \nwhere all of the IDEA-eligible kids are getting the services they are \nentitled to, property taxpayers will get relief.\n  Here are some of the specifics of our amendment. First, our amendment \nwould set in law appropriations levels for IDEA, an increase in roughly \n$2.35 billion increments annually over the next 6 years. Currently, the \nState grant program within IDEA receives $6.34 billion a year. This is \nabout 15 percent of what we should be doing under IDEA. In other words, \nwe want to be at 40 percent. This is only about 15 percent of that full \nfunding.\n\n  Under our amendment, by 2007 we will meet the goal of 40 percent by \nappropriating just a little over $20 billion--$20 billion with a ``b''.\n  Second, our amendment strikes an appropriate balance between the \nneeds of our students with disabilities and the needs of our State and \nlocal governments. Students will get a free and appropriate public \neducation, and local schools will be able to deliver these services \nwithout breaking the bank of the local tax base which they have. Under \nour amendment, States could use 55 percent of the increased funds. That \ncould be used for local purposes or for whatever purpose they want.\n  Furthermore, if a local school district can show that they are indeed \nmeeting 100 percent of the needs of their students with disabilities, \nthey can use 100 percent of the increase we are giving them for other \npurposes.\n  We did not want an anomaly where if a school district was, in fact, \nmeeting all of the needs and services for students with disabilities, \nwe would then give them all of their money and they would use this \nmoney for student disabilities when they don't have any. If they are \nmeeting 100 percent of their needs, why should they get more money to \nuse for that specific purpose?\n  Our amendment says if that is the case, and they can show that, then \nall of the increases that would accrue under their local State agency \nto a local school district they could use for other purposes. Also, our \namendment provides a new measure to ensure that kids are being served \nappropriately.\n  Another section of the amendment says that the Secretary can look at \na school district and, if there is clear evidence that they are not \nmeeting 100 percent of the needs of their students with disabilities, \nthese increases then have to go to meet that 100 percent of need.\n  This provides a good balance. It allows those local school districts \nthat are doing a great job--there are a lot of them who are meeting all \nof the needs of kids with disabilities--they can use this money for \nother purposes. It provides the Secretary with the ability to go in and \nsay, No, you are not. In certain areas where they are not meeting their \nconstitutional requirements--and there are a lot of cases that do--they \nhave to use these increases for that purpose.\n  There has been a lot of talk about Federal mandates. Every year since \nI have been in the Senate--that is going on 17 years now--I have come \nto the floor to talk about IDEA and to talk about the fact that while \nwe should fulfill our 40 percent requirement or sort of a guarantee of \n40 percent that we put out there 26 years ago, the provision of \nservices to kids with disabilities is not a Federal mandate. It is a \nconstitutional mandate.\n  Two landmark Federal district court cases--PARC v. Commonwealth of\n\n[[Page S4209]]\n\nPennsylvania, and another case, Mills v. Board of Education of the \nDistrict of Columbia--established that children with disabilities have \na constitutional right to a free, appropriate public education.\n  Again, there is nowhere in the Constitution of the United States says \nthat a State--any State--has to provide a free public education to any \nof its kids.\n  Nowhere in the Constitution is that mandated. What the Constitution \ndoes say, however, under its equal protection laws, is that if a State \ndoes provide a free public education, it cannot discriminate and say, \nOK, we will just educate white males. It cannot say, we will just \neducate whites but not blacks. It cannot say, we will educate people of \none religion over another. If they are going to provide a free public \neducation, States cannot discriminate on the basis of race, sex, creed, \nor national origin. And with the two cases in the early 1970s that I \nmentioned, States cannot discriminate on the basis of disability. So a \nchild with a disability in America--in Illinois, Iowa, or Nebraska--has \na constitutional right to a free and appropriate public education.\n  In response to those two cases, in 1975 Congress enacted the \nEducation of Handicapped Children Act, which later became IDEA. It was \nto help the States meet their constitutional obligations. So even if we \ndid not have this, States would still have to provide the funds. But \nsince I believe, and I think many of my colleagues believe, that the \neducation of children with disabilities is a national problem, that we \nat the Federal level ought to at least live up to what we said 26 years \nago and provide at least 40 percent of the average per-pupil \nexpenditure for children with disabilities.\n  Again, that is what this amendment does. It does it over the next 6 \nyears, so that by the year 2007, fully 32 years later, Congress will \nfinally live up to its promise to our States and local education \nagencies.\n  Congress enacted Public Law 94-142 for two reasons, first, to \nestablish a consistent policy on what it means to provide a free and \nappropriate public education to kids with disabilities; and, second, to \nprovide Federal funding to help States meet their constitutional \nobligations.\n  Finally, the Supreme Court's decision regarding Garret Frey of Cedar \nRapids, IA, underscores the need for Congress to help school districts \nwith the financial costs of educating children with disabilities. While \nthe excess costs of educating some children with disabilities is \nminimal, the excess costs of educating other children with \ndisabilities, such as Garret, can be very great. We need to help school \ndistricts meet these challenges.\n  Earlier this year, I heard from the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City \nChambers of Commerce that more IDEA dollars will help them continue to \ndeliver high-quality educational services to every child in their \nschool districts. I have heard from parents in Iowa that their kids \nneed more qualified interpreters for deaf and hard-of-hearing children. \nOur school districts and our families need better mental health \nservices and better behavioral assessments of children.\n  Our amendment would let these folks do it all because, over the next \n10 years, my State of Iowa, I figured out, under this amendment, would \nreceive over $1 billion in new money.\n  Again, there are so many families out there where both parents are \nworking. They may be low income families. They may have a child with a \ndisability, and all they want for that child--a child they love, as we \nall love our children--is to make sure that child is not discriminated \nagainst, that child gets the support services he or she needs to be as \nsuccessful in life as their capabilities will allow.\n  I have heard so many times about how kids in classes, who may have a \ndisability--sometimes we hear this old saw about how they act up and \nbecome disruptive. Consider if you were like my brother, who was deaf, \nand you were in a classroom with a TV monitor but did not have closed-\ncaptions, and you were not provided an interpreter. After a while would \nyou get pretty frustrated.\n\n  Sometimes, because you cannot speak well, and you cannot hear, maybe \nyou would act out a little bit of your frustrations. What happens then? \nMaybe they would expel you--all for the lack of the needed services to \nprovide that free and appropriate public education.\n  I must say, my heart goes out to many school teachers in this \ncountry, especially in elementary schools. A lot of them have large \nclasses. I have seen as many as 28 to 30 in a class. Teachers are \ntrying to do the best they can to provide instruction to these kids. \nThey may have a couple kids with disabilities. These teachers are not \ntrained to handle kids with disabilities. They have never been trained \nto do that. They are not experts in behavioral assessments. They might \nnot have had any kind of mental health training. They probably have had \nno training at all for any one particular disability or another.\n  So I feel sorry for these teachers because they want to teach these \nkids. They may have a big class to teach, and yet they are not getting \nthe supportive services they need to ensure that kids with disabilities \nget a good education.\n  That is what we hope this amendment will do, to begin to provide the \nfunding, so that school districts can provide the supportive services, \nso that our teachers are not frustrated, and so that children will not \nact out their frustrations because they are disabled and are not \ngetting the support and the kind of services they need. That is what \nthis amendment is all about.\n  Over the past 6 years, as ranking member on the appropriation \nsubcommittee, I have worked with my chairman, Senator Specter, and many \nothers in the Senate, to improve IDEA funding through the normal \nappropriations process. I think we have done quite well. On a \nbipartisan basis, we have been able to almost triple IDEA \nappropriations in the last 6 years. I thank Senator Specter for his \nleadership in this area. So we are now up to 15 percent of the funding \nformula. But that is still not adequate.\n  That is why this amendment is so necessary. Yes, we can go by, year \nafter year, trying to get some money out of the discretionary pot. But \nthen that is always a battle. It is always a battle. With this \namendment, we will not have to fight that battle every year.\n  Let me make very clear what this amendment does. This amendment \nappropriates the money that is necessary to get us to that 40 percent \nlevel. This is not an authorization amendment, my friends. This \namendment appropriates the money. And it does it over a 6-year period \nof time.\n  I will read the words. The amendment says: Funding. For the purposes \nof carrying out this part, there are authorized to be appropriated, and \nthere are appropriated--so this amendment isn't just a lot of rhetoric. \nThis amendment isn't just a lot of flowery speeches about how we are \ngoing to help our States. This does it. This puts our money where maybe \nour rhetoric has been in the past. It puts in the money.\n  It lists right in the amendment the amount of moneys that will be \nappropriated next year, and every year thereafter, until the year \n2011. It sets forth those sums. By the year 2007, we will be at \napproximately $21 billion per year or at 40 percent of the average per \npupil expenditure. That is why this amendment is so critical.\n\n  Now we can say to our States and our local school districts that it \nisn't just the promise that next year we will try to do better, next \nyear we will try to do a little bit more, and yet every year they see \nthat promise is unfulfilled. This amendment actually means the money is \ngoing to be there. For kids with disabilities, IDEA is a downpayment on \nthe American dream. If we want adults with disabilities to succeed in \nthe workplace, we have to first help them succeed in school. Now we \nhave this amendment that will do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Stabenow, Dodd, Reed of Rhode \nIsland, Wellstone, and Levin be added as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Once again, I thank Senator Hagel for working so closely \non this amendment to make sure we had one that really did what we \nwanted it to do and did it in a cost-conscious and fiscally responsible \nmanner, to make sure we address what is the need out there, the need of \nkids with disabilities who are not getting served, and to help our \nlocal school districts that are\n\n[[Page S4210]]\n\nmeeting that need to be able to use this money to help out their hard-\npressed property tax payers.\n  I thank Senator Hagel for his strong work on this amendment; Senator \nJeffords, for his many years of support both on the authorizing side \nand on the appropriations side for kids with disabilities; Senator \nKennedy, for his stalwart leadership in all aspects of trying to make \nlife more fair for people with disabilities; Senator Dodd, who, again, \nhas worked hard on these issues through all the years; and my other \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time under the control of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Through all the years, while we may have had \ndisagreements on one little aspect of this, I have found generally on \nboth sides of the aisle a lot of goodwill to try to reach some \nconsensus on how we fulfill the constitutional mandate of providing our \nkids with disabilities a free and appropriate public education.\n  We have, indeed, come a long way since I first came here in 1975, \nwith the passage of IDEA, then, later on, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, early intervention programs and now, finally, the \nfulfillment of the promise we made 26 years ago that the Federal \nGovernment would provide the lion's share of funding to our States and \nlocal school districts so our constitutional mandate could be \nfulfilled.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will take a few moments to talk about the substance of \nthe Harkin-Hagel amendment and the reasons I support it.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment of Senator Harkin \nand Senator Hagel. I congratulate both of them for bringing focus and \nattention to this great opportunity and responsibility to the Senate. \nThey both deserve great credit. I am on the floor now with my friend \nand colleague, the Senator from Vermont, who has been a strong \nsupporter over his lifetime in terms of funding for the special needs \nas well. I know he will have a chance to speak to it. I think all of us \nare very grateful for their leadership, and it is appropriate, as we \nare coming into the Nation's choices about its budget and taxes, that \nwe get an idea of some of the alternatives.\n  This amendment to fully fund IDEA finally puts real dollars behind \nthe goal of full funding by providing $181 billion over the next 10 \nyears in increased funding for special education. Congress owes the \nchildren and families across the country the most effective possible \nimplementation of this legislation and the Federal funding necessary to \nmake it happen.\n  For 25 years, IDEA has sent a clear message to young people with \ndisabilities that they can learn and that their learning will enable \nthem to be independent and productive citizens and live fulfilling \nlives. Prior to 1975, 4 million disabled children didn't receive the \nhelp they needed to be successful in school. Few disabled preschoolers \nreceived the services; 1 million disabled were excluded from public \nschools. Now, IDEA serves almost 6 million disabled children from birth \nthrough the age of 21, and every State in the Nation offers public \neducation and early intervention services to disabled children.\n  That is a remarkable statement in terms of the American people, to \ntransition from this point where so many of these children were \nbasically ignored, shunned, placed in the shadows of the communities, \nand it has been extraordinary courage those children have shown, their \nparents have shown, schoolteachers have shown, community leaders have \nshown, and to awaken this Nation to its responsibilities to provide \neducation and opportunity for these children to live independent, \nconstructive, and positive lives is just virtually unlimited.\n  I don't think any day goes by when we don't hear another remarkable \nstory. I saw Leonard Slatkin just yesterday. I was commenting about the \nwonderful success the National Symphony had with its brilliant \nsymphonies; many positive comments have been made about it. One of the \ncomments made was regarding the percussionist, who is tone deaf, for \nthe National Symphony. Maestro Slatkin had indicated that this woman is \nprobably the best percussionist in the world; she has a general \nworldwide reputation. She plays the instruments with bare feet. She can \nhear the vibrations that are coming through the floor of the concert \nhall as she plays her music. She is able to produce just superlative \nperformances.\n  Every day we are all reminded of these extraordinary acts of courage. \nSo little of that would have been possible if we had not moved ahead to \ndevelop an IDEA program a number of years ago. IDEA now serves almost 6 \nmillion disabled from birth to age 21. Every State in the Nation offers \npublic education and early intervention services to disabled children.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I am glad to.\n  Mr. REID. I have been impressed with the Senator's statement about in \n1975 it became a Federal edict, in effect, saying we are going to \neducate the handicapped--mentally, physically, and emotionally. It is \nmy understanding, though, the reason this amendment is offered on a \nbipartisan basis by the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Nebraska \nis that the Federal Government hasn't been living up to its financial \nresponsibility to take care of these disadvantaged children; is that \ntrue?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. REID. So this amendment is to allow school districts to use the \nmoney they have on programs that are not mandated by the Federal \nGovernment. They can use the money that we hope will come from this \namendment to take care of the disadvantaged children; is that true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is entirely correct.\n  Mr. REID. Is it true that one reason school districts all over \nAmerica are just scavenging for money, desperate for money, is the \nnecessity that we all accept of educating these children? Is that true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is true.\n  Mr. REID. Well, I look forward to supporting the amendment. Again, in \nthis 50/50 split Senate, I look forward to voting for this bipartisan \namendment on this important issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Just to come back to looking at the history, when the original \nspecial education law was passed, the Congress intended to work toward \nthe goal of fully funding the 40 percent of the cost of educating \nspecial needs children--a child. After 25 years, the Federal Government \npays only 13 percent of the excess costs. This bill will obligate funds \nto reach the 40 percent, full funding, in the fiscal year 2007. So that \nis what this bill does. It meets the responsibility we have given to \nthe communities. I am sure in your own State, as in mine, you can go to \na very small community where they have maybe a severely challenged \nchild and the child goes to the local school. These extraordinary \nbenefits are for the child.\n  But these are extraordinary burdens to the community. The community \nwants to help the child, and suddenly they are caught up in something \nthey never anticipated or thought possible, and they are sort of left \nout there without assistance. If we recognize that we as a nation have \nadditional responsibilities in these areas of the very special needs--\nwe do this in different ways under the Medicare and Medicaid systems; I \nrecognize that--I think that helps define our humanity. But if we are \ngoing to define our humanity, we ought to at least be able to define it \nin a more complete way, and that is by providing the resources for this \nproblem.\n  I will just mention a couple of additional facts. I see my friend and \ncolleague from Vermont, who I know wants to say a word. Listen to what \nhas happened in the schools. The dropout rate for these students has \ndecreased, while graduates have exploded. The number of young adults \nwith disabilities enrolling in college has tripled. These results do \nnot come without financial costs. It is time for the Congress to help \nschools provide the services that give children with special needs the \neducational opportunities to pursue their dreams.\n  For too many years there were empty promises. The amendment of \nSenators Harkin and Hagel will help the schools and communities to meet \nthe responsibilities. This amendment\n\n[[Page S4211]]\n\nwould make IDEA mandatory, and by passing it we will free up \ndiscretionary funds that could be allocated to other critical education \npriorities. We can truly ensure that no child is left behind; that \nevery needy child has a fair chance at a quality education; that more \nteachers are better trained; that more afterschool opportunities are \navailable; and more schools are modern and safe.\n  This is another chapter, I believe, in no child being left behind. We \nwant to make sure that no child with special needs is left behind. We \nneed the funding for the title I. We want to make sure that the \nchildren with special needs are not going to be left behind. This is a \ncontinuum. We should free ourselves from: Well, look, we have increased \nthis fund, that fund by X percent, by Y percent.\n\n  What we are talking about is not leaving the children behind and at a \ntime of record surpluses, these are questions and choices. There will \nalways be reasons why we cannot. The question is, Do we have the will \nand determination? Now is the time.\n  I see my friend and colleague, the Senator from Vermont. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I \ncommend him for his statement.\n  As we all know, there is nothing more crucial in this bill than to \nmake sure we have the resources available to help the schools and \ncommunities meet the demands that will be placed upon them by the \nrequired standards. At present, those resources are not there.\n  I correct the Senator's statement on one matter. We do not fund 40 \npercent of the cost of the disabled child. We fund it at 40 percent of \nthe cost of the average child. That means we are really far from fully \nfunding the cost of a child with disabilities. Keep that in mind.\n  What we are asking for is 40 percent of the average child, but that \nis billions of dollars in shortfall. If one examines this bill and \nexamines the problems in this Nation, what I am concerned about--from \nthe perspective of the President--is if we do not have the resources \nthat are necessary to bring about the changes in our schools to have \nthese young people meet the standards which are going to be required of \nthem, then this bill is not going to reach its fulfillment.\n  I urge all Members to recognize that if they want to help the \nPresident's goals that are set forth in this bill, they are going to \nneed the resources. Fully funding IDEA will be a big step forward. \nForty percent of the cost of an average child is far less than the cost \nof a disabled child. This is what is draining the money out of our \nschool systems. This is what is putting pressure on property taxes in \nthis Nation, to the point that, as in my State and all across this \ncountry, more and more votes are going against additional resources for \nthe schools because we do not fund that 40 percent that we promised.\n  If we do fund it, then many of the young people who presently will \nnot be helped educationally or because of disabilities will be helped. \nThe President's goal will not be reached if we do not provide the \nnecessary funds.\n  I strongly support the Harkin-Hagel amendment. I want to make sure \neverybody understands that if we do not do this, this bill is going to \nhave a very difficult time reaching the goals which the President \ndesires.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to thank Senator Harkin for his \nwork on this amendment.\n  I've supported this proposal in a free-standing bill, and today I'm \nproud to be an original cosponsor of this bipartisan amendment. And as \nan appropriator, I have special concerns I want to share.\n  We agree as a country that we need to work together, in partnership \nat the Federal, State, and local levels, to make sure that students \nwith special needs get the support to succeed.\n  Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, the \nFederal Government is supposed to provide 40 percent of the average per \nstudent costs. But we all know that the Federal Government has not paid \nits share.\n  This amendment will make sure the Federal Government meets its \nobligation to support special education. This amendment will bring us \nto full funding in 6 years.\n  This amendment also has another important advantage. By moving IDEA \nfunding from the discretionary side to the mandatory side, we will free \nup about $7.1 billion for education. That money can be used to pay for \nthe costs the underlying bill imposes on States.\n  As I have mentioned before, the underlying bill creates a number of \nexpensive, and unfunded, mandates on States in areas like testing and \naccountability.\n  We can not just demand that students pass tests. We have got to give \nthem the tools to pass those tests. But funding all the requirements in \nthis bill will be difficult because of the limits imposed by the \nPresident's tax cut.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I'm trying to prevent a \ntrain wreck. I want to make sure the $7.1 billion freed up by this \namendment will go to fund the mandates in this bill. If that does not \nhappen, we will have to fund this bill's requirements at the expense of \nother priorities such as child care, higher education, and social \nservices.\n  So we need to pass this amendment because it is the right thing to do \nfor students who have special needs, and we also need to use the money \nthis amendment frees up to bolster our investment in education. That \nextra money should stay in the classroom.\n  I have received many letters and e-mail messages about the importance \nof fully funding IDEA.\n  I should like to share with my colleagues a letter I received in \nMarch from the Yakima School District in Washington State. It is from \nSuperintendent Benjamin Soria and Barbara Greenberg, who is president \nof district's board of directors.\n  They write that the Yakima School District serves about 1,800 \nstudents with disabilities, about 13 percent of the district's total \nschool population.\n  Unfortunately, the State of Washington only provides 12.7 percent of \nfunding for special education. And, as we know, the Federal Government \nis not paying its promised share.\n  As a result, they write:\n\n       The Yakima School District must supplement state and \n     federal funds for special education with local district \n     dollars, this year amounting to $850,000.\n       If the district were to receive full funding as promised by \n     Congress, it would amount to more than $3 million to be used \n     to meet the provisions of IDEA as intended 26 years ago.\n       It is time for Congress to make good on a long overdue \n     promise.\n\n  I received another letter from John Cady from Seattle. John is the \nparent of a child with a disability.\n  He writes:\n\n       I believe that by investing in the education of our \n     nation's children, we are enabling individual growth an \n     productivity that will ultimately lead to financial \n     independence and an adult life of dignity and self-\n     fulfillment. The dollars spent on our children in Washington \n     now are well worth the rewards both they and America will \n     receive in the long run.\n\n  Schools throughout the country are working to help students with \nspecial needs reach their full potential. This amendment will help them \nand will provide additional funding that we should use to support \nclassrooms.\n  Let's show the educators in Yakima and across the country, and \nparents like John Cady, that we will fully fund our share of special \neducation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Harkin-Hagel \namendment to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Act.\n  I have been a strong supporter of full funding for IDEA for many \nyears and hope that this amendment finally will realize that goal.\n  This Congress, I joined Senators Harkin and Hagel and many others as \nan original co-sponsor of S. 466, to fully fund IDEA.\n  Last Congress, Senator Jeffords and I twice offered budget amendments \nto fully fund IDEA, and I have offered many measures over the years to \nincrease funding for IDEA.\n  The Harkin-Hagel amendment offers Congress the opportunity to fulfill \nour goal of funding 40 percent of the cost of educating children with \ndisabilities and to strengthen our support for children, parents, and \nlocal schools.\n  When Congress passed IDEA in 1975, we set a goal of helping States \nmeet their constitutional obligation to provide children with \ndisabilities a free, appropriate education by paying for 40 percent of \nthose costs.\n  We have made great strides toward that goal in the last few years, \nhaving\n\n[[Page S4212]]\n\ndoubled Federal funding over the past five years. Nevertheless, we \nstill only provide 15 percent of IDEA costs.\n  In my own state of Connecticut, in spite of spending hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to fund special education programs, we are facing a \nfunding shortfall. In our towns, the situation is even more difficult. \nToo often, our local school districts are struggling to meet the needs \nof their students with disabilities.\n  The costs being borne by local communities and school districts are \nrising dramatically. From 1992 through 1997, for example, special \neducation costs in Connecticut rose half again as much as did regular \neducation costs. Our schools need our help.\n  Of course, no one in Connecticut, or in any state or community in our \ncountry would question the value of ensuring every child the equal \naccess to education that he or she is guaranteed by our Constitution. \nThe only question is how best to do that--and a large part of the \nanswer is in this legislation. This amendment would demonstrate that \nour commitment to universal access is matched by our commitment to \ndoing everything we can to helping states and schools provide that \naccess.\n  And, this amendment will help not only our children and schools, it \nwill help entire communities, by easing their tax burden. By our \nfailure to meet our goal of fully funding IDEA, we force local \ntaxpayers--homeowners and small businesspeople--to pay the higher taxes \nthat these services require. That's especially a problem in \nConnecticut, where so much of education is paid for through local \nproperty taxes.\n  If we're going to talk about the importance of tax relief for average \nAmericans, there are few more important steps we can take than adopting \nthis amendment. It will go far to alleviate the tax burden that these \npeople and businesses bear today.\n  Last year, the National Governors' Association wrote me that \n``Governors believe the single most effective step Congress could take \nto help address education needs and priorities, in the context of new \nbudget constraints, would be to meet its commitment to fully fund the \nfederal portion of IDEA.''\n  Over the next ten years, we're looking at a $2.7 trillion non-Social \nSecurity, non-Medicare surplus. I think that fully funding IDEA is one \nof the most productive ways that we can use a small part of that \nsurplus.\n  I ask that my colleagues seize this opportunity and support this \namendment and choose to help our schools better serve children with \ndisabilities. Because, I am tired of the false dichotomy that many \npeople perceive between parents of children without disabilities and \nparents of children with disabilities.\n  By fully funding the Federal share of IDEA, and easing the financial \nburden on states and schools, we can stop talking about ``children with \ndisabilities'' and ``children without disabilities,'' and start talking \ninstead about all children, period.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes in favor \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very grateful to Senators Harkin and \nHagel for proposing this amendment. It is very important. It is a \npromise long overdue.\n  If we look at what has happened since we created this program, which \nessentially is a mandate to the schools to ensure that they take care \nof the disabled children in their school districts, we have fallen far \nshort of our commitment to those children and to those schools. Every \none of us knows this, regardless of whether we are from Illinois or \nCalifornia, east coast, west coast, North, South.\n  The fact is, if you look at the chart behind me, what you see is that \nin 1996, for example, we voted $2.3 billion to help fund this program \nfor our disabled children when in fact our commitment really was for \n$12.7 billion. It goes right through: In 2001, $6.3 billion. Remember, \nwe added quite a lot, but it still is far short of the $17 billion we \npromised.\n  This amendment is about fulfilling a commitment and a promise to our \ndisabled children and also to the school districts all across this \ncountry that are doing so well at taking care of the children. As a \nmatter of fact, if you look at the results of this IDEA program, these \nchildren are doing so much better. Fewer of them are dropping out. They \nare living up to their potential. This is an important and a good \nprogram.\n  I will show this other chart that illustrates in another way the \nunfulfilled promise that has occurred. This is mandatory spending for \nour school districts. Yet that whole inner part of our graph shows how \nwe have had an unfulfilled promise. But we will gradually begin to \nfulfill this promise with this IDEA authorization that this amendment \nwould bring us, until we get to the point in several years where the \nneed and the Federal money, 40 percent of the program, actually meet \nand we are meeting our commitment.\n  For too many years we made too many empty promises. I know Senator \nKennedy believes strongly in this regard. I was pleased he asked if I \nwould say a few words. By committing to this level of funding, we are \nnot only keeping a promise, which is the moral and right thing to do, \nbut we are helping the children who most need our help.\n  Again, I hope we have a very good vote in favor of the amendment. It \nis extremely important that we keep our promise to these children.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand all time has expired on our \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two amendments are being considered \nconcurrently.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be \nyielded back on the Harkin-Hagel amendment that is now at the desk, and \nI ask consent that the question be put to the Senate regarding that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, may we add to that request \nthat the time until 4 o'clock be evenly divided between the majority \nand minority to speak on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Iowa modify his request \naccordingly?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I will modify the request accordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 360, as modified, \noffered by the Senators from Nebraska and Iowa.\n  The amendment (No. 360), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I compliment the Senators from Iowa and \nNebraska. We need to do more legislating on a bipartisan basis. This is \na very important amendment that was accepted in this manner, with the \nunanimous consent of the Senate. That says it all. This should set a \ngood tone for the rest of this bill. The reason I asked that the time \nbe set aside, there are some Members who still want to come and speak \non this subject. It is very important. Senator Wellstone wanted to \nspeak, as do others. I wanted to make sure they could do that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4213]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I was meeting with some people from the \nsmall business community. I was an original cosponsor of this very \nimportant IDEA amendment.\n  I congratulate Senators Harkin and Hagel. I understand we actually \nhad a voice vote on this amendment. I also congratulate Senator \nJeffords, Senator Kennedy, and others who were involved in drafting and \npassing this critical piece of legislation.\n  I point out to colleagues that by making IDEA part of mandatory \nspending and not leaving it up to the appropriations process year to \nyear, we have done something very significant. In the State of \nMinnesota, if we have automatic funding for IDEA--and I think we get to \nfully funding it over a 7-year period--then we are going to have about \n$169 million for education in Minnesota.\n  This is extremely important. I am proud to be an original cosponsor. \nThe voice vote is a good thing but it makes me nervous; a voice vote is \nan indication of strong support, which is what I take it to be in this \ncase. But I also must assert how extremely important it is that this, \nof course, stay in the bill through the conference committee. The word \nfrom the Senate today on this question is one of clear, unanimous \nsupport.\n  Speaking for my colleague, Senator Dayton, he is going to have an \namendment next week--and I will join him--that will accelerate the \ntimetable for funding IDEA. He feels strongly about it. He campaigned \non this issue and believes it is a longstanding commitment we have not \nmet. I could not agree with him more.\n  But for today, this is an extraordinary first step the Senate has \ntaken. I congratulate everyone involved.\n  In particular, I congratulate Senators Harkin and Hagel. I know this \nis near and dear to Senator Harkin's heart because he has been, maybe \nmore than anyone in the Senate, the strongest advocate for children \nwith special needs. There is some poetry and justice to the fact that \nSenator Harkin has led the way on this issue of funding.\n  I am proud of what the Senate has done today. I hope with this and on \na whole lot of other amendments we will continue to dramatically change \nand improve this bill to the point where we are really doing well for \neducation and children. I will take it 1 day at a time or 1 hour at a \ntime. This was important action. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business''.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I express the appreciation of all of us \nto Senator Hagel and Senator Harkin and their staffs and all those who \nhave been part of the effort to bring about this extraordinary and \nincredibly important resolution that will result in hundreds of \nthousands of children having better opportunities for their future. \nThis action that was taken here today sends an enormous message of help \nto many children who are growing up, not only with the challenges and \nneeds that normal children have, but who have the additional burdens of \nsome physical or mental disability or challenge.\n  It will make an enormous difference to their lives. It will make an \nincredible difference to their parents' lives. It will make an \nextraordinary difference to those who care for these children. I think \nit is really the Senate at its best. So I thank those two leaders. It \nseems to me you probably do not have to do much more than that, to have \nhad a very great mark on the lives of many people in this country.\n  I salute them both. This adds a very important, special, and extra \ndimension to this legislation. It will take time for the American \npeople to understand it, but it will make an important difference.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question? Does the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts agree that it also sets a very good tone for this \nvery important piece of legislation that one of the most important \namendments this bill could have was offered on a bipartisan basis and \napproved on a bipartisan basis? Doesn't it set a good tone for the rest \nof the bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It certainly does. I appreciate the Senator mentioning \nthat. The underlying blueprint reflects the best judgment of Members on \nboth sides of the aisle. It is a blueprint which I strongly support.\n  The real gap, as the Senator heard, is placing enormous demands on \nschools, on teachers, and on children. We need to have the resources \nfor the children. That requires funding, and we still are not there on \nthat particular issue.\n  But certainly with regard to the special needs children, this has \nbeen an extraordinarily bipartisan effort. That is of incredible \nimportance to this country. I congratulate our colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle. This is a very sound, bipartisan effort. We are \nenormously grateful for their initiatives and for the result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Kennedy in \ncongratulating Senators Hagel and Harkin on their amendment with \nrespect to IDEA. This amendment will guarantee America's 16,000 school \ndistricts a long overdue increase in special education funding.\n  The amendment proposes to fully fund part B of the IDEA over the next \n6 years.\n  One of my first legislative tasks, when I was a freshman Congressman \nin 1975, was to work on the first federal legislation to guarantee a \nfree and appropriate public education for children with disabilities.\n  Public Law 94-142, later renamed the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, was passed in response to numerous court decisions \ninvolving lawsuits against a majority of the states, and growing \nconcerns about the unconstitutional treatment of children with \ndisabilities.\n  In passing this legislation, it was Congress' intent to define a \nstate's obligation to students with disabilities residing in the State.\n  In crafting Public Law 94-142, Congress looked at the national \naverage per pupil expenditure and estimated that it would cost \napproximately twice as much to educate children with disabilities as it \nwould to educate other children.\n  At that time, 26 years ago, Congress pledged to assist states and \nlocalities in meeting the needs of students with disabilities by \nproviding federal funding to cover 40 percent of the average student \ncost.\n  Although numerous studies conducted since 1975 have verified that it \ncosts at least twice as much to educate children with disabilities, \nCongress has never provided more than 14.9 percent of the average per \npupil expenditure.\n  If we were funding 40 percent of the costs educating students as \npromised in 1975, we would have appropriated $17 billion for Part B of \nIDEA for fiscal year 2001. The $6.3 billion that we did appropriate for \nfiscal year 2001 falls far short of that commitment.\n  While I commend Congress for increasing the appropriation for Part B \nof IDEA over the years since 1996, it frustrates me to no end that we \nstill fall so far short of meeting our 26 year old commitment to fund \nout 40% of the costs.\n  However, this amendment will have a far greater impact than simply \nhelping students with disabilities. With the Federal Government's \nfailure to live up to its obligation under IDEA, State and local \ngovernments have been forced to incur almost all of the additional \ncosts associated with educating children with disabilities and putting \nundue stress on such things as property taxes.\n  Money that might have been directed to additional training for \nteachers, to hiring new teachers, to increasing salaries to retain high \nquality teachers, or to repairing schools, has instead gone to meeting \npart of the Federal Government's obligation under IDEA.\n  This amendment provides increased flexibility to states and \nlocalities by modifying the provisions that were included in the 1997 \nreauthorization of\n\n[[Page S4214]]\n\nIDEA which permit a local education agency to treat up to 20 percent of \nthe increase in the appropriation over the preceding fiscal year's \nappropriation as local funds.\n  Currently, a State or locality must maintain their share of the \nannual special education spending levels regardless of the amount of \nthe Federal contribution.\n  Our amendment would give local education agencies the flexibility to \nuse local funds in an amount up to 55 percent of the increased funding \nover the fiscal year 2001 appropriation for other local needs. In \npassing this amendment, we will be increasing our Federal commitment to \nmeeting the needs of students with disabilities, and we will be giving \nlocal communities the flexibility to use local tax dollars that are \ncurrently meeting the Federal Government obligation for special \neducation, for other local purposes and to reduce the stress on \nproperty taxes.\n  While I think the reforms proposed in the BEST Act are critical to \noverall reform in our education system, I feel it is unfair for us to \ndemand more of state and local educators when we have failed so badly \nin meeting our obligation to assist in funding special education.\n  Without question, we need to dramatically improve the education we \nprovide to all of our children. Some of this will come through the \nincreased accountability and flexibility we provide in the BEST Act.\n  Forty percent of our 4th grade students are not proficient in \nreading. Our 12th grade students come in near the bottom of \ninternational exams in mathematics and science.\n  The crisis we face in math and science was recently underscored by \nthe work of the Glenn Commission. Many of its recommendations, which \nwere also supported by President Bush, have been incorporated in the \nBEST Act.\n  But training and retaining high quality math and science teachers \nrequires money, especially when schools are competing in a tight market \nfor their skills.\n  Turning our schools around will not be easy, and it cannot be done on \nthe cheap. This amendment to fully fund IDEA should help us achieve the \nreform we all seek. We owe our children nothing less.\n  Increasing special education funding is a top priority for many \ndisability groups, for teachers, for school boards throughout the \ncountry, for local education agencies, for governors, and for children \nwith disabilities and their families.\n  I have a petition from every school board in my State. Vermont \nschools have made it clear to me again and again that their number one \npriority is to fully fund IDEA. These petitions serve as a sobering \nreminder of my responsibility to the children, and families, and the \nschools in my State.\n  I have no doubt that each and every one of us has heard similar \nmessages from your state education agencies, local education agencies, \nand school boards, and from the families of children with disabilities.\n  This amendment is a win-win for everyone. Children with disabilities \nwill get the services they need.\n  There will be more money in local school districts to hire personnel \nand to train or retrain personnel to work with children with \ndisabilities.\n  Schools will be able to provide more support to general education \nteachers who have children with disabilities in their classrooms.\n  More money will be freed up for other purposes such as general \neducation reform initiatives chosen by local communities.\n  School boards will no longer feel as though they are pitting the \nneeds of one group of students against another.\n  Finally, with predictable, substantial increases in IDEA funds and \nexpanded flexibility, school districts will be better able to undertake \nthoughtful planning.\n  Over the last few months, I have heard references to the need to \nfully fund special education almost every day that Congress has been in \nsession.\n  Our country is currently enjoying thoughts of a projected 5.7-\ntrillion-dollar budget surplus over the next ten years. We are \ndiscussing over a trillion dollar tax cut. The presence of this large \nsurplus and the possibility of providing substantial tax cuts provides \nCongress with the unprecedented opportunity to fulfill the commitment \nthat Congress made 26 years ago in passing P.L. 94-142. If not now, \nwhen?\n  The time for rhetoric is passed. The time to act is now. I'm glad the \nSenate has agreed to fully fund IDEA and make good on the promise we \nmade over 26 years ago.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont has certainly not \nlet the people of Vermont down who have been asking for his help on \nthis important issue. We have a long way to go on this bill. We have to \ntake the wins when we get them. This is a tremendous win, and we could \nnot have accomplished it but for advocacy of the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. I also ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nVermont yield me several minutes of time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. Terrific. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I serve today in the Senate, but for the \nlast 8 years I served as the Governor of Delaware, and for several of \nthose years as the vice chairman and chairman of the National \nGovernors' Association. I sometimes still think a little bit as a \nGovernor. On behalf of the Governors of this country in all 50 States, \nprobably, I give a special thank you to those who made possible the \nadoption of an amendment in this Chamber today that would provide for \nfull funding of IDEA, to meet the longstanding obligation from the \nCongress for programs throughout the country that are funded in this \nway.\n  I cannot recall how many Governors' meetings I sat in where one \nGovernor after another--Democrats and Republicans, from one end of the \ncountry to another--would say, if the Federal Government would simply \nmeet its obligations under the Individuals With Disabilities Act, if \nthey would only do that, we would be able to meet some of our other \nneeds in our schools--whether the needs are small class sizes, extra \nlearning time, or technology in our classrooms. The Federal obligation \nis that we would pay 40 percent of the cost of educating these \nchildren. Today we provide less than 15 percent of the cost of \neducating these children.\n  We have taken an important step in the Senate toward meeting that \nobligation. But it is only one step. It needs to be followed by other \nsteps when we go to conference with the House, to make sure that what \nemerges from that conference committee, and what we ultimately vote on, \nis a final compromise containing this provision. If we do that, then \nthe Governors of those 50 States and the parents--parents of hundreds \nof thousands of children--and the teachers in our schools will stand up \nand applaud.\n  I also say that as this bill comes to us today, I am encouraged. It \nis not a perfect bill, but it is one that offers the prospect of \nadditional investments from the Federal Government for our schools. It \noffers that money with a bit more flexibility than is the case under \ncurrent law. It makes it clear that we offer that additional money \ntargeted where the needs are the greatest, but it offers that money \nmore flexibly and demands results.\n  As we look more closely at the accountability provisions in this \nlegislation, once testing begins in earnest in the various States, in \naccordance with annual testing and in accordance with the standards \nadopted by the various States, there are consequences that come to bear \nfor schools that do not make progress in accordance with the schedule \nagreed to, adopted by the individual States.\n\n[[Page S4215]]\n\n  If a school is not making progress in meeting its own stated goals by \nthe end of the fourth year--if a school continues to fail its \nstudents--a number of things will happen. One is that those students in \nthat failing school must be offered the right to go to another public \nschool, where transportation will be provided by the school that is \nfailing, by the school district that is failing, using up to 15 percent \nof their title I moneys.\n\n  There are also three other things that must happen to that school \nthat fails for the fourth year in a row. One, it has to be closed and \nreconstituted as a charter school, or, two, closed and reconstituted \nwith a new administration and with a new faculty, or, three, turned \nover to the State or some profitable enterprise, commercial enterprise, \nto run the school--those three options.\n  I simply remind my colleagues, as we move past the adoption of the \nfunding for IDEA, we have to keep in mind the accountability \nprovisions. We have focused on more money and more flexibility, and I \nsupport that. But on the accountability issue, if children are really \ngoing to have the ability to choose another public school, we have to \nmake sure we include in this bill assistance to States and school \ndistricts across America to enable them to adopt public school choice \nstatewide. It is not easy and it is not free.\n  Secondly, if we are really serious about charter schools being a \nviable option for schools that fail 4 years in a row, we need to \nprovide assistance, including brick-and-mortar assistance, so that \nthose charter schools can be successful, so the kids going to those \nschools will have a fighting chance to get the kind of education they \ndid not previously receive.\n  I say to Senators Harkin and Hagel, who have worked for weeks on the \nlegislation to increase IDEA funding and to make sure we meet our fair \nshare of that burden, job well done.\n  To the Senator from Vermont, the chairman of the committee, and to \nSenator Kennedy, who has been very supportive, I give my thanks as \nwell.\n  On behalf of all Governors who have sought this support, sought this \nday, this kind of victory, it is a day to salute and celebrate for \ntheir children, for their students, and all of America.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nCollins amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am not going to propound an additional \nunanimous consent request at this time, although we are working with \nthe leaders on both sides of the aisle so we, hopefully, can have a \nfurther agreement entered into between 4:30 and 5. We will go ahead and \nbe able at that time, hopefully, to lock in the sequence of amendments \nthat will come after these two.\n  I announce to the Senate that following this vote, I will ask the \nSenate to begin debate on the budget resolution conference report \nnotwithstanding receipt of the papers. Assuming consent is granted, I \nwould expect several hours of debate tonight on this important \nconference report to be followed by a vote on the adoption of the \nbudget conference report.\n  Therefore, Members should be on notice that a vote is expected to \noccur late tonight on the budget unless an agreement is entered into to \nhave it at a specific time in the morning. We expect to continue \nworking tonight and go into the night, and we will get exact timing of \nwhen we might expect another vote hopefully within the next few minutes \nor within the hour.\n  If consent cannot be granted to begin debate before the paperwork \nenters the Senate, then a vote would have to be scheduled tomorrow.\n  I hope all Senators will cooperate, and I have every indication that \nwe will be able to get an agreement so we can vote on the budget \nresolution this evening.\n  Then we will also be able to enter further agreements with regard to \nadditional amendments.\n  I believe we are ready to go to a vote at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n359 offered by the Senator from Maine. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 100, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 89 Leg.]\n\n                               YEAS--100\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 359) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 361 To Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 361 to amendment No. 358.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To improve the provisions relating to certain assessments)\n\n       On page 47, beginning with line 13, strike all through page \n     48, line 14, and insert the following:\n       ``(i) a State may defer the commencement, or suspend the \n     administration, of the assessments described in this \n     paragraph, that were not required prior to the date of \n     enactment of the Better Education for Students and Teachers \n     Act, for 1 year, for each year for which the amount \n     appropriated for grants under section 6203(a) is less than--\n\n       ``(I) $370,000,000 for fiscal year 2002;\n       ``(II) $380,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       ``(III) $390,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       ``(IV) $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2005;\n       ``(V) $410,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;\n       ``(VI) $420,000,000 for fiscal year 2007; and\n       ``(VII) $430,000,000 for fiscal year 2008; and\n\n       ``(ii) the Secretary may permit a State to commence the \n     assessments, that were required by amendments made to this \n     paragraph by the Better Education for Students and Teachers \n     Act, in school year 2006-2007, if the State demonstrates to \n     the Secretary that exceptional or uncontrollable \n     circumstances, such as a natural disaster or a precipitous or \n     unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the local \n     educational agency or school, prevent full implementation of \n     the assessments in school year 2005-2006 and that the State \n     will administer such assessments during school year 2006-\n     2007.\n\n       On page 778, strike lines 5 through 10, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(a) Grants for State Assessments and Related \n     Activities.--\n       ``(1) State grants authorized.--From amounts appropriated \n     under paragraph (3) the Secretary shall award grants to \n     States to enable the States to pay the costs of--\n       ``(A) developing assessments and standards required by \n     amendments made to this Act by the Better Education for \n     Students and Teachers Act; and\n\n[[Page S4216]]\n\n       ``(B) other activities described in this part or related to \n     ensuring accountability for results in the State's public \n     elementary schools or secondary schools, and local \n     educational agencies, such as--\n       ``(i) developing content and performance standards, and \n     aligned assessments, in subjects other than those assessments \n     that were required by amendments made to section 1111 by the \n     Better Education for Students and Teachers Act; and\n       ``(ii) administering the assessments required by amendments \n     made to section 1111 by the Better Education for Students and \n     Teachers Act.\n       ``(2) Allocations to states.--\n       ``(A) In general.--From the amount appropriated to carry \n     out this subsection for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall \n     first allocate $3,000,000 to each State.\n       ``(B) Remainder.--The Secretary shall allocate any \n     remaining funds among the States on the basis of their \n     respective numbers of children enrolled in grades 3 through 8 \n     in public elementary schools and secondary schools.\n       ``(C) Definition of state.--For the purpose of this \n     subsection, the term `State' means each of the 50 States, the \n     District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n       ``(3) Authorization of appropriations.--For the purposes of \n     carrying out paragraph (1), there are authorized to be \n     appropriated $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, and such sums \n     as may be necessary for each of the succeeding 6 fiscal \n     years.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the role.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it has been so hard to get this very \nimportant education bill up and actually moving that I hate to let any \ntime go by without making some further progress. So we have been \nworking on both sides of the aisle, and I believe we have an agreement \nto allow us to proceed with the Jeffords amendment next and then go to \nthe Dodd amendment after that.\n  Mr. DODD. Dodd-Collins.\n  Mr. LOTT. No. I prefer to say just the Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I am just trying to help out.\n  Mr. LOTT. You are giving too much credit here, I say to the Senator. \nNo.\n  We would try to have the vote on both of these at 7:30. I think that \nis more than enough time. I hope that maybe even some time could be \nyielded back. That way we could make progress. Senators could attend to \nother business and then would be prepared to be here for those two \nvotes between 7 and 7:30, or not later than 7:30.\n  I also had intended--and hope to get agreement--to proceed to the \nconference report to accompany H. Con. Res. 83, the budget resolution, \nimmediately following those two votes. I was not going to try to get a \ntime specified as to exactly how we would use the time or when a vote \nwould occur. I understand that the Democrats are not prepared to agree \nto that at this point. And I cannot force it at this point.\n  I do think it is very important we get an agreement on the budget \nresolution as soon as we can so Members can know what to expect \ntomorrow, and/or Monday, and so that we could get this completed so we \ncan move on with our annual appropriations bills and also our \nreconciliation bill.\n  So I now ask unanimous consent that the next two first-degree \namendments to be offered to S. 1 be the following, and not subject to \nsecond-degree amendments: Jeffords No. 361 and the Dodd-Collins \namendment.\n  I further ask consent that votes relative to these amendments occur \nat 7:30 in the order in which they were offered, and the time between \nnow and then be equally divided and run concurrently on both \namendments, and there be 2 minutes prior to each vote for explanation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, other \nthan to say that we appreciate the leader not asking for the last \nparagraph of the request that is written on the paper in front of me. \nWe are trying to work that out.\n  As the distinguished majority leader knows, we are in consultation \nwith the ranking member, Senator Conrad. Senator Daschle has been in \ntouch with him. We are going to try to work something out as soon as we \ncan.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 361\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is right. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, my amendment will establish the Federal Government as \na full partner in the assessments that are required under this bill.\n  Earlier today, the Senate went on record, after 26 years, to fulfill \nits responsibility under IDEA. My amendment will ensure we do the same \non testing, only we do it today, not 26 years later.\n  If we want the States to undertake these extensive testing \nrequirements, we should be willing to pay for them. Each Senator I have \nspoken to supports the thrust of this amendment--that we avoid creating \nyet another unfunded mandate, especially at a time when we are asking \nmore and more of our schools.\n  Good tests are not cheap. They must be aligned with the State's \nstandard. They should measure higher order thinking, and they should \nconstantly be improved. This bill will not just require testing in \nreading and math but will also require standards in history and science \nand an assessment later on in science.\n  My amendment calls for close to $400 million in spending each and \nevery year to help pay for the cost of developing and implementing \nassessments. If the money is not forthcoming, the State's obligation \nwill be suspended until Congress meets its obligation.\n  The exact cost of testing cannot be known. I can tell my colleagues \nwith confidence that this amendment will cover the great majority of \nthose costs. I urge my colleagues to give me their support.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the committee \nfor drafting this very important amendment to the bill.\n  I have been concerned that we could be imposing an expensive new \nmandate on State and local governments through the testing requirements \nof this bill. Testing is very important, but I think we need to provide \nsupport. The chairman's amendment will ensure that the funding is \nprovided to help States and local school districts develop the very \nbest possible tests in order to assess the performance of their \nstudents and that we will be providing a good chunk of the money to do \nso.\n  I commend the Senator for his amendment and for understanding that we \nneed an assurance that that funding will be forthcoming before imposing \nthis requirement.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Vermont for coming forth with this \nimportant amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I know of no other Senator who desires \nto participate in the discussion. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Vermont for his \namendment. I would add myself as a cosponsor, but I don't want to get \ninto trouble. I will tell him I am for it and cast my vote when the \ntime comes. He has been a wonderful leader on education issues for many \nyears and cares about it very deeply. He comes from a great tradition \nin his home State of Vermont where Members of this body have dedicated \na good part of their careers to improving the quality of education. I \ncommend him not only for the amendment he has just introduced but also \nfor his tireless efforts over the years.\n\n[[Page S4217]]\n\n                 amendment no. 365 to amendment no. 358\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk offered by \nmyself and my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, and Senator \nLandrieu, among others, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself and \n     Ms. Collins, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Reed, \n     and Mrs. Clinton, proposes an amendment numbered 365.\n\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase the authorization of appropriations for local \n                       educational agency grants)\n\n       On page 31, strike line 23 through line 2 on page 32, and \n     insert the following:\n       ``(a) Local Educational Agency Grants.--\n       ``(1) Short title.--This subsection may be cited as the \n     `Equal Educational Opportunity Act'.\n       ``(2) Authorization.--For the purpose of carrying out part \n     A, other than section 1120(e), there are authorized to be \n     appropriated--\n       ``(A) $15,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2002;\n       ``(B) $18,240,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       ``(C) $21,480,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       ``(D) $24,720,000,000 for fiscal year 2005;\n       ``(E) $27,960,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;\n       ``(F) $31,200,000,000 for fiscal year 2007;\n       ``(G) $34,440,000,000 for fiscal year 2008;\n       ``(H) $37,680,000,000 for fiscal year 2009;\n       ``(I) $40,920,000,000 for fiscal year 2010; and\n       ``(J) $44,164,000,000 for fiscal year 2011.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes. Others may arrive \nshortly. In fact, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to offer this amendment on \nbehalf of myself and my good friend and colleague from New England, \nSenator Collins of Maine, among others; Senator Landrieu of Louisiana; \nmy colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman; and others who have \nbeen supporters of seeing to it that we have the goal--that is what \nthis amendment is; there are no mandates in

481.59\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. DODD. I note my good friend from Alabama is in the chair. His is \nalways the first State on the list. But just to make the point, \npresently there would be some 10 million children in the country who \nwould be served by title I out of the 55 million children who go to \nschool. In the case of Alabama, there would be 192,377 children who \nwould be served if we had full funding. That number today is about a \nthird of that number, a third of the 192.\n  If we go down the list--and what I have provided in the first column \nis what full funding would provide--and look at the number under your \nState and then calculate what one-third of that number is, you would \nget a rough idea of what the present number of children is who are \nbeing served. Of course, the number itself reflects what\n\n[[Page S4218]]\n\nfull funding would amount to in all 50 States. That is what this chart \nprovides.\n  As we know, our society is based on the promise of equal opportunity, \nnot equal success. None of us bears an obligation to guarantee the \nsuccess of anyone, but we all share the common goal that everyone ought \nto have an equal opportunity to succeed.\n  This amendment, offered on behalf of myself and my colleague from \nMaine, and others, is designed to see to it that, as we ask for in this \nlegislation, as we will over the coming days, there be greater \naccountability at the local level--in fact, a requirement of additional \ntesting--so that we don't just socially promote students through the \neducational process; that we have some data about how students are \ndoing--taking their temperature, in effect.\n  Imagine, if you would, taking a temperature every year to see how the \npatient is doing. We know that just taking the temperature doesn't make \na child better. We may get some idea of their health, but we don't \nreally know or are not really providing any medicine that they need in \norder to improve the quality of their health.\n  What title I does, and what it has done historically, is to provide \nthat needed medicine, which I will demonstrate in these remarks, to the \nmost disadvantaged children in our society. Title I represents about \none-third, or a half, almost, of the entire Federal dollar commitment \nto education in the country. It is what our primary responsibility has \nbeen over the last 35 years since we decided to enact the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act.\n  Just to back up a little bit and put this in perspective, the Federal \nGovernment, when it comes to elementary and secondary education--this \nmay come as a shock to some--allocates between one-half and 1 percent \nof our entire Federal budget to elementary and secondary education. If \nwe add higher education, that number jumps to about 2 percent of the \nentire Federal budget. If we exclude higher education and just take \nelementary and secondary, it is between one-half and 1 percent of the \nentire Federal budget. That is our commitment.\n  If you take the amount of money being spent on elementary and \nsecondary education, for every dollar that is spent, that one-half of 1 \npercent amounts to somewhere between 4 and 7 cents on the dollar. In \nother words, for every dollar that is spent to improve or invest in the \nelementary and secondary education needs of America's children, about \n94 or 95 cents comes from our local communities or our States, and \nabout 5 or 6 cents comes from your Federal Government. That is one-half \nof 1 percent of the Federal budget.\n  So when we start talking about title I, which was designed to go to \nthe neediest districts in both rural and urban areas, we are talking \nabout a sizable percentage of that 4 or 5 cents on the dollar. Yet we \nhave never gotten to the full funding of title I since we initiated it \n35 years ago. We are only serving about a third of title I eligible \nchildren in the country. So what the Senator from Maine, myself, and \nothers are saying is that sometime over the next 10 years we have laid \nout a schedule, but obviously the schedule is an authorization subject \nto whatever changes this body and the other body and the President \nwould like to adopt. Then we could modify this formula.\n  We have laid out a formula for our colleagues that doesn't mandate \nanything. It just sets out a goal and says that as we are going to test \nchildren, as we are going to ask for greater accountability, we also \nwant you to know that we believe as a goal that we ought to fully fund \ntitle I to give these children a chance to reach their maximum \npotential educationally. That is what this amendment is really designed \nto do.\n  Let me lay it out a little bit. Congress passed the ESEA to help \nprovide disadvantaged children with an education to enable them to take \nadvantage of America's promise of equal opportunity, and the primary \nmechanism for delivering on that promise has been title I grants for \nschools.\n  Title I does more than just serve all eligible children. The reason \nwhy is simple: According to the Congressional Research Service, \nCongress funds title I grants to local education agencies at only about \none-third of the amount allowed under the formula.\n  Twenty percent of schools with poverty levels between 50 and 75 \npercent receive no funds at all. Let me repeat that. Twenty percent of \nall the schools in America with poverty levels between 50 and 75 \npercent do not receive any title I funds today at all. And 36 percent \nof schools with poverty rates between 35 and 50 percent do not receive \nany funds.\n  So it is quite clear that an awful lot of eligible children that are \nclearly disadvantaged, by any standard, are not getting the kind of \nhelp that we originally envisioned with title I. About one-third are, \nif you take the country as a whole. Some areas get zero.\n  So our goal with this amendment, without mandating anything, is to \nsay that over the next 10 years we would like to get as close to living \nup to and fulfilling the promise made of serving these children.\n  The bill we are debating will impose, as we know, some significant \ntesting and accountability standards, many of which I think most \ncolleagues support, on States and local schools. I think all of us \nagree--although the devil is in the details--that we need to know how \nstudents are doing in school and that States and schools need to be \naccountable for educating our children.\n  We need to remember that testing and accountability aren't the same \nas reform. They measure reform, or they measure how students are doing, \nbut they are not reform in and of themselves. Some of my colleagues \nhave said that we should not provide schools with more resources until \nwe have implemented these reforms.\n\n  This bill would require schools to set the goal of having all \nchildren become proficient in reading and math in 10 years. That is \nwhat the bill says. It only makes sense that we in Congress set a goal \nfor ourselves of providing districts with the resources over the 10 \nyears that they and the students and schools will need to meet the \ngoals of proficiency in reading and math. That is reform.\n  Some often talk about the importance of communities, not the Federal \nGovernment, in making decisions about education policy. I don't \ndisagree with that at all.\n  Mr. President, this is a very important point I want to make here \nbecause I think this gets lost, and sometimes we talk about titles and \nnumbers and programs and you can glaze over the eyes of even the most \ninterested listener when you start talking in acronyms and numbers and \nso forth. Average people who even care about education can get lost in \nall of this. But this is a very important point I want to make about \ntitle I because I think there are a lot of misimpressions about how \ntitle I funds are allocated and what it means if you get title I funds \nin your town and school.\n  Title I funds are used in a completely flexible fashion--completely \nflexible--if you are a qualified district and the students are \nqualified. There has been great flexibility. Schools, for instance, use \ntitle I funds to hire new teachers and provide them with professional \ndevelopment. Title I funds are used to provide new technology in \nschools if the district desires it and thinks that is the best way to \nimprove their education. They use title I funds to implement cutting-\nedge research based on new academic programs to provide better, more \nintensive instruction in reading and math to students with the greatest \neducational need. They use title I funds to support preschool and \nafterschool activities. They can be used to support any number of other \nactivities to increase student achievement.\n  The only goal required in the title I that we have ever mandated is \nthat they should be designed to reach eligible children and to increase \nstudent achievement. That is it. So at the local level, if you are a \nqualified student or qualified school district and you are designing a \nprogram to increase student achievement, then title I funds can be \nused. That is all we really require.\n  Despite the rumors and the misinformation about title I, this is not \nsome narrowly construed, highly narrow Federal mandate. We really do \nallow great flexibility.\n  Contrary to what some have also argued, schools have been \nimplementing reforms, and we need to do more to help them. The \nDepartment of Education 1999 National Assessment of title I, which was \ndone, I might add, in\n\n[[Page S4219]]\n\nconsultation with an independent review panel, found the following: \nSince 1992, national reading performance has improved for nine-year-\nolds in the highest poverty public schools, regaining lost ground in \nthe late 1980s and early 1990s. Since 1992, math achievement also has \nimproved among students in the highest poverty public schools.\n  Another study, which I have put up here for the edification of those \nwho might like to see it, found in 1999 that students receiving title I \nservices increased their reading achievement in 21 of 24 urban \ndistricts studied, and increased their math achievement in 20 of 24 \nurban districts studied.\n\n  Mr. President, it is apparently working. Again, I come back to the \nfact that there were a significant number of school districts where \nstudents were not receiving any funds. But where they are, it is making \na difference.\n  In 2000, the Rand Corporation found that the largest gains in test \nscores over the last 30 years have been made by African American, \nHispanic, and white disadvantaged students when title I funds have been \nexpended.\n  A study published this year concluded that, ``Whenever an inner city \nor poor rural school is found to be achieving outstanding results with \nits students by implementing innovative strategies, these innovations \nare almost invariably funded primarily by title I.''\n  Mr. President, these title I funds are making a difference. They \nreally make a difference. Our goal is not to mandate these funds, but \nto say that if over the next 10 years we really want to raise the level \nof achievement, and if we are going to test people over the next 10 \nyears to reach full proficiency in math and reading, our goal is to \nfully fund this program that is making a difference today.\n  Some of my colleagues say that although we have spent about $120 \nbillion on title I since 1965--which is true. Over the last 35 years, \nwe have spent about $120 billion in this program--there is still a huge \nachievement gap. There is; they are right. Even the numbers showing \nimprovement don't really deserve to be heralded too much because where \nthey started from was so low that while it is improvement, it is not a \nlevel that any one of us would accept as satisfactory, but clearly \nthere has been. Therefore, they say, because we spent this amount of \nmoney and still have an achievement gap, we should not spend any more \nmoney until we get the reforms.\n  Let's keep in mind that title I spending represents only about 3 \npercent of all spending on elementary and secondary education \nnationally. Let's not blame all the problems on title I. It is such a \ntiny percentage. Again, you start talking about a dollar being spent, \nand I mentioned that about 5 or 6 cents is the Federal commitment, and \nof the 5 or 6 cents, about 3 cents is title I. So when people say your \ntitle I money is a waste of money because the 3 cents isn't working, \nremember, there is about 95 cents that we ought to look at in terms of \nwhere that is going. So title I funds are important.\n  Many experts argue that to the extent there is still an achievement \ngap, as I said, title I has kept it from growing even greater. I think \nthat is probably a more accurate statement.\n  The new Secretary of Education, Secretary Paige, the former \nsuperintendent of schools in Houston, TX, has often spoken about the \nneed to shine a spotlight on those schools so that parents and the \npublic will bring pressure to bear where schools aren't doing their \njob.\n  I could not agree more. The parents and public have a right to know \nhow the schools are doing and a responsibility to get involved. But if \nwe do not provide schools with the resources they need to implement \nreforms, then all of the testing and accountability in the world is not \ngoing to make any difference.\n  As my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, has often said--and \nI think it is a good statement--resources without reforms may be a \nwaste of money, but reforms without resources are a waste of time. And \nI agree with that statement. Testing and accountability without more \nresources are an unfunded mandate, however well-intentioned.\n  No one questions the need for reform and no one should question the \nneed for more resources for the full funding of title I. Congress \npassed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 36 years ago because \nof the achievement gap, and we need to provide schools with the \nresources to close it.\n  This again does not mandate dollars. It sets the goal over 10 years. \nMany agree if we do not have an adequate allocation of resources that \nwe may be creating an unfunded mandate, where we are going to shut down \nschools, close the doors, without providing the financial backing that \nis needed.\n  As I said, only 2 cents of every dollar go to education, and less \nthan that, in fact, if you are talking about elementary and secondary \neducation. Eighty percent of American citizens approve more than \ndoubling the Federal investment in education in the next 5 years. We \nare talking about a 10-year commitment.\n  I know all of us are interested in closing the education gap for \ndisadvantaged students. This amendment, while an authorization, is an \nimportant step in that direction.\n  We will have further debates on the appropriations bill down the \nroad. There will have to be an agreement struck between the White House \nand Congress, but many of us, Democrats and Republicans, would like to \ngo on record that over the next 10 years we ought to try to get it. \nThere may be other reasons that get in the way, but sending a message \nto America that we care about this; that as an authorizing bill these \ngoals are commendable and deserving of bipartisan support in this body.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Maine who I know wants to be \nheard. There are several other Members who want to be heard on title I. \nI have already taken more time than I should have. I apologize to my \ncolleagues. I thank my colleague from Maine.\n  I mentioned earlier my colleague from Vermont who has done so much on \neducation issues, but Senator Collins from Maine, from the day she \narrived, has been committed to these issues.\n  There are many reasons why I enjoy my service on the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee--I think that is the right \nname. We sometimes change the names of the committees, the education \ncommittee--but no more significant reason than serving with the Senator \nfrom Maine whom I have joined on numerous occasions on a variety of \nefforts where we find common ground. We have on this amendment, Mr. \nPresident, and I am delighted to join her in this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield time to my colleague from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I first commend the Senator from \nConnecticut for his extraordinary efforts. He has such a commitment to \nimproving the education of disadvantaged children. He has been a leader \nin this effort, and I am very honored and pleased to join him tonight \nas his principal cosponsor of a very important amendment.\n  We talked a great deal during the past few days about what the proper \nrole is for the Federal Government with regard to education. We all \nagree that States and local communities have the primary responsibility \nfor education, but since the mid-1960s, when the Federal Government \nfirst passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the role of \nthe Federal Government has been to promote educational equity, to try \nto narrow that persistent and troubling achievement gap between \ndisadvantaged children and their peers. That is the reason the Federal \nGovernment is involved at all in education. It is to help with the \neducation of the poorest children in this country, to help ensure they \nhave the same opportunities as children from more affluent families.\n  Title I authorizes Federal aid to State and local education agencies \nfor the education of these disadvantaged children. Title I grants are \nused to provide supplementary educational and other services to low-\nachieving children attending schools with relatively high \nconcentrations of pupils from low-income families.\n  Much has been made of the fact that more than $120 billion has been \npoured in to title I programs over the past 35\n\n[[Page S4220]]\n\nyears with not much to show for results. I understand that argument, \nand I am concerned that we have not made more progress in providing \neducational opportunities to disadvantaged children, but I firmly \nbelieve that is about to change.\n  We are not talking about putting considerably more money and doing \nthings in exactly the same manner. We are not talking about pouring \nmore money into a failed system. Instead, what we are putting forth \nwith this bill is a new approach, a reformed system, a system that sets \nforth the goal of leaving no child behind, including and especially \nthose children from disadvantaged families.\n  We are talking about having accountability, of holding schools \nresponsible for what really counts, and that is improving student \nachievement. We are changing the focus from regulations and rules to \nresults. We are asking the right questions. We are asking the question, \n``are our children learning?'' And not, ``Was that form filled out \ncorrectly?'' That is a fundamentally different approach to education \npolicy.\n  With the leadership of President Bush and the Members on both sides \nof the aisle, the Senate has produced landmark legislation, the BEST \nAct, legislation that I believe may well be the most important bill we \nconsider this year. It is legislation that I believe will help turn \naround many failing schools across America.\n  With this act, we are making a fundamental change in our expectations \nfor our schools. We are rejecting what President Bush has so eloquently \ncalled the soft bigotry of low expectations. But along with reforming \nthe system, as we are imposing these new requirements and holding \nschools accountable for improved student achievement, we need to \nprovide some assistance with the financial aspects of reform.\n  The amendment I have cosponsored with Senator Dodd will do just that. \nOur amendment authorizes the Federal Government to provide the poorest \nschools in our country with significant additional funding over the \nnext 10 years. Our effort would set the goal of fully funding title I \nprograms by the year 2011.\n  We may not be able to do it. We may not be able to produce the \nappropriations over the next 10 years that match these authorization \nlevels, but shouldn't we set forth the goal of doing so?\n  Shouldn't we challenge ourselves, just as we are challenging schools, \nparents, teachers, administrators, school boards, and students all over \nthis great Nation to increase their standards, to set high standards \nfor our children, and to hold schools accountable for improving student \nachievement?\n  Shouldn't we, too, set high standards for ourselves? Shouldn't we \nchallenge ourselves to meet the goal of fully funding title I?\n  That is what our amendment proposes.\n  We should be troubled by the growing achievement gap between \ndisadvantaged students and their peers. Recent test results suggest we \nare going in the wrong direction, that the students who are performing \nthe worst are actually getting worse. We cannot accept that. We have to \nmake the difference.\n  The system has failed to narrow this persistent and troubling \nachievement gap over the past 35 years. That is why we need the \nfundamental reforms included in this legislation. But it is also why we \nneed to put more resources into the system to support these new \nreforms.\n  We have set these challenging goals for the schools of America. Let \nmembers set an equally challenging goal for ourselves to fully fund \ntitle I. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to join \nwith the Senator from Connecticut and with me in setting this goal for \nAmerica's schools.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Maine for her eloquent statement. \nI know my colleague from Tennessee wants to make some remarks, and I \nyield whatever time he may consume.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have two amendments on the floor now. My \ncolleague from Vermont talked 30 minutes ago about an amendment that is \nvery important that I want to elaborate on and express my support for, \nwhile addressing some of the issues that, to me, are very important. It \nis important the American people understand the significance of that \nparticular amendment.\n  Earlier today we addressed the issue of fulfilling an obligation on \nbehalf of our Government, an obligation we made through a mandate \ncalled IDEA, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  As we debated in this body in the past we put a mandate on local \nschools and school districts and on States to fulfill a very important \nobligation. That mandate was to make absolutely sure we didn't leave \nindividuals with disabilities behind. In doing that, it imposed certain \nadditional costs on the system locally. Yet we never fulfilled our \nobligation in supporting that so-called unfunded mandate. That is \nexactly what it is. We addressed that earlier today.\n  In spite of our best efforts over the last 6 years and a true market \nincrease in funding, we have a long way to go to address that issue.\n  I think this bill, through bipartisan cooperation and the addition to \nthe underlying bill worked through the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPension Committee, goes a long way in stressing President Bush's agenda \nof education, looking at local control, accountability, measurable \nstandards, and involvement of parents and empowering parents to make \nchoices in the best interests of their children, instead of having the \nFederal Government or bureaucrats making those decisions. There will be \na lot of debate as to whether it went far enough in areas such as \nchoice and parental involvement, while others said we went too far.\n\n  It is important to recognize the accountability provisions in this \nbill are strong. They have been strengthened, I believe, after a lot of \ndebate in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee and have \nbeen strengthened through bipartisan efforts of Democrats and \nRepublicans and representatives from the administration working very \nhard to make sure whatever we do in terms of streamlining--getting rid \nof red tape, allowing the freedom to innovate--we couple that freedom \nwith very strong accountability provisions. These are not block grants \nas we have in the bill elsewhere. These are performance grants. Don't \njust give money to the problem and walk away. We have tried that and it \ndoes not work. We invest the money and measure the results, and we \nmeasure the results in a way that it helps not to just identify the \nproblem but make the diagnosis specifically as to what the problem is \nso we can fix it. Reward success; do not reward failure. If there is \nfailure, further invest if necessary or put in a type of reform in an \ninnovative way, that could correct whatever the deficiency.\n  What has become apparent to most everyone today is that over the last \n35 years, in spite of very good intentions, we have not made the \naccurate diagnosis as to why the achievement gap is getting worse every \nyear and why we are failing to boost the academic achievement of the \ndisadvantaged or the underserved, the less fortunate. Looking at \ninternational comparisons and what progress has been made over the last \n30 years, we have to figure out how to eliminate the achievement gap \nand define it. That means more assessments.\n  We will hear people who do not like assessments saying it is a bunch \nof Federal tests we are imposing on local communities, and there is no \nFederal role for that. People will call and say we already have too \nmany tests out there and that is not the problem. We are already \ntesting our kids four or five times a year.\n  It is now apparent for the first time, and this is why the bill is so \nimportant, the accountability, making the diagnosis, identifying the \nproblem, and defining it, requires an understanding of where we are \ntoday but also making comparisons over time. If you just give a test \nsporadically or there is no uniformity to the test, there is no ability \nto longitudinally, year by year, compare and there will be an \ninadequate diagnosis.\n  A bunch of results such as A, B, C, D, E, or F, and you will not know \nwhether a B in Nashville, TN, is the same in Alaska or down in Florida \nor California.\n  All of this requires a degree of standardization but not a Federal \ntest.\n\n[[Page S4221]]\n\nAgain, I have talked to people around the country today who are calling \nand asking: Are you going to impose this national Federal test designed \nby bureaucrats or designed by the Department of Education or designed \nby Senators? The answer is no.\n  The assessment, however, is critical. We have spent, according to \nSecretary Paige, about $150 billion over the last 35 years, and we have \nhundreds of new programs. In spite of that, too many children are being \nleft behind by our education system. That is the problem.\n  Now we have to make the diagnosis. It means accountability systems \nand the foundation of making that diagnosis, the foundation of those \nassessments, and the foundation of defining that problem means we have \nto assess, and we have to assess on a regular basis so we can intervene \nat the appropriate time --not just once in the fourth grade, wait 4 \nyears and test that same individual in the eighth grade because then it \nis too late, and 4 years are lost.\n\n  Thus, in the underlying bill, which I think is critically important, \nwe have the annual assessment of all students in reading and math in \ngrades 3-8 consistent with President Bush's proposal. That is a \nproblem. The problem is out there, and we can define the problem and \ndefine it earlier. We can track a school or an individual. If they are \ndoing OK the first year, worst next year, worst next year, we can \nintervene. Whereas today we cannot intervene because the test that is \napplied, there is no uniformity, and we do not know if the test in the \neighth grade is the same in the fourth grade, if there is a difference. \nThere is no standardization.\n  Now, it is critical; this is not a Federal test. We are not designing \na curriculum. That is dangerous. Everybody will be out there teaching \njust to the test and that will probably not give the results that are \ndesired. Therefore, in this bill, it very specifically says that States \nwould be free to develop their own assessments, but they have to be \nlinked to state standards, No. 1; and No. 2, student achievement \nresults must be comparable to year after year after year--fourth grade, \nfifth grade, sixth grade, seventh grade, eighth grade. We have to \ncompare year to year. It is like looking at the heart, and you take \npictures and you see parts at a time, and that is useful, but it is \nreally useful to get an EKG 1 year, and the next year, and the next \nyear. That is where the powerful diagnosis is actually made.\n  States would be required, in addition, to report those assessment \nresults. Can you do a test and get accurate data to make the diagnosis? \nUnless you give that information to somebody who can use it to \nintervene or correct, once again, it might just be a bunch of test \nresults sitting on a shelf that nobody looks at, an accurate test, a \ncross-sectional and longitudinal comparison. Then you have to require \nreporting of that information--this is in the bill--to the parents. \nAgain, the importance of this bill is it empowers parents to make \nchoices, to be involved, to make demands, to hold teachers accountable \nor schools accountable, again consistent with the principles of \nPresident George W. Bush. Those results are also reported and spelled \nout to the public in the bill.\n\n  The test results also--again, it is important because of this \nachievement gap--must be disaggregated. You don't want to report in the \naggregate how good a school or district or State does. You want to be \nable to take out that data, dissect it out. Therefore, in the bill we \nsay that you have to do what is called disaggregation. Instead of \nlumping all the data together, you want to be able to take it apart, \nagain so you can more specifically and better identify what the \ndeficiencies might be, or what groups are doing well, what groups are \nnot doing well. So there will be this so-called disaggregation or \nfurther dissection of the information and data by socioeconomic status, \nby disability, by language proficiency--all of which you can address in \ninnovative and creative ways if there is failure.\n  All of that brings me back to the Jeffords amendment. That is because \nthose are mandates of a sort, but they are mandates that are carried \nout at the local level--again, not a Federal test but a State-designed \nor locally-designed test. But it is a mandate. You have to give the \ntest. You have to give the paper. You have to wait the hour or two. You \nhave to grade it. You have to develop the test. You have to make sure \nit is a useful test in a longitudinally and cross-sectional way.\n  In 1994 when we addressed the reauthorization--and we have to learn \nfrom our past mistakes--we did not quite get it right. Remember, we \nreauthorized ESEA, or the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, seven \ntimes. In 1994, Congress adopted a State assessment requirement for \ntitle I but at that time did not provide the funds to the States to \nmeet that requirement. Again, you have a mandate out there and you have \nno resources to go with it, and therefore it has had very little in the \nway of impact.\n  The significance of the Jeffords amendment, once it is added to this \nbill and voted upon in an hour and a half or so, is it will commit the \nFederal Government to sharing the cost of the proposed assessments, of \nthe proposed testing. What it specifically does, S. 1, or the Jeffords \namendment once inserted into S. 1, is it will provide $370 million in \nthe year 2002. There will be annual increases of $10 million each year \nall the way out to 2008. A total of about $2.8 billion will be added \nthrough the Jeffords amendment over 7 years.\n  There was a discussion of from where that figure came. It came from a \nlot of analysis and a lot of study. I want to tell my colleagues that \nbecause this was initially raised in one of the working group meetings, \nthe bipartisan working group. It became very clear that we were all \nconcerned about giving this additional responsibility to States and \nlocal communities.\n  Everybody said: How much does it cost to conduct a test or to develop \na test? Again, the data that came back showed that there is a lot of \nvariation from State to State.\n  A State such as Tennessee has been very involved in testing many \ntimes during the year for many of the grades and therefore has gotten \non down the line. The cost is going to be less. We will still be able \nto use many of those tests and adapt them according to Federal \nstandards.\n\n  The 7-year cost estimates have ranged, in terms of estimates you see \nin the press circulating around, from $2 billion to some as high as $7 \nbillion. But the more we as a group looked and analyzed this data, the \nmore comfortable at least I became with this figure of about $2.7 or \n$2.8 billion as a part of carrying that additional burden that the \nStates will have for this testing. Again, it depends so much on how \nmuch is already going on in that State.\n  It also depends on what types of assessments are out there. You can \ndo all sorts of assessments, what is called norm-referenced assessments \nor criterion-based assessments. There are States such as Massachusetts, \nI believe, which have a certain criterion that far surpasses even what \nwe require. We are able to compare State by State.\n  I, for one, am very comfortable with the Jeffords amendment as \nsufficiently and appropriately supporting that incremental cost with \nthis increased requirement, very important requirement, of \naccountability to make sure, in everything else we are doing, we are \nlinking any change we proposed in this bill to strong accountability.\n  In closing, I urge support of the Jeffords amendment to S. 1.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield as much time as she may consume to \nthe distinguished Senator from Louisiana, who is a principal cosponsor \nfor full funding for title I, an amendment by myself and the Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senators Dodd and \nCollins, for their great leadership in this area. In committee on many \ndays, in many meetings, in many different forums, these two have been \njust tremendously powerful voices for a very important piece of our \neducation reform efforts, and that is, in fact, title I.\n  The title, the block grant, if you will, is the money that goes to \nall of our school systems and our districts to help turn around poor \nperforming schools, to help reach those children who are in the \ngreatest need, to help reach those counties--in Louisiana's\n\n[[Page S4222]]\n\ninstance, our Parishes--where the tax base is minimal or weak, where \neven well-intentioned individuals who want to give more revenues for \nschools cannot because of their limited capacities. Title I was \nintended, when it was created, to be the answer to that, to help \nequalize the playing field. It was intended to make real what we say \nabout giving equal opportunity for children.\n  I thank them because they were very forceful in committee and now \nbringing this amendment to the floor, in which it seems many of our \ncolleagues are going to join.\n  I also thank Senator Kennedy for his outstanding work in the whole \narea of education, for working so diligently to bring us to the \nunderlying compromise which Senator Jeffords' amendment represents, \nwhich is a strong accountability component. The Federal Government now \nreally enters into a partnership with States to not just throw more \nmoney at education but to improve every school. It will give them the \nresources to help frame the goals. It will give them the tools they \nneed to set their own standards of performance and to increase testing \nand accountability in addition to adding investments through title I to \nmeet those goals.\n\n  Senator Kennedy and Senator Jeffords, Senator Lieberman, Senator \nBayh, and so many others have been engaged in this compromise. I am \nproud to be here to support it and to speak for just a moment on what \nthe title I amendment will do for Louisiana.\n  Mr. President, for your State, Alabama, which is similar to \nLouisiana, it will be a tremendous victory for our schools and our \nschoolchildren, particularly in the South, particularly in areas where \nthere are high concentrations of the poor. If this amendment we are \nadvocating is adopted and the authorization for title I is increased as \nsubstantially as this amendment calls for and the underlying agreement \nallows, it is going to mean, for Louisiana, an additional $161 million. \nThat is going to help add resources to one of the strong accountability \nsystems we have in the Nation.\n  I commend our Governor and our legislature, our BESE board, for \nstepping out years ago, introducing rigorous tests and accountability, \ntrying to identify failing schools. If we are successful in not only \npassing this amendment and authorizing this increase in title I but \nultimately successful and can lean hard on the appropriators--and I am \na new member of that committee--to actually get this money \nappropriated, it will be a tremendous help to Louisiana, to Alabama, to \nCalifornia, to New York, to Maine, to Connecticut--to all of our \nStates, to give those administrators the resources they need to help \nthese schools turn around and improve.\n  In addition, on a separate amendment which is not what we are \ndiscussing but was already adopted, we have now made a commitment and a \nstatement in the Senate that we want to live up to full funding for \nspecial education.\n  If we will do those two things--get the full funding for special \neducation and, in fact, adopt this title I amendment, and get the money \nactually funded through the appropriations process--I would say we have \ndone more to really improve, enhance, and strengthen public education \nthan we perhaps have done in the last 30, 40, or 50 years. I mean that. \nLet me tell you why.\n  Some Senators have made statements that would lead people to believe \nthat in the years past we have really funded title I and that the \nproblem is we just kept funding it but we didn't ask for results. I \nwould like to take issue with that in the few minutes I have.\n  Title I was created under President Johnson's administration with the \nidea that for the first time in America the Federal Government would \nstep up to the plate and recognize there were some areas of our country \nthat needed extra help and tried to provide extra money for these \nschools. We have really barely kept pace with inflation. While the \namount of money has gone up, when you look at it, it has barely kept \npace with inflation.\n  This amendment would significantly increase our investments in title \nI so we can live up to that promise we made 35 years ago. Whether \nchildren live in the rural part of Maine or Louisiana, or \nMassachusetts, whether they are in a poor pocket of a large urban area; \nwhether their community can afford to pay high property taxes or \nwhether there is property of value to tax, these children could get \nqualified teachers; they could get computers; they could get \ntechnological training; they could have access to wonderful libraries, \nnot only physically but on the Internet; they could have courses in \nscience and literature to help build the kind of education they need to \nbreak out of the cycle of poverty.\n  We know schools can't do all of it. We know parents, families, and \nthe community have a role to play. But I can tell you, as a great \nbeneficiary of an education system, that every single Senator in this \nroom has benefitted. Some Senators came from very wealthy families, but \nmany Senators came from poor families with very limited opportunities. \nIf it wasn't for strong parents and a good sense of community and a \ngood education, none of us would have made our way to the Senate.\n  That is why I believe so strongly in title I and why I thank Senators \nDodd and Collins for putting forth this amendment while we have a \nprojected surplus to make a real commitment in moving these dollars to \ntitle I.\n  Lets add another word about title I. Title I is not just one part. \nThere are four parts to it. There is a basic grant that is distributed \nto all the States based on the number of poor children. Then there are \nthree other parts laid on top of that to make sure the money we send \nactually reaches to the poorest districts that need the most help.\n  While this amendment doesn't specifically direct those dollars in \nthat way, the underlying amendment and the underlying bill basically \nsay if this amendment is adopted, the new money--we are talking about a \nsignificant amount of new money, $6.4 billion--will not only be added \nto title I but it will be appropriated through those targeted \nconcentration formulas so that States such as Louisiana that have high \nrates of poverty can be well served, and so that in the field Federal \nGovernment will, in fact, step up and be a real partner to these States \nand these local communities that are trying their very best to make the \nkind of real reforms that we are advocating.\n\n  It will enable them to provide this new testing--not just fake tests, \nnot just the easy tests, not testing on the cheap, but good tests and \ngood accountability measures so we can identify what schools need help \nand then give them the help they need so we don't leave any child \nbehind.\n  That is what is exciting about this amendment. I am so proud to be \nworking on it with Senator Dodd and Senator Collins.\n  I believe it is most appropriate, while we are in this debate about \nthe budget and setting parameters for how we are going to spend our \nmoney--we are going to give significant tax relief, and we can most \ncertainly do that--that we set aside the right kind of investments for \nour schools.\n  It has been said, and it was repeated to me over the weekend by one \nof the outstanding authors on the subject of education in the Nation, \nand I think it is worth repeating at this time, our schools don't just \nserve the public; our schools create the public.\n  In a nation that prides itself as being the longest living democracy \nin the world, a nation, while not perfect--we most certainly have many \nflaws and we have much to improve--that is really a model of democracy \nfor the world, our education system becomes more than just learning \nfacts about what was and what is. Students learn about the \npossibilities of what can be. They learn to think. They learn to \nbelieve in themselves. They learn to put things in perspective. An \neducation system literally becomes a place where we create a public \nthat is educated enough to sustain a democracy that not only brings \nhope to every person that lives in America but brings hope to millions \nof people around the world.\n  This is a big issue. I don't mean to overemphasize how important \ntitle I is. But it really becomes imperative that this National \nGovernment, our Federal Government, give the resources necessary to \nstrengthen the schools that create the foundations and the bedrock of \nour Nation.\n\n[[Page S4223]]\n\n  Again, I am proud to be part of it. I most certainly hope we have a \nstrong vote on this amendment tonight.\n  I thank my distinguished colleagues from Connecticut and Maine for \nbringing this amendment to the floor, and I urge passage of the Dodd-\nCollins amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my colleague from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to support the Dodd-\nCollins amendment.\n  I have had the privilege of being a legislator most of my adult life. \nI must admit what we are facing today is not a first. I realize that \nlegislation and the legislative process is an imperfect activity. As a \nmatter of fact, it was Bismarck, I believe, who was quoted as saying \nthat making laws is something similar to making sausage. It is a \nprocess that you should never see. Today is an example of that, for \nhere we are discussing one of the most important subjects facing this \nNation: How we are going to invest additional funding in education, a \nsubject matter that is absolutely essential to the future of this \ncountry, while at this very moment discussing and hopefully adopting \nthe Dodd-Collins amendment that will fully fund title I over the next \n10 years--title I being the funding for disadvantaged students--while \nat the same time we have just received the report from the other end of \nthe U.S. Capitol Building that the House is about to take up a \nconference committee report on the budget resolution from which the \nDemocratic leadership was excluded. All of the Democrats on the Budget \nCommittee were excluded from knowing what was in that budget conference \nreport.\n  We find, in fact, that what is in it is exactly the opposite of what \nwe are debating right now--that instead of fully funding title I, title \nI will not be fully funded; much less, it will not even be adequately \nfunded; much less, it will not even be increased over the next 10 \nyears. That is an irony of all ironies.\n\n  But let's look at some other issues. We understand that the budget \nresolution may come here tonight for a vote, while at the same time we \nare discussing the education bill and voting to invest additional \nresources into education. What we are going to be voting on tonight is \na budget resolution that has no increase in funding for education. You \ncan't have it both ways.\n  We understand, although we have not been privy to this documentation \nyet, that not only are there not going to be the increases in title I, \nthe subject of the amendment that we are discussing for a significant \nincrease--indeed, the full funding of title I--but that there is going \nto be less funding, with no increases, for safe and educational \nafterschool opportunities. Head Start is not going to be significantly \nincreased, the program to get children ready to enter kindergarten and \nthe elementary school years. It is going to eliminate the additional \nfunding for the training of our teachers. It is going to eliminate the \nadditional funding for reducing class sizes. And it is going to \neliminate funding for making our schools more safe.\n  What we have just talked about is what the American people want. They \nwant safe schools. They want smaller classes. They want better paid \nteachers and better trained teachers with continuing education \nopportunities. They want additional opportunities for disadvantaged \nchildren. And they want afterschool programs for children.\n  That, in large part, is what this entire bill, S. 1, is about, which \nwe are talking about and have amended.\n  Earlier today we adopted the Harkin amendment. It provided some $180 \nbillion over the next 10 years for children with disabilities. Yet I am \ntold that a stealth budget resolution conference report, that we are \nnot privy to see, is coming to this Chamber for a vote tonight. That is \nexactly the opposite of what we are doing in the consideration of this \neducation bill.\n  I know the process of legislation is not pretty, but this defies \nanybody's description about any kind of symmetry because there is none. \nIt is a total irony that we would be giving, with one hand, for one of \nthe most fundamentally important needs of this country, education, and \nlater tonight taking away with the other hand.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to address the Senate.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend our colleague from Florida. He has \nmade an eloquent statement. He raises a very valuable point. I \nappreciate his support for this amendment. This is one way to put us on \nrecord, in a bipartisan way, to say how critical increased Title I \nfunding is to educational reform. Not only must we insist upon \naccountability but we must make it possible for people to demonstrate \ntheir academic achievement, which is necessary if we are going to be \nsuccessful.\n  So I, for one, am very grateful for his support on this amendment and \nalso for his comments in relation to the position we may find ourselves \nin with having supported a reauthorization but then finding it \ndifficult under the budget agreement to have the resources actually \ncommitted.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes, and then I will \nyield the Senator from Alabama 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the whole issue of funding is very \nimportant. It is very clear to everybody in this Chamber that we have \nnot sufficiently funded title I, especially if we are to focus on \neliminating the achievement gap. In fact, after the bill passes, we \nwill require our States to engage in assessments so we can make the \ndiagnosis and understand better why, after 35 years, $150 billion, and \nover 200 programs, we continue to fail the disadvantaged. We have \nfailed to eliminate or even diminish that achievement gap. In fact, we \nhave done just the opposite. That achievement gap has increased over \ntime. The President of the United States has pointed that out again and \nagain. That is our charge: to have measurable results, linked with the \nfreedom of innovation and the best of what America is all about to \naddress this fundamental problem.\n  Title I is the cornerstone of the Federal involvement in focusing on \nthe disadvantaged in this country. It is a monument, in many ways, to \nour commitment as a nation to boost the academic performance of \ndisadvantaged children and to close that gap between rich and poor \nyoungsters.\n  It is not because of a lack of good intentions; we have a litany of \nprograms that are out there today--some have been funded fully and some \nhave been inadequately funded--but we have failed the disadvantaged in \nthis country. Title I is not accomplishing its purpose today.\n  We are talking a lot, in relation to the two amendments we will be \nvoting on at 7:30, about markedly increasing the funding in title I and \nin the education bill. We are talking about markedly, massively \nincreasing it with this increased authorization.\n  I just want to make two points. The answer is not just money. It does \ntake an increased investment. But we absolutely have to link that \nincreased investment to accountability and to appropriate reforms and \nflexibility. We have to empower parents, have local control, and \naccountability.\n  The strategy over the last 35 years of aiming dollars at programs or \nschool districts to create just new programs for disadvantaged students \nsimply has not worked. I do not want this body to think that just \nthrowing money at the problem alone is going to address the issue.\n  Part of the problem with title I, and this whole concept of fully \nfunding title I, is it is pretty complex. The decision was made about \n30 years ago not to fund individual students. We say: Leave no child \nbehind. People think when we are increasing this money, we are giving \nit to that child or to that family, or that the value goes to that \nchild or to that family, the disadvantaged student, that the resources \nare aimed at that student.\n  In truth, that is not what was decided historically. It has been to \nfund the institutions where the highest percentage of those students \nare but by using a formula which really funds the institutions. That \nmeans even if we put in an unlimited amount of money into title I, we \nwould still not be addressing\n\n[[Page S4224]]\n\nthe issue of covering all the disadvantaged students. It is a quirk in \nthe formula. It is a quirk of the decisions that have been made in this \nbody.\n  I mention that because Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire will \nlater, next week, address this issue of portability. If we really care \nabout disadvantaged students, shouldn't we, in some way, address every \ndisadvantaged student? The best way to do that, conceptually and \npractically, would be at least to take some of these resources and \nattach them to the student--the disadvantaged student, the poor \nstudent, the student with the disability--and allow that student to \nhave the resources that are most appropriate for him or her. Again, it \ncomes back to portability. But that is not the issue tonight.\n  But as I see the great support for increased funding, we have to link \nit to accountability.\n  I want to introduce the concept we will be debating next week, and \nthat is portability.\n  Just so people will understand, the title I formula is based on the \nnumber of low-income children living in a district, but the money goes \nto the school and does not go to the child. As a process, we have \ncorrected some of it in the underlying bill. The formula favors high \nspending in wealthy States because part of the equation is how much you \nare spending right now in a State, and wealthy States or wealthier \nStates--New York spends a lot more per capita or per student than \nTennessee; that is an important part of the formula--are going to get \nmore money through title I than a student will in Tennessee or \nLouisiana or many other States.\n  Secondly, districts with high-poverty schools are served first, and \nthat is appropriate, but at some level there is a cutoff and, \ntherefore, you can't serve all schools. You just don't have enough \nmoney to serve all schools that have 1 or 2 or 3 percent or 4 percent \nof disadvantaged students.\n  Third, high-poverty schools receive a priority for funding but \nbecause of the equation, per pupil, per individual disadvantaged \nstudent, they receive less than low-poverty schools. It doesn't make \nsense for a high-poverty school to receive less per pupil. It is \nbecause they have a higher percentage.\n  I mention that because the formula, the way it is configured today, \nmeans that nearly half of low-income children in America receive no \nassistance from title I. Therefore, when you hear that half who deserve \nit don't receive it, then the response is: Let's put more money into \nit.\n  I want to point out to my colleagues, you could put more money into \nit and more money into it. I am not arguing against that. I think we \nneed to put more money into it, but given the formula and the way we \ntarget institutions and not the students, with unlimited money put into \nthe system as currently configured, you will never be able to take care \nof all the disadvantaged students out there. The only way you can do \nthat is looking at portability and saying that you need to attach some \nof these funds to the individual student.\n  I know we have been going back and forth.\n  Mr. DODD. May I yield to my colleague from Delaware who has another \nengagement before we actually vote? If he could have 2 minutes or 3 \nminutes and then go to my colleague from Alabama.\n  Mr. FRIST. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to say a word about accountability \nand relate that to resources. In the measure we will be voting on and \namending later today and for the next week or so, there is a full \nmeasure of accountability. I want to mention some of the provisions.\n  If after 4 years a school has been unable to shed its label of a \nnonperforming school, a school is unable to meet its yearly progress \ngoals, a student who is trapped in that school must be offered the \nchance to go to another public school. That school district must \nprovide the transportation for that student.\n  Under the accountability regimen that is part of this bill, after 4 \nyears of failure by the school, either that school must simply be \nreconstituted and the administration and teachers let go, or largely \nreplaced, or the school has to be turned over to the State or another \nentity. There is real accountability in this legislation. There ought \nto be.\n  The question we need to consider is, Are we investing the resources \nthat will enable that school and thousands of other schools falling \nshort of the mark to help their kids meet the standards that have been \nset by the various States, particularly in reading and in math?\n  Our role in the Federal Government--when I spoke yesterday I talked \nabout our role--is to level the playing field for kids who come from a \ndisadvantaged background. Part of that role is making sure that kids \nare healthy, born healthy, have enough to eat and nutritious food early \nin their lives, and to make sure they have access to health care so \nthat when they are old enough to go to school, they are not already \nhopelessly behind.\n  It goes beyond that. It is trying to make sure that there is adequate \nchild care, as we push people off the welfare rolls, compel them to go \nto work, to make sure that those children of welfare parents have some \ndecent child care so that they get that help when their brains are \nyoung and so much can be done to get them on the right path.\n  Our role extends to Head Start. We don't begin to provide the Head \nStart funding that we have promised to provide. We just don't meet our \nobligation for 3- or 4-year-olds in this country. We leave it up to the \nStates to try to make up the difference. States such as Delaware and \nOhio do, but many do not.\n  Until the adoption of an amendment earlier today on a voice vote for \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, we simply didn't fund \nit. We met about a third of our obligation but not the rest.\n  As we prepare to hold schools and school districts and States \naccountable for the children left behind today in failing schools, we \nhave to make the appropriate investments. Whether it is Head Start, \nwhether it is child care, whether it is individuals with disabilities, \nand whether it is children who are eligible for these title I programs, \nthey actually work. To the extent that we can come closer to funding \nfor every three kids, to make the program available for those three \nkids instead of, today, one out of three, we will enable those children \nto be successful and enable their schools to avoid being a failure.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Delaware. As a \nformer Governor, I know many Governors believe as he does as well. I \nappreciate his comments and thoughts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that our colleague from Vermont, Senator \nJeffords, be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I also commend the Senator from Delaware. \nAbout 3 years ago, I guess it was, as Governor, he was one of the \ninstrumental driving forces in a bill called Ed-Flex, where it, in a \nbipartisan way, was brought to the Senate and passed, providing \neducation flexibility. It is a pleasure now that we can all participate \nin a bill in a bipartisan way, although we get partisan at times, \ndeveloping those things that started several years ago.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, we would not \nhave education flexibility in all 50 States were it not for the \nleadership that he provided in the Senate and the support of Senators \nDodd and Kennedy and others. I thank him for the great work he does.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be able to discuss \nonce again some of the issues facing education. We can really do \nbetter. The Government has not, in my view, been effective enough in \nutilizing our resources and our laws and regulations and paperwork to \nproduce education excellence.\n  Yes, we should have accountability. As the Senator from Delaware: You \nhave to have more money then to achieve excellence, and we are going to \nhave a lot more money this year in education. That is going to be a \ngood start.\n\n[[Page S4225]]\n\n  I suggest that that is not the only thing that drives improvement in \neducation. Dr. Paige, our Secretary of Education, who served in the \nHouston school system from 1995 to 2000, took over the seventh largest \nsystem in the country with only 37 percent of the students passing the \nbasic Texas test. He applied, when President Bush was Governor, \nprinciples that he believed in and learned as the dean of an education \nschool, as a teacher himself, and as a coach.\n  He went to work to improve education in the Houston schools, and in 5 \nyears, he reported that 73 percent of the students in Houston passed \nthat test.\n  When asked recently: Didn't you get a lot more money? He said: The \nthird year we had a proposal for more money. The voters voted it down. \nTest scores kept going up and things were getting better, and we came \nback again. And we did get more money.\n  Most of the progress and the framework for the progress was made \nbefore he was given any more money.\n  Testing, he says, is not an accountability factor so much as a part \nof teaching. It is a way, an ability. The process of helping children \nlearn is to find out where they are and what they can do.\n  Are they up to speed? Are they behind? What level are they on? How \ncan you improve them? We cannot leave children behind. We cannot wait \nuntil the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth grade, and find out that \nchildren are able to do basic math and read and write. Isn't that \nterrible? That has been happening, we know, too much in America.\n  I would say the key component of testing isn't just some sort of \naccountability, although it does provide accountability; it is a way \nand a technique of identifying children that are falling behind. We \ndon't want to leave children behind. No child should be left behind. We \ncan intervene early, and the President wants testing from third to \neighth grade to make sure they are up to speed and not falling behind, \nbecause he cares about them.\n  Dr. Paige said he loved those children. He loved them enough to test \nthem and find out how they were doing and make sure they are catching \nup. And he wants to engage parents. You can bring them in if things \naren't going well. If the whole school is doing badly, you can come in \nand improve it. You can challenge the leadership if they are not doing \nwell.\n  So I think we have some real potential movement in education, and \nthat is exciting. If we allow schools to have more freedom to use their \neducation money that they are going to be receiving--and are receiving \nnow--in ways that they believe will drive academic achievement, but we \nsimply say find out how your children are doing, report that to the \nparents and teachers and the taxpayers, and if you are not doing well, \nlet's confront that problem quickly. I think that is something that \nwill work.\n  We voted today to fully fund the IDEA, the Individuals With \nDisability Education Act. I think that is wonderful, and it is an act \nthat has a great goal. It has achieved some very good things. The \nvision of the Individuals With Disability Education Act was to make \nsure that children were not shunted aside, that they were allowed to \nparticipate fully in the environment in which they would be \nparticipating when they graduated, and that physically disabled \nchildren would be able to participate with other children in a \nclassroom, that children who are blind or deaf would be able to \nmainstream in the classroom and benefit from it. It had some good \nprovisions in it.\n  But I am here to tell you that there is a growing problem in America \nwith this act, dealing with one just minor--really, in the scheme of \nthings--part of it, but it has a major impact; that is, the ability of \nschools to discipline and deal with children who are not able to \nfunction in a classroom. It is a major source of frustration and anger, \nand a major factor in teachers actually quitting education. We can do \nsomething about this. We do not have to allow this to continue.\n  I have visited in my State approximately 25 school systems within the \nlast year and asked them about what is going on. I have been hearing \nroutinely about the problems they are having with the disciplinary \nrequirements that really limit their ability to maintain order in their \nclassrooms. The head of the Alabama Education Association and Teachers \nGroup said he believes changes need to be implemented. He said, ``I am \ntired of these people cursing teachers in Alabama and nothing can be \ndone about it.''\n  So I believe that the time has come to deal with it, and I want to \nshare some of the information I have learned over the last year or so \nabout this particular subject. Let me read this letter from a student \nthat I think gives an indication of what we are about:\n\n       I am a 14-year-old eighth grader. I have a problem. There \n     is this girl that goes to school with me. She is an ADD \n     student. She has been harassing me for no reason. She has \n     pretty much done everything from breaking my glasses to \n     telling me she is going to kill me. This really bothers me \n     because she is an ADD student and the only punishment she \n     ever gets is a slap on the hand. My principal says there is \n     not much he can do because her status as a special ed kid. I \n     asked what would happen if I threatened her back and he told \n     me I would be suspended from school and forced to stay away. \n     The most she has ever gotten is 3 days ``in school'' \n     suspension. I think this is wrong. She scares me and I am \n     tired of this. It has been going on for 5 months and it's \n     really getting scary.\n\n  Doesn't that bother you? Can you hear that child saying that? She is \nexactly correct. That principal is able to discipline her for a threat \nor a violent behavior much more severely and much more effectively than \nhe can deal with a special ed student.\n  Let me read this story in the Dothan Eagle, a newspaper in Alabama:\n\n       Until recently, Tina Ham never worried about the safety of \n     her child in Geneva County Elementary School in Hartford, AL. \n     But since last week, school safety is all she and other \n     parents have thought about after a third grade special ed \n     student threatened to kill his fellow third graders. Parents \n     say that an 11 year old boy threatened to shoot and kill two \n     African American students and then threatened to kill the \n     entire third grade. Parents say that the boy has a history of \n     behavior problems and has frequent outbursts at school. He \n     has a history of reportedly attacking other students. Sources \n     say the boy can be heard yelling in his classroom, and that \n     he has been seen spitting on people, walking on tables, and \n     throwing books and desks. The threats came to light after \n     calls were made to a State violence prevention hotline.\n\n  I would like to see more States do that, so that if a parent or \nteacher or student sees something they are concerned about or violence, \nthey can make an anonymous call and perhaps something can be done about \nit.\n\n       About 50 parents confronted the school board members \n     recently to express their concern about the situation. One \n     parent was quoted as saying that she ``didn't want to hurt \n     the child, but I don't want him to hurt my child. I lose \n     faith in school officials.'' One school official explained \n     that since the child was in special education, they would \n     have to meet Federal guidelines in disciplining the student. \n     It is more involved than it is with general students. One \n     school official was quoted as saying that it is a serious \n     situation and has created quite a disruption to the day-to-\n     day activities of the school. More intervention is needed. \n     One parent explained, ``I want this child to be helped. I \n     want him to receive the help he needs and my child afforded \n     the education she deserves. If there is a problem, get him \n     some help. I feel this child is capable of killing someone.''\n\n  This is a letter from a teacher from Troy, AL. First, let me just \nadd, parenthetically, that as I went about and people would tell me \nstories, I would routinely ask them to send me a letter, put that in \nwriting to me and I may share it one day on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. I have received 50 to 75 or more letters with these kinds of \nexamples.\n  This is a letter from a mid-sized rural town in Alabama:\n\n       As a special educator of 6 years, I consider myself ``on \n     the front lines'' of the ongoing battle that takes place on a \n     daily basis in our Nation's schools. I strongly believe that \n     part of the ``ammunition'' that fuels these struggles are the \n     rights guaranteed to certain individuals by the IDEA act of \n     1997. The law, though well-intentioned, has become one of the \n     single greatest obstacles that educators face in our fight to \n     provide all children with a quality education delivered in a \n     safe environment. There are many examples that I can offer \n     firsthand. However, let me reiterate that I am a special \n     educator. I have dedicated my life to helping children with \n     special needs. It is my job to study and know the abilities \n     and limitations of such children. I have a bachelor's degree \n     in psychology, a masters degree in special education and a \n     PH.D. in good ole common sense. No where in my educational \n     process have I been taught a certain few ``disabled'' \n     students should have a ``right'' to endanger the right to \n     an education of all other disabled and non-disabled \n     children. It's nonsense; it's wrong; it's dangerous; and \n     it must be stopped. There is no telling how many \n     instructional hours are lost by teachers in\n\n[[Page S4226]]\n\n     dealing with behavior problems. In times of an \n     increasingly competitive global society it is no wonder \n     American students fall short. Certain children are allowed \n     to remain in the classroom robbing the other children of \n     hours that can never be replaced. There is no need to \n     extend the school day. There is no need to extend the \n     school year. If politicians would just make it possible \n     for educators to take back the time that is lost on a \n     daily basis to certain individuals there is no doubt we \n     would have better educated students. It is even more \n     frustrating when it is a special education child who knows \n     and boasts ``they can't do anything to me'' and he is \n     placed back in the classroom to disrupt it day after day, \n     week after week. It is clear that IDEA '97 not only \n     undermines the educational process it also undermines the \n     authority of educators. In a time when our profession is \n     being called upon to protect our children from \n     increasingly dangerous sources our credibility is being \n     stripped from us.\n\n  Strong letter. I am reading her words:\n\n       I am sure you have heard the saying: The teachers are \n     scared of the principals, the principals are scared of the \n     superintendents, the superintendents are scared of the \n     parents, the parents are scared of the children, and the \n     children are scared of no one. And why should they be? I have \n     experienced the ramifications of the ``new and improved'' law \n     first hand. I had one child attempt to assault me (he had \n     been successful with two other teachers) He was suspended for \n     one day. I had another child make sexual gestures to me in \n     front of the entire class. Despite the fact that every child \n     in my class and a majority of the children in the school knew \n     of it, I was told by my assistant principal that nothing \n     could be done because ``these special ed kids have rights'', \n     I literally got in my car to leave that day, but my financial \n     obligations to my family and my moral responsibilities to the \n     children I had in my class kept me there.\n\n  She was going to give up the profession she had given her life to.\n\n       The particular child I spoke about frequently made vulgar \n     comments and threats to my girls in my class on every \n     opportunity he had when there was no adult present. \n     Fortunately, the girls, also special ed, could talk to me \n     about it. Unfortunately, they had to put up with it \n     because ``nothing could be done''. I know of a learning \n     disabled child who cut a girl in a fight. The learning \n     disabled child and her parents then attempted to sue the \n     school system because the child was burned when she \n     grabbed a coffee pot to break it over the other child's \n     head. I know of another specific incident where three \n     children brought firearms to school. The two ``regular'' \n     children were expelled. The special education student was \n     back to school the following week. I fully expect that you \n     and your colleagues in Washington will do what it takes to \n     take our schools back from this small group of children \n     who feel it is their right to endanger the education of \n     every other child in school.\n\n  Listen to that:\n\n       I fully expect that you and your colleagues in Washington \n     will do what it takes to take our schools back from this \n     small group of children who feel it is their right to \n     endanger the education of every other child in school. As my \n     grandmother said, ``right is right and wrong is wrong'' and \n     to enable this to continue is just wrong.\n\n  That is a serious commentary. The example of guns is a good one. For \nexample, three children bring guns to school. One of them is a special \ned student and the other two are not. The two that are not are expelled \nwhile the special ed student goes right back in the classroom.\n  What does that say about equal justice and fairness? Is there any \nconcern that the disabilities were not the driving factor in this and \nindependent decisions can be made by these children?\n  Mr. President, I had 15 minutes. I do not want to go over my time. Is \nanyone keeping time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed his 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair for allowing me to talk about this \nimportant subject. We have provided a historic and highly significant \nincrease in funding for IDEA, but the Federal IDEA requirements for \nschools all over America have created a dual system of education and of \ndiscipline.\n  It is important, perhaps even more than the money we are spending, \nthat we consider trusting those educators who have given their lives to \nspecial education children and are trained to teach them, and allowing \nthem to handle these discipline problems in ways they think are \nappropriate. This would be a lot better than having Federal regulations \nmicromanaging the schools. It is a very sore spot among every teacher \nin America, and if any of my colleagues do not think it is, they should \njust ask them. They will tell you about it. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes on the time of \nthe Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to address the issues before us, \nthe Jeffords amendment, and also the Dodd amendment.\n  Having listened to my colleague from Alabama, there are many children \nwho attend our schools who need assistance. One of the more recent \nstudies shows in our city of Boston, a quarter of the children come \nfrom homes where either substance abuse or violence is present.\n  Those who have looked at the profile of children from that urban area \nand similar urban areas understand the need for assistance for children \nwho are facing different challenges. One is the kind of violence they \nhave at home. Another is the medical challenges they are facing.\n  All of us want to find ways to deal with these issues. What we have \nseen in recent times is where, out of the security for other children, \nchildren are dismissed arbitrarily. Too often we see instances where \nthey get further frustrated and resort to other types of violence, such \nas going home and finding a gun and acting out their anger with even \ngreater violence.\n  These are complex issues and questions. Children ought to be able to \nlearn in a climate which lends itself to progress, and we also ought to \nfind ways of providing assistance to the children who need it.\n  We can address those issues, and I welcome the opportunity to \nparticipate as we move through the reauthorization of IDEA or at other \ntimes.\n  I want to reserve 4 minutes at the end of my 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in supporting the Jeffords \namendment which proposes the trigger for testing. There is bipartisan \nsupport for this program.\n  The case has been made very eloquently by Senator Jeffords and others \nabout the role of testing. I was impressed when I heard Secretary Paige \nand the President talk about their strong views that this should never \nbe used as a punitive measure; that the role of these tests is to try \nto determine what the children know and to help the teachers develop \napproaches to assist those students so they can do better in their \nschool work and in the future. That is certainly my view. I believe \nthat is certainly the view of those who fashioned and shaped this \nproposal that is included in the legislation.\n\n  A reasonable question has been raised about tests, tests which are \nsimple, easy, multiple-choice tests that too often are used to test \nchildren and too often the curriculum or the children are coached or \ntaught to those tests. That, clearly, is not our interest.\n  During the course of this debate we will attempt to address the issue \nof the quality of the tests, the tests that take critical thinking, \ndemonstrate an excellence in writing, tests that examine what the child \nshould know. Obviously, the difficulty is calibrated upon a well-\nthought-out curriculum taught by a well-qualified teacher. That is \nbasically what we are looking at in this legislation.\n  We are going to upgrade the curriculums. We are going to incorporate \nprofessional development for the teachers and thoughtful examination \nfor the teachers themselves so they understand the challenges that \nremain for children and help develop the supplementary services that \nwill be of high quality to help the children make progress in their \neducation. That is certainly the way we want to proceed. That is the \nobjective.\n  The Jeffords amendment indicates we recognize our responsibility in \nhelping fashion, shape, and support those developments. We will give \nour strong support and commitment and help develop those tests. This is \nthe essence of the Jeffords amendment. It provides resources. It has a \ntrigger. I think this will be funding that, effectively, will be \nassured as we move through the process. I will certainly support it.\n  As we make this case in support of the Dodd amendment, we are talking \nabout additional resources. As has been said eloquently by the Senator \nfrom Connecticut and by others, we have devised a new blueprint for \naccountability and responsibility on the\n\n[[Page S4227]]\n\nschools, on the States, on the teachers, and really with the students. \nWhat we are pointing out and what Senator Dodd and Senator Collins have \npointed out is, in order to give life to those dreams, we have to have \nthe resources to make sure all of the elements of this proposal will be \navailable to the neediest children in our society.\n  Twenty percent of our children live in poverty. There are 10 million \nwho qualify for the benefits of this proposal. Only about 3.5 million \nare reached. Under the Dodd amendment, in the first year we will \nincrease children reached from 3.5 million to 6.8 million. That is a \ndramatic increase. Over the rest of the years, we are moving for the \nfinal 3.5 million. For those who want to say we have done something \nimportant, if we support the Dodd amendment we will cover 6.8 million \nchildren at the end. This is progress. This is what we believe this \nwhole legislation should do.\n  We will consider later this evening the proposal on the budget of \n$1.2 trillion. What we are talking about in this instance amounts to \nless than six-thousandths of 1 percent of that tax cut in order to be \nable to fund that program. Mr. President, $250 billion was approved in \nthis body, Republicans and Democrats, to go to the conference on the \nbudget. Virtually zero is coming back. We are asking six-thousandths of \n1 percent, and with that money we are including an extra 6.8 million \nchildren.\n  Investing in these children makes a difference for the children, not \njust for the future but for our country. Although the support for title \nI historically has been very minimal--less than 2 percent of the money \nthat has actually been expended--it is important to respond to those \ncomments I heard recently on the floor about what has been happening in \nTexas and the fact they made such progress, allegedly, without using \nany more resources.\n\n  The fact is, in 1994, they spent $673 million in the Dallas \nindependent school district. In the year 2000, they spent $985 million. \nThat is a $312 million increase. What have been the results? The \nresults have been a significant increase in the funding and a dramatic \nincrease in student achievement. We are not just saying throw the money \nat the problem and that will answer it all. We are saying if the money \nis used, and used effectively, it results in student achievement. We \nhave seen it in Dallas, as raised earlier this evening, and we have \nseen it in a number of other places.\n  I will mention a few other title I success stories.\n  Approximately 80 percent of the students at the Baldwin Elementary \nSchool in Boston, MA, are from low-income families, and many are recent \nimmigrants. With a strong focus on professional development and high \nstandards for even the neediest children, test scores soared between \n1996 and 2000. In the year 2000, 96 percent of the third graders and 91 \npercent of the fifth graders passed the State reading test, and 60 \npercent of the third graders and 39 percent of the fifth graders scored \nproficient at advanced levels.\n  At Gladys Noon Spellman Elementary School in Cheverly, MD, in 1994, \nonly 17 percent of third graders scored at or above the satisfactory \nlevel on the State test. Title I was used to implement reform. Each \nteacher was paired with another staff member to provide small group \ninstruction during a 90-minute reading period in a language arts block \nin the mornings. All staff utilized specialists as a basis for language \ninstruction and were provided with professional development. By 1999, \n73 percent of the third graders performed at or above satisfactory on \nthe State tests.\n  These are exactly the kinds of programs that have been included in \nthis legislation and which the Collins-Dodd proposal intends to \nsupport.\n  The poverty rate at Burgess Elementary in Atlanta, GA, is 81 percent. \nBurgess Elementary staff set out to improve parent involvement in \nworking with parents in the classroom, parent volunteer programs, \nacademic programs for parent learning, and Saturday school programs for \nparents and students. Parental involvement in the school has boomed. \nMost days, 10 or 15 parents are in the school voluntarily. In 1995, \nonly 29 percent performed at or above the norm on the State tests. That \nincreased to 64 percent as of 1998, and the math scores have improved \nfrom 34 percent to 72 percent.\n  Parental involvement is in this bill.\n  We can take the other examples and take the time of the Senate to \nreview these other examples. We have tried to find the kinds of efforts \nthat have demonstrated success and support those in this proposal. But \nunless we are going to provide the investment in the children, we are \nnot going to be able to achieve those objectives; we are not going to \nbe able to get there. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  We have the blueprint. It will do the job. It will make a big \ndifference. But we want to make sure no child is left behind. This \nshould be a priority. We have an opportunity in a few moments to \nindicate our priorities, our support for this strong bipartisan effort \nto make sure the most needy and poorest children in this country will \nnot be left behind.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me first say that last evening I had the privilege of \npresenting an award at the Greater Boys and Girls Clubs of Washington, \nDC, to a very good friend of mine, Bud Selig, the Commissioner of \nBaseball. But another recipient of last evening's Boys and Girls Club \nAward was the distinguished Presiding Officer of this body, the Senator \nfrom Virginia. I will take a moment to commend my colleague--as I did \nlast evening--for the recognition he received. I commend his work.\n  May I inquire of the Chair how much time remains on these amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut controls just \nunder 17 minutes, and the Senator from Vermont has about 11 and a half \nminutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will yield myself, if I may, about 6 \nminutes. If the Chair will notify me when that time has expired? I know \nthat one colleague, the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, is on her \nway to the floor to be heard. I want to reserve some time for her, and \nthen will yield back some time if necessary and get to a vote.\n  I thank my colleagues from Delaware and Florida and others who have \nspoken on this amendment that I am offering on behalf of myself, \nSenator Collins, Senator Jeffords, Senator Landrieu, and others, to \nincrease title I funding.\n  I want to share something with my colleagues. I have submitted for \nthe record data about all 50 States and the number of students eligible \nto be served. About 10 million students would be fully served under \nfull funding of title I. We are fully serving about 3 million of the 10 \nmillion today.\n  I mentioned the numbers in Alabama earlier. I know in the State of \nTennessee, there are 192,000 eligible children. In Connecticut, there \nare about 80,000 eligible children. In Maine, 34,000. In Georgia, the \nnumber of eligible students is 300,000. In Virginia, roughly 179,000 \nare eligible. In each case, we are only providing about one-third of \nthe support that we ought to be.\n\n  I think most of my colleagues who have visited schools and talked to \nsuperintendents and principals have discovered as they have gone \naround, title I funds really do work. There is a great deal of \nflexibility in how title I funds can be used, particularly in school \nenvironments. Here are some of the things I have heard from Connecticut \neducators about how title I funds are working.\n  Title I has provided the Norwalk Public Schools with 35 highly \ntrained professionals in the district for elementary schools, almost \n100 computers and printers, $17,000 for teacher workshops on best \npractices, parent training, and parent center computers. That is title \nI funds at work. It has done a great job in that community.\n  In Canterbury, we see improvements in reading. Without this help, I \nam told by the teachers there, some students would be placed in special \neducation. We just adopted the special education full funding amendment \nby voice vote, and there are some concerns that too many kids will be \nplaced into special education when in fact it may be just that they \nneed remedial training.\n  The Connecticut Mastery Test Scores for title I students have \ncontinued to increase. In short, the support provided to title I \nstudents results in increased achievement, according to the Region One \nschool district.\n\n[[Page S4228]]\n\n  Norwich, CT, has hired preschool teachers under title I so the \nchildren can have the language development needed to be ready to learn, \nand an instructional technology coordinator to implement computer-\nassisted instruction.\n  Title I funding is responsible for the increased number of computers \navailable for students as part of their learning in New Haven, CT. \nTitle I funding has also made it possible for New Haven to hire \nadditional teachers.\n  Title I in Ashford, CT, is an integral part of the K-8 program. \nTeachers tell me that title I students go on to high school--many on \nthe honor roll, college--many on the dean's list, or the military. And, \nthey also tell me that students come back to thank them for ``making me \ndo my work'' and ``teaching me to respect teachers.''\n  My colleague from Maine and I are not suggesting this is going to \ncreate a utopia. But, we think if we can get more resources to \ndisadvantaged kids through a program that is working, they can reach \ntheir full potential.\n  Obviously, a lot of other things need to happen. More parental \ninvolvement and more qualified teachers, for example. But we also know \nthat poor districts--it could be Virginia, Connecticut, Tennessee, \nMaine--because of local property taxes funding most of the system, do \nnot get the resources they need.\n  Because of that, as shown by the examples I have cited from my own \nState--and I'm sure other Members could find similar examples in their \nState--we believe this amendment has great merit.\n  With that, I will withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have 11 minutes on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A little over--11 minutes 17 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield myself 11 minutes. Will the Chair notify me after \n10 minutes, please?\n  Over the last 2 hours we have been debating really two amendments. \nOne is the Jeffords amendment and the other is the Dodd-Collins \namendment. We will be voting in about 22 minutes. We have had a good \ndiscussion on both amendments, both of which are very important. In the \ncase of the Jeffords amendment, we will be making absolutely sure that \nthe mandates we are placing on States in terms of assessments and \ndistricts are adequately funded, that responsibility that is being \nimposed from above--I should say to the benefit of the children who are \nout there so we can make the diagnosis and we can figure out what is \nnot working in that failure to diminish that achievement gap which has \ngotten bigger and bigger, and boosting education for all children \ntoday--and the Dodd-Collins amendment, which fully funds title I \nfunding.\n  I again want to make the case that money is not the answer. We have \nheard that again and again, that we have to have sufficient reforms. \nThere is a fear, I think, of a lot of people, that we commit to a lot \nof money before we really agree on the reforms, and the reforms have to \ninvolve those elements of flexibility, of getting rid of redtape, \nwhich, as we hear again and again, really strangles and straightjackets \nour teachers and principals. It happens really across-the-board.\n  We have heard testimony in the past that, although the Federal \nfunding is only 7 percent--the pie chart showed a little sliver of \nFederal funding--most of it is local and State funding. But coupled \nwith those, 7 percent of the funding passes through this body. It comes \nfrom the taxpayer. We try to send it back down. Coupled with that is \nabout 50 percent of the paperwork on which a teacher back in Nashville, \nTN, is working. Every time we do something here, we need to be very \ncareful in those mandates that come down for those regulations. That is \ncoupled, A, out of the funding, but, B, also adequate reform, local \ncontrol, accountability, parental involvement, and choice.\n\n  It has been fascinating. I am so glad we finally got to the floor the \nunderlying bill itself, and the agreement that has been reached in a \nbipartisan way, working with the administration over the last 3 weeks \nbecause it allows people to see what is in the bill, to read the \nlanguage, and to react to it. It has been a positive and negative \nreaction.\n  I, for one, believe it embodies the principles outlined by President \nBush, although I will say it does not go as far as I wish it to go in \ncertain areas of innovation, freedom, putting the parents in charge, \nand allowing them to choose and be more actively involved in their \nchildren's education. It is very strong on the accountability and in \nareas such as the Straight A's aspect of it. It is very strong on \nflexibility, tied with accountability.\n  One area that falls short--and I am very hopeful that over the coming \ncouple of weeks that we are on the bill we can address it--is involving \nparents and families in education.\n  We hear public education defined as a Federal monopoly. In truth it \nis a monopoly. There is a little bit of fringe innovation going on in \ncharter schools. The underlying bill encourages that greatly, although \nI should also add that States like Tennessee do not have charter \nschools yet. It is one of a handful of States that doesn't allow \ncharter schools. We need to work in that direction.\n  But the area that it falls short in is in parental involvement and \nchoice.\n  Instead of trying to go through a bunch of points, I would like to \nquote several people. We are going to come back to it next week because \nthere will be amendments proposed on choice, empowering parents, and \nportability. I have already commented that we have to be careful with \nthe funding. We can throw unlimited funds in the current formula, and I \nstill leave out disadvantaged children because of the way the formula \nis focused on institutions and not on the individual disadvantaged \nstudents--portability.\n  Again, Senator Gregg from New Hampshire will be introducing an \namendment to that effect.\n  This is a quote from Virginia Walden, a single mother and executive \ndirector of D.C. Parents for School Choice.\n  They are actually having a rally tonight. They expected a few hundred \npeople to be there, and thousands wanted to come to talk about choice \nhere in the District of Columbia.\n  This is from the Washington Post of May 24, 1998. I think it captures \nthe feelings well.\n       I am a lifelong Democrat, and I am not sure when the \n     Democrats decided that siding with the poor and the needy is \n     no longer part of their platform. School choice empowers \n     parents, and I don't care who is behind it, Democrats or \n     Republicans.\n\n  Again, that is from an article from a couple of years ago but \ncaptures, I believe, the feeling about parental involvement.\n  Alveda C. King, the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., has been an \noutspoken person. This is from the Wall Street Journal of September 11, \n1997, which again captures the feeling. I refer again to the District \nof Columbia because we talked about choice.\n       The District of Columbia public school system allocates \n     $10,180 per student, the highest in the nation, according to \n     the U.S. Department of Education. Yet, according to the Annie \n     Casey Foundation, 80% of fourth-graders in the Washington \n     public schools score below their grade on basic math skills. \n     The National Assessment of Education Progress reports that \n     72% of Washington's fourth-graders test below ``basic \n     proficiency'' . . . [an] appalling failure. . . .\n       Washington's families and teachers favor a right to choose \n     the paths of education for their families. . . . The issue is \n     not what families choose, but rather, that they be allowed \n     and empowered to do so.\n\n  Again, the importance of involving parents, and, again, as people \nlook at the bill, they will conclude that we don't go far enough.\n  I am hopeful that we can address that to empower parents to be \ninvolved.\n  William Raspberry, a columnist whom our colleagues know of and read \non a regular basis, in the Washington Post, March 9, 1998, says:\n       Look at it from the viewpoint of those parents who grab so \n     avidly for the chance to get their children into better \n     schools: Should they be required to keep their children in \n     dreadful schools in order to keep those schools from growing \n     even worse? Should they be made to wait until we get around \n     to improving all the public schools? . . . Surely voucher \n     opponents cannot believe the logic of their counterargument: \n     that if you can't save everybody--whether from a burning \n     apartment house, a sinking ship or a dreadful school system--\n     it's better not to save anybody at all.\n\n  We basically have a provision in the underlying bill which, if you \nare locked into a school that fails 1 year, and then another year, and \nanother year, increases resources to try to bring that\n\n[[Page S4229]]\n\nschool up. After the third year, that parent is empowered to go to \nanother public school. A charter school is a public school.\n  But many of us would like to see that expanded to fully empower that \nparent to be able to take whatever money we pay as the taxpayer and \nallow that student to go anywhere. It is not in the underlying bill. \nAgain, it stops short of exactly where we would like to be.\n  Rod Paige, Superintendent, Houston independent school district, on \nJune 16, 1998, said:\n       [A limited voucher program] doesn't weaken public school \n     systems, it strengthens public school systems.]\n\n  That is from Houston Chronicle of June 16, 1998.\n  One more because the story is a powerful one as we look at choice. \nThe President's belief and my belief is that we need to maximize choice \nand demand strong accountability.\n  Urban League of Greater Miami, September 23, 1999, Christian Science \nMonitor:\n\n       . . .the Urban League of Greater Miami is opposing a \n     lawsuit against Florida's new voucher program. The NAACP, on \n     the other hand, is one of the parties seeking to stop \n     vouchers. They allow us to have access to educational \n     opportunity. . . .Why should a kid be forced to go to a \n     school where it is obvious that the school is not preparing \n     him or her to be competitive?\n\n  The underlying bill as amended today is a very powerful bill, again \ndeveloped in a bipartisan way, surrounding the principles we believe in \nstrongly and that recognize we have not done a service which our young \npeople today deserve. Yet there are ways to improve that bill.\n  I am very hopeful, as we look to choice, that we can empower because \nit is the parent whom we should trust most with the education of our \nchildren. The bill does not go as far as I believe we can and that our \nchildren deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, be added as a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes, three seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. I will yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nNew York, Mrs. Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to be supporting this critical \namendment, the Dodd-Collins amendment--and the Jeffords amendment--\nbecause I think that both of them offer the kind of real support in \nterms of resources that are needed to make good on the promise of this \nlegislation.\n  I share the support my friend from Tennessee has put forth on the \nunderlying structure of this bill, and what it offers our children and \nparents and teachers. But I also believe strongly that increasing \naccountability without also increasing and targeting resources to those \nchildren whom we know will have difficulty meeting the accountability \nmeasures is an essential and critical component to making this piece of \nlegislation all that it should be, and hopefully fulfilling the promise \nof leaving no child behind.\n  Earlier this week, I came to the floor to talk about my concern that \nincreasing accountability without providing resources needed to help \nour children meet these high standards and pass these new tests would \nbe an empty promise.\n  Right now, we know from the independent, nonpartisan Congressional \nResearch Service that in fiscal year 2001 Congress provided school \ndistricts with only one-third of the resources needed to fully serve \neligible students in order to help close the achievement gap.\n  With these limited funds, schools are using 70 to 80 percent of their \nfunds to pay the salaries of teachers and instructional aides, and have \nlittle left over for other critical investments, from ongoing \nprofessional development to reducing class sizes, or for providing all \nstudents eligible for title I with the extra help they need to meet \nhigh standards.\n  I have gone in and out of schools in our country for more than 18 \nyears. I have spent a lot of time in the schools of New York. I know \nthat we have the ingredients for improving education, but we have been \nreluctant to provide those ingredients in the quantities needed to the \nchildren who require them the most.\n  Yet even with our limited Federal investment, our urban school \ndistricts have actually shown gains in reading and math. Since 1992, \nnational reading and performance has improved for 9-year-olds in our \nhighest poverty public schools by nearly one grade level.\n  We know from local examples that title I is working. It will work if \nwe target the funds where they are needed. Let me just raise one \nexample. I could have picked many to talk about. I talked about some of \nthem in my earlier remarks in this Chamber.\n  P.S. 172 in Brooklyn, NY, enrolls over 600 students. Three-quarters \nare Hispanic, and virtually all of them receive free or reduced-price \nschool lunches. The school has operated a title I schoolwide program \nsince 1993. They have combined their Federal resources from title I, \nGoals 2000, title 7, with State and private funds to help all students \nachieve high standards.\n  Since 1994-1995, P.S. 172's third and sixth grade reading and \nmathematics scores on the New York State assessments have exceeded \ndistrict and city averages.\n  For what have they used this money? They help teachers implement a \nliteracy-focused curriculum through intensive professional development. \nA master teacher and a full-time staff development specialist mentor \nfirst-year teachers. We know how important that is. If we send a first \nyear, inexperienced teacher into an overcrowded classroom, and in some \nof the most difficult neighborhoods in our country, and we say: ``You \nare on your own; try to teach these children,'' whose first language is \nnot English, who come to school with all kinds of difficulties; ``teach \nthem to read, bring them up to standards,'' we are asking a whole lot \nfrom a young, inexperienced teacher.\n  But if we mentor that teacher and say: ``We are going to give you the \nhelp, the extra attention you need to be an effective teacher,'' we \nwill get positive results.\n  Teachers share their ideas and their expectations with each other and \nacross grade levels. They learn how to work in a crowded classroom with \nchildren who may not have the attention span that is needed. They do \neverything they can to really marshal those title I resources to make \nit possible to bring about the results that every one of us in this \nChamber want.\n  I do not question any one of my colleagues on either side of the \naisle about their commitment to improving the quality of education for \nour children, especially our most needy children. But what I do \nquestion is that we do not look at what has worked. We do not look at \nthe best practices where title I is making a difference, where schools \nare able to take those resources and get the kind of results that we \nare seeking.\n  In 1999, the Council of Great City Schools found that fourth and \neighth graders in urban schools did boost their performance. I have \nheard a lot of talk from Senators who say the Federal Government has \nnot made a difference, that title I has not made a difference. I \nrespectfully ask you to look at the evidence. Go to the schools where I \ngo. Talk to the teachers.\n  In fact, 87.5 percent of the urban school districts showed reading \ngains in title I schools, and 83 percent showed improvements in math \nachievement for title I students. We also found that the percentage of \ntitle I students in urban schools below the 25th percentile has been \ndeclining.\n  So we do have the formula. We have a recipe. We just need to make \nsure of the ingredients. Setting standards, testing to see whether \nchildren meet those standards, and looking for ways to bring more \nresources to bear is a winning strategy.\n  I could not be more in favor of what my good friends, Senator Dodd \nand Senator Collins, are attempting to do because if we do not focus \nour resources on these children, then I think our attempt to reform \neducation is not only an empty promise but really a fraudulent one. We \nare saying, fine, we are going to test these children. I have used this \nmetaphor before. It is similar\n\n[[Page S4230]]\n\nto handing out thermometers in the midst of an epidemic. We are going \nto find out we have a lot of sick children. We know that.\n  We know we have children who are under tremendous stresses in the \nworld today, who come from very difficult and dysfunctional \nenvironments, who cannot concentrate in school. Go in and do a random \ntest for the children's eyesight, and you will find children who cannot \nsee well enough to see the board, and they do not get any medical care \nfor that. Do a random dental care check, and you will find children, as \nI have, who have abscessed teeth, who are not concentrating or learning \nto read because they have too much pain which is dulling their \nabilities.\n  But we can today, with this debate, and with a bipartisan commitment \nwith the administration, make the changes that we know will work.\n  So I strongly urge all of my colleagues that we put our resources \nwhere our promises are. Let's not turn our back on the evidence of what \nworks.\n  I sometimes joke that Washington occasionally seems to be an \nevidence-free zone. We can come with stacks of evidence, with all kinds \nof reports; we can say, look, if we give a little more help, this title \nI school, using these best practices, will turn itself around. Instead, \nwe say, it is not working because all of these children, with all of \nthese difficulties, are not reading at grade level.\n  I know that if we are true to the mission that brings us to this \neducation debate, if we are willing to support, with resources, the \nkind of accountability we are asking from our children, we will see \nresults. We have seen results in the past.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join in supporting this amendment \nwhich will make a tremendous difference for our children.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 2 minutes on his \nside; and the other side has 1 minute 40 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me, again, thank our colleagues who have \naddressed this important subject. And I thank my colleague from New \nYork for her eloquent statement on the value of expanding the title I \nprogram, as my colleague from Maine and I are attempting to do with \nthis amendment. I do believe, if we have additional resources, based on \nthe evidence--and the evidence has been significant--that we will get \nresults.\n  There are those who suggest that because we have spent about $120 \nbillion on title I over 35 years and have not fully closed the \nachievement gap, that it is not working. But, over the years that has \nrepresented less than 3 cents of each dollar spent on education. We are \nproving today, while the results certainly are not perfect, that title \nI is essential to improving student achievement.\n  We have listened to those who are working on in the districts, in the \nschools, who do not have Ds or Rs associated with their names or wear \npolitical labels, who tell us it is making a difference.\n  What better evidence could we have than relying on those who every \nday do the hard work of trying to improve the intellectual and learning \ncapabilities of the 50 million children who go to public schools in \nAmerica? The amendment we are offering is based on that evidence. It is \nbased on the hard evidence that is provided by teachers and school \nboards and school principals and parents who have watched title I funds \nmake a difference.\n  We think they can make even more of a difference, particularly, in \nconjunction with accountability standards. We think that providing the \nresources to make it possible for these children to reach the goals we \nall want them to reach is absolutely critical if this Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 2001 is to be worthy of our nation's \nchildren.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Dodd-\nCollins amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield back the time, unless my colleague \nfrom Maine wants to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4230-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4230-S4232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have been discussing the schedule and \nvoting order with Senator Daschle and the managers of the legislation \nand how we would handle other issues. I think we have a good agreement. \nWe need to read it carefully and make sure we understand exactly who is \ngoing to be offering the amendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that if the House of Representatives has \nadopted and copies have been made available under the Senate rules, \nthen the Senate proceed to the conference report to accompany the \nbudget resolution at 10 a.m. on Monday, May 7, and the time between \nthen and 6:30 p.m. be divided with 12 hours under the control of the \nminority manager and 3\\1/2\\ hours under the control of the majority \nmanager.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on adoption of \nthe conference report at 6:30 p.m. and that paragraph 4 of rule XII be \nwaived.\n  As in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the 6:30 p.m. vote on Monday, May 7, the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Calendar No. 39, the nomination of John \nRobert Bolton to be Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security, and there be 3 hours of debate equally divided \nas follows: 30 minutes under control of the chairman, 30 minutes under \nthe control of the ranking member, 60 minutes under control of Senator \nDorgan, 30 minutes under the control of Senator Feinstein, and 30 \nminutes under the control of Senator Kerry.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the use of time the \nSenate proceed to vote at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, May 8, on the \nconfirmation of Mr. Bolton, and following the vote, the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and the Senate immediately resume legislative \nsession.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of S. 1 at 10 a.m. on Friday, the next amendment to be in \norder be offered by Senator Craig regarding ESEA funding, and the next \namendment in order for the minority side of the aisle be an amendment \nby Senator Kennedy, or his designee, and that any votes ordered with \nrespect to these amendments occur in a stacked sequence after the 6:30 \nvote on Monday, with no second degrees in order, and 2 minutes prior to \neach vote for explanation.\n  I note that we are not sure which amendment Senator Kennedy or the \nDemocrats will want to go with in the morning. It could be Senator \nMurray, Senator Wellstone, or some other amendment. I believe you will \nwork that out during the vote, and we will need to be notified, of \ncourse, of which one it will be and its substance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to ask the majority leader, is there any way that he could \npostpone this vote until Tuesday morning? I will not be here Monday \nevening. There is no way I can be here. I haven't missed a vote this \nyear.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will withhold one moment, I believe Senator \nByrd has a question, too, and then I will come back to the Senator in a \nminute.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the leader. Mr. President, I am very much opposed \nto lining up votes, stacking votes, and I am constrained to object to \nstacking votes. I don't think that is a good way to do business in the \nSenate. I have bitten my tongue many times and did not object. I think \nI should put both leaders on notice, if I may use that kind of\n\n[[Page S4231]]\n\nlanguage, that I am going to be a little tougher to deal with when it \ncomes to stacking votes in the future than I have been in the past. I \ndon't think it is a good idea. I don't think Senators know what they \nare voting on.\n  We ought to be here and be ready to vote. I know the problems of both \nleaders. I know them well. I am not going to object in this instance, \nbut I want to put the Senate on notice that I will have a more \ndifficult time in the future voting for sequential amendments in a \nstacked order. I will not object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Daschle working with \nme. Senator Daschle and I have been talking about ways we could \naccommodate as many Senators as possible. It is often difficult because \na lot of us have very important responsibilities. But we also have a \nresponsibility to pass education amendments, a budget resolution, and \nnominations. So I will modify the unanimous consent request in this \nway, without at this point changing the time.\n  If any time on the budget resolution should be yielded back on \nMonday, we could go back at that point to the education bill, and at \nthat time if there are other amendments that could be offered--and I \npresume there would be two--then we would get an agreement as to when \nthey would be voted on, realizing that Senator Byrd would not want to \nhave a stacked sequence of multiple votes. That way, we can get more \neducation work done Monday. I encourage those who will be handling the \nbudget to consider doing that, if at all possible. Senator Daschle \nsuggested perhaps that will work.\n\n  I modify my earlier request to change the stacked votes of the two \namendments that will be offered tomorrow, if votes are required, and \nthe budget resolution at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Plus the Bolton nomination.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Bolton nomination is already in the request at 9:30 \na.m.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask the majority leader, to understand \nthe steps we are going through, is the majority leader saying to the \nSenate we will postpone the 5:30 p.m. or 6:30 p.m. vote on Monday until \nTuesday morning?\n  Mr. LOTT. Tuesday morning at 9:30. I believe that will cause the \nsacrifice of other Senators, but that is what it provides. The votes \nwill be at 9:30 a.m. instead of 6:30 p.m. on Monday.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is there an understanding on Tuesday morning there will \nbe time for both sides to sum up before the vote on the budget?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the UC provides for 2 minutes prior to each vote \nfor final explanation of the vote about to occur.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I do not intend to object. As the leader has pointed \nout, we have been on this bill for some time. We are prepared to move \nahead tomorrow and on Monday. There are a number of amendments. We are \nprepared to go through Tuesday evening or Wednesday evening or Thursday \nevening, but I hope we will not be put in the position later on, since \nwe have been on this bill for some time, where we have to come to a \nvote, denying Members the opportunity to offer their amendments.\n  I wanted to put that in the Record at this time because we are \nprepared to move ahead. We are glad to accommodate the leadership, but \nwe have additional amendments that are extremely important. I want to \nmake it very clear, I want to make sure people are going to be fairly \ntreated. I am glad to accommodate others, but I want to make sure those \nwho are going to offer amendments will be accommodated. There is no \nreason not to think so tonight. I just felt compelled to raise that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand that. That is why I want us to \nmake progress and try to make progress on Monday. Certainly the Senate \nshould be prepared to go into the evening Tuesday, Wednesday, and \nThursday, to complete this important legislation.\n  Senators need to cooperate with the managers and be prepared to offer \namendments tomorrow, Monday afternoon, and Tuesday night because what \nwill happen is, we are all busy and when we get to next Thursday, when \nwe need to start wrapping it up, Senators will say: I didn't have a \nchance.\n  They have their chance. I hope both sides will talk to the managers \nand be prepared to offer their amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object. For clarification, are we \nlimited to two amendments tomorrow?\n  Mr. LOTT. Under this agreement, it specifies two, but I see no reason \nwhy we cannot do more if it can be worked out.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I modify the UC request that two or more amendments be \noffered tomorrow and that those amendments be accommodated.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is a good idea, Mr. President. I support that although \nnoting we specify the first two that will be in order and we should go \nbeyond that if at all possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as further \nmodified?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, two questions. One, we had people on this \nside ask for a little more time on Tuesday morning--we have at least 5 \nminutes on the budget--given the importance of it.\n  No. 2, is there an order to the votes on Tuesday morning?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first of all, I modify the request that we \nextend the time on the budget to 5 minutes instead of 2 for the others. \nThe order will be: Budget, the two education amendments, with the Craig \namendment first, then Senator Kennedy, or designee, and then the Bolton \nnomination.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I request that given the importance of the budget, \nin terms of the sequence, there be at least one amendment preceding it \nso people are here to actually hear the debate?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let's modify it to do the Bolton vote first, \nand then we will go to the budget vote after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as so \nmodified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, would you repeat that unanimous consent back \nto me?\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. LOTT. Just kidding, Mr. President. I think we all have it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 361\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senate that there are 2 \nminutes equally divided on the Jeffords amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  This is the Jeffords test trigger amendment. Under the bill, grades 3 \nthrough 8 will have to be tested by each State. The Federal Government \nis supposed to fund the cost of those tests. The amendment merely says \nif there is no money, there is no test, at least for that year.\n  This is to prevent the States from being placed in a position of \nhaving no money and having to administer very expensive tests.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask the senior Senator from Vermont\n\n[[Page S4232]]\n\nwhether he requires a rollcall vote or if he will accept a voice vote.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I want a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered. Do \nSenators yield back there time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n361. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 93, nays 7, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 90 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--93\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--7\n\n     Gramm\n     Helms\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n  The amendment (No. 361) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD.

There are now 2 minutes equally divided before \nthe vote on the Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the cosponsor of this amendment, Senator \nCollins of Maine, and I, think we made such a convincing argument \nduring the hour and a half debate that we will yield our 2 minutes, and \nwe ask for the immediate vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on the events of a Judiciary Committee meeting this morning \nwhere the agenda contained the nominations of Larry Thompson to be \nDeputy Attorney General and Ted Olson to be Solicitor General.\n  Those nominations had moved through all of the procedural hurdles. \nThe hearings were held 4 weeks ago. Many questions had been answered. \nIn accordance with the Judiciary Committee rules, they had been held \nover for a week so that they were ready for action when the Judiciary \nCommittee met today.\n  I will say they are very important nominations because the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States is the only official requiring \nconfirmation who has been confirmed so far. He does not have the No. 2 \nperson, the Deputy; he does not have the No. 3 person, the Solicitor \nGeneral.\n  The discussion in the Judiciary Committee, instead of focusing on \nthose individuals for confirmation, the discussion concerned itself \nwith the blue slips and the American Bar Association and many \ncollateral matters.\n  Finally, when the chairman of the committee, Senator Hatch, said he \nwas going to rule all other discussion out of order and we would \nproceed to a vote, at that point, the ranking Democrat said there was \ngoing to be a caucus, and the Democrats--there are very few of them \nthere; actually three, perhaps four--started to file out of the room so \nthat there were only nine Senators present, not enough for a quorum of \n10 which is necessary to have any Senate action.\n  It was an unusual executive session because all nine Republicans came \nto the session because of the importance of acting on the Deputy \nAttorney General and the Solicitor General.\n  Then the Republicans sat and waited and waited and waited for a \ncaucus to conclude by the Democrats. Finally, when it was apparent \nthere would be no response, the executive session was over.\n  The announcement was made that if there was not an undertaking by the \nDemocrats to have a vote on those two positions by 4 o'clock this \nafternoon, or after our votes which are scheduled at 4 o'clock, that \nthe Republican members would proceed in a news conference to tell the \nAmerican people exactly what had happened.\n  With an evenly divided, 50/50 Senate, 50 Democrats and 50 \nRepublicans, there has been a great deal of controversy, and almost all \nof it has been below the surface. But today in plain public view, this \ncontroversy erupted.\n  The executive session of the Judiciary Committee was being televised, \nand it is certainly unsenatorial to have this kind of conflict.\n  Enough is enough, and the time has come that the American people need \nto know that the important business of a very important department of \nthe Federal Government cannot be conducted because the Attorney General \nalone is the only official of rank who has had Senate confirmation and \ncannot carry on all the duties. He needs the No. 2 person, the Deputy, \nand he needs the No. 3 person, the Solicitor General. It is not \nirrelevant to note that in the executive committee session of the \nJudiciary Committee today, we had, in addition, the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Antitrust Division and the Assistant Attorney General \nfor Legislation.\n  I make no special point about the failure of the committee to report \nthose nominees out because this was\n\n[[Page S4233]]\n\nthe first week they were on the agenda, and there is the established \nright of any member to hold over anybody for a 1-week period.\n  The people's business needs to be conducted, and the long discussion \nwhich ensued over the blue slip, which is an arcane procedure where \nSenators can have a lot to say or perhaps the controlling determination \nabout U.S. district court judges, is not of much interest to the \nAmerican people.\n  The input and status of the American Bar Association, while I think \nit is important, and I think there ought to be some input at least to \ndistrict court judges, is not of great interest. I think the American \npeople are concerned about what happens in the Department of Justice.\n  Again, I say, regrettably, it is not senatorial to have this kind of \ngridlock spill out into the public arena and into the public press. But \nI think the American people need to know what is happening.\n  Not too long ago, someone said on a controversial issue, ``Where is \nthe outrage? Where is the outrage?'' This is one of those items where I \nthink there may be some outrage, once America knows that there is \ngridlock on a great many collateral issues which do not affect at all \nthe confirmations of the Deputy Attorney General, a very able man, \nLarry Thompson, or the confirmation of the Solicitor General, a very \nable man, Ted Olson. On that there has been no disagreement. Nobody has \nquestioned that those people ought to be confirmed. But they are not \nbeing confirmed, and the business of the Department of Justice cannot \nbe conducted. I think once there is focus on that, we may see a little \nchange in the practices in the Judiciary Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there has been some talk on the floor today \nabout things going on in the Judiciary Committee. I want to report that \nSenators Ensign and Harry Reid are setting an example of what we \nbelieve is the right way to approach judicial nominations.\n  Yesterday, Senator Ensign sent to President Bush four judicial \nselections. Senator Ensign went over these with me and asked me what I \nthought of the selections. When the day comes for the blue slip, I will \nsign in very large letters my name. These are very good people to be \nnominated.\n  James Mahan, district court judge in Las Vegas, practiced law when I \nwas there. He is an outstanding trial lawyer. He did not only trial \nwork but he did business law work.\n  Larry Hicks, who is from an excellent law firm, almost became a \nFederal judge. The elections came and interfered with him being a \nFederal judge some 7\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  You cannot find two better lawyers than James Mahan and Larry Hicks.\n  In addition to that, Senator Ensign sent two persons just as capable \nas the other two. Walt Cannon practiced law in Las Vegas during the \nsame period of time as I did. He is an outstanding lawyer. He has done \na tremendous amount of trial work. He has appeared before juries on \nnumerous occasions. He knows what a courtroom is all about. He has a \nperfect demeanor to be a judge.\n  Finally, Senator Ensign sent the name of another district court judge \nby the name of Mark Gibbon who practiced law in Las Vegas at the same \ntime as I did. He is a fine lawyer. But he has been a better judge than \nhe was a lawyer.\n  I want the work of Senator Ensign, with my acceptance, to be the \nmodel for what we need to do with judicial nominations. Both of us \nagree that we should report them out very fast, get the work done as \nquickly as possible, and get them on the bench so they can do the work.\n  The blue slip has worked very well in the past. I think we should \ncontinue with the example that Senator Ensign and I have done in the \nState of Nevada.\n  I compliment Senator Ensign for the fine people he nominated to be \nFederal district court judges. I look forward to working with him in \nthe future. I think we have a routine that will work well for this \nCongress, and hopefully thereafter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4233-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4233-S4235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMMUNITY-BASED OUTPATIENT CLINICS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                                AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, Congress transformed the landscape of \nhealth care delivery for veterans with the Veterans' Health Care \nEligibility Reform Act of 1996. This law eliminated barriers to \noutpatient care and encouraged the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, \nto offer health care services to veterans in the most clinically \nappropriate setting. VA responded by shifting its emphasis from \nhospital-based treatment to outpatient care, and in just a few years \nhas opened more than 250 new community-based outpatient clinics.\n  I am enormously pleased that VA has opened community clinics in West \nVirginia and throughout the country. It is critical to bring health \ncare services closer to veterans, especially as our veterans population \ncontinues to age. But it is not sufficient merely to increase the \naccessibility of care, we must also ensure that veterans receive the \nhighest quality of care possible. Just as I fought to secure outpatient \nclinics for veterans, I will fight to ensure that these clinics are the \nvery best that they can be.\n  At my request, the Democratic staff of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs surveyed more than 200 VA community-based outpatient \nclinics nationwide to evaluate the success, capacity, and quality of \ncare in these clinics. This self-reported information from individual \nclinics offers Congress and VA an opportunity to assess services \nprovided by the various clinics, and to determine where improvements \ncan be made to ensure that veterans receive the best possible care. The \nDemocratic committee staff report concludes that, although all clinics \nreported offering primary care, services varied markedly by clinic and \nby geographic location.\n  VA's 22 regional network directors, rather than VA Headquarters, hold \nresponsibility for activating, operating, and overseeing the community \nclinics. Although this provides flexibility to local VA managers, the \nvariations in services described by clinic staff appear to result from \nvaried management practices rather than deliberate adaptations to \ncommunity needs.\n  For example, staffing levels did not appear to be related to the \nnumber of patients seen, and varied among clinics and among networks. \nSome clinics served about 5,000 patients in the first half of fiscal \nyear 2000 with the equivalent of 15 full-time health care providers, \nwhile others served the same number of patients with only six full-time \nstaff. Some clinics operated with fewer than two full-time employees.\n  Variations in staffing translated into differences in the types and \nlevels of services provided, including basic mental health care. Less \nthan half of the clinics surveyed offered even minimal mental health \ncare, an issue of concern as VA continues to close its inpatient mental \nhealth care clinics. In several areas of the country, waiting times for \nan appointment for primary care ranged from 30 to 150 days. More than \n60 percent of the community clinics lacked equipment and personnel to \nrespond to a cardiac emergency, an issue of patient safety.\n  VA's lack of a consistent, nationwide system for collecting and \nanalyzing information on health care outcomes and treatment costs is an \nobstacle to measuring the success of VA's outpatient clinics. VA must \ndevelop tools to allow community clinics to monitor health outcomes, so \nthat veterans can depend on a system that not only meets their needs \nbut continues to improve their health status. Clinics must be able to \ncombine this information on health outcomes with accurate data about \ncosts of treatment, so that VA can ensure the effective and efficient \nuse of resources at all clinics.\n  I certainly do not expect community clinics to offer the full range \nof services available in a large medical center. However, it is \nreasonable to assume that a veteran seeking primary care through a VA \noutpatient clinic should be able to expect a minimum standard package \nof services and an acceptable quality of care, regardless of geographic \nlocation. Oversight by VA headquarters and by Congress is essential to \nensuring consistency in the services and quality of care offered to \nveterans through community clinics.\n  I have forwarded a copy of this report to VA Secretary Anthony \nPrincipi, and I look forward to working with him to\n\n[[Page S4234]]\n\nmake certain that veterans who turn to VA's community care clinics can \nexpect not just access, but excellence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the executive summary of the \nDemocratic committee staff report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Staff Report on Community-Based Outpatient Clinics in the Veterans \n         Health Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs\n\n    (Prepared by the Democratic staff of the Committee on Veterans' \n  Affairs, United States Senate, for Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, \n                      Ranking member, May 3, 2001)\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       Background--In 1996, Congress broke down the barriers to \n     developing an outpatient care network within the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. The Veterans' \n     Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-\n     262) simplified eligibility rules, mandated uniformity in \n     services offered to veterans, and eliminated legal barriers \n     to the sharing of health care resources with other providers. \n     In response, VA has shifted emphasis from providing hospital-\n     based care to treating more veterans in outpatient clinics. \n     Much of the new outpatient care is being provided in \n     Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), local, often \n     small clinics, some operated by VA staff, others managed by \n     contractors for VA.\n       Responsibility for activation, operation, and oversight of \n     CBOCs rests with VA's 22 Veterans Integrated Service Networks \n     (VISNs) directors, contingent upon congressional approval. \n     Between 1996 and 2001, more than 250 CBOCs have been \n     activated, with the goal of improving access to care for many \n     veterans. CBOC staff may treat veterans in the community \n     clinic or refer them to the parent VA medical center for more \n     intensive treatment and then provide followup care through \n     the clinic.\n       As a consequence of the establishment of the CBOCs and \n     other changes in response to the Eligibility Reform Act of \n     1996, more veterans are accessing primary care in the \n     outpatient setting. VA estimates that the total number of \n     annual outpatient visits (in all facilities) has increased \n     from 26 million to 42 million in the last 5 years. Of the 229 \n     clinics that completed surveys for this report, total \n     outpatient visits in the first half of FY 2000 increased more \n     than 20% over the equivalent period in FY 1999.\n       Democratic Staff Project--At the direction of Ranking \n     Member John D. Rockefeller IV, the Democratic staff of the \n     Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs undertook an oversight \n     project to determine whether CBOCs have fulfilled their \n     potential to deliver high quality care to veterans in an \n     effective and efficient manner.\n       To carry out this project, staff members designed a survey \n     questionnaire intended to obtain information regarding \n     capacity and performance directly from the clinics. This \n     survey requested information on operation and management \n     issues, staffing, hours of operation, patient load, \n     availability and timeliness of care, costs, and quality of \n     care. Staff mailed surveys directly to the 257 \n     congressionally approved clinics for which valid mailing \n     addresses could be obtained--rather than to VISN offices or \n     to parent medical center directors--and compiled the \n     results for federal FY 1999 (October 1, 1998-September 30, \n     1999) and the first two quarters of federal FY 2000 \n     (October 1, 1999-March 31, 2000).\n       Based on this self-reported information from individual \n     clinics, this report is intended to offer an opportunity to \n     assess services provided by the various clinics and to \n     determine where improvements can be made to ensure that \n     veterans receive the best possible care.\n       Data Collection and Validity--VA programs frequently suffer \n     from flawed data collection and monitoring, and outpatient \n     care provided by CBOCs is no different. No single VA source \n     could provide Committee staff with accessible and objective \n     information on clinic services systemwide. Thus, the validity \n     of the information received via the surveys must rely solely \n     upon the precision and accuracy with which clinic staff \n     completed the questionnaire. Despite Committee staff efforts \n     to design unambiguous questions regarding basic operational \n     parameters, the responses lacked uniformity. Some respondents \n     indicated that the requested data for specific questions had \n     never been properly collected or could not be accessed. \n     Because a site audit of each clinic was beyond the scope of \n     Democratic Committee staff resources, this report relies \n     solely on self-reported data, with caveats for incomplete or \n     subjective responses noted.\n       Findings and Conclusions--While community-based clinics \n     appear to offer an appropriate avenue for increasing \n     veterans' access to care, the unevenness of responses to the \n     staff survey precludes any generalized conclusions on the \n     collective success, capacity, and quality of these clinics. \n     The available data show wide variety in every possible \n     parameter of clinic function, both within and among networks. \n     This variability, which suggests a significant lack of \n     uniformity among the CBOCs, prevents easy summaries or simple \n     solutions for possible deficits.\n       The flexibility inherent in the decentralized VA health \n     care system has allowed network and medical center directors, \n     rather than VA Headquarters, to map the course of VA's \n     community-based outpatient care. While this arrangement does \n     not preclude provision of excellent health care in individual \n     clinics and does present the opportunity to tailor services \n     to each community's demands, the significant variations in \n     operational standards described by clinic staff appear to \n     reflect varied management practices rather than deliberate \n     adaptations to community needs.\n       Based on the variability in services--and in the vocabulary \n     for describing operational standards--the Democratic \n     Committee Staff can only infer that VA has not established a \n     systemwide baseline for the minimum acceptable service levels \n     in CBOCs. Community clinics should not be expected to offer \n     identical or completely inclusive services. However, veterans \n     accessing primary care through VA outpatient clinics should \n     be able to depend upon a minimum standard package of \n     services, regardless of geographic location, and on an \n     acceptable level of quality of care. Also, the Congress \n     should be able to expect an effective and efficient use of \n     resources at all CBOCs.\n       Specific findings include the following: The number of FTEE \n     (full-time employee equivalents) providing primary care \n     varied markedly among clinics and did not appear to be linked \n     consistently to the patient load. Staffing levels for clinics \n     serving about 5,000 patients in the first half of FY 2000 \n     ranged from 6 to 15 FTEE. Some clinics operated with fewer \n     than two FTEE, raising significant concerns about the ability \n     of such a limited staff to offer high quality health care \n     while performing administrative tasks and monitoring quality \n     of care.\n       VA does not provide the same services in all clinics. \n     Variations in staffing translate into variations in the types \n     and levels of services provided, including basic mental \n     health care, both preventive and counseling services, and \n     overall hours of service. Veterans in different regions \n     should be able to expect a standard basic package of \n     services.\n       Community clinics have not eliminated long waiting times to \n     obtain an appointment and to receive treatment in every \n     network in accordance with VA goals. The longest actual \n     waiting time for an appointment exceeded 30 days in 18 \n     networks. Only a few clinics reported having a defined policy \n     for accepting and scheduling ``walk-ins.''\n       Many community clinics lacked equipment and personnel to \n     respond to a cardiac emergency, an issue of patient safety. \n     Each clinic should have, at minimum, an automated external \n     defibrillator and staff trained in its use. Only 38% of \n     clinics reported having the staff and equipment necessary in \n     the case of a cardiac emergency.\n       Community clinics have not offered sufficient outpatient \n     mental health care to compensate for the loss of VHA \n     impatient programs. The number of VA medical facility beds \n     available for impatient mental health care has declined \n     steadily over the last two decades. By the end of FY 2001, VA \n     anticipates reducing the numbers of patients treated in \n     inpatient psychiatric care programs by 56% from the level \n     treated in FY 1995. Outpatient mental health care programs \n     provide a complement to (although not a substitute for) acute \n     inpatient care, and can serve as a valuable community-based \n     tool in a comprehensive mental health care maintenance \n     regimen.\n       If outpatient programs are to play a part in maintaining \n     systemwide capacity for mental health care treatment of \n     veterans, they must be accessible to veterans at the sites of \n     outpatient care. Yet, less than half of the clinics \n     surveyed reported offering any mental health care. Of the \n     229 clinics that responded to the staff survey, only 50 \n     reported that they provided PTSD treatment, and only 42 \n     reported offering substance abuse treatment of any kind. \n     Mental health care FTEE constituted only a small fraction \n     of the total clinic staff in most networks.\n       Clinics report a range of costs per patient visit, with the \n     average cost per visit within a network in FY 1999 ranging \n     from $27 to $290. Calculating the cost-effectiveness of \n     outpatient treatment requires a uniform method of calculating \n     actual costs, which VA currently lacks. Whether the variation \n     in patient visit costs reported by clinics represents varying \n     staff efficiency or differences in treating ``revenue-\n     generating'' insured patients cannot be determined from the \n     data here.\n       The lack of a coherent system for collecting, monitoring, \n     and analyzing quality of care data prevents evaluation of \n     community care success. Almost all clinics reported that they \n     document and monitor the quality of health care provided, but \n     the clinic staff who completed the surveys had widely varying \n     perceptions of what constituted a quality of care assessment. \n     The materials presented for documenting quality of care \n     ranged from medical checklists to patient satisfaction \n     surveys that focused largely on aspects of patients' physical \n     and emotional comfort in the clinic setting, rather than \n     health care-related criteria. None documented health \n     outcomes. Only 130 clinics reported sending any quality of \n     care reports (regardless of content) to the parent \n     facilities, and none received written feedback specific to \n     that clinic from the parent facilities. The complete lack of \n     a shared vocabulary for measuring quality of care prevented \n     any compilation of the data. One clinic operated by a \n     contractor responded that monitoring quality is not part of \n     its contract.\n\n[[Page S4235]]\n\n       The poor or absent measures of quality of care make the \n     effectiveness of the care provided by the clinics, variations \n     between contracts- and VA-operated clinics, and the effect of \n     staffing inequities impossible to judge. VA needs a \n     consistent set of tools that can be employed in outpatient \n     clinics systemwide to obtain meaningful quality of care \n     outcomes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4235-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4235-S4237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            VICE PRESIDENT'S TORONTO SPEECH ON ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on Monday of this week, the Vice \nPresident gave a speech in Toronto laying out some of the broad themes \nof the Administration's developing energy policy.\n  Some of the points made by the Vice President were valid. I want to \ncomment on some of those. I obviously realize that we are now in the \nmiddle of the debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I \nintend to come back to the floor either later today or next week to \ntalk about that legislation and to commend the sponsor of it and the \nDemocratic ranking member, Senator Kennedy. Senator Jeffords and \nSenator Kennedy have done yeoman's work in putting that legislation \ntogether.\n  I want to take the opportunity this next week to go through that in \nsome detail. But today I wanted to take a few minutes to talk about \nenergy issues since the Vice President is clearly focused on this and \nis speaking out strongly on it.\n  I agree with much of what the Vice President has said.\n  For example:\n\n       I agree with him that we face some serious long-term issues \n     in national energy policy.\n       I agree with him that our response must have comprehensive \n     and long-term focus.\n       I agree with him that we are very dependent on coal and \n     nuclear power for electricity generation, and this dependence \n     will probably continue into the future.\n\n  There are a number of other points, however, where I fear he may have \noverstated a particular point of view or missed the mark. Let me just \ncite some of those.\n  The Vice President seemed to equate energy conservation with \nrationing for something like rationing. I don't know of anyone \nadvocating energy conservation who supports rationing. He also stated \nthat ``some groups are suggesting that government step in to force \nAmericans to consume less energy.''\n  That is certainly not any proposal I have made or seen here in the \nCongress.\n  What I think would be helpful to the discussion is perhaps to \nidentify the questions that need to be asked about energy policy as we \nproceed over the next few weeks with consideration of the energy \npolicies that the administration is going to recommend as well as those \nthat have been introduced here in the Congress.\n  Let me cite essentially five questions and elaborate on them \nslightly.\n  The first question that I believe should be asked is whether the \nenergy policy, the one that the Vice President is going to advocate, or \nthat any of us here are advocating, adequately recognizes the enormous \ndifferences between energy markets in the 1970s and 1980s and those \nthat we face today.\n  Back in the 1970s, there was a lot of talk about eliminating our \ndependency on foreign imports with increased domestic production \nthrough ``Project Independence.'' Electricity markets were local, \nelectricity suppliers were largely confined within State boundaries and \nregulated by State public utility commissions. Because a State public \nutility commission could guarantee its utilities fixed rates of return \non their investments in infrastructure, such as large nuclear power \nplants, there was a market for them.\n  We now face a very different situation. Electricity markets have \nbecome regional, and increasingly they are beyond the ability of State \npublic utility commissions to regulate. The nationwide electrical grid \nis being called upon to transmit large amounts of electrical power \nacross enormous distances, something it was not really designed to do. \nState regulation of electricity has given way to a system that relies \nmore on market forces, even though electricity markets are far from \nperfect ones. The old model of a protected and regulated monoply \nenvironment for utility investments in new generation has been \ntransformed into a ``wild wild west'' of decentralized generation by a \nwelter of new actors.\n  No where do the changes in energy markets manifest themselves more \nclearly than in the situation facing energy infrastructure. Attempts to \nblame Federal environmental regulations for the difficulties of siting \nand building energy infrastructure are severely off the mark. The most \nserious obstacle to building new energy infrastructure has been not at \nthe Federal level, though, but at the local level and in capital \nmarkets. For example, the Vice President and other Administration \nofficials have often observed over the last several weeks that it has \nbeen 20 years since a large refinery has been built in the United \nStates. But the main reason has not been the Clean Air Act. It has been \nthe low rates of return on capital in the refining sector and the \nrefining overcapacity that existed up to a few years ago. You are not \ngoing to build a new refinery when there are already too many to serve \nthe market, and up until recently, that was the case.\n  The need for energy infrastructure has provoked serious local concern \nand opposition. One example, which has been in the news, is the \nLonghorn pipeline from the Gulf Coast to El Paso, Texas. It has been \ntied up for nearly 5 years addressing community opposition to its \nconstruction. If the energy industry can't build pipelines in Texas, I \ndon't think we should assume it will be any easier to build them \nanywhere else.\n  The result of these factors--economic and local--have been cited at a \nhearing before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee last week by \na witness from ExxonMobil, who testified that our largest U.S.-based \noil company does not believe that any new refineries will be built in \nthe United States. He predicted that the only additions to U.S. \nrefining capacity would come from expansions at existing facilities. \nExpanding that capacity will not be easy regardless of federal \npolicies. Most refineries are located in heavily industrialized areas \nwith significant environmental issues regulated at the State and local \nlevels of government.\n\n  Instead of looking for ways to blame the Federal Government for an \nenergy infrastructure problem which has not been of the Federal \nGovernment's making, I think we need to look for creative new ways to \nrespond to the challenges of working with State and local communities \non these siting issues. Effective mechanisms for greater regional \ncooperation are critical to ensure adequate infrastructure investments \nare made on a timely basis to meet energy demand. Coordinated regional \nefforts on energy infrastructure can reduce the impact on communities \nby optimizing infrastructure use and reducing price volatility.\n  If the Vice President's energy policy recognizes this complex reality \nand starts to address it, then it will be helping the country to make a \npositive step forward. If the answer from the Vice President's study is \nsimply to try to pit energy needs against environmental protection, \nthen we won't be looking at a comprehensive and balanced energy policy.\n  The second question to ask of the Vice President's comments this week \nis how this so-called energy policy that we are envisioning will \nconnect planned actions related to energy with climate change policy.\n  Science has been developed showing fairly clearly today that there is \na connection between human activity and climate change. We may not be \nable to prove the exact amount of human causation in the global warming \nthat we see, or to model its precise regional impacts. But we know \nenough now to realize that our ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse \ngases pose substantial risks both to critical and fragile ecosystems \naround the world and to future generations of humans. The world will \nhave to deal with the issue, and the United States must be a leading \ncontributor to negotiations on any international framework to address \nglobal warming. A leadership role for the United States is required not \nonly because we are a major emitter of greenhouse gases, but also \nbecause we have the leading capability to harness science and \ntechnology both to understand climate change and to respond to it.\n  We, as a country, need to have a climate change policy. We need to \nput in\n\n[[Page S4236]]\n\nplace some actions to deal with this new science. One part of the \npositive contributions that the United States has made to international \nclimate change negotiations has been our success in getting flexible, \nmarket-based mechanisms and recognition of carbon sinks incorporated \ninto the developing international framework. U.S. industry, \nparticularly in the energy sector, has indicated that these provisions \nare essential to holding down the eventual energy costs of responding \nto human- induced climate change. But without the United States as an \nactive insider in the international negotiations, these important \nflexibility mechanisms will be lost. The decision of the new Bush \nadministration to back away from the Kyoto protocol may doom the \nflexibility that we have won in the discussions to date. It could also \nspur other countries to erect new obstacles to American firms wishing \nto expand into international energy markets, in retaliation for the \nPresident's retreat on CO2.\n  While negotiations on an international framework to address global \nwarming continue for the next several years, our domestic industry will \nhave to make significant investment decisions on new energy \ninfrastructure. We have no domestic framework on greenhouse gas \nemissions that would guide or even inform these investment decisions. \nAddressing these issues up front would reduce business costs and risks. \nMaintaining our present course would increase the probability of future \neconomic losses and waste in the energy sector.\n  For these reasons, we need to integrate energy policy and climate \nchange policy. They are inextricably linked--to do one is, by \nimplication, to do the other. U.S. industry deserves to know how we are \ngoing to address greenhouse gas emissions before it invests billions of \ndollars in new energy infrastructure. If the Vice President's answer is \nthat we will do energy policy now and worry about climate change later, \nthen we don't have a truly comprehensive and balanced energy policy.\n  Mr. President, I do not pretend to have the exact answer for what our \nglobal climate change policy should be, but I know we need to have one. \nWe cannot continue to look the other way and pretend that the issue \ndoes not exist. So I look forward to seeing what the Vice President \nrecommends in his energy recommendations and how it relates to this \nclimate change issue.\n  The third question is to ask what kind of balance is being made \nbetween increasing production and increasing efficiency. I know there \nhas been some rhetoric in that connection to the effect there needs to \nbe an adequate balance. I do not believe any of the concrete proposals \nI have seen coming out of the administration or suggested by people \nfrom the administration have in them the necessary balance. We know \nthat the Vice President is all for increasing energy supplies, and most \npeople would agree that increasing supply is one essential part of the \nbig national energy picture. The Senate Democratic energy bill contains \nnumerous measures to improve energy supplies across the entire \nspectrum--coal, oil and gas, renewables, and nuclear. The other \nessential part of the energy picture, though, is increasing efficiency. \nIf we use energy more wisely to attain the same amount of economic \noutput, we improve our economy and reduce the burden that energy \ninfrastructure imposes on local communities.\n  Since the 1970s, new technologies have increased our nation's \nproductivity in many ways, including our use of energy. Technologies \nthat increase energy efficiency have allowed the U.S. economy today, \ncompared to 20 years ago, to produce the same output with 30 percent \nless energy. Even greater savings are possible in the future, with \nappropriate federal leadership.\n  Consumers really benefit when they get goods and services at cheaper \nprices because less energy is required to produce them. With that in \nmind, I was surprised and saddened by the decision at the Department of \nEnergy last month to roll back the proposed efficiency standard for new \ncentral air conditioning systems. The rationale given was that the \nhigher standard wasn't cost effective. But the cost-benefit analysis \nDepartment of Energy relied upon used average electricity costs from 5 \nyears ago. It is surprising to see the administration, on the one hand, \ninsist that this summer's high electricity costs in the West be passed \nalong to consumers to control peak loads, while in the next breath \nstate that its efficiency policies should be based on the lower \nelectricity costs that prevailed 5 years ago in this country. And if \nthe administration is really worried about the need to build 1300-1900 \nnew power plants, it should realize that its rollback of air-\nconditioning standards just added 43 more big power plants to whatever \nnumber will be needed by 2020.\n\n  Another area of energy efficiency that cannot be ignored is vehicle \nfuel efficiency. The Vice President has alluded to the dangers of our \nincreasing dependence on imported oil. Yet that dependence is directly \nrelated to our increasing consumption of oil in the transportation \nsector. The only realistic solution to this problem is to couple \nefforts to increase domestic production with a concerted effort to \nreduce fuel use by light duty vehicles--cars, trucks and SUV's. \nIncentives for hybrid and high efficiency vehicles could be part of a \nmore comprehensive program, but are not adequate by themselves. The \nFederal fleet, through its choice of vehicles, should be a leader in \nreversing this trend. All regulatory and non-regulatory mechanisms \nshould be employed to stem demand growth to a level we can management \nas a society.\n  If the Vice President's energy policy does not take a fresh look at \nthe need to improve energy efficiency through forward-looking \nstandards, then it is probably not a truly balanced and comprehensive \nenergy strategy.\n  A fourth question is to ask of the Vice President's energy policy--\nand all of these policies floating around in Congress--is whether one \nof the greatest national resources we have in Ameria--that is, our \ncapacity for scientific and technological innovation--is being \nstimulated and engaged to solve our energy problems. So far, the \nadministration, in my view, at least, has failed badly on this score. \nThe 2002 research and development budget proposed by the President for \nthe Department of Energy contains severe cuts for a variety of advanced \nenergy technologies, even in areas, like nuclear energy research, that \none would expect would be favored by this administration. There has \nnever been a time when increased investments in energy research and \ndevelopment were more needed, or showed more promise for solving some \nof our problems. I hope very much that will be changed in the \ndeliberations that result in the task force's report. We need to be \nincreasing these investments across the board--in coal, in nuclear, in \nrenewables, in oil and gas, in energy efficiency, and in the basic \nscience that underpins all of those. If the Vice President's energy \npolicy does not dramatically turn around the cuts being proposed for \nboth energy R at the Department of Energy, and find additional funds \nfrom outside the Department, then we don't have a truly comprehensive \nand balanced energy strategy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be yielded an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  A final question I believe we all need to ask is whether the \nproposals address the pressing energy crises that are brewing for this \nsummer and are going to be on the front page of every newspaper.\n  California and western electricity issues: Problems in the West and \nprojected troubles in other parts of the country--one example, of \ncourse, is New York City itself; where shortages are forecast for the \nsummer, meaning that pressure to do something about electricity is \nmounting. As the market imperfections in California become more and \nmore apparent, a pro-active role for the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission is increasingly indicated. I do believe we need to have \naction from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the very near \nfuture. We should have acted before now to deal with those very real \ncrisis situations around the country. To date, the response of FERC has \nbeen a disappointment. More effort has seemed to be expended on blaming \nCalifornia elected officials for their problems than on effectively \npolicing the market. The Federal Government must play a key role\n\n[[Page S4237]]\n\nin promoting reliable electricity supplies through FERC and by ensuring \nwholesale markets are transparent and functioning efficiently.\n  A second immediate issue that needs attention is the LIHEAP program, \nthe Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. High energy prices this \npast winter have left many working families unable to pay their heating \nbills and are having their utility service cutoff. The Senate has acted \nto increase the authorization for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram but the President's support and action is needed if we are \ngoing to put additional funds in this program. I hope it will be \naddressed by the Vice President's task force. Summer cooling bills will \nbe arriving soon and the states have no funds left to help with those \ncosts either.\n  Fuel specifications is another issue. The President could act \nimmediately to help sort out the welter of gasoline specifications \naround the country that has balkanized the fuel market and rendered \nregions highly vulnerable to shortages of gasoline if a piece of the \nlocal energy infrastructure goes down. We saw gasoline price spikes in \nthe Midwest and West Coast last summer because of this problem, and we \nwill likely have similar problems again this summer.\n  If the Vice President's answer on these specific, pressing needs is \nthat nothing much can be done about these problems this year, and that \nfolks who are unfortunate enough to live in California, or folks who \nlive in a region that is experiencing a gasoline price spike due to \nlack of availability of the right blend of gasoline, or working class \nfamilies who cannot pay the high electricity bills for air \nconditioning, will just have to do without while we are working on some \nlong-term energy fix, then we don't have a truly comprehensive and \nbalanced energy strategy.\n  In conclusion, there has been a lot of interaction within the \nadministration, perhaps, on this issue, but there has not been \ninteraction between the administration and the Congress, at least that \nI am aware of, on what the Vice President is getting ready to \nrecommend. By contrast, the Senate is now engaged in discussing an \neducation bill where we did have very intense bipartisan discussions \nwith the administration and among ourselves. Energy, in my view, is \nimportant in this country, just as education is important. There are \nreal opportunities for bipartisan progress on the issue of energy as \nwell as in the area of education.\n  I hope the administration sees this and puts away some of the hot \nbutton issues that are not likely to command support in the Senate, \nsuch as the opening of ANWR. They should put those away in favor of \nproposals that will command broad bipartisan support.\n  In the end, that may be the strongest indication of whether the \nadministration wants to pursue a consensus bipartisan energy policy \nwhich will serve the interests of the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4237-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMEMORATION OF TAX FREEDOM DAY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to apprise the Senate of a \nvery distressing development. Today marks Tax Freedom Day, the day when \nAmericans will finally have earned enough money to pay off their tax \nbills for the year.\n  This year's Tax Freedom Day marks the longest period Americans have \never had to work to pay their taxes. It is astounding that every hour \nworked since the beginning of this year will go solely to pay America's \ntax bills.\n  The average American is shouldering a heavier tax burden than ever \nbefore. This year, Americans will work longer to pay for Government \nthan they will to pay for food, clothing and shelter combined.\n  Congress has got to put a stop to this. I am pleased to report that \nSenator Baucus and I, and the other members of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, are right now working on a tax cut bill that will provide a \nreal reduction in income taxes. With $1.35 trillion, we can now produce \nincome tax cuts large enough that working Americans will actually see a \ndifference in their paychecks.\n  So what has caused the lengthiest Tax Freedom Day in our Nation's \nhistory? It was the Federal individual income tax increases enacted in \n1993. And here is the proof.\n  The Tax Foundation is the nonpartisan, nonprofit policy group that \ncalculated today's Tax Freedom Day. The Tax Foundation's analysis shows \nthat the Federal tax burden grew by 14 days' pay between 1992 and 2001. \nThat means that because of the 1993 tax increases, Americans now have \nto work an additional 2 weeks just to meet their Federal tax burden. \nThat is equal to some Americans' vacation pay.\n  In stark contrast, the Tax Foundation says State and local tax \nburdens remained virtually unchanged during this period. So the culprit \nin creating the longest Tax Freedom Day in history is the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The biggest source of Federal revenue is the individual income tax. \nOver the past decade Federal tax collection levels for payroll taxes, \ncorporate taxes, and all other taxes have been relatively stable. \nCollections of individual income taxes, however, have soared.\n  In 1992, tax collections from individual income taxes were 7.7 \npercent of our gross domestic product. That percentage has risen \nsteadily each year, and as of the year 2000, it was an astounding 10.2 \npercent of GDP. Individual income taxes now take up the largest share \nof GDP in history. Even during World War II, collections from \nindividuals were 9.4 percent of GDP, nearly a full percentage point \nbelow the current level.\n  The source of the current and projected tax surpluses is from the \nhuge runups in individual tax collections. And that has given us the \nlengthiest Tax Freedom Day in our Nation's history.\n  Yesterday, the members of the Finance Committee met informally to \ndiscuss what everyone thinks should be in the tax cut package. I think \nthere was a nearly unanimous agreement that individual income tax rates \nare simply too high.\n  Senator Baucus and I are working hard to put together a bipartisan \ntax cut package. I ask Members of the Senate and the American public to \nsupport our efforts. Our quest for real tax rate reduction is sincere \nand urgent. With an uncertain economy and excessive Federal tax \ncollections, America needs action and it needs it now. American \ntaxpayers expect us to deliver tax relief and we must not fail them.\n  As I stand here today, I pledge to you that as chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, I will do everything in my power to ensure that next \nyear's Tax Freedom Day will not mark the longest period Americans have \nto work to pay their taxes. And I am confident that my Democratic \ncolleagues will join us in supporting this goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4237-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SCHOOL VIOLENCE PREVENTION HOT LINE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Michigan State Police recently \nintroduced a 24-hour school violence prevention hot line to allow \nstudents, parents, teachers and others, to report school violence or \nsuspicious criminal conduct to the State Police. The hot line, 800-815 \nTIPS, offers young people and others in Michigan a way to reach out to \nlaw enforcement anonymously, if desired, and in a non-confrontational \nenvironment.\n  In the past month, students and citizens from across the state have \ngiven the State Police approximately 60 tips, including tips about \nbullying, harassment, sexual assault, as well as tips about knives and \nguns in school. The State Police then passed these tips on to the \nappropriate local law enforcement agency for investigation. Michigan is \nthe thirteenth state to implement such a hotline and we hope it will \nhelp keep our schools safer for students and teachers.\n  We also hope that other preventative measures will be taken to keep \nour schools safer, such as legislative initiatives to keep firearms out \nof the hands of juveniles and prohibited persons. Together, we can work \ntoward preventing the disturbing number of violent acts in school that \nwe have seen far too much of in the last few years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4237-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4237-S4238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    U.S.-JORDAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in the Senate to offer a way \nout of the stalemate we have on trade policy.\n\n[[Page S4238]]\n\n  The trade agenda facing our nation is a long and important one: \nApproval of the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement and the U.S.-Vietnam \nBilateral Trade Agreement; renewal of the Generalized System of \nPreferences and the Andean Trade Preferences Act; a fully revised and \nimproved Trade Adjustment Assistance program; completion of \nnegotiations on bilateral free trade agreements with Chile and \nSingapore; active negotiations on the Free Trade Area of the Americas.\n  But, despite a strong feeling in the Congress that we need to \ncontinue the aggressive pursuit of trade liberalization and market \nopening around the world, we have made no progress at all this year. \nThere are several hold-ups.\n  First, we need to determine how to deal with the issues of trade-\nrelated environmental standards and internationally recognized core \nlabor principles in trade agreements. Second, we need to reach \nagreement on America's trade priorities and our trade negotiating \nobjectives. And, third, we have to determine how we will deal with the \nnumerous elements of the trade agenda.\n  The key to breaking loose this logjam and allowing us to start to \nbuild a consensus on trade lies with the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade \nAgreement. This was negotiated during the Clinton Administration, \nalthough it was completed too late to secure Congressional action last \nyear. This agreement has wide support in the Congress, in the \nAdministration, and throughout the country. I am confident that, once \nformally endorsed by the Administration, it will sail through easily. \nYet the delay in approval continues because it has been linked to the \nrest of the trade agenda and the unresolved issues I mentioned a moment \nago.\n  We need to delink Jordan from the rest of our trade agenda. It is a \ngood, solid trade agreement. Jordan is a key partner of the United \nStates in the search for peace in the Middle East. This agreement will \nstrengthen our relationship with Jordan, demonstrate how important we \nconsidered King Hussein, and now consider King Abdullah, in the peace \nprocess, and complete the set of free trade agreements that already \napply to Israel and the Palestinian Authority.\n  Majority Leader Lott summarized this eloquently when he wrote to \nPresident Bush:\n\n       Jordan has been a reliable partner of the United States and \n     has played an important role in America's efforts to achieve \n     a lasting peace in the Middle East. The United States-Jordan \n     Free Trade Agreement is an important and timely symbol of \n     this critical relationship.\n\n  This agreement serves America's vital national interest.\n  The Jordan FTA contains provisions in which both our countries agree \nnot to relax environmental or labor standards in order to enhance \ncompetitiveness. For the first time, these provisions are in the main \nbody of the agreement. Although there has been some controversy about \nthat, I think the issue has been put to rest, especially after King \nAbdullah explained to us during his recent visit about how difficult it \nwould be to open up the text of the agreement.\n  The controversy over the Jordan FTA now centers around one phrase: If \nthere is no resolution at the end of the dispute settlement process, \n``the affected Party shall be entitled to take any appropriate and \ncommensurate measure.'' This includes trade sanctions, and therein lies \nthe problem. Many Democrats welcome this because it puts enforcement of \ntrade-related labor and environmental commitments on a par with other \ntrade commitments. Many Republicans object because they believe trade \nsanctions should not be used in the case of labor or environmental \ndisputes.\n  So, let me make my proposal.\n  The ``appropriate and commensurate'' phrase is flexible enough to \nencompass a variety of measures, including trade sanctions, fines, cuts \nin aid programs, and a variety of other options. Let's move ahead with \nthe Jordan FTA as negotiated. We Democrats will note that the Jordan \nFTA is a breakthrough in how it addresses labor and environment. We \nwill also note that ``appropriate and commensurate measure'' includes \ntrade sanctions, without requiring them. After all, in our trade \nnegotiations throughout the world, sanctions, of any kind, are the very \nlast resort, and we work hard to avoid their imposition. And remember \nthat trade sanctions in the context of the Jordan FTA simply means \nremoving some of the concessions we make in the agreement itself.\n  Across the aisle, Republicans can also correctly note that \n``appropriate and commensurate measure'' does not require trade \nsanctions in the case of a dispute over trade-related labor or \nenvironmental issues. The President will decide what is an \n``appropriate and commensurate measure.''\n  In other words, we will agree to take enforcement measures \nappropriate to the circumstances. This is not the best outcome, but it \nis a way to get past the current paralysis in trade policy. It would \nallow us to move forward on an agreement of strategic importance to the \nUnited States. It would demonstrate flexible and creative thinking on \nboth sides. It would move us to work toward a compromise that can \ngarner broad bipartisan support.\n  And, let's be honest with ourselves. Given the very small volume of \ntrade with Jordan, the very large strategic significance of our \nrelationship with Jordan, and the importance Jordanians place on this \nfree trade agreement, it is highly unlikely that any Administration, \nDemocrat or Republican, present or future, will be forced to impose \ntrade sanctions on Jordan. Disputes are likely to be settled amicably, \nas they have been with Israel which has a similar free trade agreement \nwith the United States.\n  Several weeks ago, I introduced legislation to implement the U.S.-\nJordan Free Trade Agreement. The bill is a simple one. It merely gives \nthe President authority to reduce tariffs with Jordan, outlines rules-\nof-origin requirements, deals with safeguards provisions, and eases \nnon-immigrant visa requirements for Jordanian business people. It does \nnot even mention ``appropriate and commensurate measures.'' U.S. law \nwould not be changed at all by this phrase.\n  Let's pass this bill. Let's create the U.S.-Jordan free trade area. \nAnd let's get on with the business of working together to develop a \nconsensus on how we move forward on a lengthy and important national \ntrade agenda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4238-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  Today, I would like to detail a heinous crime that occurred August \n24, 2000 in Allentown, PA. A 24-year-old fatally shot a 15-year-old \nyouth attending a party in his home after the teen touched him on the \narm and other partygoers suggested the teen was gay. According to the \nAllentown Morning Call, a witness said that the alleged perpetrator, \nMichael Gambler, retrieved a shotgun and shot Kevin Kleppinger in the \nforehead. Friends say that Kleppinger was not gay and had been rubbing \nthe perpetrator's arm because he thought he had accidentally spit on \nit. Other teens in the apartment began teasing the victim that he might \nbe gay before the perpetrator shot him.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4238-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4238-S4239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING POLAND ON THE 210TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE POLISH \n                              CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today marks the 210th anniversary of the \nPolish Third of May Constitution, which was the first democratic \nconstitution in Europe and the second one in world's history after the \nAmerican Constitution was ratified in 1788. On May 3, 1791 the Polish \nParliament followed the example of the United States and adopted its \nown written and modern supreme law of the land.\n  The Constitution signed by the Polish King and the Lithuanian Grand \nDuke was originally known as the Bill\n\n[[Page S4239]]\n\non Government and it extended equal protection of the law to every \nperson, including peasants, as well as establishing separation of \npowers. Although the Constitution formally lasted only for few years \nuntil the Third Partition of Poland, today the legacy of this historic \ndocument is still alive. It tells us about the grand Polish tradition \nof democracy, which was crafted in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth \nin the 18th century, evolved in the Polish Republic after regaining \nindependence in 1917, and was reconfirmed in the early 1990's following \nthe end of the cold war.\n  Poland's has been a success story in its smooth transition to a \nliberal democracy with a free market economy. I was proud to cast my \nvote in the Senate in favor of the enlargement of the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization, NATO, to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic. Poland was admitted to NATO on March 12, 1999, and has become \na close ally and friend of the United States, which is a home to more \nthan 9 million people of Polish descent. Furthermore, Poland is one of \nthe frontrunners seeking membership in the European Union.\n  We must continue our support for Poland's successful integration in \nthe Western structures of security and economic cooperation, which \npromote peace, stability and prosperity across all of Europe. I firmly \nbelieve that both America and Poland share the same goal of continuing \nto enlarge NATO by admitting the Baltic countries into NATO in order to \nenhance the overall tranquility in the region.\n  As a Senator of the State of Illinois, where the Polish community is \nthe second largest in the country, I hope my colleagues in the Senate \nwill join me in congratulating Poland on its remarkable celebration of \nanniversary of their democratic constitution. I also believe that they \nwill join me in providing their support to Poland's continuing endeavor \nto contribute to the security and stability of the entire European \ncontinent.\n  The Third May Constitution two centuries ago signaled to the world \nthat Poland entered the family of emerging Western democratic states. \nOur effort today should be to make sure that Poland's centuries-long \ncommitment to democracy culminates in Poland fulfilling its promise as \na full-fledged member of the Western democratic world and ceasing to be \ndiscounted as part of Europe's ``grey zone.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4239-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4239-S4240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COLUMBIA BASIN SALMON RECOVERY PLAN\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, a priceless national treasure in the \nPacific Northwest is in dire straits. Icons of our region, wild salmon \nand steelhead, teeter on the brink of extinction. These anadromous fish \nare one of the best examples of how nature works her magic and selects \nthe best and the brightest for future generations. This heritage must \nnot end. Our generation has the responsibility to assure that these \nfish live on and enrich our lives in the future.\n  Despite several decades of work and a cost to taxpayers and \nelectricity ratepayers of an estimated $3 billion, Pacific Northwest \nsalmon and steelhead have continued to decline to the point where they \nmay soon become extinct. We must reverse this trend. We must not allow \nextinction to happen and must proceed quickly with an aggressive \nconsensus plan of action that returns them to sustainable and fishable \npopulations. I believe we can do so in a manner that honors the \nprinciples of state water sovereignty, states' rights, and private \nproperty rights.\n  The economy of the Pacific Northwest is mainly vibrant and strong \nwith some important exceptions, particularly in some more rural areas \nthat depend on agriculture and natural resource industries. We must \nkeep our Northwest economy strong and spread its strength throughout \nthe entire region. This economy provides jobs for families and tax \nrevenue to support important work, particularly the education of our \nchildren. Now, we face high energy costs and drought. Therefore, it is \nimperative that we make prudent choices now that will assure our future \nand quality of life in the Pacific Northwest.\n  There are volumes of scientific research and theories on what needs \nto be done to bring these fish back from the brink of extinction. For \nyears, I have studied documents, discussed science with experts and \nadvocates, held hearings to learn about and publicize policy choices, \nand today I am here to lay out a funding proposal to make our efforts \nfor salmon and steelhead recovery far more aggressive, comprehensive, \nand coordinated than they have ever been.\n  The cost of restoring these fish has largely been borne by the \ncitizens of the Northwest through the electricity rates they pay that \nfund the Northwest Power Planning Council's Fish and Wildlife Program. \nBut because this is a national issue and because recovering the species \nis required by the Endangered Species Act, the Federal Government has \nan obligation to shoulder a significant portion of the financial \nresponsibility for doing so.\n  I will not support flow augmentation other than that agreed to by the \nState of Idaho, if any. The extensive political opposition to breaching \nthe four lower Snake dams means that such a recommendation would put \nthe region into economic and political gridlock in such a way that \nwould prohibit further efforts to take achievable steps to save the \nsalmon and steelhead.\n  We now have a window of time, possibly up to 10 years, to exercise \noptions and take steps toward recovering the fish before evaluation of \ndam breaching is then brought back to the table for further \nconsideration. That means we have a brief opportunity to do things \nright. Otherwise, if we continue to spin our wheels or make wrong \ndecisions about how to approach recovery, we will, in 5, 6, or 8 years \nbe once again facing the difficult question of whether the region must \nbreach the dams to save the fish.\n  Even though we have not yet mastered the entire process required to \nrecover these fish, it is very obvious that we do have an enormous \namount of good information and a very long list of measures that we can \ndo, right now. The problem is that we have done only part of what we \ncan do. My proposal will commit the region and the Federal Government \nto take immediate coordinated and aggressive action that is known to \nbenefit the fish while providing an agreed-upon mechanism for \nmonitoring and subsequent adjustments.\n  Specifically, I am recommending:\n  Corps of Engineers, $159.8 million, additional funding for their \nColumbia River Fish Mitigation program. This program primarily funds \nthe construction of fish passage systems and also provides dollars for \nthe Corps to contract with the National Marine Fisheries Service to do \nanadromous fish research and monitoring.\n  An increase for operations and maintenance funding (O), which will \nalso provide the money needed to barge all fish, rather than trucking \nsalmon around the dams. O funding is essential to keeping fish \npassage systems operable and mitigation programs running. Furthermore, \nwe must study the potential benefit to modernizing the region's flood \ncontrol management.\n  Money for restoring estuary habitat in the Lower Columbia River and \nTillamook Bay Estuaries. We have heard from all of the interests that \nwe'll get a big bang for the buck for salmon and steelhead by restoring \nestuary habitat.\n  National Marine Fisheries Service, $243.5 million, additional funding \nfor the operations and maintenance of fish hatcheries. In the past, our \nhatcheries have provided sport fishing opportunity, but have not yet \nbenefitted wild salmon and steelhead recovery. We need to reform our \nhatcheries to produce fish that are not susceptible to disease and \npredation, and support recovery goals.\n  An increase for screening irrigation diversions. If we are to recover \nsalmon and steelhead, we must keep juveniles in the river and out of \nirrigation systems. These diversion screens can cost up to $1 million \napiece, which make them unaffordable to communities, irrigation \ndistricts, and individual farmers.\n  Full funding for the Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. It is critical to \nthe states of Idaho, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California as well \nas the Tribes that the federal government provide funding to help meet \nfederal Endangered Species Act requirements for salmon and steelhead.\n  Bureau of Reclamation, $25.0 million, funding to provide for the \npurchase of\n\n[[Page S4240]]\n\none more year of Idaho State-authorized flow augmentation, which is the \n427,000 acre feet of water that is used to facilitate salmon and \nsteelhead migration, plus $10 million to fund a water bank to store \nwater for the purposes of fish passage and temperature reduction during \nlow flow periods. The Bureau of Reclamation would also receive money to \nimplement offsite mitigation measures called for in the Biological \nOpinion.\n  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, $56.9 million, increases for habitat \nimprovements, habitat conservation planning, landowner assistance, \nSection 7 consultation, and hatchery retrofits.\n  In addition to the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Fish and \nWildlife Service has major responsibilities for screening irrigation \ndiversions. Its screening program provides help to individual \nlandowners in the form of technical assistance and money to pay for \nfish screens over irrigation diversions.\n  There are many agencies with responsibilities for implementing salmon \nand steelhead recovery measures, and, frankly, these are just some of \nthem. I also recommend funds for other agencies such as the Natural \nResource Conservation Service and the Environmental Protection Agency \nto implement their piece of the anadromous fish restoration program.\n  This adds up to a grand total of $688.2 million.\n  I anticipate that regional interests will examine the details of my \nproposal and will offer suggestions to improve this appropriations \npackage. I encourage that discussion and look forward to the input that \nothers will offer. There are processes currently underway in the region \nthat could well result in changes to this proposal.\n  It is my hope and expectation that this funding will change what has \nbeen a decades-long, torturous, and expensive process into a success \nthat will make the Pacific Northwest a role model for how to recover \nendangered species. I look forward to working with colleagues in the \nHouse and Senate to provide funds to support a successful Columbia \nBasin Salmon and Steelhead Recovery Plan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4240-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today, there is much focus on the \nproblems in our schools but, I would like to bring to your attention \nthe students and citizens in the great State of New Jersey who are \ndoing something to make our schools a better place to learn and grow. \nThe Quest Program is an amazing group of 11- and 12-year-olds who are \npositively affecting the student body and facilities at Dr. John Howard \nJr. Unique School of Excellence in East Orange, NJ.\n  Noting the rise of suspensions and other discipline issues in their \nschool, a group of 13 fourth and fifth graders gathered under the \nleadership of their teacher, Ms. Christine McAdams, and created the \nQuest Program. They developed this program to find ways to improve \nstudent behavior. Volunteering more than 400 hours toward the goal of \nbettering the student body, these young people established 14 \nenrichment programs through which students could positively direct \ntheir youthful energy and exuberance. These exceptional students even \nsuccessfully bought property to expand their school playground by \nresearching grant and funding opportunities in their community.\n  The Quest Program placed first in New Jersey in the junior division \nof the Community Problem Solving Component of the International Future \nProblem Solving Program. The Dr. John Howard Community Problem Solving \nTeam will represent New Jersey at the International Competition in \nAthens, Georgia this June.\n  These 13 students are an excellent example of the creativity and \ndedication of which America's young people are capable. Joshua Baily, \nSabre Burroughs, Teri Jones, Orion Khan, Kamiah Mitchell, Shanteea \nMoore, Chetachi Odelugo, Cory Patterson, Rubi Ramirez, Katiria Torres, \nReymond Torres, John Wilson, and Minette Wilson are a credit to their \nfamilies, their school, and the State of New Jersey.\n  As a Senator who believes very strongly in the importance of \neducation, I am exceptionally proud of these prodigious young people \nand their decision to spend their time and energy making their school a \nbetter place to learn. It is my hope that you will join me in wishing \nthem good luck in June and in all of their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4240-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4240-S4241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPORTING FARMER EDUCATION\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Farmland \nIndustries for their leadership in educating farmers on the importance \nof international trade, through the program ``Support Trade, for \nFarmers, For Farmland, For You.'' I also congratulate them for \nreceiving the 2001 National Agri-Marketing Association's award for Best \nof Show.\n  I ask that the letter of congratulations I sent to Farmland \nIndustries be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows.\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2001.\n     Mr. Robert Honse,\n     President & CEO, Farmland Industries, Inc., Kansas City, MO.\n       I recently read that Farmland's trade education program, \n     ``Support Trade, For Farmers, For Farmland, For You'' was \n     selected to receive the 2001 National Agri-Marketing \n     Association's award for Best of Show. Congratulations on this \n     impressive achievement!\n       Farmland Industries clearly understands the important role \n     of international trade to the agriculture industry. As the \n     only working family farmer in the United States Senate and \n     Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, I also \n     appreciate the importance of international trade to America's \n     farmers. International trade has a significant impact on my \n     home state of Iowa, with agriculture exports contributing \n     more than $5 billion a year to Iowa's economy. Nationwide, \n     approximately $6 million in agriculture products, such as \n     grains, oilseed, cotton, meats, and vegetables are processed \n     for export every day. These exports generate more than $100 \n     billion in total business activity, and sustain nearly a \n     million American jobs.\n       Trade is vital to the United States economy generally, and \n     to our farmers in particular, as agriculture makes an \n     enormous and valuable contribution as our third largest \n     export. Increased market opportunities in agricultural trade \n     are of tremendous importance to American farmers and to our \n     economy. That is why I applaud your efforts to inform and \n     mobilize the farming community in support of open markets.\n       The ``Support Trade'' program sponsored by Farmland \n     Industries, and the communications team led by Sherlyn Manson \n     and David Eaheart, addressed a vitally important issue \n     through a program that has informed and enlightened farmers \n     at the grassroots level on the importance of international \n     trade.\n       You are to be highly commended for your leadership. Too few \n     companies appreciate the importance of trade education at the \n     grassroots level. Farmland Industries is truly a leader whose \n     example I hope others will emulate.\n       I look forward to working with you during this session of \n     Congress as we address such important international trade \n     issues as renewing Trade Promotion Authority for President \n     Bush, continuing normal trade relations for the People's \n     Republic of China, passing normal trade relations for \n     Vietnam, and preparing for the launch of a new round of World \n     Trade Organization negotiations this November.\n\n[[Page S4241]]\n\n       Again, congratulations for your selection as the recipient \n     of the 2001 National Agri-Marketing Association's Best of \n     Show.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles E.

Mr. President, for the past 22 years, men's \nbasketball at the College of Charleston has been charmed by the unique \npowers of head coach John Kresse. Last week, the native New Yorker \nearned a berth in Palmetto sports history when he was inducted into the \nSouth Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame. Coach Kresse's remarkable \nstatistics speak for themselves. He has compiled a 539-134 record with \nthe Cougars for an .801 winning percentage that trails only Jerry \nTarkanian and Roy Williams among active coaches. With a December 1999 \nvictory over Tennessee Tech, he also became the second fastest coach in \nNCAA history to record 500 wins. That same year, the College of \nCharleston became the only team in Southern Conference history to post \na 19-0 season. Under his leadership, the Cougars have earned four NCAA \nand two NIT tournament bids and have won 22 or more games in 17 of the \nlast 21 seasons.\n  Coach Kresse arrived in Charleston in 1979 after successful stints as \nassistant coach under Lou Carnesecca at his alma mater, St. John's, and \nthe New York Nets of the American Basketball Association. Over the next \ntwo decades, he groomed Charleston's modest basketball program to \nbecome a nationally-recognized competitor and source of tremendous \nstate pride. ``I'm not a showy guy,'' Kresse told The Post and Courier \nnewspaper about his transformation from city slicker to Southern sports \nhero. ``I'm a basic meat and potatoes guy who fell in love with this \ncity, this State and the hospitality.'' The home arena now bears Coach \nKresse's name, but fans bear his testimony every time they cheer a \nCougar squad to victory. I can't think of anyone who deserves to be a \nHall of Famer more than John Kresse. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4241-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               S.C. TENNIS COACH CELEBRATES 80TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Wilton ``Skinny'' McKinney first \nswung a tennis racket in 1930 while giving his Greer neighborhood's new \nred clay court a try. He and his buddies scrounged up one ball and a \nrule book and, before you know it, Skinny had caught the tennis bug.\n  Skinny served as captain of his Greenville High and University of \nSouth Carolina tennis teams, and then served his country for three \nyears in the Pacific fleet during World War II. Although he went on to \ncapture the South Carolina doubles championship five times, Skinny \nfound his true talent when he began coaching at his high school alma \nmater in 1948. For 25 years, he worked as an accountant by day and \nvolunteer coach in the evening, leading Greenville High to an \nunprecedented 16 State titles. He continues to give weekly lessons in \nGreenville. Many of his former students have won athletic scholarships, \nincluding a handful of All-Americans, and two became world-class \nplayers.\n  Skinny's success has earned him numerous accolades, including the \nOrder of the Palmetto and Rotary International's Paul Harris Fellow \naward, as well as elections to the Southern Tennis Hall of Fame and the \nSouth Carolina Tennis Hall of Fame. For many years, he was also chair \numpire at the Family Circle Cup tennis tournament on Hilton Head. The \ncenter tennis court at the Greenville Country Club, where he is a \nformer director of tennis programs, bears his name, as does an annual \naward presented by The South Carolina Tennis Association. Yet most of \nhis students would argue his greatest asset is an inspired coaching \nstyle that tempers hard work with a caring attitude. Last week, friends \nand students paid tribute to the 60-year coaching veteran with a \nsurprise 80th birthday party.\n  ``Skinny'' McKinney is a credit to the sport of tennis, to South \nCarolina and the nation. Peatsy and I wish him a happy belated birthday \nand best wishes out on the court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4241-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN HOME ON THE OCCASION OF THEIR 75TH \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ncontributions of the Southern Christian Home of Morrilton, Arkansas, to \ncountless citizens and families of Arkansas. On Saturday, May 5, 2001, \nthe Southern Christian Home celebrates its 75th Anniversary.\n  Established in 1926 in Fort Smith, AR, the Southern Christian Home, \nSCH, relocated to Morrilton, AR, in 1936. Their mission during the past \n75 years has been to glorify God by providing services that meet the \nphysical, moral, mental, social, and spiritual needs of children based \non Biblical truths and principles. The SCH provides care to children \nages 6 to 17 years old. Since the SCH's inception there have been an \nestimated 5,000 to 6,000 children who have received care through the \nSCH's service offerings.\n  The Southern Christian Home's commitment to children is far reaching. \nWhile the SCH's primary focus has been Arkansas children, it has also \nprovided services to children from Albania, China, and Brazil. \nAdditionally, the SCH operates a children's home in Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n  As I have said on many occasions in the Senate, there is no greater \nnational resource than our children. We, as a society, must continually \nreaffirm our commitment to ensure that all children live healthy, \nenriching, and promising lives. The work of the Southern Christian Home \nis a shining example of this ideal.\n  On behalf of Arkansans and the Senate, I take this opportunity to \nwish Southern Christian Home a happy 75th Anniversary. I hope for them \nevery success for the coming 75 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4241-4", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE WOMEN WEEK\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN.

For that reason, the \nNational Association of Insurance Women and its 400 local affiliates \nare dedicated to the development of leaders for the insurance industry.\n  NAIW and its affiliates promote personal and professional development \nthrough education, networking and leadership opportunities to all women \nin the insurance business. Both national and local organizations \ncontinually strive to raise the standards of ethics, consumer education \nand customer service throughout the insurance industry.\n  NAIW local affiliates are engaged in charitable causes to strengthen \nand enhance hundreds of communities throughout the U.S., Canada, Puerto \nRico and the Virgin Islands. Professional insurance women have earned \nrecognition for their many accomplishments in the economically vital \ninsurance industry.\n  It is important that we celebrate and honor the women who are \nperforming such important and diverse roles throughout the risk and \ninsurance industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4241-5", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4241-S4242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING DETROIT POLICE OFFICERS\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President I rise today to recognize the \nSpirit Mound Trust and the State of South Dakota in their efforts to \npreserve and maintain the historic Spirit Mound site located near \nVermillion, SD. Recently, 320 acres of the Spirit Mound site were \nacquired through the collaborative efforts and active involvement of \nthe local community, the State of South Dakota and the Federal \nGovernment.\n  On August 24, 1804, Lewis and Clark stopped near present day \nVermillion, SD, and walked nearly 9 miles in temperatures over 100 \ndegrees to a hill that native people thought was inhabited by devils \n18-24 inches high. When Lewis and Clark reached the top of the mound, \nthey saw the great northern plains buffalo herds below them, the \nbeautiful Missouri River valley and even present day Iowa and Nebraska.\n  As the Lewis and Clark bicentennial approaches, it is estimated that \nbetween 15-30 million enthusiasts will retrace the expedition's \nfootsteps. This provides a unique opportunity for many to visit and \nenjoy South Dakota's beautiful and historic landscape. A restored \nSpirit Mound will significantly contribute to the public's appreciation \nof Native culture, the Lewis and Clark expedition and the natural \nbeauty of South Dakota's prairie. Also, the W.H. Over Museum in \nVermillion, SD, has established a Lewis and Clark/Spirit Mound Learning \nand Information Center. This center will help educate visitors about \nthe historical role Spirit Mound played in the Lewis and Clark \nexpedition.\n  The Spirit Mound Trust, a group that has long advocated the \npreservation of the Spirit Mound site, was established in 1986 with the \ngoal of raising the necessary money to purchase and restore the area to \nits native prairie landscape. The acquisition and restoration of Spirit \nMound would not have become a reality if it were not for the leadership \nand perseverance of this local group. In the group's 15 year history, \n17 board members--past and present--are responsible for Spirit Mound's \ncurrent preservation. Those members are: Larry Monfore, Dr. Loren \nCarlson, Mark Wetmore, Margaret Cash, Dr. William Farber, Dr. Thomas \nGasque, Amond Hanson, Dr. Jim Heisinger, Dr. Jim Peterson, Charles \nWetmore, James Antonen, Dr. Betty Asher, Dr. Leonard Brugier, Dr. Jerry \nJohnson, Jim Kruger, Dr. Fred Peabody, and Dr. Webster Sill.\n  Governor William J. Janklow and his staff also played an important \nrole in the acquisition of the Spirit Mound site. Governor Janklow has \nbeen steadfast in his support for state participation in the Spirit \nMound project. Tim Bjork, who is the director of the South Dakota Parks \nand Wildlife Foundation, negotiated the purchase price of the land. \nWithout his leadership and tenacity, the acquisition of Spirit Mound \nwould have never been accomplished.\n  I would also be remiss if I did not thank my former staff member and \nVermillion native, Sarah Dahlin. Because of her tireless work and \ndedication to this project, we are now able to celebrate the eventual \npreservation of one of the very few physical features of the Upper \nMissouri River readily identifiable as a place where Lewis and Clark \nactually stood. With Sarah's assistance, I am pleased that we were able \nto secure sufficient federal funds to purchase the Spirit Mound acreage \nand to pass legislation authorizing this unique federal-state \npartnership.\n  Future generations will thank all of those who have sacrificed time, \neffort and money for this project. The preservation of Spirit Mound \nwill enable all Americans to better appreciate what the Lewis and Clark \nCorps of Discovery experienced nearly 200 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4242-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TONY AND MARGARET RADOSEVICH\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate and commend \none of my constituents, Andy Robinson of Narragansett, RI. At the end \nof last year, Andy Robinson retired from teaching after thirty years in \nthe classroom. This Sunday his family, friends and innumerable former \nstudents will celebrate Andy's career and the impact he has had on the \nlives of so many Rhode Islanders. Andy Robinson is a model public \nservant and I would like to take a few minutes to express my \nappreciation for his commitment to our community.\n  Born and raised in East Providence, Andy graduated from my alma \nmater, LaSalle Academy. After receiving his bachelors degree from \nProvidence College, Andy became a student teacher at Narragansett \nJunior High School. He then took a position for three years as a social \nstudies teacher at Burrillville Junior-Senior High School while \ncompleting his masters degree at Providence College.\n  In 1975 Andy accepted a job as a social studies teacher at \nNarragansett High School, and I doubt he imagined at the time that he \nwould dedicate the next 25 years to forming the minds of the students \nattending that school. Andy worked hard to improve and broaden the \nsocial studies program at Narragansett High School. He introduced \nProject Close-Up, Rhode Island Project Insight, the Rhode Island Model \nLegislature Program, the Mock Trial Program, the Junior Achievement \nApplied Economics Program and the Center for Civic Education ``We the \nPeople'' Program and Constitution Competition. He also obtained a \nfederal grant to bring the Youth and the Law Program to the School. \nAndy served as the Social Studies Department Chair, a member of the \nschool Steering Committee, a member of the School Based Improvement \nTeam, and a member of the Review Committee for National Standards in \nSocial Studies. For his endless energy and unflagging commitment to \neducation, Andy has received the ``Ocean State Center for Law And \nCitizenship Education Outstanding Law Educator'' and is named in Who's \nWho in American Education.\n  Moreover, Andy's public service did not end in the classroom. From \n1968 to 1989, Andy served in the Rhode Island National Guard. He has \nheld positions in the Narragansett Lions Club, the Narragansett \nDemocratic Town Committee and the Eastward Look Property Owner \nAssociation. He continues to serve as a member of the Narragansett \nChamber of Commerce, the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick of South Country, \nthe Board of Incorporators South County Hospital, the Prout School \nBoard and the Prout School Academic Affairs Committee.\n  Andy shares his commitment to the community with his wife Jane, who \nis a teacher at the Narragansett Elementary School. Together they \nraised two daughters, Catherine, who will soon begin serving the U.S. \nArmy as a JAG, and Elizabeth who is carrying on the family tradition as \na teacher of special education in Virginia.\n\n[[Page S4243]]\n\n  Recently, Narragansett High School dedicated its yearbook to Andy \nRobinson. Several students wrote tributes to him and they all had \ncommon themes, students looked forward to Mr. Robinson's class, he made \nthe material interesting and easy to learn, and he cared. Andy Robinson \nis an uncommon teacher. I think one student, Melissa Deluca, spoke for \neveryone when she wrote, ``Mr. Robinson, our teacher, our guide, my \nfriend. Thank you.''\n  Andy Robinson is an inspiration not only to his students, but to all \nwho have the pleasure of knowing him. On behalf of the citizens of \nRhode Island, I want to thank Andy for his years of hard work and \nselfless dedication and congratulate him on a well deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4243-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 10.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the Northern Marianas Commonwealth relative to \n     an amendment to the Constitution of the United States \n     concerning Judicial taxation; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                      Senate Resolution No. 12-33\n\n       Whereas, the separation of powers is fundamental to the \n     United States Constitution and the power of the federal \n     government is strictly limited; and\n       Whereas, under the United States Constitution, the states \n     are to determine public policy; and\n       Whereas, it is the duty of the judiciary to interpret law, \n     not to create law; and\n       Whereas, our present federal government has strayed from \n     the interest of our founding fathers and the United States \n     Constitution through inappropriate federal mandates; and\n       Whereas, these mandates by the way of statute, rule or \n     judicial decision have forced state governments to serve as \n     the mere administrative arm of the federal government; and\n       Whereas, the federal district courts with the acquiescence \n     of the United States Supreme Court, continue to order states \n     to levy or increase taxes to comply with federal mandates; \n     and\n       Whereas, these court actions violate the United states \n     Constitution and the legislative process; and\n       Whereas, the time has come for the people of this great \n     nation and their duly elected representatives in state \n     government, to reaffirm, in no uncertain terms that the \n     authority to tax under the Constitution of the United States \n     is retained by the people who, by their consent alone, do \n     delegate such power to tax explicitly to those duly elected \n     representatives in the legislative branch of government whom \n     they chose, such representatives being directly responsible \n     and accountable to those who have elected them; and\n       Whereas, the lawmakers of the Commonwealth of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands have petitioned the United states Congress to \n     propose an amendment to the Constitution of the United States \n     of America; and\n       Whereas, the amendment was previously introduced in \n     Congress; and\n       Whereas, the amendment seeks to prevent federal courts from \n     levying or increasing taxes without representation of the \n     people against the people's wishes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twelfth Northern Marianas \n     Commonwealth Legislature:\n       1. That the Congress of the United states prepare and \n     submit to the several states an amendment to the Constitution \n     of the United States to add a new article providing as \n     follows: ``Neither the Supreme Court nor any inferior court \n     of the United States shall have the power to instruct or \n     order a state or political subdivision thereof, or an \n     official of such state or subdivision to levy or increase \n     taxes.''\n       2.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to Airfare \n     Pricing; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 63\n\n       Whereas, In recent years, mergers among airlines have \n     significantly changed air transportation throughout our \n     country. There are two pending mergers involving major \n     carriers that, if completed, will result in two airlines \n     controlling half of the entire United States airline market; \n     and\n       Whereas, While there have been increasing concerns over the \n     quality of air services, the prospect of even more \n     communities facing a market situation with little or no \n     competition has many observers calling for actions that would \n     ensure that there is fairness in pricing and acceptable \n     standards of performance. Certain communities and regions of \n     the country face the possibility of losing air services \n     entirely or dealing with prices that do not have to respond \n     to competition; and\n       Whereas, Our nation's air transportation network represents \n     an enormous investment and a public-private partnership \n     through the airports, air traffic control systems, and \n     infrastructures that are maintained; and\n       Whereas, There are discussions underway in congress and in \n     the United States Justice Department on the impact of \n     mergers, whether or not airlines are fulfilling previous \n     agreements, and relevant antitrust\n\n[[Page S4245]]\n\n     issues. These discussions need to include serious \n     consideration of airfare pricing, particularly in areas where \n     little or no competition exists: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to investigate \n     airfare pricing, especially in markets where mergers have \n     eroded competition; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-48. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Montana relative to federal weed control \n     programs and the procurement of federal weed control funds; \n     to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, noxious weeds are invasive species that are very \n     difficult to contain or eliminate once they are established; \n     and\n       Whereas, noxious weeds are invading Montana's rangeland, \n     forest land, waterways, cities, towns, private lands, and \n     public lands, including National Parks and monuments; and\n       Whereas, noxious weeds replace native species on lands \n     regardless of land ownership and land ownership boundaries; \n     and\n       Whereas, Montana's citizens and Legislature have made \n     significant contributions and commitments toward reducing the \n     acreage infested by noxious weeds and controlling any new \n     invasions; and\n       Whereas, current working agreements between public land \n     management agencies and country weed districts and other \n     local groups are generally successful in addressing the \n     control or containment of noxious weeds on public lands; and\n       Whereas, noxious weeds are a continuous problem that must \n     be addressed on an annual basis and are never truly \n     eradicated from the ecosystem; and\n       Whereas, public land management agencies should, at a \n     minimum, contribute financially to the control of noxious \n     weeds in Montana: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Montana, That the federal government be strongly \n     urged to:\n       (1) enter into agreements with local groups and agencies to \n     promote the control of noxious weeds in a manner that \n     addresses locally identified priorities;\n       (2) continue to provide funding for local weed control \n     programs on an annual and continuing basis; and\n       (3) provide assistance in helping local groups and agencies \n     access federal weed control programs and procure available \n     federal weed control funds. Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent by the \n     Secretary of State to the President of the United States, the \n     Vice President of the United States, the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, the Secretary of the Interior, the presiding \n     officers of the Appropriations Committees of the U.S. Senate \n     and U.S. House of Representatives, the Montana Congressional \n     Delegation, the Chief of the Forest Service, the Director of \n     the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Director of the bureau of \n     Land Management.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-49. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Montana relative to Montana's Yellowstone and \n     Missouri River Basins; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Montana lost 590,000 acres of land to reservoir \n     flooding under the Pick-Sloan plan, as set out in the federal \n     Flood Control Act of 1944, and was in return promised \n     1,313,930 acres of new irrigation, but only 76,200 acres were \n     ever developed for irrigation under the plan; and\n       Whereas, over 16,500,000 acre-feet of water leave Montana \n     annually in the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers--water that \n     is abundant but underused in this time of need for growth in \n     Montana; and\n       Whereas, Montana's conservation districts have reserved \n     over 853,000 acre-feet of water for new irrigation \n     development, and the state has completed water rights \n     compacts with several tribes that enable tribes to develop \n     many acres of new irrigation as well; and\n       Whereas, Montana's agricultural sector continues to shrink \n     along with the population of rural communities; and\n       Whereas, Montana consumes less than 30% of the hydropower \n     that is generated in the state under the Pick-Sloan plan; and\n       Whereas, Montana's Vision 2005 program identified the goal \n     of doubling the value of irrigated agriculture by the year \n     2005 by developing 500,000 acres of new irrigation, which is \n     less than one-half of the number of acres promised under the \n     Pick-Sloan plan; and\n       Whereas, costs for power may double or triple, and without \n     low-cost power, it will become impossible to irrigate new \n     lands and even existing irrigated lands identified in the \n     original Pick-Sloan plan; and\n       Whereas, agriculture is Montana's largest industry, and any \n     increase in values from irrigation would benefit the entire \n     state and region: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Montana, That the federal government be strongly \n     urged to:\n       (1) assist the efforts of the Lower Yellowstone \n     Conservation District Development Committee in obtaining the \n     promised benefits of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River plan, as \n     set out in the federal Flood Control Act of 1944; and\n       (2) assist the efforts of the Lower Yellowstone \n     Conservation District Development Committee in drafting and \n     passing the proposed federal Montana Water Resources Act, \n     which will outline benefits promised in the Flood Control Act \n     that are needed to sustain existing irrigation and the \n     development of new irrigation throughout Montana's \n     Yellowstone and Missouri River basins. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State send copies of this \n     resolution to the President of the United States, the Vice \n     President of the United States, the Secretary of the United \n     States Department of Agriculture, the Secretary of the \n     Interior, the presiding officers of the Energy and Natural \n     Resources Committees of the United States Senate and House of \n     Representatives, the Montana Congressional Delegation, and \n     the Commissioner of the federal Bureau of Reclamation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4245-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following executive reports of committee were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. McCain for the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n       Michael P.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 to require that group and \nindividual health insurance coverage and group health plans provide \ncoverage for qualified individuals for bone mass measurement (bone \ndensity testing) to prevent fractures associated with osteoporosis; to \nthe Committee of Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Early \nDetection and Prevention of Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases Act \nof 2001 along with my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe.\n  Osteoporosis and other related bone diseases pose a major public \nhealth threat. More than 28 million Americans, 80 percent of whom are \nwomen, suffer from, or are at risk for, osteoporosis. Between three and \nfour million Americans suffer from related bone diseases like Paget's \ndisease or osteogenesis imperfecta. Today, in the United States, 10 \nmillion individuals already have osteoporosis and 18 million more have \nlow bone mass, placing them at increased risk. Osteoporosis is \npreventable through the use of new technology, yet the majority of \nAmericans with the disease remain undiagnosed and untreated.\n  Osteoporosis is often called the ``silent disease'' because bone loss \noccurs without symptoms. Often people do not know they have \nosteoporosis until their bones become so weak that a sudden bump or \nfall causes a fracture or a vertebrae to collapse. Every year, there \nare 1.5 million bone fractures caused by osteoporosis. Half of all \nwomen, and one-eighth of all men, age 50 or older, will suffer a bone \nfracture due to osteoporosis.\n  The consequences of osteoporosis are often unrecognized. In New \nJersey, individuals hospitalized with osteoporosis fractures average \n9.3 days in the hospital for hip fracture and 71 days for vertebral \nfracture. National statistics show that 10 to 20 percent of people with \nhip fracture either die within six months, cannot walk without aid or \nrequire long-term care. Education is needed to encourage individuals \nand their providers to diagnose osteoporosis early and treat the \ndisease swiftly, preventing costly and debilitating fractures.\n  Osteoporosis is a progressive condition that has no known cure; thus, \nprevention and treatment are key. The Early Detection and Prevention of \nOsteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases Act of 2001 seeks to combat \nosteoporosis, and related bone diseases like Paget's disease by \nrequiring private health plans to cover bone mass measurement tests for \nqualified individuals who are at risk for developing osteoporosis.\n  Bone mass measurement is the only reliable method of detecting \nosteoporosis in its early stages. The test is non-invasive and painless \nand is predictive of future fractures as high cholesterol or high blood \npressure is of heart disease or stroke. This legislation is similar to \na provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that requires Medicare \ncoverage of bone mass measurements.\n  Medical experts agree that osteoporosis is preventable. Thus, if the \ntoll of osteoporosis and other related bones diseases are to be \nreduced, the commitment to prevention and treatment must be \nsignificantly increased.\n  The bill is supported by the National Osteoporosis Foundation, \nAmerican Medical Women's Association, American Society for Bone & \nMineral Research, Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation, National \nAssociation of Orthopedic Nurses, American Physical Therapy Association \nand the Health Promotion Institute.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 819\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Early \n     Detection and Prevention of Osteoporosis and Related Bone \n     Diseases Act of 2001''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nature of osteoporosis.--\n       (A) Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone \n     mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue leading to \n     bone fragility and increased susceptibility to fractures of \n     the hip, spine, and wrist.\n       (B) Osteoporosis has no symptoms and typically remains \n     undiagnosed until a fracture occurs.\n       (C) Once a fracture occurs, the condition has usually \n     advanced to the stage where the likelihood is high that \n     another fracture will occur.\n\n[[Page S4248]]\n\n       (D) There is no cure for osteoporosis, but drug therapy has \n     been shown to reduce new hip and spine fractures by 50 \n     percent and other treatments, such as nutrition therapy, have \n     also proven effective.\n       (2) Incidence of osteoporosis and related bone diseases.--\n       (A) 28,000,000 Americans have (or are at risk for) \n     osteoporosis, 80 percent of which are women.\n       (B) Osteoporosis is responsible for 1.5 million bone \n     fractures annually, including more than 300,000 hip \n     fractures, 700,000 vertebral fractures and 200,000 fractures \n     of the wrists.\n       (C) Half of all women, and one-eighth of all men, age 50 or \n     older will have a bone fracture due to osteoporosis.\n       (D) Between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 Americans have Paget's \n     disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, hyperparathyroidism, and \n     other related metabolic bone diseases.\n       (3) Impact of osteoporosis.--The cost of treating \n     osteoporosis is significant:\n       (A) The annual cost of osteoporosis in the United States is \n     $13,800,000,000 and is expected to increase precipitously \n     because the proportion of the population comprised of older \n     persons is expanding and each generation of older persons \n     tends to have a higher incidence of osteoporosis than \n     preceding generations.\n       (B) The average cost in the United States of repairing a \n     hip fracture due to osteoporosis is $32,000.\n       (C) Fractures due to osteoporosis frequently result in \n     disability and institutionalization of individuals.\n       (D) Because osteoporosis is a progressive condition causing \n     fractures primarily in aging individuals, preventing \n     fractures, particularly for post menopausal women before they \n     become eligible for medicare, has a significant potential of \n     reducing osteoporosis-related costs under the medicare \n     program.\n       (4) Use of bone mass measurement.--\n       (A) Bone mass measurement is the only reliable method of \n     detecting osteoporosis at an early stage.\n       (B) Low bone mass is as predictive of future fractures as \n     is high cholesterol or high blood pressure of heart disease \n     or stroke.\n       (C) Bone mass measurement is a non-invasive, painless, and \n     reliable way to diagnose osteoporosis before costly fractures \n     occur.\n       (D) Under section 4106 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \n     Medicare provides coverage, effective July 1, 1999, for bone \n     mass measurement for qualified individuals who are at risk of \n     developing osteoporosis.\n       (5) Research on osteoporosis and related bone diseases.--\n       (A) Technology now exists, and new technology is \n     developing, that will permit the early diagnosis and \n     prevention of osteoporosis and related bone diseases as well \n     as management of these conditions once they develop.\n       (B) Funding for research on osteoporosis and related bone \n     diseases is severely constrained at key research institutes, \n     including the National Institute of Arthritis and \n     Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, the National Institute on \n     Aging, the National Institute of Diabetics and Digestive and \n     Kidney Diseases, the National Institute of Dental Research, \n     and the National Institute of Child Health and Human \n     Development.\n       (C) Further research is needed to improve medical knowledge \n     concerning--\n       (i) cellular mechanisms related to the processes of bone \n     resorption and bone formation, and the effect of different \n     agents on bone remodeling;\n       (ii) risk factors for osteoporosis, including newly \n     discovered risk factors, risk factors related to groups not \n     ordinarily studied (such as men and minorities), risk factors \n     related to genes that help to control skeletal metabolism, \n     and risk factors relating to the relationship of aging \n     processes to the development of osteoporosis;\n       (iii) bone mass measurement technology, including more \n     widespread and cost-effective techniques for making more \n     precise measurements and for interpreting measurements;\n       (iv) calcium (including bioavailability, intake \n     requirements, and the role of calcium in building heavier and \n     denser skeletons), and vitamin D and its role as an essential \n     vitamin in adults;\n       (v) prevention and treatment, including the efficacy of \n     current therapies, alternative drug therapies for prevention \n     and treatment, and the role of exercise; and\n       (vi) rehabilitation.\n       (D) Further educational efforts are needed to increase \n     public and professional knowledge of the causes of, methods \n     for avoiding, and treatment of osteoporosis.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to assess \nopportunities to increase carbon storage on national forests derived \nfrom the public domain and to facilitate voluntary and accurate \nreporting of forest projects that reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide \nconcentrations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Senator Craig and I are introducing \nlegislation that uses a simple, scientifically sound and entirely \nvoluntary approach to combat global warming. It's not revolutionary, \nand it's not regulatory. We believe growing more trees, bigger trees \nand healthier trees is one of the most effective ways to remove \ngreenhouse gases from the atmosphere and help protect the earth's \nclimate. The Forest Resources for the environment and the Economy Act \nof 2001 will expand the nation's forested lands and put our forests on \nthe frontlines in the battle against global warming.\n  Investing in healthy forests today is an investment in the well-being \nof our planet for decades to come. In the Pacific Northwest, forests \nare more than critical environmental resources--they are also a \ncornerstone of our economy. In debates about forest policies, there are \nthose who have advocated an exclusively environmental pathway, and \nothers who have stressed an exclusively economic pathway. This bill is \npart of what I believe is a third pathway through the woods, a path to \nboth stronger rural economies and healthier forests.\n  I introduced this bill with Senator Craig in the 106th Congress. \nThough there have been numerous changes to the bill to address specific \nconcerns, the underlying functions of the bill remain the same: this \nbill will reduce the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and \nhelp protect our global climate for ourselves, our children and our \ngrandchildren. It will provide improved wildlife and fish habitats and \nprotect our waterways. It will enhance our national forests by reducing \nwater pollution within their watersheds. It will provide jobs in the \nforestry sector in areas that have been hard hit by declining timber \nharvests. And it will grow additional timber resources on \nunderproductive private lands.\n  The legislation does all of this through entirely voluntary, \nincentive-based approach. The bill makes new resources available to \nprivate landowners through state-operated revolving loan programs that \nprovide assistance for tree planting and other forest management \nactions. I know that this approach works because of the leadership of \nmy home state, Oregon. The loan\n\n[[Page S4250]]\n\nprogram is modeled after the innovative Forest Resource Trust, which \nwas established in Oregon in 1993, and is just one of the many ways \nOregon continues to lead the nation in state actions to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. I am introducing this bill to make sure that \nwe take advantage of these opportunities across the country and \nencourage more businesses to invest in the nation's forests.\n  The bill is based on recommendations of the National Academy of \nSciences to overcome the capital constraints that prevent non-\nindustrial, private forest land owners from growing healthy forests. \nAlmost 10 million landowners in the United States own 42 percent of the \nnon-industrial, private forest land in parcels of less than 100 acres. \nAccess to the low-interest loans provided by this bill can empower \nthese landowners to improve their lands while providing global \nenvironmental protection.\n\n  In addition to establishing the state revolving loan programs, the \nbill makes important changes to the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to \nstrengthen the voluntary accounting and verification of greenhouse gas \nreductions from forestry activities. The bill directs the Secretary of \nAgriculture to develop new guidelines on accurate and cost-effective \nmethods to account for and report real and credible greenhouse gas \nreductions. These guidelines will be developed with the input of a new \nAdvisory Council representing industry, foresters, states, and \nenvironment groups.\n  As I said above, numerous changes have been made to the bill since \nits introduction in the 106th Congress. By a process of intellectual \ngive and take between various Congressional offices, stakeholder groups \nand environmental organizations, this bill has been improved to offer \ngreater environmental protection opportunities and better science. The \nbill now requires that all funded projects have ``a positive impact on \nwatersheds, fish habitats, and wildlife diversity.'' It promotes \nreforestion activities for species that are native to a region. Also, \nthe bill now allows flexibility in the loan repayment requirements that \nencourage the longer rotation, and permanent protection, of lands \nreforested under this program. In addition, the new Advisory Council \nwill have three independent scientists instead of one and the members \nmust have an expertise in forest management; carbon storage reporting \nwill include monitoring requirements to assure the net increase of \ncarbon storage; and the bill allows for the incorporation of the latest \nscientific and observational information. Overall, this bill is a solid \nstep forward in the long journey towards addressing global climate \nchange.\n  As in the last Congress, this bill will pay for itself by taking the \nmoney that polluters pay when they are caught violating the Clean Air \nAct and Clean Water Act and use it to expand our forests, protect \nstreams and rivers and help remove greenhouse gases from the air. In \nfiscal year 1998, $45 million of these environmental penalties were \nassessed against polluters. There are currently no guarantees that \nthese penalties, which revert to the General Fund, are used to improve \nour environment. This bill would make this money available as loans to \nsmall and medium landowners to cover the upfront costs of tree planting \nand other activities that aid in the growth of healthy, productive \nforests and provide better wildlife habitats.\n  We cannot afford to play Russian roulette with our global climate. \nThe total amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere depends, in \npart, on the efficiency of forests and other natural ``sinks'' that \nabsorb carbon dioxide--the most significant greenhouse gas--from the \natmosphere. The implications are as simple as they are scientifically \nsound--if we grow more trees, bigger trees, and healthier trees, we \nwill remove more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and help protect \nthe global climate. According to the Pacific Forest Trust, our forest \nlands in the United States are only storing one-quarter of the carbon \nthey can ultimately store. Just tapping a portion of this potential by \nexpanding and increasing the productivity of the nation's 737 million \nacres of forests is an important part of a win-win strategy to slow \nglobal warming. This bill takes an important first step toward \nsequestering greenhouse gases on Federal lands: it directs the Forest \nService to report to Congress on options to increase carbon storage in \nour national forests.\n\n  It is hard to believe that nine years ago, during the first Bush \nAdministration, both Democrat and Republican Senators proclaimed their \nsupport for taking action to protect the climate system and reducing \nthe buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. When the 1992 United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change was ratified by the \nSenate, Senators from both parties came to the floor to applaud this \ncommitment to begin reducing greenhouse gas emissions. And then-\nPresident Bush supported that position as well. We cannot afford to let \nthe current debates about international treaties paralyze this Congress \nwhen their are opportunities here at home to protect our environment in \nways that also provide jobs and economic growth.\n  This bill is about taking advantage of a clear win-win opportunity. \nIt's a win for the global environment. It's a win for sustainable \nforestry. It's a win for local water protection. And it's a win for \nrural communities. For these reasons, the bill has already received \npositive reactions from timber companies and environmental \norganizations alike, including the National Association of State \nForesters and the Society of American Foresters, American Forest and \nPaper Association, American Forests, Environmental Defense Fund, \nGovernor John A. Kitzhaber of Oregon, PacificCorp, The Nature \nConservancy, and The Pacific Forest Trust.\n  I look forward to pursuing this common-sense step toward protecting \nthe environment and supporting our forest workers. This bill will have \na sequential referral to both the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee and the Senate Agriculture Committee. These Committees share \njurisdiction over all our nations forests, public and private. They \nrepresent the interests of the people who use our forests from the \nNational Forest visitor, to the large industrial land owner, to the \nsmall woodlot owner. Through the combined efforts of both of these \nCommittees, I am sure that the bill will receive a thorough hearing. I \nlook forward to starting this process with a hearing in early May in \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the section-by-\nsection analysis of the Forest Resources for the Environment and the \nEconomy Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 820\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Forest Resources for the \n     Environment and the Economy Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

The bill \n     achieves these purposes through three major actions: (1) \n     Guidelines for Accurate Carbon Accounting for Forests.--The \n     bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture, through the Forest \n     Service, to establish scientifically-based guidelines for \n     accurate reporting, monitoring, and verification of carbon \n     storage from forest management actions. The bill establishes \n     a multi-stakeholder Carbon and Forestry Advisory Council to \n     assist USDA in developing the guidelines.\n       (2) Report on Options to Increase Carbon Storage on Federal \n     Lands--The bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture, through \n     the Forest Service, to report to Congress on forestry options \n     to increase carbon storage in the National Forest System.\n       (3) State Revolving Loan Programs/Cooperative Agreements--\n     The bill provides assistance to plant and manage \n     underproducing or understocked forests to increase carbon \n     sequestration. Assistance is provided through Cooperative \n     Agreements with State or local governments, American Indian \n     Tribes, Alaska natives, native Hawaiians, and private-\n     nonprofit entities; or through loans to nonindustrial private \n     forest landowners. The Federal share of funding for \n     Cooperative Agreements and the loan program will come from \n     penalties that are being assessed against violators of the \n     Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act (civil penalties \n     assessed in FY 1998 totaled $45 million).\n\n\n                         section 1. short title\n\n       The title of the bill is the ``Forest Resources for the \n     Environment and the Economy Act''.\n\n\n                    SECTION 2.

It directs the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to review the existing Federal guidelines on \n     reporting, monitoring, and verification of carbon storage \n     from forest management actions and to make recommendations to \n     the Secretary of Energy for amendment of the guidelines.\n       Carbon and Forestry Advisory Council: This subsection also \n     directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a 16-\n     member, multi-stakeholder Carbon and Forestry Advisory \n     Council for the purpose of advising the Department of \n     Agriculture on: the development of the guidelines for \n     accurate voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas sequestration \n     from forest management actions, and for other purposes.\n       Criteria: The guidelines developed by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture must take account of additionality and leakage. \n     The guidelines must include recommended practices for \n     monitoring, measurement and verification of carbon storage \n     that are scientifically sound and cost-effective.\n       State Forest Carbon Programs: The guidelines will include \n     guidance to States for reporting, monitoring and verifying \n     carbon storage achieved under the carbon storage program \n     established in Section 5 of the bill.\n       Biomass energy projects: The guidelines will include \n     guidance on calculating net greenhouse gas reductions from \n     biomass energy projects.\n       Amendment of guidelines: The subsection directs the \n     Secretary of Energy to revise the existing voluntary \n     reporting guidelines to include the recommendations provided \n     by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n       Review of guidelines: Guidelines must be reviewed at least \n     every 24 months, and as necessary for consistency with any \n     future Federal laws that credit for reductions of atmospheric \n     greenhouse gas concentrations resulting from forest \n     management actions.\n       Monitoring of Forest Carbon Programs: Participants in the \n     Forest Carbon Program established in Section 5 of the bill \n     must report annually to the Secretary of Agriculture on the \n     results of the program. Reports that are certified to comply \n     with the guidelines in this section will be submitted to the \n     Department of Energy for inclusion in the 1605(b) voluntary \n     reporting data base.\n\n\n    section 5. forest carbon cooperative agreements and loan program\n\n       This section authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     enter into cooperative agreements and directs the Secretary \n     to provide assistance to States to establish revolving loan \n     funds to undertake forestry carbon activities.\n       (a) Forest Carbon Activity Cooperative Agreements. This \n     subsection authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to enter \n     into cooperative agreements with willing State or local \n     governments, American Indian tribes, Alaska natives, native \n     Hawaiians, and private-nonprofit landowners for forest carbon \n     activities.\n       (b) Forest Carbon Activity Revolving Loan Program. This \n     subsection establishes a program to provide assistance \n     through State established revolving loan funds to \n     nonindustrial private forest land owners (NIPF) for eligible \n     forest carbon activities. Requirements include:\n       Eligibility: Funds may be used to support eligible forest \n     carbon activities on not more than 5,000 acres of an NIPF \n     landowners' holdings.\n       Loan terms: Loans must be repaid with interest at a rate \n     not to exceed a 3 percent real rate of return. They must be \n     repaid when the land is harvested, although the owner may pay \n     off the loan prior to harvesting. Loans must include a \n     transferable lien on all timber, forest products and biomass. \n     The State assumes the risk of loss of timber due to natural \n     disaster. A loan agreement must include recognition that, \n     until the loan is paid off, all reductions in atmospheric \n     greenhouse gases achieved by projects funded by the loan are \n     attributable to the entity that provides funding for the \n     loan.\n       Permanent conservation easements: Loan recipients can \n     cancel the loan by donating a permanent conservation \n     easement.\n       Reinvestment of funds: All repayments collected by a State \n     must be reinvested in the program and used by the State to \n     make additional loans.\n       Records: The State Forester shall maintain all loan records \n     and make them available to the public.\n       Matching funds: A State must match Federal funding by at \n     least 25% beginning in the second year of participating in \n     the program.\n       Loan Funding Distribution: The Secretary will report to \n     Congress on a formula under which Federal funds will be \n     distributed among eligible States. The distribution formula \n     will give priority to States that have experienced or are \n     expected to experience significant declines in employment \n     levels in the forestry industries due to declining timber \n     harvests on Federal land.\n       Private funding: A revolving loan fund may accept any funds \n     provided by nongovernmental organizations, businesses or \n     persons for the purpose of this Act.\n       Bonneville Power Administration (BPA): States served by BPA \n     (Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana) may apply for funding \n     from BPA for purposes of funding loans that meet both the \n     objectives of this Act and the fish and wildlife objectives \n     of BPA under current law.\n       (c) Requirements: This subsection specifies requirements of \n     any financial assistance arrangement for forest carbon \n     activities.\n       Eligibility: This gives a general definition of eligible \n     forestry carbon activities.\n       Guidance: The Forest Service, in collaboration with the \n     States, will provide guidance on eligible forestry carbon \n     activities.\n       Activities require under law: Funding shall not be provided \n     for activities required under existing laws.\n       Pre-agreements: Funding shall not be provided for costs \n     already incurred.\n       Limitation on land considered for funding: No funding shall \n     be provided for reforestation of land that has been \n     harvested, if the landowner received revenues from the \n     harvest sufficient to reforest the land.\n       Eligible tree species: Planted tress must be native or non-\n     invasive species.\n       Forest management plan: Priority shall be given to projects \n     on land under a forest management plan or forest stewardship \n     plan.\n       Use of funds: Funds shall be used for planting of trees and \n     their management.\n       Financial assistance amount: Cooperative agreements or \n     loans may cover up to 100 percent of total project costs, not \n     to exceed $100,000 during any 2-year period.\n       Authorization of appropriations: Authorizes funding from FY \n     2001 to FY 2010 at amounts equal to civil penalties collected \n     under the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, which \n     currently revert to the Treasury as General Revenues. In \n     fiscal year 1998, $45 million in penalties were assessed.\n       Allocation of funds: The Secretary shall allocate 15 \n     percent of available funds for cooperative agreements and the \n     remaining 85 percent for the State revolving loan fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Thompson):\n  S. 821. A bill to amend the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 to \nmodify provisions relating to the Board of Directors of the Tennessee \nValley Authority, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``TVA Modernization \nAct of 2001'' along with Senator Thompson. This bill would expand and \nrestructure TVA's Board of Directors to make it reflect the board \nstructure of most large corporations.\n  TVA is now a multi-billion dollar per year corporation. However, it \ncontinues to function under a Depression-era administrative structure. \nBy expanding the board and restructuring it more like a corporation's \nboard, TVA will be in a better position to meet the future challenges \nfacing TVA and the energy industry as a whole.\n  Specifically, this legislation would create a nine-member, part-time \nboard made up of experts in corporate management and strategic decision \nmaking. Each member would be required to be a legal resident of the TVA \nservice area, and each member would receive an annual stipend. The \nboard would appoint a CEO who would be responsible\n\n[[Page S4255]]\n\nfor daily management decisions. Currently, the board is comprised of \nthree full-time members, although one position is currently vacant, and \nthe Chairman acts as the CEO.\n  This legislation provides the organizational structure necessary for \nTVA's future. With proper leadership and sound management practices, \nTVA can continue to improve and more efficiently provide its valuable \nservices.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 821\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe treatment of bonds issues to acquire renewable resources on land \nsubject to conservation easement; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the \n``Community Forestry and Agriculture Conservation Act of 2001.''\n  Communities across the United States are losing private forest and \nfarmland to development. Many citizens are demanding that we protect \ngreen space, control sprawl, and protect natural resources, fish and \nwildlife.\n  Unfortunately, there are few options available to local communities \nto protect these working green spaces. Federal, state or local \ngovernments can purchase the land outright. But this is expensive, and \nsimply unworkable for larger tracts of forest and agricultural land. \nOutright purchase also raises concerns about harming local economies, \nreducing the tax base, and hurting private property rights.\n  Meanwhile, landowners are often land-rich and cash-poor. My bill \nwould allow landowners to capitalize some or all of their assets.\n  We have a responsibility to find solutions that protect private \nforests and farm land, enhance economic prosperity, and bring \ncommunities together in the process. The Community Forestry and \nAgriculture Conservation Act would accomplish these goals.\n  The bill modifies the tax code to make it easier for communities to \nissue tax-exempt revenue bonds on behalf of a private non-profit \ncorporation to purchase tracts of land. This protects the land from \ndevelopment, while allowing jobs that depend on harvesting the land to \ncontinue. The bonds would be serviced by harvesting the resources on \nthe land in a responsible, sustainable way.\n  I want to give an example of the concept behind this bill, and then \nmention some of the benefits.\n  A group of community leaders would form a non-profit organization \nwith a diverse board of directors. The non-profit organization would \nwork with a landowner to reach a voluntary sale agreement at fair \nmarket value. The non-profit organization would then develop a binding \nmanagement plan, which would allow for continued harvesting, but in a \nmanner that exceeds federal and state conservation standards.\n  A local government could then issue tax-exempt revenue bonds on \nbehalf of the non-profit organization to fund the acquisition of the \nland. The bonds would be serviced by the non-profit organization with \nrevenue raised by the continued harvest of trees or crops in accordance \nwith the management plan. The non-profit would hold title to the land, \nbut an independent third party would monitor the permanent conservation \neasement.\n  There are three benefits to this bill.\n  First, it gives communities a new tool to protect green spaces from \ndevelopment. Second, communities are able to keep resource-based jobs \nand their tax base. Third, this legislation will bring communities \ntogether. It will move us away from the conflicts of the past and will \nencourage environmentalists, timber companies, farmers, and local \ngovernments to work together to maintain these green spaces.\n  This legislation is supported by a number of conservation \norganizations, private companies, local governments, and private \nassociations, including: World Wildlife Fund; The Nature Conservancy; \nTrust for Public Land; Land Trust Alliance; Pacific Forest Trust; \nAmerican Sportfishing Association; Plum Creek Timber Company; Collins \nPine Companies; Mendocino Redwood Company; The Harwood Group; Port \nBlakely Tree Farms; Weyerhaeuser; The Campbell Group; King County, \nWashington; Mendocino County, California; Society of American \nForesters; and the Political Economy Research Center.\n  In addition, the Senate agreed to a modified version of this \nlegislation as an amendment to the Senate version of H.R. 2488 in 1999. \nThe amendment was removed during conference.\n  As I did two years ago, I want to emphasize that this is an approach \nthat every Senator can support. It is bipartisan. It is inexpensive. It \nis voluntary. It respects private property rights. It limits government \ninvolvement but establishes proper enforcement to prevent abuse. It \nprotects the environment. It provides local control.\n  I would like to thank Senators G.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to guarantee \ncomprehensive health care coverage for all children born after 2001; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure and pride \nto introduce today the MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2001. I am \njoined by my colleague Representative Stark, who is introducing \ncompanion legislation in the House.\n  In 1997, we passed historic legislation which created the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. I was a proud sponsor of the CHIP legislation \nwith our late-colleague Senator John Chafee. However, one thing which \nwe have learned throughout the implementation process of CHIP is that \nwhile it provides a vehicle for insuring our nation's low-income \nchildren, it does not guarantee all of America's children health \ninsurance coverage and access to affordable health care. I'm pleased to \nsay that of the 26,000 West Virginia children without health insurance \ntwo years ago, according to the most recent state estimate nearly \n20,000 have now enrolled in the CHIP program. But this is not enough. \nWe can do better for our children to make sure they can count on access \nto the care they need to grow up healthy. It should not be so hard. \nToday, there remain more than 10 million children in America without \nhealth insurance, in spite of more and more children being enrolled in \nCHIP every day. Clearly, there is still much more that can and should \nbe done to guarantee health coverage to all American children.\n  Today, I offer a solution to ensure that all of our nation's children \nhave access to health care. The MediKids program, which I propose, \nwould create a new Medicare-like program for children which is separate \nfrom Medicare and will have no financial impact on the existing \nprogram. Every child would be enrolled at birth, just as every American \nis enrolled in the Medicare program at age 65. This ensures that all \nchildren will have coverage, avoiding difficult problems related to \noutreach and enrollment, or state-to-state variations. MediKids is a \nsimple, direct and comprehensive approach to dramatically improve the \nhealth insurance safety net for America's Children. Eligibility for the \nprogram would be phased in over five years, covering children from \nbirth to 5 years of age in the first year, 6 to 10 in the second, 11 to \n15 in the third, 16 to 20 in the fourth, and 21 and 22 in the fifth and \nfinal year. By 2008, the legislation would provide every child in \nAmerica access to consistent, continuous health insurance coverage.\n  The benefits covered by the program would be very similar to those \navailable to children under Medicaid now, including the screening and \nprevention services so critical to successful childhood development. \nThe MediKids program would work in conjunction with CHIP and Medicaid, \nallowing children enrolled in those programs, and those children with \nprivate insurance coverage, to remain in those programs.\n  CHIP and Medicaid are important programs, and essential for the \ninsurance coverage of children. However, even with perfect enrollment \nin CHIP and Medicaid, there would still be a great number of children \nwithout health insurance. This is partially due to our increasingly \nmobile society, where parents frequently change jobs and families often \nmove from state to state. When this occurs there is often a lapse in \nhealth coverage. Also, families working their way out of welfare \nfluctuate between eligibility and ineligibility for means-tested \nassistance programs. Another reason for the number of uninsured \nchildren is that the cost of health insurance continues to increase, \nleaving many working parents unable to afford coverage for themselves \nor their families. All of this adds up to the fact that many of our \nchildren do not have the consistent and regular access to health care \nwhich they need to grow up healthy.\n\n  Under The MediKids program, all children would be enrolled \nautomatically at birth, and have continuous, reliable health coverage \nfrom birth until their twenty-third birthday. A prescription drug \nbenefit would be included as part of the program, and the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services will continue to develop age-appropriate \nbenefits as needed. The legislation also contains provisions allowing \nthe Secretary to review and update the benefits offered annually, with \ninput from the pediatric community.\n  During the first few years of the program, the costs can be fully \ncovered by public funds such as tobacco settlement monies, the budget \nsurplus, or other funds upon which we may agree. Over this period of \ntime, the Treasury Secretary will have the necessary time to develop a \npackage of progressive, gradual tax changes to fund the program. \nParents will be responsible for a small premium which will account for \none-forth of annual average cost per child, and will be exempt from the \npremium should they have comparable health coverage for their children \nthrough private insurance or enrollment in other federal programs.\n  There will be no cost-sharing under the program for preventive and \nwell child care, and there will be assistance for low-income families \nto meet their needs. Those families living at or below 150 percent of \npoverty will pay no premium and those living between 150 percent and \n200 percent of poverty will receive a 50 percent discount on premiums. \nA family's premium obligation will be capped at 5 percent of its total \nincome.\n  Children are inexpensive to insure, yet the benefits of doing so \nwould be enormous for our country. We have an opportunity now to \nguarantee that future generations of children grow up more healthy and \nready to succeed than any before them. I am pleased to announce that I \nam joined today by a number of organizations whose support has been \ncritical to the cause of ensuring health coverage for all children. I \nthank the many national organizations that have already lent their \nsupport and endorsement to this important legislation. The American \nAcademy Pediatrics and the Children's Defense Fund have already begun \nto actively push for the MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2001. I am so \npleased to have the support of these and other organizations which have \ndedicated themselves to children and children's health care in America.\n  I learned a valuable lesson some thirty-five years ago as a VISTA \nvolunteer in the small town of Emmons, West Virginia. I was taught that \nhealth care is not just something to be talked about, or debated here \non the floor of the Senate. Health care is a fundamental right, its as \nnecessary as food and shelter. I have learned this time and time again, \nand I have carried that lesson with me throughout my entire life in \npublic service, as Chairman of the Pepper Commission on Comprehensive \nHealth Care, and also on the National Commission on Children.\n  The growing number of uninsured in this country is a very serious \nproblem. The fact that some 10 million children, our nation's most \nvulnerable population, do not have access to affordable health \ninsurance today is not just unfair, it is downright immoral. In a \nnation as wealthy as ours, it is wrong that poverty at birth can mean \nlife-long illness or even early death, especially from easily treatable \nand preventable causes. What's more, children are the cheapest \npopulation in America to insure.\n  But as I have said time and time again, I also believe it is \nimportant to not lose sight of the ideal, and our capacity to reach \nthat ideal, of the United States of America joining every\n\n[[Page S4258]]\n\nother industrialized nation by ensuring that its citizens have basic \nhealth insurance.\n  I believe that we must not lose sight of that great ideal which I \nhave spoken about here today, that every American have access to \naffordable health care. The MediKids Health Insurance Act is a tangible \nstep toward achieving that ideal. I offer this legislation to enlist my \ncolleagues in an effort to insist that all of our nation's children are \ninsured as quickly as possible. I ask my colleagues from both sides of \nthe aisle to join as co-sponsors.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 827\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Report on long-term revenues.\n\n       (c) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) More than 11 million American children are uninsured.\n       (2) Children who are uninsured receive less medical care \n     and less preventive care and have a poorer level of health, \n     which result in lifetime costs to themselves and to the \n     entire American economy.\n       (3) Although SCHIP and Medicaid are successfully extending \n     a health coverage safety net to a growing portion of the \n     vulnerable low-income population of uninsured children, we \n     now see that they alone cannot achieve 100 percent health \n     insurance coverage for our nation's children due to \n     inevitable gaps during outreach and enrollment, fluctuations \n     in eligibility, and variations in access to private insurance \n     at all income levels.\n       (4) As all segments of our society continue to become more \n     and more transient, with many changes in employment over the \n     working lifetime of parents, the need for a reliable safety \n     net of health insurance which follows children across State \n     lines, already a major problem for the children of migrant \n     and seasonal farmworkers, will become a major concern for all \n     families in the United States.\n       (5) The Medicare program has successfully evolved over the \n     years to provide a stable, universal source of health \n     insurance for the nation's disabled and those over age 65, \n     and therefore provides a tested model for designing a program \n     to reach out to America's children\n       (6) The problem of insuring 100 percent of all American \n     children could be gradually solved by automatically enrolling \n     all children born after December 31, 2002, in a program \n     modeled after Medicare (and to be known as ``MediKids''), and \n     allowing those children to be transferred into other \n     equivalent or better insurance programs, including either \n     private insurance, SCHIP, or Medicaid, if they are eligible \n     to do so, but maintaining the child's default enrollment in \n     MediKids for any times when the child's access to other \n     sources of insurance is lost.\n       (7) A family's freedom of choice to use other insurers to \n     cover children would not be interfered with in any way, and \n     children eligible for SCHIP and Medicaid would continue to be \n     enrolled in those programs, but the underlying safety net of \n     MediKids would always be available to cover any gaps in \n     insurance due to changes in medical condition, employment, \n     income, or marital status, or other changes affecting a \n     child's access to alternate forms of insurance.\n       (8) The MediKids program can be administered without \n     impacting the finances or status of the existing Medicare \n     program.\n       (9) The MediKids benefit package can be tailored to the \n     special needs of children and updated over time.\n       (10) The financing of the program can be administered \n     without difficulty by a yearly payment of affordable premiums \n     through a family's tax filing (or adjustment of a family's \n     earned income tax credit).\n       (11) The cost of the program will gradually rise as the \n     number of children using MediKids as the insurer of last \n     resort increases, and a future Congress always can accelerate \n     or slow down the enrollment process as desired, while the \n     societal costs for emergency room usage, lost productivity \n     and work days, and poor health status for the next generation \n     of Americans will decline.\n       (12) Over time 100 percent of American children will always \n     have basic health insurance, and we can therefore expect a \n     healthier, more equitable, and more productive society.\n\n     SEC. 2. BENEFITS FOR ALL CHILDREN BORN AFTER 2002.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Social Security Act is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new title:\n\n                     ``TITLE XXII--MEDIKIDS PROGRAM\n\n     ``SEC. 2201.

REPORT ON LONG-TERM REVENUES.\n\n       Within one year after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall propose a gradual \n     schedule of progressive tax changes to fund the program under \n     title XXII of the Social Security Act, as the number of \n     enrollees grows in the out-years.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Summary of the MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2001\n\n       The MediKids Health Insurance Act provides health insurance \n     for all children in the United States regardless of family \n     income level by 2008. The program is modeled after Medicare, \n     but the benefits are targeted toward children. Families below \n     150 percent of poverty pay no premium or copays, while those \n     between 150 and 300 percent of poverty pay a graduated \n     premium up to 5 percent of their income and receive a \n     graduated refundable tax credit for cost sharing expenses.\n       The MediKids enrollment process is simple with no re-\n     determination hoops to jump through because it is not means \n     tested. MediKids follows children across state lines when \n     families move, and covers them until their parents can enroll \n     them in a new insurance program. Moreover, MediKids fills the \n     gaps when families climbing out of poverty become ineligible \n     for means-tested programs. It provides security for children \n     until their parents can obtain reliable health insurance \n     coverage.\n\n\n                               enrollment\n\n       Every child born after 2002 is automatically enrolled in \n     MediKids, and those children already born are enrolled over a \n     5-year phase-in as described below. Children who immigrate to \n     this country are enrolled when they receive their immigration \n     cards. Materials describing the program's benefits, along \n     with a MediKids insurance card, are issued to the parent(s) \n     or legal guardian(s) of each child. Once enrolled, children \n     remain enrolled in MediKids until they reach the age of 23.\n       Parents may choose to enroll their children in private \n     plans or government programs such as Medicaid or S-CHIP. \n     During periods of equivalent alternative coverage, the \n     MediKids premium is waived. However, if a lapse in other \n     insurance coverage occurs, MediKids automatically covers the \n     children's health insurance needs (and a premium will be owed \n     for those months).\n\n\n                                phase-in\n\n       Year 1 (2003) = the child has not attained age 6.\n       Year 2 (2004) = the child has not attained age 11.\n       Year 3 (2005) = the child has not attained age 16\n       Year 4 (2006) = the child has not attained age 21.\n       Year 5 (2007) = the child has not attained age 23.\n\n\n                                benefits\n\n       The benefit package is based on the Medicare and the \n     Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening. Diagnosis, and \n     Treatment (EPSDT) benefits for children, and includes \n     prescription drugs. The benefits will be reviewed annually \n     and updated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n     reflect age-appropriate benefits as needed with input from \n     the pediatric community.\n\n\n                   premiums, deductibles, and copays\n\n       Families up to 150 percent of poverty pay no premiums or \n     copays. Families between 150 and 300 percent of poverty pay a \n     graduated premium up to 5 percent of their income and\n\n[[Page S4262]]\n\n     receive a graduated refundable tax credit for cost sharing \n     expenses. Parents 300 percent of poverty are responsible for \n     a small premium equal to one fourth of the average annual \n     cost per child. Premiums are collected at the time of income \n     tax filing. There is no cost sharing for preventive and well \n     childcare for any children.\n\n\n                               financing\n\n       Congress would need to determine initial funding. In future \n     years, the Secretary of Treasury would develop a package of \n     progressive, gradual tax changes to fund the program, as the \n     number of enrollees grows.\n\n\n                                 states\n\n       Medicaid and S-CHIP are not altered by MediKids. These \n     programs remain the safety net for children until MediKids is \n     fully implemented and appropriately modified to best serve \n     our nation's children. Once MediKids is fully operational, \n     Congress can revisit the role of these programs in covering \n     children.\n       To the extent that the states save money from the \n     enrollment of children into MediKids, states are required to \n     maintain those funding levels in other programs and services \n     directed toward the Medicaid population. This can include \n     expanding eligibility or offering additional services. For \n     example, states could expand eligibility for parents and \n     single individuals, increase payment rates to providers, or \n     enhance quality initiatives in nursing homes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Carper, \n        Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Akaka, and \n        Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 828. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax for certain energy-efficient property; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join a bipartisan \ncoalition of Senators in introducing environmentally friendly \nlegislation to encourage the use of fuel cells, a clean and cutting-\nedge energy source. If adopted, this bill would provide tax incentives \nto consumers for purchasing residential and commercial fuel cell \nsystems to power their electricity. The $1,000-per-kilowatt tax credit \napplies to all types of stationary fuel cell systems and would be \napplicable for 5 years. This is a Senate companion piece to legislation \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Nancy \nJohnson last month.\n  With oil and gas prices now reaching record highs, I believe fuel \ncells are one excellent answer to our heightened energy demand and \ndependence on foreign oil. The benefits of fuel cell technology are \nmany. They are a nearly pollution-free power supply because they \noperate without combustion; they can run on any hydrogen-rich source, \nincluding propane, natural gas, methane or diesel; they can operate \nindependently of a power grid, which is ideal for remote locations, and \nthey provide highly reliable, uninterrupted power, making them very \nattractive for applications highly sensitive to power interruptions. \nCurrently they are being used at a variety of locations, including a \nNew York City police station in Central Park, a major postal facility \nin Alaska, a hotel on Mohegan tribal lands in Connecticut, and in a \nhospital in California.\n  Fuel cells have been successfully used since the 1960s. Initially \nthey were developed for space applications and have provided all of the \nwater and electricity needs in every manned U.S. space mission, \nincluding the Apollo and Gemini spacecraft. Since this time, they have \nbeen developed for a wide variety of other applications, including \ncommercial, residential, and transportation uses.\n  I am pleased to join Senators Snowe, Schumer, Dodd, Hutchinson, \nClinton, Cantwell, Carper, Dorgan, Leahy, Levin, Harkin, Akaka, and \nMikulski on this important bill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nConnecticut Senator Lieberman, to introduce a bill that will promote \nthe expanded use of an environmentally sound and efficient energy \ntechnology, fuel cell power.\n  We all agree with President Bush that we have a crisis situation, \nAmerica's energy future is bleak. Portions of our country are \nexperiencing rolling blackouts, fuel prices are skyrocketing, America's \ndependence on imported oil reached a new high of over 60 percent in \nrecent months, and our search for additional fossil fuels threatens the \nsanctity of protected wilderness areas. Now is the time to promote long \nterm solutions such as fuel cell technology to reduce our fossil fuel \nconsumption and maintain a steady supply of energy.\n  Fuel cells are not a futuristic dream, every manned U.S. space \nmission has relied upon fuel cells for electricity and drinking water. \nFrom a New York city police station to a postal facility in Alaska to \nhospitals, schools, banks, military installations, and manufacturing \nfacilities around the world, fuel cell units are efficiently generating \ndependable power 24 hours a day, seven days a week for upwards of 5 \nyears with only routine maintenance.\n  Fuel cell technology offers a clean, secure, efficient, and \ndependable source of energy that should be part of our national energy \nstrategy. Not only do fuel cells deliver the high quality, reliable \npower that is considered an absolute necessity for many portions of our \nsociety, they reduce power grid demand while improving grid \nflexibility. Fuel cells are an ideal energy source to address America's \npressing energy needs.\n  Using an electro-chemical reaction to convert energy from hydrogen-\nrich fuel sources into electricity, fuel cells reduce the need for \nfossil fuel consumption. And, since no combustion is involved, fuel \ncells produce virtually no air pollution and significantly reduce \ncarbon dioxide emissions. In fact, a 200 kilowatt fuel cell power plant \nproduces less than one ounce of pollutants for every 1,000 kilowatt \nhours of electricity it yields. In comparison, the average American \nfossil fuel plant produces nearly 25 pounds of pollutants to generate \nthe same 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity. That is 400 times the \namount of the fuel cell power plant.\n  However, it is difficult for consumers to take advantage of fuel \ncells because as with any new technology, the introductory price is \nhigh. To create the market incentives necessary to speed the \ncommercialization of this technology, our legislation provides a $1,000 \nper kilowatt stationary fuel cell tax credit for power plants that have \nan electrical generation efficiency of 30 percent or higher.\n  By lowering the initial price for consumers, market introduction and \nproduction volume of fuel cells will be accelerated with the end result \nbeing a significant reduction in manufacturing costs. The decrease in \nprice would enable even more consumers to use the one of the cleanest, \nmost reliable and most efficient means to generate electricity.\n\n  This fuel cell tax credit is designed to benefit the widest range of \npotential fuel cell customers and manufacturers with a meaningful \nincentive for the purchase of fuel cells for residential and commercial \nuse while minimizing the budget impact to $500 million over the 5-year \nlife of the program. I hope my colleagues will agree that an annual \ncost of $100 million is a small price to pay for a reliable source of \npower that will benefit the environment and reduce our nation's \ndependence on foreign oil supplies.\n  At a time when power shortages and interruptions are becoming more \nprevalent, we must increase our investment and commitment to non-\ntraditional energy sources such as fuel cells. The reliable, \ncombustion-free power fuel cells provide is a sensible alternative that \nis available today. I urge my colleagues to support us in the Fuel Cell \nTax Credit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \n        Lott, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Reid, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Miller, and Mr. \n        Edwards):\n  S. 829. A bill to establish the National Museum of African American \nHistory and Culture within the Smithsonian Institution; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am honored to introduce legislation, \ntoday, that creates the ``National Museum of African American History \nand Culture.'' I along with Senators Max Cleland, Rich Santorum, \nMajority Leader Lott, Hillary Clinton, Harry Reid, Christopher Dodd, \nZell Miller, and John Edwards are committed to passing this legislation \nthis year.\n  One of the most important chapters in our national story of human \nfreedom and dignity is the history and legacy of the African American \nmarch toward freedom, legal equality and full participation in American \nSociety. Yet in our\n\n[[Page S4263]]\n\nnation's front yard, the National Mall, there is no museum set aside to \nhonor this legacy.\n  As a Kansan, I feel a special connection to honoring the legacy of \nAfrican-Americans. Kansas, as you know, not only played a significant \nrole in the Civil War but also was chosen by many African-American \nfamilies as a place to began their new life of freedom and prosperity \nin the ``Exodus to Kansas.''\n  This is just one part of the incredible history of African Americans \nthat must be told on a national level. We have over 200 wonderful \nAfrican-American history museums across the nation that tell portions \nof the African-American story. However, this legacy must be showcased \nat a national level.\n  That is why I am here today with my colleagues introducing this \nlegislation to create the National Museum of African-American history \nand culture within the Smithsonian Institution, a premier organization, \nwhich represents the best museums in the nation. We believe it is \nvitally important that the Smithsonian, the world's leading museum \norganization, provide its expertise in putting this facility and its \nprograms together.\n  This project has brought together a very broad and bicameral \ncoalition that stood with us today during the press conference to \nannounce the introduction of this bill. I would like to personally \nthank Pastor Chuck Singleton, of Loveland Church in California, as well \nas Robert Johnson, of B.E.T., Dorothy Height of the National Council of \nNegro Women, and Phyllis Berry Myers, of the Center for New Black \nLeadership for joining with us to support this legislation today.\n  We do not pretend that our legislation is a cure-all for the problem \nof racial division. It is, however, an important and productive step \ntoward healing our nation's racial wounds. I believe that this museum \nwill both celebrate African-American achievement and serve as a \nlandmark of national conscience on the historical facts of slavery and \nthe civil rights struggle.\n  We have an extraordinary opportunity before us--a chance to learn, \nunderstand and remember together our nation's history and to honor the \nsignificant contribution of African Americans to our history and \nculture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 829\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Museum of African \n     American History and Culture Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over the history of our Nation, the United States has \n     grown into a symbol of democracy and freedom around the \n     world, and the legacy of African Americans is rooted in the \n     very fabric of our Nation's democracy and freedom.\n       (2) There exists no national museum within the Smithsonian \n     Institution located on the National Mall that is devoted to \n     the documentation of African American life, art, history, and \n     culture and that encompasses on a national level, the period \n     of slavery, the era of reconstruction, the Harlem \n     renaissance, the civil rights movement, and beyond.\n       (3) Slavery was an accepted practice in this Nation, \n     authorized by the Government through legislation such as the \n     fugitive slave law of 1793 (1 Stat. 302) and sanctioned by \n     the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott decision (Scott v. \n     Sanford, 60 U.S. 393 (1857)).\n       (4) Those African Americans who suffered under slavery and \n     their descendants show us the strength of the human character \n     and provide us with a model of courage, commitment, and \n     perseverance. A national museum dedicated to the history of \n     and commemorating those who suffered the grave injustice of \n     slavery in this country will help in ``binding our Nation's \n     wounds'' rooted in slavery and will allow all Americans to \n     understand the past and honor the history of all Americans.\n       (5) Leaders of the African American community in the 1950s \n     and 1960s led this Nation in the civil rights movement with \n     the intent of ending discrimination against African \n     Americans. During this period, many African American churches \n     were destroyed and countless individuals involved in this \n     movement were often beaten and killed. Through the devotion \n     and sacrifice of those leaders, the civil rights movement \n     made great strides in ensuring equality for African Americans \n     in this country.\n       (6) African Americans have enriched the cultural make-up of \n     the United States by their contributions in the areas of \n     science, medicine, the arts and humanities, sports, music, \n     and dance.\n       (7) Preserving this rich record of the experiences of \n     African Americans, studying their experiences, and presenting \n     those experiences through exhibits to the public would be of \n     great educational and social value.\n       (8) The creation of a National Museum of African American \n     History and Culture located on the National Mall in the \n     District of Columbia and administered by the Smithsonian \n     Institution's Board of Regents was endorsed in 1991 by a \n     unanimous vote by the Smithsonian Institution's Board of \n     Regents.\n       (9) The Smithsonian African American Institutional Study \n     recommended that the National Museum of African American \n     History and Culture be established in the Arts and Industries \n     Building of the Smithsonian Institution.\n       (10) Although the Smithsonian Institution has had some \n     success in focusing on African American history and culture, \n     the programming on African American history and culture has \n     been occasional and episodic.\n       (11) A National Museum of African American History and \n     Culture will provide a continued and consistent African \n     American presence on the National Mall.\n       (12) The National Museum of African American History and \n     Culture will be dedicated to the collection, preservation, \n     research, and exhibition of African American historical and \n     cultural material reflecting the breadth and depth of the \n     experiences of persons of African descent living in the \n     United States.\n       (13) The National Museum of African American History and \n     Culture established by this Act will coordinate the \n     collection of material related to African Americans, which is \n     rapidly disappearing due to a lack of resources and trained \n     professionals engaged in preservation.\n       (14) The work of the National Museum of African American \n     History and Culture will be, fundamentally, the same as the \n     work of all museums in the United States that reflect and \n     express the experiences of the people of the United States in \n     an inclusive manner.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN \n                   AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established within the \n     Smithsonian Institution the National Museum of African \n     American History and Culture (hereafter referred to in this \n     Act as the ``Museum''), and the Smithsonian Institution shall \n     maintain and administer the Museum.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the Museum is to provide for--\n       (1) the collection, study, and creation of scholarship \n     relating to the African American diaspora that encompasses \n     slavery, the era of reconstruction, the Harlem renaissance, \n     the civil rights movement, and beyond;\n       (2) the creation and maintenance of permanent and temporary \n     exhibits documenting American slavery and African American \n     life, art, history, and culture from slavery and the era of \n     reconstruction to the Harlem renaissance, the civil rights \n     movement, and beyond;\n       (3) the collection and study of artifacts and documents \n     relating to African American life, art, history, and culture \n     and the African diaspora;\n       (4) the establishment of programs in cooperation with other \n     museums, historical societies, educational institutions, and \n     other organizations that promote the understanding of modern \n     day practices of slavery throughout the world;\n       (5) collaboration between the Museum and other African \n     American museums, historically black colleges and \n     universities, and other museums, historical societies, \n     educational institutions, and other organizations that \n     promote the study of the African diaspora including \n     collaboration regarding--\n       (A) development of cooperative programs and exhibitions;\n       (B) identification, management, and care of collections; \n     and\n       (C) participation in the training of museum professionals; \n     and\n       (6) leadership and commitment to historical accuracy in the \n     study, education, and exhibition of African American life, \n     art, history, and culture in the museum and throughout the \n     Nation.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss legislation being \nintroduced in the Senate today to establish the National Museum of \nAfrican American History and Culture. I am very proud to work with such \ndistinguished members of the Senate as my friend, Senator Brownback, \nand the other co-sponsors of this legislation: Senators Santorum, \nClinton, Reid, Dodd, and Miller. Our bill is similar to a measure being \nintroduced in the House by Representatives John Lewis and J.C. Watts. I \nam both proud and pleased to be associated with this project and look \nforward to seeing this legislation passed by the Senate and the House \nof Representatives and signed into law by the President in the near \nfuture.\n  This bipartisan legislation would establish a permanent collection of \nartifacts and historical materials showcasing 400 years of African \nAmerican history, available for the public to experience and enjoy \nyear-round. The national museum would be financed by a combination of \npublic and private sector contributions. A number of studies document \nthe great need for museum collections addressing African American \nhistory and culture. African American visitors to Washington find that \ntheir story is not being told in the existing museums and memorials. \nYet, there are existing private collections of historical materials \naddressing African American history that could be contributed to a \nmuseum in Washington.\n  Many notable African Americans have made important contributions in \nthe areas of science, medicine, the arts and humanities, sports, music \nand dance, among many other fields. It is right to honor this legacy on \na national level. We believe that by establishing this museum we will \nbe able to finally honor the legacy of African Americans properly. By \nplacing this museum on or near the National Mall, we will finally place \nthe history of African Americans in a national spot-light, where it \nbelongs.\n  Legislation authorizing a national museum devoted to African American \nhistory and culture has been introduced during every Congress since \n1988. The legislation passed the Senate unanimously in one Congress, \nand passed the House unanimously in another session. However, it has \nnot yet become law. The sponsors of the legislation in the 107th \nCongress believe that the time has come for enactment of this \nlegislation so that families across America from all races and ethnic \ngroups who visit the nation's capital can more fully understand \nAmerican history and the significant contributions of African Americans \nto that history.\n  I encourage others to join us in this endeavor as we attempt to \nremember, recognize, and commemorate the major contributions made by \nAfrican Americans in the areas of science, medicine, the arts and \nhumanities, sports, music, and dance. This museum will not only be a \ntribute to African American history and culture but it will also be a \nsource of pride for all Americans as physical evidence of the strength, \ncharacter, and dignity of the human race.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Warner, Mr. Torricelli, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Johnson, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 830. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \nthe Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences \nto make grants for the development and operation of research centers \nregarding environmental factors that may be related to the etiology of \nbreast cancer; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenators Reid, Hatch, Leahy, Warner, Toricelli, Snowe, Murray, \nMikulski, Johnson, Corzine, and Kerry in introducing the Breast Cancer \nand Environmental Research Act of 2001. This bill would establish \nresearch centers that would be the first in the nation to specifically \nstudy the environmental factors that may be related to the development \nof breast cancer. The lack of agreement within the scientific community \nand among breast cancer advocates on this question highlights the need \nfor further study.\n  It is generally believed that the environment plays some role in the \ndevelopment of breast cancer, but the extent of that role is not \nunderstood. The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act of 2001 \nwill enable us to conduct more conclusive and comprehensive research to \ndetermine the impact of the environment on breast cancer. Before we can \nfind the answers, we must determine the right questions we should be \nasking.\n  While more research is being conducted into the relationship between \nbreast cancer and the environment, there are still several issues that \nmust be resolved to make this research more effective. They are as \nfollows:\n  There is no known cause of breast cancer. There is little agreement \nin the scientific community on how the environment effects breast \ncancer. While studies have been conducted on the links between \nenvironmental factors like pesticides, diet, and electromagnetic \nfields, no consensus has been\n\n[[Page S4266]]\n\nreached. There are other factors that have not yet been studied that \ncould provide valuable information. While there is much speculation, it \nis clear that the relationship between environmental exposures and \nbreast cancer is poorly understood.\n  There are challenges in conducting environmental research. \nIdentifying links between environmental factors and breast cancer is \ndifficult. Laboratory experiments and cluster analyses, such as those \nin Long Island, New York, cannot reveal whether an environmental \nexposure increases a woman's risk of breast cancer. Epidemiological \nstudies must be designed carefully because environmental exposures are \ndifficult to measure.\n  Coordination between the National Institutes of Health, NIH, the \nNational Cancer Institute, NCI, and the National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, needs to occur. NCI and NIEHS are \nthe two institutes in the NIH that fund most of the research related to \nbreast cancer and the environment; however, comprehensive information \nspecific to environmental effects on breast cancer is not currently \navailable.\n  This legislation would establish eight Centers of Excellence to study \nthese potential links. These ``Breast Cancer Environmental Research \nCenters'' would provide for multi-disciplinary research among basic, \nclinical, epidemiological and behavioral scientists interested in \nestablishing outstanding, state-of-the-art research programs addressing \npotential links between the environment and breast cancer. The NIEHS \nwould award grants based on a competitive peer-review process. This \nlegislation would require each Center to collaborate with community \norganizations in the area, including those that represent women with \nbreast cancer. The bill would authorize $30 million for the next five \nyears for these grants.\n  ``Genetics loads the gun, the environment pulls the trigger,'' as Ken \nOlden, the Director of NIEHS, frequently says. Many scientists believe \nthat certain groups of women have genetic variations that may make them \nmore susceptible to adverse environmental exposures. We need to step \nback and gather evidence before we come to conclusions--that is the \npurpose of this bill. People are hungry for information, and there is a \nlot of inconclusive data out there, some of which has no scientific \nmerit whatsoever. We have the opportunity through this legislation to \ngather legitimate and comprehensive data from premier research \ninstitutions across the nation.\n  According to the American Cancer Society, each year 800 women in \nRhode Island are diagnosed with breast cancer, and 200 women in my \nstate will die of this terrible disease this year. We owe it to these \nwomen who are diagnosed with this, life-threatening disease to provide \nthem with answers for the first time.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting and cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation, and ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                 S. 830\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Breast Cancer and \n     Environmental Research Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n     deaths among American women.\n       (2) More women in the United States are living with breast \n     cancer than any other cancer (excluding skin cancer). \n     Approximately 3,000,000 women in the United States are living \n     with breast cancer, 2,000,000 of which have been diagnosed \n     and an estimated 1,000,000 who do not yet know that they have \n     the disease.\n       (3) Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer \n     among women in the United States and worldwide (excluding \n     skin cancer). In 2001, it is estimated that 233,000 new cases \n     of breast cancer will be diagnosed among women in the United \n     States, 192,000 cases of which will involve invasive breast \n     cancer and 40,800 cases of which will involve ductal \n     carcinoma in situ (DCIS).\n       (4) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n     death for women in the United States. Approximately 40,000 \n     women in the United States die from the disease each year. \n     Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women \n     in the United States between the ages of 20 and 59, and the \n     leading cause of cancer death for women worldwide.\n       (5) A woman in the United States has a 1 in 8 chance of \n     developing invasive breast cancer in her lifetime. This risk \n     was 1 in 11 in 1975. In 2001, a new case of breast cancer \n     will be diagnosed every 2 minutes and a woman will die from \n     breast cancer every 13 minutes.\n       (6) All women are at risk for breast cancer.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Chafee in \nintroducing the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act. Senator \nChafee and I serve together on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee where we have had the opportunity to take a closer look at \ndifferent environment-related health concerns. Most recently, the \nCommittee traveled to Nevada to investigate what environmental factors \nmay have contributed to a childhood leukemia cluster in the town of \nFallon.\n  The Fallon hearing reminded me how little we know about what causes \ncancer and what, if any, connection exists between the environment and \ncancer. Three decades have passed since President Nixon declared the \n``War on Cancer'' and scientists are still struggling with these and \nother crucial unanswered questions about cancer. This is particularly \ntrue in the case of breast cancer. We still don't know what causes \nbreast cancer. We don't know if the environment plays a role in the \ndevelopment of breast cancer, and if it does, we don't know how \nsignificant that role is. In our search for answers about breast \ncancer, we need to make sure we are asking the right questions.\n  To date, there has been only a limited research investment to study \nthe role of the environment in the development of breast cancer. More \nresearch needs to be done to determine the impact of the environment on \nbreast cancer. The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act would \ngive scientists the tools they need to pursue a better understanding \nabout what links between the environment and breast cancer may exist. \nSpecifically, our bill would authorize $30 million dollars to the \nNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to establish eight \nCenters of Excellence that would focus on breast cancer and the \nenvironment.\n  In the year 2000 alone, 183,000 women will learn that they have \nbreast cancer. In this same year, 40,000 women will die from breast \ncancer. In Nevada--a state with a population under two million people--\n1,200 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in this year and 200 \nwomen will lose their lives to this deadly disease. These women are our \nmothers, our wives, our daughters, and our friends.\n  If we miss promising research opportunities because of Congress' \nfailure to act, millions of women and their families will face critical \nunanswered questions about breast cancer. I urge my colleagues to join \nin our quest for answers about this deadly disease and to support the \nBreast Cancer and Environmental Research Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S. 831. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a 100 percent deduction for business meals; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould increase the deductibility of business meals to 100 percent. By \nonly allowing a 50 percent deduction, the current law unfairly hurts \nsmall business owners who many times conduct business face to face over \na meal. For these people, the costs of business meals truly is a \nlegitimate business expense. However, unlike other business expenses, \nthey are not able to fully deduct the cost of business meals.\n  America's small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Allowing \nfull deductibility of business related meals will lighten the heavy \nfinancial burden small business owners face daily just to be able to \nkeep their doors open. Furthermore, increased deductibility will inject \nadditional capital into our country's businesses, allowing them to \nspend more money on innovation and growth. Such activities will lead to \nmore jobs and a stronger economy.\n  Full deductibility of business meals will also create an increase in \nrestaurant patronage. As a result, my bill will benefit waiters, \nwaitresses, cooks and other restaurant workers by increasing their job \nsecurity and wages. Increased wages will make it easier for restaurant \nemployees to meet the rising cost of living. With the cost of gasoline, \nelectricity, and health insurance rising to unprecedented levels, \nhigher wages can not come soon enough.\n  Just as importantly, increased wages will make it easier for more \nAmericans to save for their retirement. Rather than living paycheck to \npaycheck, increased wages in the restaurant industry will make it \npossible for more people to begin to save for the future. Given the \nbleak predictions for the continued solvency of the Social Security \ntrust fund, Congress must do all that it can to encourage saving.\n  Similar bills to increase the deductibility of business meals have \nbeen introduced in previous years. Now is the time to move beyond mere \ndiscussion and to move towards meaningful action. This legislation will \nhave a positive effect on our economy. It fosters small business growth \nand will help increase wages for many Americans throughout the country. \nI ask that my colleagues join me in support of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 831\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. INCREASED DEDUCTION FOR BUSINESS MEAL EXPENSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 274(n)(1) (relating to only 50 \n     percent of meal and entertainment expenses allowed as \n     deduction) is amended by striking ``50 percent'' in the text \n     and inserting ``the allowable percentage''.\n       (b) Allowable Percentage.--Section 274(n) is amended by--\n       (1) striking paragraph (3);\n       (2) redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (3); and\n       (3) inserting after paragraph (1) the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(2) Allowable percentage.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     the allowable percentage is--\n       ``(A) in the case of amounts for items described in \n     paragraph (1)(B), 50 percent, and\n       ``(B) in the case of expenses for food or beverages, 100 \n     percent.''.\n       (c) Conforming Amendment.--The heading for subsection (n) \n     of section 274 is amended by striking ``50 Percent'' and \n     inserting ``Limited Percentages''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 832. A bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nIndian Gaming Regulatory Improvement Act of 2001 to make what I believe \nare necessary changes to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. I am \nvery pleased to be joined by Senator Inouye in this regard.\n  The IGRA was signed into law in 1988 with two purposes in mind: to \nprovide for and continue the economic opportunities tribal gaming \npresents to Indian tribes; and to provide a regulatory framework which \nensures the integrity of tribal gaming--integrity that benefits tribes \nas well as customers of tribal gaming operations.\n  In 1988, tribal gaming was a relatively new activity and in 13 years \ntribal gaming annual gross revenues have grown from $500 million to $9 \nbillion. The IGRA requires these revenues to be spent by tribal \ngovernments for specific purposes including physical infrastructure, \ngeneral welfare and the\n\n[[Page S4268]]\n\nbetterment of Indian and surrounding non-Indian communities.\n  Out of 561 federally recognized tribes, there are 212 tribes that \nconduct some form of gaming. The old saying that the best social \nwelfare policy is a job is true when it comes to tribal gaming. The \neconomic benefits for these tribes, their members and surrounding \ncommunities cannot be ignored. For these communities collectively, \nunemployment has dropped significantly and workers, both Non-Indian and \nIndian alike, employed by these operations enjoy benefits such as \nsteady income and good paying jobs, health insurance and retirement \nbenefits. Additionally, tribes who operate gaming have been able \nto complement scarce federal dollars to provide for housing, health \ncare and education for their members and to generate hundreds of \nthousands of jobs for Indians and non-Indians nationwide.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today closely resembles a measure I \nintroduced in the last Congress and is not intended to be a \ncomprehensive attempt to address all gaming matters that have arisen in \nthe past 13 years. Rather, this bill takes aim at 6 very specific \nitems:\n  1. With regard to gaming fees assessed against tribal operations, \nthis bill will require the Federal National Indian Gaming Commission to \nlevy fees that are reasonably related to the duties of and services \nprovided by the Commission to tribes, and in certain instances to \nreduce the level of fees payable by those operations;\n  2. The bill establishes a requirement that fees paid by tribes can \nonly be utilized for the specific activities of the Commission mandated \nby the IGRA;\n  3. It provides statutory authority for the Commission to establish, \nthrough a negotiated rule-making process, minimum standards for the \nconduct of tribal gaming, while still recognizing the primary \nresponsibility of tribes to regulate gaming on tribal lands;\n  4. The bill authorizes technical assistance to tribes for a number of \npurposes including strengthening tribal regulatory regimes; assessing \nthe feasibility of non-gaming economic development activities on Indian \nlands; providing treatment services for problem gamblers; and for other \npurposes not inconsistent with the IGRA;\n  5. It clarifies the current conflict between the IGRA and other \nFederal law with regard to the classification of certain games \nconducted by tribes; and\n  6. Last, to bring the Commission in line with all other Federal \nagencies it specifically subjects the Commission to the reporting and \nstrategic and long-term planning requirements similar to requirements \ncontained in the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 \n(``GPRA'').\n  While there are other matters that Indian tribes and others wish to \naddress that are not included in this bill, I am hopeful that my \ncolleagues will find this legislation to be reasonable and targeted to \nspecific issues that demand our attention in this session of Congress.\n  I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 832\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe child tax credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Tax \nCredit Expansion and Equity Act of 2001, with my good friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, and our other \ncosponsors Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bingaman, and Ms. \nCollins. This legislation would take an important first step towards \nhelping those children who are most in need, by expanding the current \nChild Tax Credit and making its benefits more equitable.\n  That I am here today introducing this bill is due in large part to \nthe efforts of two other people. Thanks to the President's initiative \nto double the current child tax credit from $500 to $1,000. This effort \nhas opened the door to addressing the cost borne by the parents in our \nsociety as they raise their children.\n  Of course, there is a larger cost than just the monetary expense \nincurred in taking care of and raising children. However, what better \nway can we acknowledge this cost, and lessen parents' burden than to \nincrease the child tax credit. My good friend, and colleague, \nRepresentative Connie Morella, from Maryland, recognized this and began \nan effort in the House of Representatives to address the current child \ntax credit inequity. I thank her for all of her good work and am happy \nto be able to work with her from this side of the Capitol to see that \nthis issue is properly addressed.\n  The President's proposal, while an important first step, doesn't do \nenough to help those who need it the most--our low and middle income \nfamilies. But make no mistake it is thanks to the President's opening \nthe door to the Child Tax Credit that we are here today to take that \neffort one step further and make this credit partially refundable.\n  There are over 16 million children in poverty, 1 in every 4, whose \nfamilies have no federal tax liability and therefore will receive no \nbenefit from an increase in the child tax credit because it's not \nrefundable. More than two-thirds of these children are in working \nfamilies.\n  There are an additional 7 million children who live in families that \nwill not benefit from an increase in the child tax credit unless it's \nrefundable due to their limited tax liability because they do not pay \nenough in federal taxes to get a $500 credit. Yet, these families pay \ntaxes. They pay federal and state taxes, payroll taxes, gas taxes, \nphone taxes, sales taxes, property taxes and other taxes. \nOverwhelmingly, they represent working families. They have no federal \ntax liability and therefore without this change to the child tax credit \nthey will receive no benefit from an increased child tax credit.\n  There may be some who will say that unless you can do it all don't do \nany of it. There are some who will say that only a fully refundable \ncredit is acceptable. However, I respectfully disagree. I have served \nin Congress for over two decades and I have learned that you should \nnever pass up the opportunity to make a difference. I have long made\n\n[[Page S4270]]\n\nimproving the lives of our children a priority.\n  The Child Tax Credit Expansion and Equity Act, would expand the child \ntax credit from $500 to $1,000 as proposed by the President, but it \nwould make the first $500 refundable. Families which would otherwise \nreceive nothing, would have a $500 refundable credit to help mitigate \nthe costs of raising their children today.\n  This bill just makes good sense. It makes sense that every family \nwith children should be eligible for the child tax credit. It makes \ngood sense to expand the number of families that qualify for the credit \ninstead of just giving more money to those families that already \nbenefit. It makes good sense and it does so in a simple and fair way. \nIt does not create another complicated tax form. The amount of the \ncredit is based on the number of dependents, period. It fits into the \ncurrent tax code and doesn't require a complex calculation or a degree \nin accounting. This is good public policy.\n  If timing is everything, then this is the time to do this for some of \nour most needy families. America today is prosperous, healthy and \nstrong. And yet, too many of our children, our most vulnerable of \ncitizens are in need of assistance. When the federal government is \nexpecting the largest surplus ever, shouldn't we make an investment in \nour future and help those who need it most.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this legislation and work with me \nand the cosponsors to ensure that the child tax credit is assisting the \nmost children possible.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Snowe, in introducing legislation to make the child tax \ncredit refundable.\n  Throughout America, families with children struggle with the extra \ncost associated with raising children today.\n  Early in the President's campaign, he proposed to increase the \ncurrent child tax credit from $500 to $1,000. While a reduction in tax \nrates is helpful to families, an increase in the per child tax credit \nis especially helpful because it recognizes that there are costs \nassociated with raising a family.\n  During the President's inaugural remarks, he said, ``America at its \nbest, is compassionate. In the quiet of American consciences, we know \nthat deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise.''\n  With much applause, the President continued, ``And whatever our views \nof its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault.'' \n``Americans in need are not strangers, they are citizens, not problems, \nbut priorities.\n  While I very much support the President's proposal to increase the \nchild tax credit from $500 to $1,000, it makes sense to me that all \nfamilies, not just families with tax liability, should receive such \nassistance.\n  Because the President's tax credit is not refundable, over 16 million \nchildren are left behind. They live in families with no federal tax \nliability and therefore will receive no benefit from an increase in the \nchild tax credit because it's not refundable--it's not available to \nfamilies without federal tax liability.\n  An additional 7 million children live in families who will not \nbenefit from an increase in the child tax credit unless it's refundable \nbecause their current credit would not increase due to limited tax \nliability.\n  Yet, these families pay taxes. They pay federal and state taxes, \npayroll taxes, gas taxes, phone taxes, and other taxes. Overwhelmingly, \nthey represent working families. Yet, at $12,000 or $20,000, they have \nno federal tax liability and therefore unless the child tax credit is \nmade refundable, they will receive no benefit from an increased child \ntax credit.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will increase the current \nchild tax credit from $500 to $1,000 as the President proposed, but \nwould also provide a refundable credit of $500 per child for those \nfamilies without federal income tax liability. This reform will lift \none million families out of poverty.\n  Often, people talk of the complexity of the tax code. The beauty of \nmaking the child tax credit refundable is its simplicity. All families, \nregardless of income, would receive the credit--no marriage penalty, no \ncliff, no complicated phase-outs.\n  Back in 1991, the Bipartisan National Children's Commission, chaired \nby my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, recommended \nenacting a refundable child tax credit. After a decade, the time is \nright. We have the resources. And, I hope and believe, we have the \nwill.\n  Making the child tax credit refundable is simply one of the most \neffective antipoverty strategies in years.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with us today in supporting this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4270-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4270-S4271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 82--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS BY THE \n     PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON \n  GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS AND REPRESENTATION BY THE SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Truman on May 10, 1950;\n       Whereas the National Science Foundation strengthens the \n     economy and improves the quality of life in the United States \n     as the Federal Government's only agency dedicated to the \n     support of education and fundamental research in all \n     scientific and engineering disciplines;\n       Whereas the National Science Foundation has worked \n     continuously and successfully to ensure that the United \n     States maintains its leadership in discovery, learning, and \n     innovation in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering;\n       Whereas the National Science Foundation has supported the \n     research of more than half of the United States Nobel \n     laureates in physics, chemistry, and economics;\n       Whereas the National Science Foundation has been the lead \n     Federal agency in a number of national science initiatives, \n     such as those in information technology and nanotechnology;\n       Whereas the National Science Foundation funds almost 20,000 \n     research and education projects in science and engineering at \n     over 2,000 colleges and universities, elementary and \n     secondary schools, nonprofit organizations, and small \n     businesses throughout our Nation;\n       Whereas the National Science Foundation's innovative \n     education programs work to ensure that every American student \n     receives a solid foundation in science, technology, and \n     mathematics through support for the training and education of \n     teachers, the public, and students of all ages and \n     backgrounds, and by supporting research into new teaching \n     tools, curricula, and methodologies;\n       Whereas the programs funded by the National Science \n     Foundation are an exemplary demonstration of the value of \n     scientific peer review in selecting the most innovative and \n     technically excellent research activities using a network of \n     over 50,000 scientists and engineers each year;\n       Whereas the National Science Foundation's international \n     programs promote new partnerships and cooperative projects \n     between United States scientists and engineers and their \n     foreign colleagues, and such partnerships play a key role in \n     establishing and strengthening diplomatic and economic ties; \n     and\n       Whereas research supported by the National Science \n     Foundation has led to discoveries, technologies, and products \n     which affect our daily lives, including a greater \n     understanding of bacteria, viruses, and the structure of DNA; \n     medical diagnostic tools, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging \n     (MRI); the Internet, web browsers, and fiber optics, which \n     have revolutionized global communication; polymer materials \n     used in products ranging from clothing to automobiles; \n     Doppler radar used for accurate weather forecasting; \n     artificial skin that can help recovering burn victims; \n     economic research in game and decision theory which has led \n     to a greater understanding of economic cycles; and \n     discoveries of new planets, black holes, and insights into \n     the nature of the universe: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the significance of the anniversary of the \n     founding of the National Science Foundation;\n       (2) acknowledges the completion of 50 years of achievement \n     and service by the National Science Foundation to the United \n     States; and\n       (3) reaffirms its commitment for the next 50 years to \n     support research, education, and technological advancement \n     and discovery through the National Science Foundation, the \n     premier scientific agency in the Federal Government.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to introduce this resolution \nto commemorate the National Science Foundation, (NSF)'s, fifty years of \npublic service. I am joined in this resolution by Senator Hollings, \nSenator Allen, Senator Breaux, Senator Bond, Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Mikulski, Senator Leiberman, and Senator \nKennedy. In addition, I would like to thank my colleague, \nRepresentative Nick Smith, for his leadership on this issue. The NSF \nhas played a crucial role in developing and maintaining the United \nStates economic and scientific leadership, and it deserves the \ngratitude of the American people for its groundbreaking work.\n  Since its creation in 1950, the National Science Foundation has \nconducted ``cutting-edge'' research. More than half of the U.S. Nobel \nLaureates in physics, chemistry, and economics have had their research \nsupported by NSF. The National Solar Observatory, and other NSF-\nsponsored programs, are finding new discoveries about the Sun, the \nplanets, and other galaxies in our universe. The NSF also runs programs \nthat study life here on Earth. The NSF Antarctic station, that has \nrecently been in the news, studies the West Antarctic Ice Shelf to \nunderstand changes in global climate change. The recent news report on \nthe Antarctic Station further highlights the risk, sacrifice, and \ndedication that many of our scientists and engineers take on a daily \nbasis in our scientific research pursuits. A NSF-sponsored \nMultidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research studies \nnew construction techniques to prevent death and destruction from \nearthquakes. The NSF Plant Genome Project is mapping a model plant, the \nArabidopsis thaliana, to find ways to develop crops resistant to \ninsects, disease, and harsh environmental conditions. Most important, \nNSF plays an important role in working with America's schools to teach \nchildren math and science and train the scientists and engineers that \nare necessary to maintaining America's technological leadership.\n  It is important to point out that NSF-sponsored research continues to \nplay an important role in every day American life. Research sponsored \nby NSF developed Magnetic Resonance Imaging, (MRI), artificial skin, \nand other medical breakthroughs that have saved the lives of millions \nof Americans. NSF research also developed the Doppler radar, which is \nused every day to warn Americans of impending hazardous weather. In \naddition, the NSF played a major role in developing the Internet, web \nbrowsers, and fiber optics, which have revolutionized our economy and \nculture. The NSF also helped to develop the American Sign Language \nDictionary. Currently, the NSF is pursuing a number of new research \ninitiatives, including nanotechnology and information technology. These \nnew endeavors promise to foster new discoveries throughout the 21st \ncentury.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this \nresolution to express our gratitude and support for\n\n[[Page S4272]]\n\nthis major American research institution.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, innovation, undeniably, has been the \ncornerstone of this nation's competitiveness. What is often overlooked, \nhowever, is that the precursor to innovation is basic, fundamental \nresearch. An agency that has been essential to this kind of research is \nthe National Science Foundation, NSF. Through the NSF, the United \nStates has invested in world class basic research at our colleges and \nuniversities.\n  Today, we are introducing a resolution to commemorate 50 years of \naccomplishment by the National Science Foundation. The NSF is the \nFederal agency mandated to support overall academic science and \nengineering in the United States. To fulfill this responsibility, it \nsupports both (1) university and college research in all fields of \nscience, engineering, and mathematics, and (2) science, engineering, \nand mathematics education, including precollege as well as university \neducation. NSF provides grants for these purposes, as opposed to \noperating research laboratories of its own.\n  NSF supported researchers have won Nobel Prices and have made \ndiscoveries that have significantly affected our daily lives. From \nunderstanding DNA to the development of web browsers, the science that \nNSF sponsors has enormous impacts. Moreover, NSF helps support the \ngraduate students who become the next generation of researchers, \nteachers, and practitioners in the Sciences.\n  Specifically, I would like to draw attention to NSF's Experimental \nProgram to Stimulate Competitive Research, EPSCoR. This program is \nhelping to develop the research infrastructure in states like South \nCarolina that have traditionally been left behind in Federal research \nfunding. I encourage the NSF to continue its support for EPSCoR.\n  NSF will complete its 50th year on May 10. I salute the agency's \ncontribution to U.S. prosperity and scientific inquiry and hope that \nthe next 50 years are just as productive as the first 50.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/03/senate-section/article/S4272-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 358.

FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) Native Hawaiians are a distinct and unique indigenous \n     people with a historical continuity to the original \n     inhabitants of the Hawaiian archipelago, whose society was \n     organized as a nation and internationally recognized as a \n     nation by the United States, Britain, France, and Japan, as \n     evidenced by treaties governing friendship, commerce, and \n     navigation.\n       ``(2) At the time of the arrival of the first non-\n     indigenous people in Hawai'i in 1778, the Native Hawaiian \n     people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient \n     subsistence social system based on a communal land tenure \n     system with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion.\n       ``(3) A unified monarchal government of the Hawaiian \n     Islands was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first \n     King of Hawai`i.\n       ``(4) From 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized \n     the sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom of Hawai`i, \n     which was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, extended \n     full and complete diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of \n     Hawai`i, and entered into treaties and conventions with the \n     Kingdom of Hawai`i to govern friendship, commerce and \n     navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887.\n       ``(5) In 1893, the sovereign, independent, internationally \n     recognized, and indigenous government of Hawai`i, the Kingdom \n     of Hawai`i, was overthrown by a small group of non-Hawaiians, \n     including United States citizens, who were assisted in their \n     efforts by the United States Minister, a United States naval \n     representative, and armed naval forces of the United States. \n     Because of the participation of United States agents and \n     citizens in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i, in 1993 \n     the United States apologized to Native Hawaiians for the \n     overthrow and the deprivation of the rights of Native \n     Hawaiians to self-determination through Public Law 103-150 \n     (107 Stat. 1510).\n       ``(6) In 1898, the joint resolution entitled `Joint \n     Resolution to provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to \n     the United States', approved July 7, 1898 (30 Stat. 750), \n     ceded absolute title of all lands held by the Republic of \n     Hawai`i, including the government and crown lands of the \n     former Kingdom of Hawai`i, to the United States, but mandated \n     that revenue generated from the lands be used `solely for the \n     benefit of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for \n     educational and other public purposes'.\n       ``(7) By 1919, the Native Hawaiian population had declined \n     from an estimated 1,000,000 in 1778 to an alarming 22,600, \n     and in recognition of this severe decline, Congress enacted \n     the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108), which \n     designated approximately 200,000 acres of ceded public lands \n     for homesteading by Native Hawaiians.\n\n[[Page S4361]]\n\n       ``(8) Through the enactment of the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920, Congress affirmed the special \n     relationship between the United States and the Native \n     Hawaiians, which was described by then Secretary of the \n     Interior Franklin K. Lane, who said: `One thing that \n     impressed me . . . was the fact that the natives of the \n     island who are our wards, I should say, and for whom in a \n     sense we are trustees, are falling off rapidly in numbers and \n     many of them are in poverty.'.\n       ``(9) In 1938, Congress again acknowledged the unique \n     status of the Hawaiian people by including in the Act of June \n     20, 1938 (52 Stat. 781, chapter 530; 16 U.S.C. 391b, 391b-1, \n     392b, 392c, 396, 396a), a provision to lease lands within the \n     National Parks extension to Native Hawaiians and to permit \n     fishing in the area `only by native Hawaiian residents of \n     said area or of adjacent villages and by visitors under their \n     guidance.'.\n       ``(10) Under the Act entitled `An Act to provide for the \n     admission of the State of Hawai`i into the Union', approved \n     March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred \n     responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian Home \n     Lands to the State of Hawai`i but reaffirmed the trust \n     relationship between the United States and the Hawaiian \n     people by retaining the exclusive power to enforce the trust, \n     including the power to approve land exchanges and amendments \n     to such Act affecting the rights of beneficiaries under such \n     Act.\n       ``(11) In 1959, under the Act entitled `An Act to provide \n     for the admission of the State of Hawai`i into the Union', \n     the United States also ceded to the State of Hawai`i title to \n     the public lands formerly held by the United States, but \n     mandated that such lands be held by the State `in public \n     trust' and reaffirmed the special relationship that existed \n     between the United States and the Hawaiian people by \n     retaining the legal responsibility to enforce the public \n     trust responsibility of the State of Hawai`i for the \n     betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, as defined \n     in section 201(a) of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920.\n       ``(12) The United States has recognized and reaffirmed \n     that--\n       ``(A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-\n     based link to the indigenous people who exercised sovereignty \n     over the Hawaiian Islands, and that group has never \n     relinquished its claims to sovereignty or its sovereign \n     lands;\n       ``(B) Congress does not extend services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their race, but because of their unique status as \n     the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom \n     the United States has established a trust relationship;\n       ``(C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to \n     administer a portion of the Federal trust responsibility to \n     the State of Hawai`i;\n       ``(D) the political status of Native Hawaiians is \n     comparable to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives; \n     and\n       ``(E) the aboriginal, indigenous people of the United \n     States have--\n       ``(i) a continuing right to autonomy in their internal \n     affairs; and\n       ``(ii) an ongoing right of self-determination and self-\n     governance that has never been extinguished.\n       ``(13) The political relationship between the United States \n     and the Native Hawaiian people has been recognized and \n     reaffirmed by the United States, as evidenced by the \n     inclusion of Native Hawaiians in--\n       ``(A) the Native American Programs Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. \n     2991 et seq.);\n       ``(B) the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1996);\n       ``(C) the National Museum of the American Indian Act (20 \n     U.S.C. 80q et seq.);\n       ``(D) the Native American Graves Protection and \n     Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.);\n       ``(E) the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 \n     et seq.);\n       ``(F) the Native American Languages Act (25 U.S.C. 2901 et \n     seq.);\n       ``(G) the American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n     Hawaiian Culture and Art Development Act (20 U.S.C. 4401 et \n     seq.);\n       ``(H) the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 2801 \n     et seq.); and\n       ``(I) the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3001 et \n     seq.).\n       ``(14) In 1981, Congress instructed the Office of Education \n     to submit to Congress a comprehensive report on Native \n     Hawaiian education. The report, entitled the `Native Hawaiian \n     Educational Assessment Project', was released in 1983 and \n     documented that Native Hawaiians scored below parity with \n     regard to national norms on standardized achievement tests, \n     were disproportionately represented in many negative social \n     and physical statistics indicative of special educational \n     needs, and had educational needs that were related to their \n     unique cultural situation, such as different learning styles \n     and low self-image.\n       ``(15) In recognition of the educational needs of Native \n     Hawaiians, in 1988, Congress enacted title IV of the Augustus \n     F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School \n     Improvement Amendments of 1988 (102 Stat. 130) to authorize \n     and develop supplemental educational programs to address the \n     unique conditions of Native Hawaiians.\n       ``(16) In 1993, the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate \n     released a 10-year update of findings of the Native Hawaiian \n     Educational Assessment Project, which found that despite the \n     successes of the programs established under title IV of the \n     Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and \n     Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988, many of the \n     same educational needs still existed for Native Hawaiians. \n     Subsequent reports by the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate \n     and other organizations have generally confirmed those \n     findings. For example--\n       ``(A) educational risk factors continue to start even \n     before birth for many Native Hawaiian children, including--\n       ``(i) late or no prenatal care;\n       ``(ii) high rates of births by Native Hawaiian women who \n     are unmarried; and\n       ``(iii) high rates of births to teenage parents;\n       ``(B) Native Hawaiian students continue to begin their \n     school experience lagging behind other students in terms of \n     readiness factors such as vocabulary test scores;\n       ``(C) Native Hawaiian students continue to score below \n     national norms on standardized education achievement tests at \n     all grade levels;\n       ``(D) both public and private schools continue to show a \n     pattern of lower percentages of Native Hawaiian students in \n     the uppermost achievement levels and in gifted and talented \n     programs;\n       ``(E) Native Hawaiian students continue to be \n     overrepresented among students qualifying for special \n     education programs provided to students with learning \n     disabilities, mild mental retardation, emotional impairment, \n     and other such disabilities;\n       ``(F) Native Hawaiians continue to be underrepresented in \n     institutions of higher education and among adults who have \n     completed 4 or more years of college;\n       ``(G) Native Hawaiians continue to be disproportionately \n     represented in many negative social and physical statistics \n     indicative of special educational needs, as demonstrated by \n     the fact that--\n       ``(i) Native Hawaiian students are more likely to be \n     retained in grade level and to be excessively absent in \n     secondary school;\n       ``(ii) Native Hawaiian students have the highest rates of \n     drug and alcohol use in the State of Hawai`i; and\n       ``(iii) Native Hawaiian children continue to be \n     disproportionately victimized by child abuse and neglect; and\n       ``(H) Native Hawaiians now comprise over 23 percent of the \n     students served by the State of Hawai`i Department of \n     Education, and there are and will continue to be \n     geographically rural, isolated areas with a high Native \n     Hawaiian population density.\n       ``(17) In the 1998 National Assessment of Educational \n     Progress, Hawaiian fourth-graders ranked 39th among groups of \n     students from 39 States in reading. Given that Hawaiian \n     students rank among the lowest groups of students nationally \n     in reading, and that Native Hawaiian students rank the lowest \n     among Hawaiian students in reading, it is imperative that \n     greater focus be placed on beginning reading and early \n     education and literacy in Hawai`i.\n       ``(18) The findings described in paragraphs (16) and (17) \n     are inconsistent with the high rates of literacy and \n     integration of traditional culture and Western education \n     historically achieved by Native Hawaiians through a Hawaiian \n     language-based public school system established in 1840 by \n     Kamehameha III.\n       ``(19) Following the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i in \n     1893, Hawaiian medium schools were banned. After annexation, \n     throughout the territorial and statehood period of Hawai`i, \n     and until 1986, use of the Hawaiian language as an \n     instructional medium in education in public schools was \n     declared unlawful. The declaration caused incalculable harm \n     to a culture that placed a very high value on the power of \n     language, as exemplified in the traditional saying: `I ka \n     `olelo no ke ola; I ka `olelo no ka make. In the language \n     rests life; In the language rests death.'.\n       ``(20) Despite the consequences of over 100 years of \n     nonindigenous influence, the Native Hawaiian people are \n     determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to future \n     generations their ancestral territory and their cultural \n     identity in accordance with their own spiritual and \n     traditional beliefs, customs, practices, language, and social \n     institutions.\n       ``(21) The State of Hawai`i, in the constitution and \n     statutes of the State of Hawai`i--\n       ``(A) reaffirms and protects the unique right of the Native \n     Hawaiian people to practice and perpetuate their culture and \n     religious customs, beliefs, practices, and language;\n       ``(B) recognizes the traditional language of the Native \n     Hawaiian people as an official language of the State of \n     Hawai`i, which may be used as the language of instruction for \n     all subjects and grades in the public school system; and\n       ``(C) promotes the study of the Hawaiian culture, language, \n     and history by providing a Hawaiian education program and \n     using community expertise as a suitable and essential means \n     to further the program.\n\n     ``SEC. 7203.

Native performance on \n     standardized tests is low, Native student dropout rates are \n     high, and Natives are significantly underrepresented among \n     holders of baccalaureate degrees in the State of Alaska. As a \n     result, Native students are being denied their opportunity to \n     become full participants in society by grade school and high \n     school educations that are condemning an entire generation to \n     an underclass status and a life of limited choices.\n       ``(5) The programs authorized in this title, combined with \n     expanded Head Start, infant learning and early childhood \n     education programs, and parent education programs are \n     essential if educational handicaps are to be overcome.\n       ``(6) The sheer magnitude of the geographic barriers to be \n     overcome in delivering educational services in rural Alaska \n     and Alaska villages should be addressed through the \n     development and implementation of innovative, model programs \n     in a variety of areas.\n       ``(7) Congress finds that Native children should be \n     afforded the opportunity to begin their formal education on a \n     par with their non-Native peers.

HELPING CHILDREN SUCCEED BY FULLY FUNDING THE \n                   INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT \n                   (IDEA).\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) All children deserve a quality education.\n       (2) In Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children vs. \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (334 F. Supp. 1247)(E. Dist. Pa. \n     1971), and Mills vs. Board of Education of the District of \n     Columbia (348 F. Supp. 866)(Dist. D.C. 1972), the courts \n     found that children with disabilities are entitled to an \n     equal opportunity to an education under the 14th amendment of \n     the Constitution.\n       (3) In 1975, Congress passed what is now known as the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (referred to in \n     this section as ``IDEA'') (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) to help \n     States provide all children with disabilities a free, \n     appropriate public education in the least restrictive \n     environment. At full funding, Congress contributes 40 percent \n     of the average per pupil expenditure for each child with a \n     disability served.\n       (4) Before 1975, only \\1/5\\ of the children with \n     disabilities received a formal education. At that time, many \n     States had laws that specifically excluded many children with \n     disabilities, including children who were blind, deaf, or \n     emotionally disturbed, from receiving such an education.\n       (5) IDEA currently serves an estimated 200,000 infants and \n     toddlers, 600,000 preschoolers, and 5,400,000 children 6 to \n     21 years of age.\n       (6) IDEA enables children with disabilities to be educated \n     in their communities, and thus, has assisted in dramatically \n     reducing the number of children with disabilities who must \n     live in State institutions away from their families.\n       (7) The number of children with disabilities who complete \n     high school has grown significantly since the enactment of \n     IDEA.\n       (8) The number of children with disabilities who enroll in \n     college as freshmen has more than tripled since the enactment \n     of IDEA.\n       (9) The overall effectiveness of IDEA depends upon well \n     trained special education\n\n[[Page S4367]]\n\n     and general education teachers, related services personnel, \n     and other school personnel. Congress recognizes concerns \n     about the nationwide shortage of personnel serving students \n     with disabilities and the need for improvement in the \n     qualifications of such personnel.\n       (10) IDEA has raised the Nation's awareness about the \n     abilities and capabilities of children with disabilities.\n       (11) Improvements to IDEA in the 1997 amendments increased \n     the academic achievement of children with disabilities and \n     helped them to lead productive, independent lives.\n       (12) Changes made in 1997 also addressed the needs of those \n     children whose behavior impedes learning by implementing \n     behavioral assessments and intervention strategies to ensure \n     that they receive appropriate supports in order to receive a \n     quality education.\n       (13) IDEA requires a full partnership between parents of \n     children with disabilities and education professionals in the \n     design and implementation of the educational services \n     provided to children with disabilities.\n       (14) While the Federal Government has more than doubled \n     funding for part B of IDEA since 1995, the Federal Government \n     has never provided more than 15 percent of the maximum State \n     grant allocation for educating children with disabilities.\n       (15) By fully funding IDEA, Congress will strengthen the \n     ability of States and localities to implement the \n     requirements of IDEA.\n       (b) Local Educational Agency Eligibility.--Clauses (i) and \n     (ii) of section 613(a)(2)(C) of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1413(a)(2)(C)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(i) Notwithstanding clauses (ii) and (iii) of \n     subparagraph (A), for any fiscal year for which amounts \n     appropriated to carry out section 611 exceeds $4,100,000,000, \n     a local educational agency may treat as local funds, for the \n     purpose of such clauses, up to 55 percent of the amount of \n     funds it receives under this part that exceeds the amount it \n     received under this part for fiscal year 2001, except where a \n     local educational agency shows that it is meeting the \n     requirements of this part, the local educational agency may \n     petition the State to waive, in whole or in part, the 55 \n     percent cap under this clause.\n       ``(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), if the Secretary \n     determines that a local educational agency is not meeting the \n     requirements of this part, the Secretary may prohibit the \n     local educational agency from treating funds received under \n     this part as local funds under clause (i) for any fiscal \n     year, and may redirect the use of those funds to other \n     educational programs within the local educational agency.''.\n       (c) Funding.--Section 611(j) of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411(j)) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(j) Funding.--For the purpose of carrying out this part, \n     other than section 619, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated, and there are appropriated--\n       ``(1) $8,823,685,000 for fiscal year 2002;\n       ``(2) $11,323,685,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       ``(3) $13,823,685,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       ``(4) $16,323,685,000 for fiscal year 2005;\n       ``(5) $18,823,685,000 for fiscal year 2006;\n       ``(6) $21,067,600,000 for fiscal year 2007;\n       ``(7) $21,742,019,000 for fiscal year 2008;\n       ``(8) $22,423,068,000 for fiscal year 2009;\n       ``(9) $23,095,622,000 for fiscal year 2010; and\n       ``(10) $23,751,456,000 for fiscal year 2011.''.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 361.

Abell on the occasion of his confirmation by the Senate \nas Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force\n\n[[Page S4373]]\n\nManagement Policy. I have had the great pleasure and distinct honor to \nwork with Charlie Abell for the past 8 years, during his service as a \nprofessional staff member on the Senate Armed Services Committee. While \nwe are all extremely proud of him, it is difficult to see him go.\n  Charlie Abell began his service to country with a distinguished 26-\nyear career in the U.S. Army. Charlie enlisted in the Army in 1966, and \nretired as a lieutenant colonel in 1992. During his military career, he \nserved as both an infantry officer as well as a Cobra attack helicopter \npilot. He was a highly decorated officer who led an infantry platoon, \nan infantry company, and attack helicopter units during two combat \ntours in Vietnam. Charlie has always been at the ``scene of action.''\n  Mr. Abell's decorations include the Legion of Merit, four Meritorious \nService Medals, the Purple Heart, two bronze stars for Valor, 14 Air \nMedals, two for valor, the Army Commendation Medal for valor and the \nCombat Infantryman's Badge.\n  Following his successful Army career, Charlie joined the Senate Armed \nServices Committee staff. He has been a most valued member of our \n``team''. Charlie has been the lead staff member for the Personnel \nSubcommittee for the past eight years, and has been responsible for a \nwide range of issues concerning military personnel and quality of life. \nHis expertise and counsel have been invaluable to the members of the \nArmed Services Committee--and indeed the Senate as a whole--as we have \nworked over the past several years to reform the military retirement \nsystem, enhance military pay, improve the military health care system, \nand honor our commitment to all military retirees to provide health \ncare for life. Charlie's achievements with our Committee have truly \ntouched the lives of all members of the military services--Active Duty, \nReserve Components and retirees--and their families as well. I offer my \nsincere gratitude for his outstanding work in these endeavors on behalf \nof myself and all of the members and staff of the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n\n  Today, Charlie Abell was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve in the \nposition of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy. \nWhile it is difficult for us to lose such a valuable member of our \ncommittee staff, we are all very proud of Charlie and know that he will \nbe a very important addition to Secretary Rumfeld's staff. We will miss \nhis professionalism, his depth of knowledge, his humility, and most of \nall his friendship.
