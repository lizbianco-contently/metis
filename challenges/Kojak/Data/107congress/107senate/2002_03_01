Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I yield whatever time the Senator from \nOregon may need.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I commend the Senator from Connecticut, \nwho has just done yeoman work on what I think is a critical question; \nthat is, finding common ground and the bipartisanship that is needed to \npass this election reform bill.\n  I think the Senate has a clear choice this morning. A vote for \ncloture strengthens this Nation's greatest freedom--the right to vote. \nA vote against cloture weakens that freedom and it weakens a freedom \nthat is critical for this country and leaves that freedom unprotected.\n  I believe this morning's vote is a choice between affirming the \npioneering spirit of this country--the spirit that led my State of \nOregon to champion new voting reforms, such as vote by mail, motor \nvoter laws--and stamping out that spirit with what could end up to be \nrepressive antivoting rules.\n  So the choice is between election reform and gridlock. I want to be \nfair with the Senator from Connecticut and we are going to continue to \nwork nonstop, relentlessly, to find a bipartisan approach to this \nissue. We want to blaze a real trail in meaningful election reform and \nget this bill on the President's desk.\n  So I urge my colleagues on both sides to continue to work on this \ncritical effort, to join the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator \nfrom Kentucky in an effort to get a bipartisan solution.\n  I don't want to see this bill derailed. S. 565 is the vehicle that \ncan enfranchise the thousands, perhaps millions of voters who will cast \ntheir ballots in every election. But we also need to make sure that \nthere is a fix to S. 565. The photo identification requirement, in my \nview, would disenfranchise millions of first-time voters by requiring \nidentifying documents to be presented along with their vote--not their \nregistration, but their vote--before that vote could be counted. This \nwould have applied to first-time voters even if they had cast ballots \nfor 50 years in a jurisdiction and then moved down the street to \nanother.\n  The amendment approved by the Senate allows the signature \nverification system used by 27 States and the District of Columbia as \none option for identifying first-time voters. The amendment I drafted \nwith the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, protected successful vote-\nby-mail systems such as the one in my home State and ensured that \nAmericans who may not have access to driver's licenses, bank accounts, \nand utility bills would still have access to democracy.\n  There doesn't seem to be any point to rehashing the Schumer-Wyden \namendment this morning. A majority of this body acknowledged that \nallowing signature verification would protect the voting rights of 24 \nmillion seniors in this country who disproportionately vote by absentee \nand mail-in ballot.\n  The majority of this body agreed with the eloquent assertion of the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights that ``requiring voters to \npresent photo ID or other documentation when voting in person or by \nmail results in discrimination''--that it ``would undermine successful \nvote by mail programs--such as Oregon's . . . and . . . make voting \nmore difficult for millions of elderly and disabled Americans.''\n  A majority of this body refused to overturn the will of Oregon voters \nand scores of others across this country. In my home State, 70 percent \nchose to institute a vote-by-mail system based on signature \nverification, a vote-by-mail system that has boosted turnout to record \nlevels--without deterring voting.\n  A majority of this body refused to return to the bad old days when \nonly Americans who were already enfranchised could be assured that \ntheir vote could be cast and counted.\n  Most importantly, a majority of this body recognized that being tough \non fraud doesn't have to make it tougher to vote. Since approval of our \namendment, I have worked with Senator Schumer, Senators Dodd, Bond, and \nMcConnell to continue to find a way to meet our colleagues halfway. I \nhave said that I think the framework for a compromise is to strengthen \nantifraud measures at the front end of the process, when people \nregister and when you do the most good in terms of deterring fraud. I \nthink tougher identification standards at that point in the \nregistration--something the Senator from Missouri has felt strongly \nabout--makes sense and I want to see that happen.\n  I believe compromise is possible, that we can, on a bipartisan basis, \ncome together, put the voting rights of Americans first, whether they \nvote by mail or in person, and find ways to stop fraud without putting \nup roadblocks to democracy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a number of editorials and letters \nprinted in the Record supporting the amendment that I and Senator \nSchumer authored.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n Senate Democrats Aim for Compromises To Save Bill Overhauling Voting \n                                 System\n\n                           (By David Rogers)\n\n       Washington.--In a last ditch effort to save election-law \n     overhaul legislation, Senate Democrats will seek to \n     compromise on Republican demands for provisions to prevent \n     voter fraud, despite protests from civil-rights and Hispanic \n     groups.\n       At issue is a proposal to require people who register by \n     mail to present photo identification or other documentation \n     when they first vote in a jurisdiction. Democrats won a 51-46 \n     roll call Wednesday to ease the proposed rules, but the \n     outcome so angered some Republicans that the entire bill was \n     put in jeopardy by a threatened filibuster.\n       After hours of sometimes tempestuous discussions with \n     civil-rights groups, Senate Rules Committee Chairman \n     Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) said last night that he is \n     prepared to give ground to the GOP in hope of completing \n     debate and moving to the next step: negotiations with the \n     House and the Bush Administration. Talks continued into the \n     evening with Republican staff in hopes an agreement can be \n     taken to the full Senate this morning.\n       As outlined by Mr. Dodd, tougher voter-ID requirements \n     would be preserved under the compromise. But the effective \n     date would be delayed until 2004, when the bill also requires \n     states to take steps to better protect the rights of voters \n     who may be challenged at the polls.\n       The most important of those so-called insurance provisions \n     is the requirement that all states adopt provisional-voting \n     systems for people who claim to be eligible, but aren't on \n     the official registration list. Rather than be turned away \n     outright, an individual in this case would be given a \n     provisional ballot so that if his or her claim is later \n     verified, the vote would be counted.\n       Minority lawmakers and civil-rights groups were themselves \n     sometimes divided. At one juncture, Rep. Corrine Brown, an \n     African-American Democrat, delivered an emotional appeal for \n     the bill, given the balloting problems in her own state of \n     Florida during the 2000 election.\n       Rep. Silvestre Reyes (D., Texas), chairman of the House \n     Hispanic Caucus, lent crucial support to Mr. Dodd's decision, \n     which ran in the face of opposition from groups such as the \n     Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n       Mr. Reyes said the voter-ID provisions are the most \n     difficult for Hispanics because many lack photo \n     identification and don't have easy access to substitute \n     documents. For example, the bill would allow a voter to use \n     his or her utility bill as a form of identification. But Mr. \n     Reyes said that since many Hispanics live together as \n     extended families, not all household members would have a \n     utility bill in their name.\n       Under the bill, the federal government would for the first \n     time provide funding--$3.5 billion over five years under the \n     Senate version--to help states and localities buy new voting \n     equipment and address such problems as occurred in Florida.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              American Association\n\n\n                                           of Retired Persons,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 12, 2002.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to express our firm support \n     for the bipartisan election reform legislation (S. 565 \n     substitute) that you jointly cosponsored with Senators Dodd, \n     McConnell, Durbin, Bond, Toricelli, McCain, Schumer and \n     Brownback. AARP urges you to support passage of the bill. \n     While the S. 565\n\n[[Page S1381]]\n\n     substitute can be improved, it contains the critical building \n     blocks to reform and enhance the nation's voting system. \n     Enactment of S. 565 should minimize the likelihood of a \n     recurrence of the problems that plagued the Presidential \n     Election of 2000.\n       We support the Dodd/McConnell substitute because it \n     addresses the following core AARP concerns: Enhancement of \n     civil rights protections; improved registration & balloting \n     technology; improved elections administrative procedures; and \n     provision of Federal funds to encourage state & local \n     reforms.\n       Equally important, Dodd/McConnell establishes minimum \n     standards of accountability and enforcement.\n       The bill includes measures critical to older persons, \n     people with disabilities, and minority populations, such as: \n     The ability to verify that their ballots actually reflect \n     their voting preferences; enhanced access to registration \n     opportunities, polling places, and user-friendly equipment; \n     fail-safe provisional ballots to avoid erroneous voter \n     denials; centralized, statewide registration lists to assist \n     in voter confirmation; and funds for better election \n     administration, including voting equipment upgrades, poll \n     site access enhancement and poll worker training.\n       At the same time, some of the antifraud provisions in Dodd/\n     McConnell need modification in order to assure existing civil \n     rights protections and reduce technical loopholes that might \n     discourage or intimidate potential voters. The bill's photo \n     ID requirements are particularly problematic. Alternative \n     approaches such as signature match and verification, already \n     successfully used by many states, could enhance the anti-\n     fraud provisions without having a chilling effect on voter \n     participation. We strongly urge you to support both the \n     Manager's amendment and a floor amendment that would correct \n     these shortcomings in an otherwise strong, balanced and \n     comprehensive election reform bill.\n       We appreciate your support in making these reforms in our \n     elections process a reality. AARP look forward to working \n     with the Senate to further our most basic right as citizens--\n     the vote.

Unless Section 103(b) is fixed, the NHLA will \n     urge you to oppose the bill.\n       NHLA supports many of the bill's provisions, particularly \n     those provisions which set national minimum standards \n     regarding voting systems, provisional balloting, and \n     statewide registration lists. While some states already have \n     laws in these areas, too many states do not. It is time that \n     Congress step in and set some basic standards that ensure \n     that voting is more accessible to all eligible voters no \n     matter in which state they live. Voting is the cornerstone of \n     our democracy. By voting in favor of these provisions, you \n     are voting in favor of an inclusive democracy.\n       NHLA vigorously opposes Section 103(b) of the bill, which \n     would require voters who register and vote for the first time \n     in a jurisdiction to produce either a photo ID or one of only \n     five limited documents either in person or by including a \n     copy with their ballot. Latino voters are likely to be \n     subject to this provision frequently since we move often, \n     have a significant number of youth turning 18, and have a \n     high number of new citizens. Also, Latino voters are less \n     likely to have the documents required. A Massachusetts \n     federal court recently struck down a requirement similar to \n     the provision in the bill because it would have a \n     discriminatory impact on Hispanic voters under the Voting \n     rights Act (VRA). The Justice Department has also opposed \n     similar measures under the VRA.\n       We are truly befuddled as to why the Senate would want to \n     take steps to disenfranchise Hispanic voters at this time. \n     The 2000 Census showed the demographic power of the Latino \n     community, and the 2000 and 2001 election cycles demonstrated \n     that our demographic force is converting into a political \n     force. Also, the trends and polls indicate that Hispanic \n     voters are more open to voting for the best candidate to \n     represent them, regardless of party affiliation. At at time \n     when both parties are reaching out to this growing \n     electorate, it is the wrong time to adopt a measure that \n     would make it harder to vote.\n       We urge you to vote for an amendment to either strike \n     Section 103(b) or fix it by adding in the alternatives of \n     collecting signatures that can be verified or collecting an \n     attestation. We will score the vote on the amendment in our \n     NHLA congressional scorecard. If the provision is not fixed, \n     we urge you to oppose the bill, and we will score the vote on \n     the final passage of the bill.\n\n       Moises Perez, Exec.

The legislation will be offered \n     as a substitute to S. 565. While the substitute is not \n     perfect, it contains the key elements needed to improve our \n     nation's election systems.\n       The 2000 election demonstrated that basic reforms are \n     needed at the federal, state and local levels to protect \n     voters and to improve election administration. It is also \n     clear that it is time for the federal government to pay its \n     fair share of the costs of administering federal elections.\n       The Dodd-McConnell substitute provides for basic national \n     standards in vital, but limited, areas. It provides \n     substantial federal funds for election reform efforts. And it \n     provides a blueprint on which federal, state and local \n     efforts can be built.\n       To protect voters and improve administration, the \n     substitute provides for minimum national standards in three \n     areas. First, voting systems standards will assure that \n     voters can verify and correct their ballots, as well as be \n     notified of overvotes. These standards also protect against \n     high voting machine error rates and enhance access for \n     persons with disabilities. Second, a national standard will \n     assure that voters can receive provisional ballots. This \n     fail-safe system means that if a voter's name is not found on \n     the registration list at the polls, or if other problems \n     occur, the voter can still cast a ballot that will be counted \n     if the voter's eligibility is confirmed. Third, statewide \n     computerized voter registration lists will be required. This \n     facilitates removal of duplicate registration across \n     jurisdictions, provides greater assurance that names will be \n     on the rolls, and streamlines administration while combating \n     possible fraud.\n       The substitute provides funding through state grants \n     programs that will be developed with public involvement. \n     Funds are provided not only for meeting standards, but also \n     for other vital areas of election administration, including \n     poll worker training and providing access to the polls for \n     persons with disabilities. The substitute sets up a new \n     federal commission that can provide effective guidance, while \n     Justice Department enforcement of voter protection laws, such \n     as the Voting Rights Act, is maintained.\n       While the substitute is a strong bill, it contains a photo \n     ID requirement that will result in discrimination and create \n     real administrative problems at polling places. Though the \n     requirement is described as an anti-fraud device, effective \n     alternatives exist to meet anti-fraud objectives that will \n     not undermine voter participation through absentee balloting \n     by persons with disabilities, seniors and others. We strongly \n     urge you to correct this provision. We are also concerned \n     that the so-called ``safe harbor'' provisions of the bill \n     will have unintended, deleterious consequences.\n       The League of Women Voters believes that the Senate must \n     act expeditiously on this important topic. We urge you to \n     move ahead with the Dodd-McConnell substitute, which is \n     clearly preferable to the House-passed bill in setting a \n     workable structure for reform and creating an effective \n     election commission.\n       America deserves an election system that will protect the \n     most basic and precious right of all citizens in a \n     democracy--the right to vote. Each citizen's right to vote, \n     and to have that vote fairly counted, is at state.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 1, 2002]\n\n                            Fixing the Vote\n\n       Last December Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) helped broker a \n     bipartisan election reform bill in the Senate; ``this is a \n     bill that\n\n[[Page S1382]]\n\n     works, this is a bill that can pass,'' he said. Now Mr. \n     Schumer has proposed an amendment to that bill, and \n     Republicans say he is damaging the chances of a post-Florida \n     fix for the nation's creaky voting system. But the truth is \n     that the Schumer amendment would improve the bill. \n     Republicans should contain their sense of betrayal and \n     support the measure in the procedural vote scheduled for \n     today. The electoral system will be the better for it.\n       The Schumer amendment fixes an anti-fraud provision in the \n     election bill. The provision says that new voters, including \n     those who have moved to a different county, must verify their \n     identity by showing a photo ID, a utility bill or some other \n     official document with their address on it. This provision \n     may have the good effect of preventing some fraud. But it \n     also may disqualify voters with no driver's license and no \n     utility bills in their own name--and this group of \n     potentially disqualified voters is much bigger than the \n     likely number of fraudulent ballots.\n       Some 3 million disabled people are thought not to have \n     driver's licenses or other qualifying picture IDs, and many \n     of them may live in homes where the utility bills go to some \n     other member of the household. Poor people without cars and \n     settled homes may be disenfranchised too. The anti-fraud \n     provision also threatens the vote-by-mail systems in Oregon, \n     Washington and Colorado. It would require voters to photocopy \n     proof of identity and send it in along with the ballot. But \n     some voters live out of convenient range of photocopiers. \n     Others may be put off by the sheer hassle.\n       The Schumer amendment would fix this danger by allowing \n     states to accept other types of proof of identity--for \n     example, a signature. It would also impose the identity \n     requirement on fewer people--only new voters and those who \n     have moved across state lines, and not those who have just \n     changed counties. This is a good amendment that would \n     significantly cut the risk of disqualifying eligible voters \n     while only marginally increasing the risk of fraud. The \n     Senate should adopt it, and then proceed quickly to pass the \n     election reform bill. The 2000 contest demonstrated that \n     hundreds of thousands of voters are deprived of their rights \n     by a system that is broken. It is past time to fix it.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I do believe that a vote for cloture \nstrengthens this country's greatest freedom--the right to vote--and a \nvote against cloture leaves that freedom unprotected. A vote for \ncloture is a vote for the millions of seniors in American nursing homes \nwho need to vote by mail and don't want new barriers to have their \nvotes counted and assured. Their generation saved this democracy and \nthey deserve to participate in it.\n  A vote for cloture is a vote for working families who use the vote-\nby-mail system in my State and others as a way to have their voices \nheard as they live the hectic lives that often present challenges to \ntheir getting to the polls. This morning, I urge my colleagues to \naffirm America's most precious right--the right of every citizen to \nvote and to have that vote count. I want to wrap up--particularly since \nmy good friend from Pennsylvania is in the Chamber--by reemphasizing my \ndesire to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nSenator Bond and Senator McConnell. I have strong views about this \nissue. We want to work with our colleagues and talk about whether those \non the other side of the aisle want a bill. I have stuck up for my \ncolleagues. I think they want a bill and I want to make it clear that I \nthink Senators Bond and McConnell are working very hard with us to try \nto find the common ground. I hope we can get there, and I believe \ncloture will help advance that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I yield to my friend for a question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator. My \nquestion relates to the provisions of the underlying bill, as I \nunderstand it, providing that a voter may establish identity by either \nphoto identification, a bank statement, utility bill, paycheck, \ngovernment check, or any other check, or any other government document \nwhich shows the name and address. Is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. WYDEN. My colleague is right. It is the basic proposition that \nthere are a number of systems by which we can address this concern. \nThere is a reason that groups such as AARP still believe that, even \nwith the measure the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania has \noutlined, the legislation without the Schumer-Wyden amendment still \ncreates barriers. We have people in vote-by-mail systems--seniors, the \ndisabled--who find it awfully hard, physically, to get about and locate \nthe kind of documents the Senator is talking about.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The further question is: The amendment offered by the \nSenator from Oregon and the Senator from New York would put in the \ndisjunctive one other way of establishing identity and that is, by \nsignature alone--is that correct?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Of course, in my home State of Oregon, what we have tried \nto do is to have a tough system at the front end. But, yes, when you \nsign your ballot and mail it in, and there is a statement about the \ntough criminal penalties that are involved in falsification there, we \nprosecute people in the State of Oregon. You can send your ballot in by \nsigning it, and that is then checked against the original \nsignature. That is how it takes place in my home State.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, a further question I have of the \nSenator from Oregon is: How do you prosecute someone where there is a \nregistration by signature and then subsequent voting by signature?\n  By way of background, I have had considerable experience in \nprosecuting vote fraud cases, having been in the Philadelphia district \nattorney's office for 12 years, 4 as assistant and 8 as district \nattorney. Philadelphia is a rough town with political corruption, and I \nhave prosecuted both Democrats and Republicans.\n  When you talk about a signature alone, having been registered with \nthe signature and then a signature comes in, there is no way to find \nthat person. The difficulty is that it may be a dead person. Graveyard \nvoting is very popular in Philadelphia--voting people who have died. It \nis also very popular to have people registered by signature who were \nnever in existence.\n  I ask my colleague from Oregon, how can you conduct a prosecution--I \ncould never figure out how to--how can you conduct a prosecution, if \nyou have a registration by signature and then you have a signature come \nin on the card? You cannot find the person. To have a prosecution, you \nhave to have a defendant, you have to have a warrant of arrest \nidentifying somebody, and you have to pick somebody up. How can there \npossibly be a prosecution for someone who sends in a signature of \nsomebody who never existed?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, \nthere have been a number of prosecutions. They, obviously, as my \ncolleague knows from his prosecutorial days, play out in a variety of \nways.\n  For example, I know of an instance where the person was out bragging \nthat they had skirted the law, they were evading the law, and when the \nprosecutors learned about it, they came down very hard.\n  The point is--and my colleague makes a good point with respect to how \nthese systems may work in Pennsylvania--Senator Smith, my friend and \ncolleague, and I had a Senate special election. We generated three \ntimes the level of voter participation than we saw in the previous \nSenate special election. I won by a grand total of 18,220 votes after \nmore than 1 million were cast.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Any braggarts among those?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, to my colleague's great credit, he did \nnot assert there was any fraud. We prosecute aggressively in the State \nof Oregon.\n  I see my colleague from Missouri is in the Chamber, and I want him to \nbe assured, however this vote turns out this morning, we are going to \ncontinue to work relentlessly for a bipartisan compromise.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, how many minutes remain on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twelve and a half minutes remain.\n\n[[Page S1383]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. I will be happy to yield 3 minutes to my colleague from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I increase my request to 6 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. We will offer 2\\1/2\\ minutes. I am pleased to yield 3 \nminutes to my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I engaged in a colloquy with the \nSenator from Oregon to show we really cannot prosecute anyone \nsuccessfully on this signature arrangement. You register by signature, \nnobody ever sees the person, and you vote by the signature. The person \ncould be dead or never in existence.\n  On the one case the Senator from Oregon cites of the braggart case, \nif somebody admits it, you can prosecute anybody if you are going to \nhave confessions. But, that is not the way criminal law cases arise. In \nthe 12 years I was in the district attorney's office, I never saw \nsomebody who came in and confessed to having committed vote fraud. To \nprosecute those cases, you have to have evidence and there is no \nrealistic way to obtain it.\n  I was listening to the majority leader, Senator Daschle, on the radio \nthis morning on a playback of a news conference he had yesterday in \nwhich he said that the position staked out by Senator Bond requiring \nphoto identification was just too difficult, referring to people in his \nown State.\n  But the fact of the matter is, the underlying bill which was worked \nout in the compromise does not require photo identification. Photo \nidentification is one way. There could be a bank statement, a utility \nbill, a paycheck, a government check, or any other government document \nshowing an address, showing a person is in existence. If the underlying \nbill required a photo identification, I would say that is too \ndifficult. There are many other ways to establish that the person \nactually is in existence, but the signature simply does not accomplish \nthat.\n  Nobody has a better record than I on voting rights. In my 22 years in \nthe Senate, I have pushed that consistently. Against many in my party, \nI have supported motor voter. I want to see the ballot as widespread as \npossible, but people who want to make it easy to register with motor \nvoter are going to lose it, if there is not some realistic way to \nprevent fraud.\n  Frankly, I do not like to see filibusters, but we are on a very basic \nproposition as to whether we can have widespread fraud without any way \nto identify whether the person is in existence or not. I think the \nSchumer-Wyden amendment simply cannot be accepted.\n  If there are overtones that the bill is going to be pulled if this \namendment is not accepted, it seems to me that very frequently--I ask \nfor an additional 25 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. I will be happy to yield half a minute to my colleague from \nPennsylvania.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Any suggestion that the whole bill is going to go down \nover this amendment--the Democrats control the Rules Committee; they \nhave a majority. They have come out with a bill which they have \ncontrolled, and that bill ought to be enacted if this amendment cannot \nsurvive a cloture vote.\n  I thank my colleague from Missouri, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his excellent work on this \nbill. As a former prosecutor in a State that has not been a stranger to \nvote fraud, he knows how difficult it is, and he has made a very \ncompelling case for our efforts to eliminate fraud in this bill.\n  We have had an interesting dueling set of editorials today that have \ncome out in some of the papers on the east coast. We do not read a lot \nof them in Missouri, but the Washington Post is the one that did not \nget it. The Washington Post said:\n\n       Republicans should contain their sense of betrayal and \n     support the measure.\n\n  They go on to say that without the Schumer amendment, it would \ndisqualify a number of voters.\n  No. 1, Madam President, sense of betrayal counts for something here \nand counts for something back home. It may not matter to editorial \nboard writers within the beltway, but when we make a deal, as we made a \ndeal, a bipartisan deal after accommodations on both sides, I expect \nthat people will stay with that deal.\n  Somebody said: You made a deal, but now we want you to start \nnegotiating again. I said: Wait a minute, we do not work that way.\n  We came in good faith to an agreement, and we agreed with the \nproposition that we ought to make sure everybody who is eligible to \nvote is registered and can vote.\n  The Washington Post just flat gets it wrong when it says there are \ngoing to be people who cannot qualify. Ninety percent of adult \nAmericans have a driver's license. You have to show identification to \nget on a plane, to rent a video, to buy cigarettes.\n  Why can't you have some minimal identification to assure that you are \na live human being entitled to vote, and entitled to vote only once in \nevery important election?\n  Well, we have agreed that with the money we are providing to States, \nif somebody does not have a photo identification, a driver's license, a \ngovernment check, a bank account, a utility bill, a pay stub, we are \nproviding the money for the States to issue an election card.\n  We are worried about all the people in nursing homes. No. 1, \neverybody who is registered is going to stay registered. The Senator \nfrom New York pointed out the problems they had with crowded rolls. We \ndo need to work on purging. I voted against the amendment by my \ncolleague from Montana; he wanted to make it easier to purge no longer \nactive voters from the rolls. I think it was a good idea, but because \nwe had a deal, I voted against his amendment. We are, as the Senator \nfrom New York pointed out, going to have to clean it up.\n  Incidentally, speaking of the Senator from New York, he assured us \nyesterday--and I am glad to see he is in the Chamber --there was no \nfraud in New York. Well, I do not know anything about New York, but the \nWall Street Journal this morning points out the doubledippers sign up \nto vote in New York and Florida, and they report that an investigation \nturned up 286 individuals who voted both in New York City and in \nFlorida last November in the 2000 election. Since you can figure that \nNew York City voters generally vote 3 to 1 Democratic, that means at \nleast 140 fraudulent votes for the Gore-Lieberman ticket in Florida.\n  One other thing. Somebody gave me a copy of the New York Daily News: \nDouble Take in Ballot Probe. Voters With Same Name and Birthday Expose \nNew York System.\n\n       Seventy-five voters with the same name and same date of \n     birth registered to vote in Brooklyn and either Rockland or \n     Orange Counties. Fourteen actually voted in more than one \n     county, sometimes in the same election.\n\n  It describes how the double voting and the double registration occurs \nin some areas with heavy Democratic votes. So there are some problems, \nbut frankly we do not have time to go into it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \n1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Three minutes fourteen seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Daily \nNews article, the Wall Street Journal editorial, the Washington Post \neditorial, and a New York Times editorial which says Americans should \nbe willing to verify their identity in order to exercise the right to \nvote, and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch article on the famous dog Ritzy \nMekler, whose owner says she, Ritzy, does not want any other dogs \nvoting, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 From the Washington Post, Mar. 1, 2002\n\n                            Fixing the Vote\n\n       Last December Sen.

Some registered to vote in one county then voted in \n     another.\n       The Daily News reported yesterday that during the last \n     election, there was evidence of similar voting irregularities \n     in the Rockland County Hasidic community of New Square. That \n     contributed to an overwhelming 1,400-to-12 New Square vote \n     for Sen. Hillary Clinton that is now under investigation by \n     federal prosecutors.\n       But the irregularities appear to extend beyond New Square \n     into other Hasidic communities in Brooklyn's Williamsburg, \n     Rockland County's Monsey and Orange County's Monroe.\n       The New found that in New York it's easy to pull off double \n     voting because--unlike many other states--New York has no \n     nationwide system for registering voters.\n       Each country has a separate registration system, and no one \n     checks to see if a voter is registered and voting in two \n     spots.\n       ``There is no computer link. Some of the upstate counties \n     aren't even on computer,'' said Steven Richman, general \n     counsel to the New York City Board of Elections.\n       For instance, Jacob Fligman, whose birthday is July 29, \n     1953, voted in the general election of 1998 in both Brooklyn \n     and Monsey. He also voted in November in Monsey, but this \n     week he was found at his apartment in Brooklyn.\n       In all, seven men voted in elections in both Brooklyn and \n     Rockland County throughout the 1990s, raising questions about \n     whether they properly voted in November's election.\n       Israel Reich voted in Brooklyn in 1997 and 1998, and this \n     week he was found at his apartment on Wythe Ave. in \n     Williamsburg. He voted in Monsey in November.\n       Chaim Pinkasovits voted in November in Monsey, though his \n     name was listed this week on a mailbox at his apartment on \n     Hooper St. in Brooklyn's Williamsburg.\n       Jacob Weber voted in the November election in Monsey, but \n     last week a neighbor said he lived in an apartment on Heyward \n     St. in Williamsburg.\n       New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer has called for a \n     statewide voter registration system that would make it easier \n     for voters to register, but also ``enable election officials \n     to curb election fraud.''\n       Spitzer's report, issued in February, specifically noted \n     state wide registration would ``curb multiple voting.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 1, 2002]\n\n                        Vote for Voting Reforms\n\n       All week, partisan wrangling over the question of \n     preventing electoral fraud threatened to kill the Senate's \n     sensible election reform bill, though a compromise seemed \n     within reach late yesterday. Differences over the fraud issue \n     do not justify scuttling the overall bill, the product of \n     year-long, painstaking negotiations. The resulting bipartisan \n     legislation goes a long way toward curing the deficiencies in \n     the nation's balloting process that became manifest in the \n     2000 presidential election. Senate leaders must ensure that \n     the vote on electoral reform proceeds, and should encourage \n     members to support it overwhelmingly.\n       The legislation establishes federal standards for voting \n     procedures and technologies that state and local election \n     officials would have to meet when administering national \n     elections, and it provides $3.5 billion over five years to \n     pay for the upgrade. The bill forces states to meet federally \n     mandated error rates for their voting equipment, provide \n     provisional ballots when someone's eligibility is questioned \n     at the polls and allow people an opportunity to correct \n     improperly marked ballots. The bill's anti-fraud provisions \n     were necessary to gain key Republican support late last year \n     for such a forceful federal intrusion into the states' \n     traditional prerogative of running elections. When Senators \n     Charles Schumer and Ron Wyden, both Democrats, offered a \n     last-minute amendment to remove the bill's requirement for \n     first-time voters who register by mail to identify themselves \n     at the polls, the measure's Republican sponsors, Christopher \n     Bond and Mitch McConnell, felt their Democratic colleagues \n     were reneging on the deal, and they threatened to filibuster \n     the legislation.\n       Both sides would be foolish to allow the fight over this \n     amendment to kill the legislation. Republicans should know \n     that forcing states to maintain computerized statewide voter \n     lists, a key item in the bill, does more than the disputed \n     provision itself to combat fraud, eliminating as it does \n     duplicate registrations in several counties.\n       The Schumer-Wyden amendment was strongly supported by a \n     coalition of civil rights groups that say the burden of \n     having to produce a photo identification card or an \n     alternative proof of identity, like a utility bill, \n     disproportionately hurts minority voters, recent immigrants, \n     students and people with disabilities. Their legitimate \n     concerns must be balanced against the need to safeguard the \n     integrity of the process.\n       Americans should be willing to verify their identity in \n     order to exercise their right to vote. Senators Schumer and \n     Wyden are wisely seeking an accommodation with Republicans, \n     even if it means leaving much of the original provision \n     intact. The Senate must move ahead now and pass this needed \n     reform.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 1, 2002]\n\n                           Should Dogs Vote?\n\n       Dogs and dead people don't have a constitutional right to \n     vote, but more of them are going to start turning up at the \n     polls if Senate Democrats, led by New York's Charles Schumer, \n     have their way.\n       It wasn't supposed to come to this. Following the Florida \n     2000 debacle both parties were eager to fix the system. The \n     House did its part by passing a bipartisan bill last year. \n     And then in December, after months of negotiations, Senator \n     Christopher Bond (R., Mo.) and Mr. Schumer announced that the \n     Senate, too, had reached a compromise. Their bill, said Mr. \n     Schumer, would allot $3.5 billion for states and localities \n     to upgrade voting systems, improve registration procedures \n     and educate voters about ballots.\n       It would also target voter fraud, which has been on the \n     increase since the 1993 Motor Voter Law allowed people to \n     register to vote while applying for a driver's license. \n     Unfortunately, some 95% of Motor Voter registrants don't \n     vote, but their names are available for political operatives \n     and others to misuse. A St. Louis dog once registered. The \n     Senate bill requires those who register by mail and are \n     voting for the first time to prove their identity.\n       Acceptable proof of identity would include photo ID, a \n     utility bill, a bank statement, a government check, a pay \n     check, or any government document showing the name and \n     address of the voter. This is not a requirement that every \n     voter show up at the polls with a photo ID. The measures \n     would apply only to first-time mail-in registrants.\n       These antifraud measures, which were acceptable to \n     Democrats two months ago, are somehow now unacceptable; Mr. \n     Schumer this week introduced an amendment that strips away \n     the mail-in registrant requirements. And on the Senate floor \n     yesterday he announced that his home state is practically \n     fraud free.\n       ``In New York,'' said Mr. Schumer, ``We have not had--I \n     checked again yesterday, we called around the state. We \n     called people, not just on one party or another . . . There's \n     been almost no allegation of any kind of fraud with our \n     system.'' Perhaps he thinks that all of the political cheats \n     in the Northeast live in New Jersey.\n\n[[Page S1385]]\n\n       Alas, the Senator failed to call one of his hometown \n     newspaper, the New York Post, which reported two years ago in \n     a story headlined ``Double-Dippers Sign Up to Vote in N.Y. \n     and Florida'' that ``New York City [alone] has 11,642 voters \n     with illegal dual registrations.'' An investigation of voting \n     records in New York and Florida by the Republican National \n     Committee, which the Senator also apparently failed to ring, \n     has turned up 286 names of individuals who double-voted in \n     November 2000.\n       Mr. Schumer would prefer that states verify voter \n     identities through signature matching. Not only would this be \n     a costly provision--34 states currently don't use signature \n     verification and would have to purchase the technology--but \n     it would also require that the nation's 1.4 million poll \n     workers double as hand-writing experts.\n       The truth is that Senate Democrats are trying to torpedo a \n     bill they helped write due to pressure from civil rights \n     groups such as the NAACP and La Raza. The activists claim \n     that requiring proof that a voter is a real person is an \n     ``undue burden.'' They expect us to believe that the same ID \n     requirements for, say, renting a video or buying a pack of \n     cigarettes somehow disenfranchise the poor and elderly when \n     it comes to casting a ballot.\n       Mr. Schumer's amendment passed in a largely partisan \n     preliminary vote Wednesday, but Senate Republicans are \n     planning to filibuster and we'd encourage them to do so. \n     Someone has to make the case that the integrity of the ballot \n     box is just as important to the credibility of elections as \n     the access to it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Mar. 1, 2002]\n\n  Spaniel Makes Senate Appearance in Support of Bond's Reform Efforts\n\n                         (By Deirdre Shesgreen)\n\n       Washington.--Ritzy Mekler has given new bite to Sen. \n     Christopher ``Kit'' Bond's election-reform crusade.\n       Ritzy, a 13-year-old English springer spaniel, was Bond's \n     Exhibit A on the floor of the Senate this week as the \n     Missouri Republican pressed his case for anti-fraud \n     provisions in legislation to overhaul the nation's voting \n     system. The reason: When she was a younger pup, Ritzy was \n     registered to vote in St. Louis.\n       The dog's 1994 registration is one reason, in Bond's view, \n     that St. Louis has a reputation for vote fraud. Other reasons \n     are recent efforts to register several dead St. Louisans, \n     including a prominent former alderman.\n       What does Ritzy think about her sudden celebrity status?\n       ``Ritzy would like for their to be reform,'' deadpanned her \n     owner, Margaret Mekler, a retired teacher who lives in St. \n     Louis. ``I don't think she wants any other dogs, including \n     the ones in her own household, voting.''\n       Mekler seconded her pet's position. ``Our dog is very \n     intelligent,'' she said, ``but I'm not sure I want her voting \n     on who's going to be the president.''\n       Bond was pleased.\n       ``I'm glad to have Ritzy's support,'' he said. ``I just \n     don't want her votes.''\n       Bond hoped to eliminate the animal vote through a provision \n     in the legislation that would require first-time voters who \n     register by mail to show a photo ID or other verification of \n     their identity, such as a utility bill, before they vote.\n       But Democrats said that requirement would disenfranchise \n     many voters--such as the elderly or immigrants--who don't \n     have the necessary identification cards. Sens. Charles \n     Schumer, D-N.Y., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., offered an amendment \n     that would allow voters to prove their identity by providing \n     a signature that could be matched with a signature on record \n     with local election authorities.\n       Bond said the amendment would ``gut'' his anti-fraud \n     provisions.\n       He promptly trotted out a blown-up copy of Ritzy's 1994 \n     registration card to the Senate floor. With the card on \n     prominent display, Bond said Schumer's amendment would do \n     nothing to keep the pooch from casting a ballot.\n       ``I have a feeling that whoever wrote Ritzy Mekler on that \n     registration form probably could duplicate that `Ritzy \n     Mekler' signature each and every time they wanted to vote,'' \n     said Bond as the debate opened earlier this week.\n       Schumer responded that there was no law Congress could pass \n     to keep all dogs from voting.\n       ``Ritzy, whom we have heard a lot about, is going to find a \n     way to vote illegally, incorrectly, whether we have this \n     amendment or not,'' Schumer said. ``All the owner of Ritzy \n     has to do is put a photo ID in that envelope.''\n       Democrats won a preliminary vote on Schumer's amendment, \n     prompting Bond and other Republicans to hold up the bill, \n     which is now stalled.\n       Just how Ritzy got onto the St. Louis voter rolls is still \n     a mystery.\n       Mekler suspects it started when she and her husband put \n     their phone number under Ritzy's name because they didn't \n     want their own names listed in the phone book.\n       Then they received a notice from the election board.\n       ``. . . We got a voting notification that said that Ritzy . \n     . . had been registered, unbeknownst to us,'' Mekler said. \n     ``The registration said she had moved here from California, \n     she was 21, and had a Social Security number.''\n       ``We got the letter and we said `Well, wait a minute, What \n     is this?' '' Mekler recalled.\n       Mekler, 56, suspects someone must have seen Ritzy's name in \n     the phone book and decided to register her, not knowing she \n     was a dog.\n       As soon as they realized the mistake, the Meklers notified \n     the election board.\n       St. Louis election officials said nobody by name of Ritzy \n     Mekler ever voted. ``Ritzy was removed (from the voting \n     rolls) as soon as we received a call from Mr. Mekler,'' said \n     Jeanne Bergfeld, assistant director of the Election Board.\n       Bergfeld also said she knew of no second attempted dog \n     registration last year, as previous elections officials had \n     reported after 3,800 suspect cards were dropped off at the \n     Election Board just before the mayoral primary last March.\n       The cards included the deceased, but no canines, she said.\n       Mekler said she'd like stricter rules for voter \n     identification, though not all members of her household \n     agree.\n       ``I hope (we) get some reform,'' she said. ``If not, we \n     have two other dogs and a cat who would like to register.''\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the Wall Street Journal editorial \nthis morning has accurately captured the essence of our vote this \nmorning--``Dogs and dead people don't have the constitutional right to \nvote, but more of them are going to start turning up at the polls if \nSenate Democrats, led by New York's Charles Schumer, have their way.''\n  The cloture vote today is not about whether we support election \nreform; clearly everyone in this Chamber does. The cloture vote today \nis about ensuring the integrity of our elections--do we want to make it \nharder, or easier, to cheat.\n  Over 2 months ago Senators Dodd, Bond, Schumer, Torricelli, and I \nintroduced a bipartisan bill to make it easier to vote and harder to \ncheat. This compromise was the result of months and months of \nnegotiations among the five of us.\n  Two weeks ago this bill was brought before the entire Senate for its \nconsideration. But, on Tuesday night, after 5 days of debate on the \nbill, the Senator from New York, one of the principal negotiators and \ncosponsors of this compromise, offered an amendment which would \neviscerate one of the key antifraud provisions of our deal.\n  The antifraud provisions in the compromise are due to the hard work \nof the Senator from Missouri, which I thought we all supported. He \nsought to ensure that when one talks about the Spirit of St. Louis they \nare referring to an airplane, not a dead voter.\n  This amendment was put to a vote on Wednesday morning and the three \nDemocratic cosponsors of the bill voted in favor of gutting the \nantifraud provision. After months of negotiations, after more than 2 \nmonths between introduction and bringing it up on the floor, and after \n5 days of debate, it appears our cosponsors did not really support the \nagreement after all.\n  The Senator from Missouri and I voted to support the compromise we \nhad reached. That is what this vote today is all about.\n  This vote is as much about the sanctity of a compromise deal as it is \nabout a person's right to vote, and do so only once.\n  A vote today against cloture is not a vote to kill election reform. \nTo the contrary, it ensures effective and balanced reform.\n  Over the course of this 8-day debate we have addressed issues \nimportant to individuals Senators and their home States.\n  However, the Schumer amendment which brought this debate and this \nChamber to a grinding halt, takes us all back to the first days of our \nnegotiations over this compromise.\n  We already discussed, debated, and decided these issues once, and now \nmy colleagues want to do it all over again but this time on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  My colleagues on this side of the aisle have serious concerns about \nsome provisions of this bill, but we have been willing to work with the \nSenator from Connecticut to preserve the key provisions of the \ncompromise.\n  This vote is all about the Schumer amendment, which would make it \neasier to cheat, impose the most expensive mandate on the states, and \nrequire 1.4 million poll workers to become handwriting experts.\n  Quoting again from the Wall Street Journal:\n\n\n[[Page S1386]]\n\n\n       Someone has to make the case that the integrity of the \n     ballot box is just as important to the credibility of \n     elections as the access to it.\n\n  I commend the Senator from Missouri from doing exactly that.\n  The Schumer amendment unravels the core agreement we had reached on \nelection reform and has turned what we had hoped was going to be a \nlargely bipartisan exercise into a partisan split, which will be \nevident in a few moments on the cloture vote.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on cloture. A vote against cloture is \nnot a vote against election reform. It gives us the opportunity to \ncontinue to discuss the matter and hopefully work out this problem.\n  The Senator from Connecticut has spent an enormous amount of time on \nthis issue, and so have I and other Senators, and we still would like \nto see a bill passed, but this is a critical point. The whole crux of \nthis bill is to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat. What the \nSenator from Missouri has offered and has discussed--and the provision \nthat was in the underlying bill is quite simply understood--is this \ndeals with first-time registrants by mail only, that they be required \nto provide some identification so we can eliminate dead people and dogs \nfrom the rolls all across America. I do not think that is asking too \nmuch.\n  The sanctity of the vote is important to everyone, and to the extent \ndead people and dogs can vote, it diminishes obviously the votes of all \nthe rest of us. So that is really what this is about. A vote no on \ncloture will give us the opportunity to continue to discuss this matter \nand hopefully get back to the original core compromise that brought us \nall together in the first place. Consequently, I urge my colleagues to \nvote no on the cloture motion that will be before us momentarily.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Connecticut be given 1 minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, so my colleagues know, we had hoped as a \nresult of hours of negotiation--and I am not exaggerating--over the \nlast 48 hours, we would resolve the issue at hand. I mentioned the \nother day the efforts have gone on for several weeks. Unfortunately, \nnot everybody has seen every dotted ``i'' and crossed ``t,'' and \nobviously if that is the case, then we cannot get the unanimous consent \nnecessary to either vitiate cloture or to withdraw amendments and \nconsider others.\n  So we are in a situation where the rules of the Senate make it very \ndifficult, if there is not complete agreement on everything, to move \nforward.\n  Let me say to those who are interested in where this debate is going, \nwe are very close to a resolution of this particular issue that has \ncaused the stall on this bill. It is my fervent hope and belief that \ncome the first of next week we will be able to complete action on this \nbill. When we get beyond this issue, there are several remaining issues \nthat will need to be voted on. My view is none of them is of such a \nnature, whether adopted or defeated, that would go to in any way derail \nthe process.\n  On the cloture vote, Members will vote for or against. At this point, \nit is a matter on which we are going to vote, but it does not go to the \nissue of whether we are voting for dead dogs or live people or dead \npeople and live dogs. The issue is whether or not we are going to get \nto an agreement, and I believe we can.\n\n  I regret we did not have it done by this morning. I thought we had, \nbut obviously we do not, and so I am disappointed by that fact. I am \noptimistic we can get there in the next couple of days.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate for 30 \nseconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I add my remarks to those of the \nSenator from Connecticut. We are willing to compromise. We have worked \nfully. We have moved on the amendment that Senator Wyden and I have to \nvirtual agreement with what the Senator from Missouri wants. Let us not \nhold up this bill. We think that having the overall bill is more \nimportant than the amendment the Senator from Oregon and I offered. We \nwant to try as best we can to protect voters, but we do not want the \nbill to go down. We do not want to use that as a pretext for killing \nthis bill.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this afternoon many Members of Congress, \nmany people across America will be headed to airports, and at the \nairport checkpoint they will be asked to show some form of a photo \nidentification as well as a ticket. That is now the custom in America. \nIt is something we have come to accept as part of our effort to make \ncertain we have security on planes and in airports.\n  The most common form of identification which will be presented by \npassengers across America to prove their identity is their driver's \nlicense. More than any other documentation, that is what people use \nwhen they travel.\n  But, if we look to the question of the authenticity and integrity of \na driver's license, I am afraid we find very troubling statistics and \ninformation. It seems that with very little effort and a minimum amount \nof money, virtually anyone in America can get a driver's license made \nwith their picture on it. It may not be their real name. It may not \nhave any accurate facts on it. But it will be a photo of some person \nwith some name.\n  A driver's license, as the primary source of identification in \nAmerica, is your ticket to enter our society. Once you have that \ndriver's license and present it, you are in the system. You are \nrecognized as part of the system.\n  You may want to get in the system for a variety of reasons. A person \nwho is over 21 years old and wants to buy alcohol needs a driver's \nlicense to present so they can make that purchase. Someone who is in \nthe business of stealing the identity of another person will want a \ndriver's license with their photo on that other person's statistical \ninformation.\n  Of course, if your goal is even more sinister, a driver's license \nbecomes critical. Timothy McVeigh knew that. That is why he used a \nphony driver's license when he rented the truck which he drove into \nOklahoma City, blew up, and killed so many innocent people. Several of \nthe 19 terrorists involved in the September 11th attack also knew how \nimportant a phony driver's license was. They either obtained fake \ndriver's licenses or licenses issued to them under false pretenses, \nwhich gave them access to a system, which started opening doors once \nthe driver's license was in their name--or at least in some name with \ntheir photo.\n\n  When we debate this, a lot of people in America get nervous. If we \nare talking about identification cards, are we talking about a national \nidentification card system? I am not proposing that at all. Some \nMembers of Congress have. I am not one of them. But I do think there \nare things we can do that can strengthen the process of issuing \ndriver's licenses all across America, which can make them more uniform, \nmore authentic, more credible.\n  I am working on legislation, and I will be holding a hearing in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee in the coming weeks that will address \nthis issue. I have worked with the administrators of State agencies \nacross America. Every State agency with the responsibility of issuing \ndriver's licenses is part of an association which has worked with me in \nan effort to come up with some standards across the States. When I walk \ninto a DMV, whether it is in Illinois, New York, Georgia, or \nCalifornia, what do they ask to prove my identity? Is it a birth \ncertificate? Is it a passport? What will really prove my identity?\n  I think establishing minimum uniformity in the way driver's licenses \nare issued State to State makes sense. It is going to eliminate forum \nshopping by those who are looking for the easiest State to provide \ncounterfeit and illegal documents in the process of obtaining a \ndriver's license. That is why I worked with the association to come up \nwith minimum uniform standards, so that State to State everybody knows \nthat a person applying for a driver's license has established their \nidentity through the most credible means. If somebody comes to Illinois \nto apply for a driver's license and they produce documentation that \nindicates they once lived in another State, I think the State of \nIllinois should have an opportunity to have access to that other State \nand find out if there is a chance that person either applied for a \ndriver's license which was suspended or revoked or that State has some \ninformation that may be of value to Illinois before issuing the \nlicense. I think this is an excellent starting point.\n  We are also working with States in terms of applying standardized \nverification requirements, such as validating source documents, for \nexample. This includes authenticating the information provided, perhaps \nby cross-checking with other government agencies. So if somebody came \nand said, ``Here is my birth certificate as part of the proof of who I \nam,'' there would be a way to establish how you would cross-check that \nto make certain the document was valid.\n  We are also working on ways to prevent tampering and counterfeiting \nof documents. This morning, on the CBS morning show, I was a guest of \nBryant Gumbel. They featured a video segment where one of their \nreporters went to Los Angeles with $150 in hand and started walking the \nstreets and saying, ``Where can I get a phony driver's license?'' It \ndidn't take long to find one. Within a short period of time, that phony \nlicense was prepared with the reporter's photo for $150. Then he took \nthat license and started buying airline tickets with that new name. He \nalso got on several flights without anyone ever stopping him for using \na phony document.\n  That tells you how easy it can be even with enhanced aviation \nsecurity today. But there are ways to make these driver's licenses more \nsecure so they can't be counterfeited and easily manipulated. There are \nalso ways to authenticate the validity of the driver's license using \nvery inexpensive equipment. I think that ought to be part of our goal \nas well.\n\n  We also need to establish tougher criminal penalties for those who \nwould misuse driver's licenses, who would issue phonies, or those who, \nfrankly, are part of a network that is trying to make a profit at the \nexpense of identity. Senator Barbara Boxer of California and I \ndiscussed this issue this morning. She has legislation that addresses \nsome of these aspects and we are going to work together with her on \nthat.\n  We also provide Federal whistleblower protection to those who uncover \ninternal fraud or report suspicious activities involving State motor \nvehicle agencies. Why is this important? Look at what recently happened \nin Tennessee. There was a woman who--at least, it is alleged--was \ninvolved in an illegal scheme to sell driver's licenses, which is a \nvery serious charge for somebody who had been a State employee in \nTennessee. Then, under the most mysterious of circumstances, within a \nday of her expected court appearance, her car was set on fire, and she \nwas killed. We have had instances in my State where people working at \nthe driver's license stations have been bribed to issue commercial \ndriver's licenses and other things. That does not give us confidence in \nthe integrity of the system today.\n  We need enhanced criminal penalties in place for anyone involved in \nany aspect of the fake driver's license trade, and also we need to \nestablish whistleblower protections to get people to come forward with \ninformation.\n  We should also require States to implement effective auditing \nprograms in order to scrutinize every aspect of the issuing process for \ndriver's licenses. One way to cut down on internal fraud and abuse is \nto protect the integrity of the agency's process. So a State should be \nable to find out for example, through routine audits, if some of their \nequipment used to manufacture driver's licenses are missing or \ninventory is\n\n[[Page S1388]]\n\nunusually low for the number of applications received.\n  Frankly, these things would move us toward a system which would give \nmore credence to the current process of presenting identification. I \ndon't mind standing in line at airports. Last week, I was at Chicago \nMidway, and I twice stood in lines for a half hour each to present my \nidentification and plane ticket. That is part of the cost of making \ncertain that when I got on that airplane, it was safe. I think people \nall across America understand that. It is sad, and I wish it weren't \nthe case, but it would be sadder still if the wrong person using fake \ndocuments got on the plane and ended up endangering many innocent \nlives. But if this process is worth anything, and if it is going to \nwork, the identification presented has to be valid and validated. That \nis why this effort is so important.\n  I have discussed this in terms of terrorism and security, but two \nother aspects should be mentioned. All across America now, we have \nproblems with drunk driving. Fortunately, the percentage of drunk \ndrivers has gone down dramatically in this country, and I give credit \nto effective law enforcement, as well as to organizations such as \nMothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Students Against Drunk Driving \n(SADD). They have changed the climate and environment, advocating \ndesignated drivers and a more responsible use of alcohol. Even some of \nthe beer and alcoholic beverage companies have gone that extra step to \ntry to advertise the dangers of drinking and driving, and the need to \nbe suspicious of those who do.\n  The biggest problem we face here is the number of young people under \n21 who are easily able to obtain phony driver's licenses and \nidentifications who can then purchase alcohol. Once they purchase and \nconsume it and end up in an intoxicated state, they endanger their \nlives and others. If we toughen the standards by which States issue \nthese driver's licenses, and if we go after the manufacturers and \nmarketers of fake documents with heavy penalties, and if we make the \ncards more resistant to counterfeiting, then I believe we can diminish \nthe likelihood that a young person will end up with a phony license or \nidentification, buy alcohol, and cause a death in the process.\n\n  The next area I will mention is one that I know personally--identity \ntheft. You may not be aware of the fact that this is the largest \ngrowing consumer fraud complaint in America. Last year, at the Federal \nTrade Commission, 204,000 complaints were filed for a variety of \ndeceptive practices, and 42 percent of them related to identity theft. \nThis means that in just one year, close to 100,000 Americans were \nvictimized when somebody took their name and their information and did \nsomething with it without their approval. It has happened to me as a \nMember of the Senate. I got a call a couple of years ago at home, and \nthey said:\n\n       We finally caught up with you, Richard Durbin. Did you \n     think you were going to avoid this bill you incurred in \n     Denver, Colorado?\n\n  I said:\n\n       I haven't incurred any bills in Denver, Colorado.''\n\n  They said:\n\n       Yes, you did. You applied for a credit card, and here is \n     your Social Security number. You made several thousand \n     dollars in purchases and you never paid for it.\n\n  I said:\n\n       It never happened. I never went to that store. I haven't \n     been in Denver, Colorado, for that purpose.\n\n  Someone had stolen my identity, and they applied for a local credit \ncard, and they ran up several thousand dollars in purchases. Of course, \nthey didn't make any payments. Eventually, I straightened it out. There \nare ways to do that although it could take a long time. I give credit \nto the credit agencies that accepted the truthful information and \ncleared my credit record.\n  Identity theft is growing, and part of the scam is to come up with \nphony documentation. One of the key elements in documentation is your \ndriver's license which is the most widely used form of identification. \nOnce you have that license, doors start to open. You use that phony \nlicense to match the name on a stolen credit card, and you are off to \nthe races. It is pretty easy. Sadly, we have to acknowledge that it is \na growing problem in America.\n  So coming up with minimum uniform standards on driver's licenses, \nmaking sure that when they are issued, they are truly issued to the \nperson who is applying for them, providing ways to make certain that \nother States haven't revoked a driver's license when a new State is \nbeing asked to issue one, making certain that States improve their \ninternal processes to prevent fraud and abuse, putting in tougher \npenalties for those who would abuse them, incorporating security \nfeatures on driver's licenses so they can't be counterfeited--all of \nthese things move us forward to improve our nation's security.\n  And all of these common sense solutions add up to a process that is \nfar from anything remotely resembling any national identification card. \nThere would not be any new nationally issued cards or databases or \ntracking systems or collection of sensitive information. There would \nnot be intrusion on privacy--if the FBI needed information about a \npotential criminal's information contained in his DMV record, they \nwould go through the same process they do today--by going to each State \nand following the established process to obtain that information.\n  What I propose is a system where the States would have an incentive \nto move forward--a better system, more accurate, with more integrity, \nwith ability to work more effectively with other States. I think this \nis a step in the right direction. I commend my colleagues who have \nexpressed an interest in this issue. In the next several weeks, we will \nhave a hearing in the Governmental Affairs Committee, where we will \nbring in people from across the spectrum--law enforcement, State \nleaders and representatives, those who have been deceived, and those \nwho have had their identity stolen from them.\n  I will ask them to come together to help us with legislation that \nwill take this commonsense step forward, to make sure that the most \ncommonly used photo identification presented at an airport or a train \nstation or at the bank is really is an indication of true identity of \nthe cardholder.\n  I yield back my time, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this being the first day of March, I \nremind my colleagues of the schedule before us. We are about 3 weeks \naway from our 2-week Easter recess. There are many items on the agenda: \ncampaign finance reform; trade authority; stimulus, perhaps; and, of \ncourse, the President's budget, which will take, I am sure, at least a \nweek.\n  So it is becoming somewhat clear that time is a precious commodity. \nIt is in short supply. I remind my colleagues of commitments made by \nthe majority leader. These were commitments made in good faith about \ntime and about energy, and we have both around this body.\n  I am reminded of a statement he made on November 27 of last year. I \nquote:\n\n       I am prepaid to commit to taking up the energy bill prior \n     to the Founders Day recess; that is, during the first work \n     period, between January 22 and the time we break for the \n     Founders Day recess.\n\n  Again, on December 3, the majority leader said:\n\n       I have already stated very emphatically my desire to bring \n     up the energy bill prior to the Founders Day recess, to have \n     a good debate, to talk about all of the issues, including \n     those which are controversial. It is my expectation we will \n     do just that.\n\n  Again, that was December.\n  The majority leader says he wants to move an energy bill, but I am \nafraid we just have not seen the kind of commitment that America \nexpects or that is referenced in our calendar. We spent virtually all \nday yesterday in quorum calls, morning business, with no votes. We \ncertainly have not done an awful lot this week. I note it is Friday \nafternoon, and it is pretty lonesome around here. Nevertheless, I do \nwant to bring to everyone's attention the absence of any aggressive \ntimeframe in addressing this energy legislation.\n  As you know, it was one of our President's priorities. The priorities \nwere energy, a stimulus package, and trade promotion.\n  To my knowledge, after looking through the Record, our debates, so \nfar, have been quite limited. I spoke an hour on it. Senator Daschle \nspoke for some 20 minutes. That was some time ago. I do not think that \nis an energy debate.\n  In my view, the leader has been waiting I do not know for what \npurpose. When will it come up? Perhaps Monday or Tuesday. It probably \nwill not come up Monday; maybe Tuesday. The longer it takes until we \ncan pass an energy bill, the longer our Nation remains vulnerable.\n  In my opinion, energy dependence is our Achilles' heel. Our enemies \nare painfully aware of this. We waited too long to deal with bin Laden, \nwe waited too long to deal with al-Qaida, and we are waiting too long \nto deal with Saddam Hussein.\n  This is a new month. There is still time and there are still plenty \nof opportunities to commit to the debate and the vote. But the longer \nwe wait to address our energy security, the tougher it becomes to fix \nand the greater the risks that we face.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to call to the attention of my \ncolleagues the dilemma we will face once we get to the bill. This is a \nvery complex bill. It is inferior, in my opinion, because it did not \ncome through the normal course of activities associated with Senate \nprocedure.\n\n  Ordinarily, the bill would begin, upon introduction, by being \nreferred to the committee of jurisdiction, the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. The committee would hold hearings. It would take \nwitnesses. It would develop a consensus, and, more importantly, it \nwould provide an education for each member on the intricacies.\n  We are going to be talking about ANWR. That is a very contentious \nissue. But equally contentious is going to be CAFE standards. Just what \nare we going to do to address conservation? And, indeed, at what price?\n  The electric portion is extraordinarily complicated. We have not had \nan opportunity for review in the normal process. As a consequence, \nMembers are going to be educated by lobbyists, lobbyists with special \ninterests. I venture to say, three-quarters, if not more, of the \nmembership is not familiar with the terminology used in the electric \nbill. It is very, very complex.\n  Our interests, of course, are maintaining an uninterrupted supply of \nelectric energy in this country. We have seen what happened in \nCalifornia. We are going to need more transmission lines, more intra- \nand interstate activities relative to oversight by FERC. I could go on \nand on, but I promised to keep my remarks within 12 minutes.\n  My purpose in bringing this issue up is to make sure every Member \nunderstands what we are looking at. We are going to be looking at a \nbill that has been laid down as the energy bill, without the process of \nthe hearings, without the process of committee action, without the \nprocess of Republicans and Democrats having come together on some kind \nof a consensus about what we could agree or disagree on. That is going \nto be done on the floor of the Senate, which I think is unfortunate. \nAnd I am very critical, very frankly, of the Democratic leader, who \nmade the decision to pull the responsibility away.\n  We all know why that was done. It was done strictly as a political \nmove, to ensure the issue of ANWR did not come up in the committee, \nbecause the votes to pass out a bill with ANWR were clearly within the \ncommittee's structure. We had both Democratic and Republican support. \nAs a consequence of this decision, we are left with this rather unusual \nset of circumstances.\n  I might say, to some extent, it was also done to the Commerce \nCommittee, which was debating the issue of CAFE standards. It couldn't \naddress it or resolve it. At least they had the authority up to that \ntime. But, anyway, that was pulled from their committee as well from \nthe standpoint of jurisdiction.\n  So, my point is, we have a process here that is less than \ntraditional. I think it is less than a bipartisan effort in the Senate \nto try to move a bill.\n  So the bill has been laid down on the floor by the majority leader, \nand we will start the process.\n  As a consequence of that, I think it is also important to recognize \nthe realities.\n  Yesterday, our brave men and women in uniform were again fired upon. \nThey were fired upon by Saddam Hussein's ground forces. They were \nthreatened. They were attacked. As a consequence, they fired back.\n  I am not talking about Afghanistan; I am talking about Iraq, a \ncountry from which we are currently importing 800,000 barrels of oil a \nday.\n\n  I quote the Associated Press:\n\n       U.S. planes patrolling a no-fly zone over northern Iraq \n     bombed an Iraqi air defense system Thursday in response to \n     Iraqi anti-aircraft fire, the U.S. military said. It is the \n     second time that U.S. planes have bombed Iraqi defense sites \n     in northern Iraq this year.\n\n  Well, we are 2 months into this year.\n  But since the gulf war, in 1992, we have been enforcing a no-fly zone \nover Iraq to keep Saddam Hussein in check. A no-fly zone is almost an \naerial blockade in the sense of comparing it to a sea blockade. It is \nconsidered almost an act of war.\n  It is the second time we have bombed, as I said, and it is only March \n1st. So I think we are off to a rather troubling start.\n  Last year, Iraq shot at U.S. forces, enforcing the no-fly zone, over \n400 times. We responded on 23 occasions.\n  But let's not lose sight that while, on the one hand, we perhaps make \na fist at Iraq, on the other hand, we have our hand out taking his oil.\n  In September 2001, we broke an 11-year-old record, importing more \nthan 1.16 million barrels of oil from Iraq. It was the same time that \nwe had the aircraft used as a weapon in taking down the Twin Towers in \nNew York and the Pentagon and the tragedy that occurred in \nPennsylvania. It was the same time.\n  Where is the synergy? We have given Saddam Hussein more than $4 \nbillion for his oil in the last year. That is a lot of money for an \neconomy that is believed to have a GDP of only about $52 billion.\n  What does he do with that money? We know he has chemical weapons. He \nhas a chemical weapons program. The reason we know it is because during \nthe Iran-Iraqi war he used it on his own people--his own people--the \nKurdish people in northern Iraq.\n  In fact, he is believed to have sufficient chemicals to produce \nhundreds of tons of mustard gas, VX, and other nerve agents, as well as \n25 missiles and\n\n[[Page S1390]]\n\nan estimated 15,000 artillery shells capable of the delivery of lethal \nweapons.\n  Israel witnessed first hand the reach of his weapons delivery system \nduring the gulf war. We know what happened. We know of missiles that \nwere aimed at Israel. We know he has been working on nuclear weapons \nbecause one of his top nuclear engineers defected to the West in 1994 \nand has given us details of the program.\n  Over many years, Iraq has worked on a number of occasions to acquire \nthe material and the knowledge to perhaps build some kind of crude \nnuclear weapon. We can only truly speculate on the extent of his \nsuccess, but it is commonly believed that an Iraqi nuclear device is \ninevitable. And if it is not available currently, the question is when?\n  I think it is fair to say that he is up to no good. We can't say for \nsure because we haven't had U.N. inspectors in there since 1998. There \nwas a U.N. mandate that we do that. We have not followed through. One \ncan only imagine what he might be able to have accomplished in almost 4 \nyears of seclusion.\n  As long as we are dependent on sources such as Saddam Hussein for our \noil, we will continue to finance the regime of Saddam Hussein. As long \nas he is in power, he will continue to threaten the world as a member \nof the axis of evil, which is a quote from our President.\n  All the tools he needs evidently are now within his grasp. Reducing \nforeign dependence on oil can reduce the influence and the reach of a \nSaddam Hussein. The question we have to ask ourselves is, when and if \nwe are going to have to deal with this, what will be the consequences \nif we wait too long? Will it be another terrorist attack sponsored by \nIraq? Will it be another situation where we have something occur that \nwe wish we had taken care of because all the signs were there that this \nthreat was real? Reducing our dependence on a country such as Iraq is \ngoing to decrease the supply of oil, so the price is going to go up.\n  So what do we do? We have domestic opportunities, and some of that \nwill come up in the debate on ANWR, which obviously, as the occupant of \nthe Chair knows, is a conviction I have, that we can open it safely, \nthat it will come on line in roughly 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years, that it would \nbe on line now if President Clinton had not vetoed it in 1995, and that \nit is a significant supply because it is estimated at somewhere between \n6.5 and 16 billion barrels. If it is half that, it would be as big as \nPrudhoe Bay.\n  I might add, for the benefit of the Chair, who is not from Texas, I \ncan speculate that there is much more oil in ANWR than in all of Texas.\n  With that profound statement, I ask unanimous consent that a \nWashington Post article of Friday, March 1, final edition, be printed \nin the Record, that portion covering Thursday's bombing which comes \namid a rising debate on whether Iraq will be the next target of U.S. \nantiterrorism campaigns.

The planes dropped \n     bombs on the Iraqi defense system after Iraqi forces north of \n     Mosul fired on them during routine patrols of the zone, the \n     U.S. European Command said on a statement. Mosul is 400 \n     kilometers (250 miles) north of Baghdad.\n       The planes returned safely to their base at Incirlik, in \n     southern Turkey, the command, which is based in Germany, \n     said.\n       U.S. and U.K. planes based in southeast Turkey have been \n     flying patrols over northern Iraq since 1991 to protect the \n     Kurdish population from Iraqi forces. Iraq doesn't recognize \n     the zone and has been challenging allied aircraft regularly \n     since 1998.\n       Thursday's bombing comes amid a rising debate on whether \n     Iraq will be the next target of the U.S. anti-terror \n     campaign. U.S. President George W.

Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, has \ncome to the floor on several occasions and complained about the manner \nand method in which Senator Bingaman and Senator Daschle brought forth \nthe energy bill, which will shortly come before the Senate. They have \ncomplained about the path by which it got to the floor. My friend, the \nSenator from Alaska, says it should have been reported out of the \nEnergy Committee rather than coming to the floor by Senate standing \nrule XIV.\n  But, in May of 2000, Senator Lott moved a Republican bill--the \nNational Energy Security Act of 2000--to the floor by rule XIV.\n  So when the Senator from Alaska was chair of the Energy Committee and \nthe Republicans were in the majority, they moved the bill to the floor \nexactly the same way Senator Daschle has moved our bill. So the ranking \nmember of the Energy Committee is now complaining of Senator Daschle \ndoing exactly the same thing they did. He participated in this when he \nwas chairman of the committee.\n  It seems the Senator from Alaska is denigrating the example he set \nlast Congress.

Mr. President, I would like to clarify some issues \nrelated to my amendment that passed the Senate earlier this week \nregarding the establishment of a protection and advocacy system to \nensure that people with disabilities have full and equal access to the \nelection process. Among other provisions, my amendment states that \nprotection and advocacy systems under S. 565 may not resort to \nlitigation when representing persons with disabilities who have been \ndenied equal access to the polling place or to the voting process.\n  I agreed to this provision with some trepidation, since the \nprotection and advocacy system has a long and well established \nauthority under several federal laws to pursue litigation to enforce \nthe rights of people with disabilities. The protection and advocacy \nsystem has proven themselves to be responsible stewards of the public \ntrust we as members of Congress have placed in them in regard to \nlitigation. The protection and advocacy system is known for exhausting \nall other remedies before resorting to litigation, and in fact less \nthan 5 percent of all cases handled by protection and advocacy systems \nnationally result in litigation. The vast majority of people with \ndisabilities helped by the protection and advocacy system have their \nissues resolved through alternative means of dispute resolution such as \nnegotiation and mediation.\n  And yet the authority to pursue litigation when necessary and when \nwarranted is an essential component of our nation's disability rights \nsystem. If we take away the ability of people with disabilities to \nobtain due process through the courts, we take away the level playing \nfield created by laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, the \nFair Housing Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the \nRehabilitation Act, the Developmental Disabilities Act, and others. \nBecause of that, it is essential that protection and advocacy systems \nretain their current authority to utilize a full array of approaches, \nincluding litigation, to carry\n\n[[Page S1391]]\n\nout their important work as defenders of the rights of people with \ndisabilities. Nothing in my amendment today is intended to undermine \nthat important authority in any other federal laws affecting the \nprotection and advocacy system.\n  I look forward to continuing in my role as a champion of the \nprotection and advocacy system, and of the rights of people with \ndisabilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/01/senate-section/article/S1391-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FIGHTING HATE VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay homage to the legion of \nAfrican-American leaders who have made extraordinary contributions to \nhumanity by fighting to secure equality and justice for us all. As a \nconsequence of their valiant efforts, people of color can now enjoy a \nquality of life, including unprecedented educational and professional \nopportunities, never before realized. Because of their courage, we all \ncan experience the benefits that flow from building a nation that \nvalues the creativity and talent of all her citizens. I am, and we all \nshould be, proud to be the beneficiaries of their heroic acts.\n  Despite the extraordinary accomplishments of the past century, \nhowever, we began this new millennium still burdened by the weight of \nracial prejudice and the hatred, and sometimes violence, that emanates \nfrom it. Based on improved data collection efforts, we now know that \nfar too frequently individuals may be victimized or otherwise targeted \nfor vicious acts, simply because of the color of their skin, or the \ncontent of their faith, or because of any number of distinguishing \ncharacteristics--differences that should form the basis of our best \nAmerican values, but instead are used to injure certain individuals and \ntarnish the American spirit.\n  Simply stated, hate violence is a scourge on our national \nconsciousness, and the incidents of it are embarrassingly high. Perhaps \nthe best-known racially-motivated hate crime in recent years is the \ncallous killing of James Byrd, who, for no other reason except the \ncolor of his skin, was chained to the back of a pickup truck and \ndragged to his death. Mr. Byrd's death was senseless and shocking, but \nby no means is it the only example of such a crime. Each year, \nthousands of Americans are subjected to hate crimes, in perhaps not so \nsavage a manner as Mr. Byrd's murder, but no less cruel and no less \nharmful.\n  Consider these numbers: while the overall number of crimes reported \nto the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2000 declined slightly, by \n0.2 percent, reported hate crimes increased 2.3 percent, from 7,876 in \n1999 to 8,063. And by all indicators, those numbers likely \nunderestimate the true magnitude of hate violence in our country. \nStudies by organizations like the National Organization of Black Law \nEnforcement Executives have revealed that countless targets of hate \nviolence, some of whom are immigrants who fear reprisals or \ndeportation, decline to report these crimes to the police.\n  As disturbing as the quantity of hate crimes committed each year, \nhowever, is the record number of young people who are perpetrating \nthese crimes. According to a special report by the Federal Bureau of \nJustice Statistics, from 1997 to 1999, 33 percent of all known hate \ncrime offenders were under the age of 18 years. For that same time \nperiod, another 29 percent of all hate crime offenders were 18 to 24 \nyears of age. In total, an alarming 62 percent of all offenders were \nunder the age of 24. When they should be imagining their college years \nor their early career plans, some kids, sometimes suffering under great \nmental depression, are instead conjuring up awful acts of hatred.\n  The damage caused by these crimes cannot be measured solely in terms \nof the physical injury inflicted or the property costs incurred. The \ndevastation they provoke is far greater and much more destructive. \nThese crimes fragment our society and inspire distrust. They fuel fear \nand suspicion of groups and communities that are unfamiliar. And, \nperhaps most fatal, they threaten to stall the important growth and \ncommunity-building that must transpire for this Nation to retain its \nstanding as a world leader for centuries to come.\n  If we have learned anything from the tragic events of September 11, \nit is that we cannot tolerate acts of hatred. We must enable a swift \nand tough law enforcement response by refining Federal hate crime laws, \nas well as give our children the tools to confront violent bigotry by \nproviding necessary education and programming.\n  We can undertake to do nothing more important, nor pay any greater \ntribute to the heroes we honor during Black History Month, than to \nfight hate violence in every form and in every way we know. The \nsecurity and safety of all Americans depend on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/01/senate-section/article/S1391-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO DAN NAATZ\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to say goodbye to a good \nfriend of mine, someone who has worked by my side for the last 13 \nyears.\n  Dan Naatz has been my chief of staff for the last 2 years, but his \ncommitment to me and Wyoming has lasted much longer then that.\n  I first met Dan back in 1989 when he joined my office in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. He was one of the first staff members I hired \nafter being elected that year in a special election to fill the seat \nleft open by Dick Cheney who was nominated to be our Secretary of \nDefense.\n  After several years, Dan made the decision to return to school and \nearn a master's degree from the University of Virginia.\n  I was disappointed to see him go then, but after he earned that \ndegree I was fortunate enough to convince him to come back and serve as \nmy legislative director.\n  Dan was with me when I was honored to win a seat in the U.S. Senate \nin 1994 as well. Our history together goes way back.\n  It is never easy to lose someone like Dan, who has been with me since \nthe beginning. He has held nearly every position in my office and did \nthem all very well. None better than the job he did of leading my staff \nand our legislative agenda for Wyoming.\n  It was inevitable though that Dan would be recognized outside of this \nbody though for his expertise in crafting successful legislation and \npublic policy.\n  Over the years, he has been a key advisor and good friend.\n  Particularly, Dan played a significant role in our efforts to reform \nand strengthen the National Park System.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on National Parks, he and I \nspent many hours together, first writing and developing changes that \nwould improve the system for visitors and the valuable resources, and \nthen, as the engine that helped see it through to public law.\n  I was proud of all the work he did, and he should be proud of the \nchanges he helped make, because they will make a difference for future \ngenerations who will visit and experience our parks.\n  Dan has joined CHEP USA. I wish him and his wife Cindy and their \nfamily the best of luck, and I know the Senate body does as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/01/senate-section/article/S1391-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1391-S1392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PROSECUTING GUN-RELATED CRIMES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the fight to reduce gun violence must be \nwaged on two fronts. First, we need to keep guns out of the hands of \ncriminals, prevent children from gaining access to firearms and give \nlaw enforcement the resources they need to thoroughly investigate gun-\nrelated crimes. At the same time, we have to vigorously prosecute \ncriminals who commit gun-related crimes.\n  According to the 2000 National Crime Victimization Survey, 533,470 \nvictims of rape and sexual assault, robbery and aggravated assault \nfaced a perpetrator with a firearm. The Community Gun Violence \nProsecution Program can play a major role in improving prosecution of \ncriminals who commit these gun-related violent crimes by providing \nfunding to hire prosecutors solely to prosecute firearm-related violent \ncrimes. Providing funds to improve prosecution will not only bring \nfelons to justice, but will also act as a deterrent to future crimes.\n  On Monday, it was announced that the Dickinson County, MI, \nprosecutors office will receive $119,117 from the U.S. Department of \nJustice through CGVPP. The grant will be used to hire an assistant \nprosecutor who will devote\n\n[[Page S1392]]\n\nhis or her time to prosecuting violent crimes committed with a firearm. \nThis grant is the latest of several that prosecutors in Michigan, \nincluding Wayne, Muskegon and Ingham County prosecutors, have received \nto combat and deter gun-related crime. The efforts of prosecutors are \ncritical to getting violent criminals off the streets. However we \ncannot forget that preventing gun violence ultimately requires that we \nenact sensible gun-safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/01/senate-section/article/S1392-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING STEWART VERDERY\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize C. Stewart \nVerdery, General Counsel to the Assistant Republican Leader, Don \nNickles, and a staffer for the Senate Republican High Tech Task Force, \nof which I serve as Chair, for his dedicated service to the Senate.\n  After more than 6 years of serving the U.S. Senate, Stewart Verdery \nwill depart today to join the team at Vivendi Universal here in \nWashington, D.C. He first served as counsel to my friend from Virginia, \nSenator John Warner. Stewart then served as counsel to the Senate Rules \nCommittee, as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and currently \nserves as General Counsel to Senator Don Nickles. Let me take this \nopportunity to also thank Senator Nickles for allowing Stewart to \ndedicate time to the High Tech Task Force and the broader goal of \nadvancing constructive technology policy in the Senate.\n  As Chairman of the High Tech Task Force, I have come to know Stewart \nvery well over the last year through his role as an advisor to Task \nForce and to the Republican leadership on technology issues. From the \nbeginning, I have been impressed by his extraordinary command of \ncomplex technology issues and, perhaps more important, his ability to \nsuccinctly explain the issues to others. His advice and counsel were \nalways sound and thoughtful, and through his effective and friendly \nmanner, he instantly earned the respect of those with whom he worked.\n  Stewart Verdery played a key role in the transformation of the High \nTech Task Force into a lead advocate for the technology-friendly \npolicies in the Senate. With his assistance, my colleagues and I were \nbetter prepared to advance a positive technology policy agenda in the \nSenate last year, including: the passage of a clean, two-year Internet \ntax moratorium extension; passage of the upgraded Export Administration \nAct reauthorization; securing additional funding for anti-piracy \nprosecutions; and the hard-fought effort in the economic stimulus \ndebate to make the Research and Development tax credit permanent, to \nprovide enhanced expensing and to include the broadband tax credit.\n  I speak for many in the U.S. Senate when I say that we will miss \nStewart and his talents. I wish Stewart, his wife Jenny and their two \nyoung children, Isabelle and Chase, all the very best health and \nhappiness in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/01/senate-section/article/S1392-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CAPITOL POLICE CHIEF JAMES VAREY\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

The \nCapitol Police has never had to respond to the terrible problems we \nhave seen in the last 6 months, be it terrorist threats, or anthrax \nattacks, but because of the strong leadership at the top, this \ninstitution has remained strong and open to the public. The force will \nmiss Chief Varey's great advocacy on their behalf, which resulted in \nsuch new resources as the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. We \nwill certainly miss the friendly spirit he has displayed to the entire \nSenate family.

Mr. President, when I think of women who have put \ntheir stamp on history, I think of so many ``Wonder Women'' from \nLucretia Mott to Eleanor Roosevelt to Sally Ride. While these names are \nrecognizable to all of us, there are others--teachers, mothers, \ngrandmothers--who are unsung heroines. They are women who greatly \ninfluenced our lives.\n  I have also come to admire our 19th-century counterparts--the women \nwho were warriors on the front lines of the slavery, suffrage, and \ntemperance battles. These early advocates of social justice continue to \ninspire us today. With few resources at their command, they were forced \nto use the power of ideas to affect change. The pen became a mighty \nsword; the voice, a thunderous cannon. They shook the 19th century.\n  Two of these women were contemporaries. They were both reared in New \nEngland, were married, had large families and overwhelming personal \nresponsibilities. They were especially sensitive to injustice. Both \nchanged the thinking of the nation on the dominant issues of their day. \nBeyond that, the similarities cease. One was from a prominent family, \nthe daughter of a renowned clergyman. Unlike most women of her time, \nshe was well-educated--a teacher and a writer. The other woman was a \nslave, unable to read or write. But she could speak, and did that quite \nwell.\n  One was Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of Uncle Tom's Cabin--the \nwoman whose writings did more to arouse the conscience of the nation \nagainst slavery than anyone of her day. Harriet had seven children and \na husband who was a hypochondriac. He took to his bed whenever there \nwas a crisis in life, leaving her to manage on her own. In spite of the \ndemands on her, Harriet managed to do what she loved most--to write. At \nthe time, women with political opinions were not taken seriously, but \nthat did not prevent her from expressing her ideas. She somehow found \ntime to write--letters, articles, entire books--thirty-three literary \nworks in all. Uncle Tom's Cabin broke all sales records of its day. Her \nsuccess brought her to the attention of the President of the United \nStates. It is said that Abraham Lincoln referred to her as ``the little \nlady whose book started this big war.''\n  Harriet recognized what women have known for centuries, that there \nare duties, intrusions, necessary things that lay claim to our time and \nthoughts. That was certainly true of Isabella Baumfree, the hearty \nslave woman who faced more than her share of adversity. She was quite a \ncontrast to the very proper, primly dressed, and precisely spoken Mrs. \nStowe.\n  By 1828, New York had abolished slavery. Around the same time, \nIsabella felt the call to preach. She was 46. She took the name \nSojourner Truth because it was her intention to sojourn the land and \nproclaim the truth. Since she couldn't read the Bible, Isabella had it \nread to her, and she memorized large portions of it. She dictated her \nlife's story and sold it to support herself. Wherever she spoke, her \nsimple but dynamic message attracted crowds. She confounded the \nskeptics with plain truth and images from her own life, but critics \nhounded her. When told that there were threats to burn the auditorium \nwhere she was to speak, Sojourner replied, ``Let them burn the building \nand I will speak upon the ashes.''\n  Women of accomplishment have always been adaptive. They find a way \nwhen there is no way. They wear many hats. Being generalists, they come \nat problems from many different perspectives.\n  A good example of this can be seen in the life of a St. Louis lady by \nthe name of Frances Gage, or Aunt Fanny as she was known in the women's \nmovement. Aunt Fanny loved to give speeches at the women's conventions. \nShe often told her audiences about an incident that had inspired her to \nbecome an activist on behalf of women. ``At age ten, I made my first \nbarrel. It was a beautiful barrel. The cooper who instructed me told my \nfather, ``Fanny made that barrel and has done it quicker and better \nthan any boy I have had after six months training.'' Fanny beamed with \npride as she waited for her father's approval. Instead he shook his \nhead and replied, ``What a pity that you were not born a boy so that \nyou could be good for something. Now, run into the house, child, and go \nback to your knitting.''\n\n[[Page S1393]]\n\n  Having been rejected as a barrel maker, Fanny turned her energy to \nbeing a speechmaker for the women's movement. Her desire to make a \nperfect barrel transferred to a desire to perfect the rights of women. \nNot only are women adaptive, they are triumphant. Without the \ntraditional power resources--money, position, and prestige they had to \nrely on their talents and determination.\n  These women refused to see themselves as too weak, or under-\nempowered, to make a difference. Their efforts on the critical issues \nof their time radically changed the course of the nation. They were not \njust taking political stands--not just writing and speaking about \ncompassion, justice, and mercy. They were engaged in daily acts of \nhuman kindness. What they said and what they did matched. These women \nleft their stamp on history with their ability to be adaptive, \ntriumphant, and genuine. They have also left their stamp on us, their \n20th- and 21st-century sisters. For these traits are alive and well in \nwomen today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/01/senate-section/article/S1393-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADDITIONAL STATEMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nCONGRATULATING THE MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN \n                               IN MADISON\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD.

In the last two months alone, he has \nbeen named Outstanding Middle Weight Wrestler at the Aztec Duels, \nChampion at the Rocky Mountain Invitational, Champion at the Moab \nTournament, Champion and Outstanding Wrestler at the Ignacio \nInvitational, League Champion at the Intermountain League, Champion at \nthe Regional Tournament, and then finally, State Champion at the CO \nState Championship tournament for the AAA division which was held the \nweekend of February 21-23.\n  Jarad Lyons, is without a doubt, a class act. He is respected by not \nonly his teammates and his coach, but by other coaches in the State as \nwell. He is a compassionate team member, and is willing to help every \nwrestler on his team, regardless of his experience. He is well known \nthroughout his community, and enjoys the support and well wishes of \neveryone. People feel they can call him at home, and tell him how proud \nthey are of him. I think this is the mark of a truly special young man.\n  In his free time, while I know wrestling takes precedence, Jarad also \nenjoys working on his car, a 1965 Barracuda, which he purchased himself \nand has rebuilt entirely. He now drives the silver and black pinstriped \nclassic beauty very proudly.\n  I congratulate Jarad Lyons on his tremendous achievement, and wish \nhim every success in the future. He is an example of the success that \nhard work and determination bring when we set ourselves to achieving \nour goals. He is an outstanding young Coloradan and he has earned and \ndeserves our applause and congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/01/senate-section/article/S1393-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING DANIEL MAYDAN ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE'S TORCH OF LIBERTY AWARD\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to set aside a moment \nto reflect on the work of Dr. Daniel Maydan, the latest recipient of \nthe Anti-Defamation League's Torch of Liberty Award. This distinguished \nhonor recognizes those who personify the League's ideals of equality \nand justice.\n  Dr. Maydan, President of California-based Applied Materials, is a \ntrue leader in the technology industry and broader community. He \nspearheaded the development of the company's plasma etch technologies, \nleading to the creation of a manufacturing system central to \nCalifornia's semiconductor industry. This revolutionary technology has \nbeen included in the Smithsonian Institution's breakthrough \ntechnologies collection.\n  Bridging the digital divide both at home and abroad, Dr. Maydan \nhelped strengthen Israel's presence in the global economic sphere, \nearning the Israel Trade and State of Israel Jubilee Awards. In \naddition, he established scholarship programs at Hebrew University and \na Center for Advanced Materials Study at the Israel Institute of \nTechnology to encourage and support others pursuing studies and careers \nin the sciences. In addition to his many other activities, he serves on \nthe Board of Directors of the San Jose Symphony.\n  Dr. Maydan has helped shape our technology field and helped make it \npossible for others to follow his lead. It is clear that he is most \nworthy of this honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/01/senate-section/article/S1393-4", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO KENTUCKY'S COMMUNITIES\n\n   Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I rise to congratulate 10 \nKentucky communities for being named to ``Site Selection'' magazine's \ntop 100 Small Towns. ``Site Selection,'' an Atlanta-based magazine \ncirculated to over 45,000 executives involved in corporate site \nselection decisions, based its study on how well prepared small towns \nare to handle businesses searching for new project locations and \nbusiness ventures. Specifically, each town was judged by the total \nnumber of jobs created, the number created on a per capita basis, \nunemployment rates, and the amount of investments by companies who \nlocate in the community.\n  The 10 towns in Kentucky named to this noteworthy list are: Bowling \nGreen, Campbellsville, Danville, Bardstown, Frankfort, Elizabethtown, \nFranklin, Shelbyville, Glasgow, Madisonville, and Lebanon. Through \ntheir hard work and commitment to progress, these towns have proven to \nthe business community nationwide that they are more than prepared to \ntake on the many challenges that accompany the opening of new business \nprojects. I take this as an indication of the Commonwealth's commitment \nto creating a new and better economy for future generations of \nKentuckians.\n  I once again congratulate these 10 communities for this much deserved \ndistinction and thank the men and women living in these towns for \ncontinually working toward the greater good of the Commonwealth of \nKentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/01/senate-section/article/S1393-5", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/01/senate-section/article/S1394-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1394]]\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/01/senate-section/article/S1394-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted.\n\n       By Mr. BAUCUS, from the Committee on Finance, without \n     amendment:\n       S. 1979: A bill to provide energy tax incentives.

A bill to enhance penalties for fraud in connection with \nidentification documents that facilitates an act of domestic terrorism; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing two bills to help \nprevent terrorists from using false identification to gain access to \nour Nation's airports and airplanes.\n  The tragic events of September 11 taught our Nation and the world a \nvery harsh lesson about the safety of our skies. Congress responded by \ndrafting and passing legislation to ensure enhanced security at our \nairports and on our airplanes. I worked hard with my colleagues on the \nSenate Commerce Committee to increase the security of our Nation's \nskies, and we succeeded in passing an airline security bill.\n  However, there is still more we can do. Current law does not go far \nenough when it comes to guarding against the use of fake IDs by \nterrorists. The importance of this fact cannot be underestimated. As we \nnow know, some of the terrorists who hijacked the planes on September \n11 did indeed use fake IDs to board the planes. My two bills include \nthree ``T''s to prevent terrorists from using false identification--\ntechnology, training, and tough sentences.\n  First, the legislation I am introducing today will mandate training \nfor airline personnel who are responsible for checking the \nidentification of passengers.\n  Second, my legislation would provide technology to catch fraudulent \nIDs. It would require the placement of ID technology in every airport \nacross the Nation. This technology would check\n\n[[Page S1397]]\n\nthe validity of passengers' IDs, and could also include optical or \nfacial scanners to determine if an individual is in a terrorist \ndatabase. These technologies are out there, they're ready for use, and \nour airports should be using them starting now.\n  Finally, I propose legislation to mandate prison time for anyone who \nproduces, transfers, possesses, or uses a fake ID in connection with \nterrorism. Currently, in Federal law, there is no mandatory \nimprisonment for the production, transfer, possession, or use of a fake \nID. Under any circumstances, even in relation to terrorist acts. This, \nto me, seems wrong. If you at any point and time facilitate an act of \nterrorism by providing someone with a fake ID, making a fake ID, \npossessing a fake ID, or using that fake ID, you should go to jail. \nPeriod. My bill makes sure that principle is reflected in Federal law.\n  Last, my bill closes the loophole that punishes people for fake IDs \nused in acts of international terrorism, but not domestic terrorism. \nUnder the USA PATRIOT Act the Congress passed last year, a definition \nof ``domestic terrorism'' was added to the criminal code. My bill makes \nsure that fake ID offenses related to domestic terrorism get the same \npunishment as those relating to international terrorism.\n  It simply is not enough to have sporadic safeguards in a handful of \nairports. The bills I am introducing today will help close loopholes \nthat currently serve as wide open doors for terrorists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/01/senate-section/article/S1397-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2964.

Mr. President, I see the manager of the election reform \nbill coming into the Chamber. He has\n\n[[Page S1403]]\n\nworked so hard on it. In fact, he worked last night and is still \nworking on it. I am glad he has come out of the bowels of the Senate \nwhere he has been working and has come to the Senate Chamber. I would \nbe glad to hear from the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada, the \ndistinguished Democratic majority assistant floor leader, for yielding.\n  To give some flavor and idea about where this is, let me thank, first \nof all, Senator Daschle, the majority leader. His patience--I may be \ntesting it. I hope I am not. I have such deep affection for my leader, \nand he has been generous beyond belief, and his staff's cooperation has \nbeen just stunning. I want to publicly thank them.\n  I thank my Republican colleagues. I thank Senator Lott as well. I \nknow he is feeling a certain amount of pressure from his Members, too. \nI know there are other issues with which this body needs to grapple in \ndebate on. I am very in tune with that desire. It certainly was not our \nintent that this matter end up taking as long as it has. In fact, I had \npredicted it might take substantially less time. However, how we ended \nup--when we have a matter such as this one cannot accurately predict \nwith any certainty what is going to happen. Actually, we ended up in a \nlogjam earlier this week on the Schumer-Wyden amendment, with Senator \nBond and other Members.\n  I am prepared to say we are literally attempting to resolve this \nissue as I speak. We do not have it in writing yet in final form. It \nappears that we are not going to have it this afternoon based on my \nconversations. I thank the staffs of Senator McConnell and Senator \nBond. Both Brian Lewis and Leon Sequeira of Senator McConnell's office \nand Julie Dammann and Jack Bartling of Senator Bond's office have been \nvery supportive and helpful. I thank particularly Senator Bond's staff, \nJack Bartling, who worked with me last night until almost midnight to \ntry to work out appropriate language. Again, today we have spent any \nnumber of hours in our cloakrooms trying to come together with some \nbipartisan language that is very important to those of us who are \ninterested in completing action on this compromise election reform \nbill.\n  There has been concern this bill might die because we have not been \nable to resolve certain issues. That is not going to happen today. This \nbill is going to be resolved, in my view, by Monday night or Tuesday \nmorning at the latest. Then we will be able to get on to other business \nin the Senate.\n  We do not have a unanimous consent request to that effect, and I have \nurged not to propose one. I do not want to find myself having the UC \nbecome a vehicle for some people taking advantage of these \ncircumstances.\n  I think the managers of the bill on the minority side are committed \nto getting this bill done. I thank them for that. We have come a long \nway. We have some amendments yet to resolve. We have not voted on \neverything. However, we will on Monday consider remaining amendments \nand work on some compromise where needed. Over the weekend, the staffs \nwill be finalizing some language, and then on Monday night we have a \ncloture vote, as I understand it, at 6:15 p.m. My hope is that, \nregardless of the outcome of that cloture vote, we will then consider \namendments that evening with the possibility of stacking some votes \nTuesday morning. This will be considered in light of the fact that some \nMembers may not be back even for the cloture vote on Monday night.\n  We would accommodate them in such a way that we would have the \nstacked votes, go to third reading, and complete work on this bill by \nTuesday morning. That is my desire. I further believe it is the desire \nof Senator McConnell and the desire of Senator Bond and others who have \nbeen involved with this process. That is not a suggestion that they \nwould accept the unanimous consent request to provide for such. \nHowever, I believe their intent and their desire is to mutually achieve \nthe same goal as I seek to achieve.\n\n  In this body, the Senate works on comity. We look each other in the \neye and we make commitments to each other to the extent we can fulfill \nthem. I still believe this may be one of the few institutions left in \nAmerica where you do not need a written contract to achieve those \nagreements. So I am working on the assumption that my colleagues are as \ncommitted as I am to seeing this unique and historic legislation become \nthe law of the land with respect to the administration of elections for \nFederal office.\n  I apologize to my colleagues for taking so much time. I am sorry it \nhas gone to this length. However, when you are legislating in something \nthis unique and this novel, that goes to the very heart of who we are \nas a democracy and how we cast and count our ballots for the most \nimportant offices in our land, then there are an awful lot of people \nwho are at the table. Even the legislative process is inclusive, not \nexclusive.\n  The Presiding Officer on several occasions has been in the chair. I \nsay to my colleagues, he knows these matters that have been discussed \nover the last number of days. He is a former secretary of state. He \nknows these issues as well as anyone--in fact, better than anyone in \nthe Chamber probably, given his most recent work in the area. So he \nknows when I speak that there is deep interest at a local level from \nall the local election administrators and officials in this subject \nmatter. I do not have to mention that this is also the case for all the \nsecretaries of state across the country, obviously all of us in the \nSenate, the people in the other Chamber, and people at the White House.\n  There are a lot of people who are at the table when you are \ndiscussing the future of how elections are going to be conducted in \nlight of what happened in the November 2000 elections for Federal \noffice and what had occurred in previous Presidential elections. So \nthis is a major undertaking. It is not an annual appropriations bill. \nIt is a fundamental change in how we are going to do some things with \nrespect to Federal elections. We think we have been inclusive and \nworked in a very cooperative fashion with our States and localities. I \nshould have maybe anticipated it might have taken a bit more time. I \nguess my optimism for the bill exceeded my ability to see how many \npeople would like to be heard and offer ideas to the underlying \nproposal we brought to the Chamber now 2 weeks ago.\n  So I commit to my colleagues I will do everything I can to get this \ndone at the very first of the week. I make this commitment to the \ndistinguished assistant Democratic leader and to the majority leader \nand to others who I know are very anxious to get moving on other \nmatters. I will not stand in the way of that occurring if you will give \nme a bit more of a window to try to achieve what I have sought to do \nover these last couple of weeks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator from Connecticut leaves, I say to him I \nhave been involved in the legislative process a long time at a State \nlevel and in Congress. The Senator from Connecticut has been in the \nCongress longer than I, but I have been tremendously impressed the last \nseveral days by the Senator from Connecticut. I have to say I think \nmost people would have given up by now, but the Senator from \nConnecticut has a vision as to what this legislation will do for our \ncountry, what it will do for the State of Nevada.\n  The Senator from Connecticut has spoken to our secretary of state, a \nRepublican, by the name of Dean Heller----\n  Mr. DODD. He is a good man.\n  Mr. REID. Who loves this legislation. This legislation for my State \nis very important.\n  I spoke a little bit yesterday indicating in 1998 the nightmare of my \nelection. Because the State has so few resources outside of Clark \nCounty, the very populous Las Vegas area, in Reno one registrar of \nvoters tried to save a few dollars and printed their own ballots, \ncausing all kinds of problems because of antiquated machines. With this \nlegislation, that would be taken care of. The State of Nevada would \nhave help to have elections, and all 17 counties would have fair \nelections.\n  So, as I said, I think most people would have given up.\n  I have to say the strength and the depth of feelings of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut is something we do not often see--a Senator sitting \ndown at a table with not another Senator there, with only staff \nrepresenting various\n\n[[Page S1404]]\n\nSenators in this institution. I have not seen that very often. That \nportrays, to me, how the Senator feels about this.\n  The Senator and I have spoken off the Senate floor about the \nimportance of this legislation. In the last few minutes of the \nSenator's statement today, he talked about this legislation being \nhistoric. This will give the opportunity to vote to people who have \nnever had the opportunity to vote. It will cause people to go to the \nvoting booth who will no longer feel demeaned because they cannot hear \nor see or they have some other handicap. They will be able to vote now.\n  The Senator from Connecticut has shown tremendous courage in going \nforward with this legislation. I have to say I only hope, after the \nmany times the Senator from Connecticut has tried to get this \nlegislation passed, that it gets passed. In fairness and justice, it \nneeds to pass. I hope over this weekend people reach out to the Senator \nfrom Connecticut and indicate how important it is that he stick to what \nhe is doing because this certainly--the Senator has had many remarkable \naccomplishments in his career, while I have been in the Senate with \nhim, not the least of which is being the quarterback of the campaign \nfinance reform. But I hope this legislation is able to go forward \nbecause our country deserves it and the Senator from Connecticut \ndeserves it.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the assistant leader and again I thank the other \nstaff, Brian Lewis and Leon Sequeira of Senator McConnell's and Julie \nDammann and Jack Bartling of Senator Bond's staff. I thank my own staff \nas well, Ronnie Gillespie, Kennie Gill, and Shawn Maher specifically. I \nwould also like to include in the record a special thanks and \nappreciation for two interns, Laura Roubicek and Candace Chin, who have \nboth taken extraordinary measures to support election reform and bring \nthe this landmark legislation to final passage. There are also many \nothers in my office who have done a terrific job as well and I thank \neach and every one of them. I thank the people from the civil rights \ncommunity. We spent about 5 hours yesterday going over what this bill \ndoes and what are its shortcomings and what are its strengths.\n  Before this debate is complete, I will list all the groups around the \ncountry participating in this effort and have been at the table, \nincluding yesterday, who bring a passion and interest in fairness and \njustice that I wish America could have watched. We only have cameras in \nthe Chamber and in committee rooms, but this was not a hearing, it was \na group of people sitting down trying to figure out what was right for \njustice, for people who are in the corners, who fall through the cracks \ntoo often when we talk about legislation.\n\n  I was deeply proud as an American to be sitting in that room \nlistening to people who do not hold an elective office, do not run for \noffice, but fight on behalf of the people they represent.\n  I thank Corrine Brown, Congresswoman from Florida, for whom, as I \nsaid yesterday, this is not an intellectual issue alone. It is one she \nfeels passionately about. She watched all that happened in her own \ncongressional district in Florida. Others in attendance included Eddie \nBernice Johnson, the chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus; \nSylvestre Reyes, head of the Hispanic caucus in the House; and John \nConyers, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee and co-author \nof the original Dodd-Conyers election reform bill. They were all \npresent at this gathering yesterday to talk about the importance of \nthis compromise bill and how valuable it is to move forward and \ncomplete the legislative process.\n  Even if it means, as part of what I think the arrangement will be, \nwithdrawal of the Schumer-Wyden proposal, and consideration of a \npackage of civil rights provisions that will protect and preserve \nexisting civil rights laws as they are and administrative provisions \ndealing with some state and local issues as well. That is the way we \nare going to try to get through this Gordian knot that sits on the path \nto final passage of the legislation.\n  There are a lot of people who were disappointed that the final result \nis going to be that the Schumer-Wyden amendment may be withdrawn from \nthis bill at this particular point. However, there are others, such as \nCongresswoman Corrine Brown, who will tell you while she is \ndisappointed about that, she understands there are a lot of other \nthings to recommend in this bill, such as the very strong provisions in \nthis bill.\n  Congresswoman Brown spoke passionately about the compromise bill and \nmoving forward, as have Eddie Bernice Johnson, Sylvestre Reyes, and \nJohn Conyers. That in no way should reflect their disappointment over \nthe fact that Schumer-Wyden may not be part of this bill. It deals with \nthe situation where a person who registers by mail but does not provide \nidentification in the mail-in registration package, and then shows up \nin person to vote. Under our compromise bill, that voter would have \nthree alternatives to cast a vote. First, that voter could provide a \nphoto ID and then cast an actual ballot. Next, that voter could provide \nany of the documents listed in the bill, such as a utility bill, and \ncast an actual ballot. Finally, that voter could not present any \nidentification and then be eligible to cast a provisional ballot, not \nan actual ballot. The Schumer-Wyden amendments permits two additional \nalternatives for that voter to cast a ballot on election day. The \nSchumer-Wyden amendment would add both the alternative of voter \nsignature verification and attestation as legitimate methods for such \nfirst time voters who register by mail and want to come in to vote in \nperson to cast a vote on election day. Under our compromise law, \nwithout the Schumer-Wyden proposal, that voter could still vote, but it \nwould be a provisional ballot and would count only when the \nregistration was corroborated.\n  I don't know the approximate number of how many fit into that \ncategory. Even if it is a few, it is wrong, in my view. But I \nunderstand the passions and feelings of my colleagues from Missouri and \nothers are such to stop this bill in its entirety from going forward.\n  The Senator from Nevada mentioned those who are disabled. I have a \nsister who is blind. I have talked about her in the past. She \nrepresents the National Federation of the Blind in my State. Her \neyesight is such she can see some things. She is a teacher and has been \nfor 35 years. The idea that a person who is blind has never been able \nto cast a ballot in private, independently in the same manner as \nothers, in the history of our country, is changed with the underlying \nlaw.\n  If this bill becomes law, no longer will millions of Americans have \nto rely on somebody else to walk into a voting booth to be told how \nthey will cast a ballot. For the first time in the history of this \ncountry we will have voting systems in every precinct in America that \nallows people to cast the independent and private ballot--for those who \nare disabled, those who are blind--and we do it by paying for it, not \nby asking local States and jurisdictions to do so because we think it \nis the right thing to do.\n  For the first time in the history of our country, a person will be \nable to cast a ballot, and in fact check how they voted. They will know \nwhether or not they overvoted. That is included in this legislation as \nwell. There will be provisional voting process for every voter in \nAmerica, in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, so they can go \nin and if there is a battle over whether they are properly registered, \nthey can cast the provisional ballot, and it will be counted and not be \nthrown out. We require statewide voter registration, which will go to \nthe heart of the fraud issues in many respects. I mentioned the \ndisabled provisions, the language minorities provisions. We expand the \nnumbers of language minorities now included in the Voting Rights Act of \n1965.\n  This bill establishes a permanent commission on elections at the \nrequest of Senator McConnell of Kentucky. We have never had one before \ncharged with Federal elections. It will give a permanent place so that \nwe will not have to go through this process of waiting for a crisis to \noccur and come to the Congress of the United States to fix something. \nWe will have a place where we can reform and modernize our election \nprocess so it will serve the voters of this country over and over \nagain, as well as the election administrators.\n\n  The antifraud provisions, the open access of the voting process for \nothers,\n\n[[Page S1405]]\n\nas well as the provisions for the disability community and our language \nminorities are major achievements. These are the reasons why Corrine \nBrown, why Eddie Bernice Johnson, and why John Conyers, why Sylvestre \nReyes all believe this is the right thing to do. Even though there is a \nprovision in this bill with which they will end up disagreeing, their \nview is, go forward, get to Senate-House conference, see if we cannot \nwork out other differences and pass landmark legislation.\n  The White House will be involved. We are not done with this. I \nbelieve we can get out of the Senate with a good bill, as I believe we \ncan get to conference, resolve it with the Ney-Hoyer bill, and come \nback for the 2002 elections this year.\n  The President has put $1.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2003 budget for \nelection reform issues. There is no reason the $400 million provided in \nthe bill cannot be drawn down by States so voters who vote this fall \ncan see changes they never would have imagined occurring as quickly as \nthey can.\n  That is what is at stake. That is how we hope to resolve the \nroadblock in this process. We are aware and are working on the Oregon \nand Washington issue. Senators Wyden and Gordon Smith and Patty Murray \nand Maria Cantwell have spoken eloquently on behalf of their unique \nsituation on how they conduct vote by mail Federal elections and cast \nand count ballots. We are trying to accommodate them. Our goal in this \nbill has never been to deprive a State of the ability to conduct its \nelections in the unique way they do. We are trying to accommodate their \ninterests.\n  I apologize for reviewing where things are. I want people to know how \nmuch is at stake. This is not another bill we are dealing with, as the \nSenator from Nevada has graciously pointed out. This is fundamental. \nThomas Paine said more than 200 years ago, this is the primary right to \nvote, upon which all other rights depend. If you get this one wrong, it \nis awfully hard to get the other ones right. We are talking about \nsomething that is so important to the long-term health and well-being \nof our Nation. We saw how much harm was done, how many people were hurt \nin the 2002 elections when things went wrong. We bear a responsibility \nas the national legislative body to come up and respond to what \noccurred in this country in 2002 and occurred before that. We only \nbecame aware of it to the extent we did because of what happened in the \nPresidential race.\n  The country believes we need to make this process work better. It is \nin shoddy condition. To engage in this Congress and not engage this \nquestion would be a shortcoming we should not endure. We must accept \nand meet this challenge. I apologize to my colleagues, particularly the \nleadership, for the time this has taken. It is my fervent hope we are \ncoming down to the final few hours of this. This is the last major \nhurdle. It is not to minimize the significance of other amendments that \nMembers have, but this is a major battle between a House divided in \nmany ways, as we saw by the vote that occurred on the tabling motion, \nalmost 50-50 in terms of how people felt. If we get beyond that and \ndeal with the other issues, I am fairly hopeful by Monday night or \nTuesday morning Members will have an opportunity to vote on the first \nelection reform proposal before this body of this size almost in 40 \nyears, since the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\n  I don't know what else we will accomplish in this Congress, but I \nhope at the end of the day when we look at the 107th Congress we can \npoint to this landmark election reform bill as one of the significant \nachievements of this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/01/senate-section/article/S1405-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 4 P.M.
