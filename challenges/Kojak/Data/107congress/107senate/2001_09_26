It's \nnot easy to live right side up in an upside down world. Help those on \nboth sides of the aisle in the Senate to be on the Lord's side and not \nto be neutral with national or personal evil. Father, steel our wills \nto do righteousness, to defend those who cannot defend themselves, and \nto pursue justice for all.\n  God, bless America and shed Your grace on us, not because we deserve \nit but because of Your mercy and because the world so desperately needs \na lighthouse of truth. We thank You that recent horrific events that \nwere meant for evil can be molded into good and, Lord, we ask that You \nwould give protection, not mainly for our lifestyle but for Your glory, \nfor liberty, and for our children and future generations.\n  Father, we pray for those who are mourning right now, but we thank \nYou that they do not mourn as those who have no hope, and we do not \nremember as those who have no anchor.\n  Lord, we ask You right now to help these leaders to be faithful, to \nfight the good fight, to finish the course, and to keep the faith. Give \nus divine wisdom today and not just a human agenda. God bless our \nPresident with the smile of Your approval and the light of Your \nguidance. In the name of our Lord and Saviour.

Madam President, as our Nation mourns the loss of \nthousands of our citizens in the terrorist attacks on America, many of \nus in Washington and in Maine also grieve the passing of a very special \nperson who devoted her professional life to public service, Mary Berry \nGerwin.\n  Mary was only 46 when she died on September 18, after a courageous 9-\nyear battle with cancer. In her short time on Earth, however, Mary had \na greater impact on public policy and on those of us who knew her than \nmost people accomplish in lifetimes that last twice as long as hers.\n  I will share with my colleagues a little bit about Mary's remarkable \ncareer in public service. Most recently, Mary held the position of \nDeputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. During her \ntenure at the Pentagon, she received the Outstanding Public Servant \nAward from then-Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen.\n  Among Mary's duties at the Pentagon were working with service \nmembers, retirees, and their families on a variety of health care \nissues. She traveled extensively to the Middle East, Korea, and Bosnia, \nto meet firsthand with service members to discuss health care and \nquality-of-life issues. She also visited refugee camps in Kosovo to \nhelp improve conditions there as well.\n  I came to know Mary when we worked closely together as staff members \non the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management from \n1981 to 1987. The very first day I met her, I knew Mary was a star. She \nwas extraordinarily bright, and no one ever worked harder or longer. \nHer work ethic was legendary. In fact, her longtime boss, former \nSenator and Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen, remarked of Mary that a \nraised eyebrow could send her back to her desk at 8 p.m. to work \nanother 4 hours to midnight.\n\n  She was also a lot of fun, with an optimistic outlook and a quick wit \nthat helped to sustain her through her lengthy illness. Mary succeeded \nme as the subcommittee staff director in early 1987. She then went on \nto serve as staff director of the Senate Special Committee on Aging \nwhen Senator Bill Cohen became its chairman.\n  During her years in the Senate, Mary contributed enormously to \nlegislative accomplishments. She drafted significant bills, including \nthe Social Security disability reform bill, landmark anti fraud and \nabuse legislation, nursing home, and long-term care Medicaid reforms, \nthe Independent Counsel Act, the Ethics In Government Act amendments, \nand a major revision of the Clinical Laboratories Improvement Act, as \nwell as procurement and information technology reforms. Mary was \nparticularly proud of Aging Committee hearings in 1996 that led to \nincreased funding for the National Institutes of Health for research on \ndiseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and spinal cord injuries.\n  Mary touched so many lives. Members of our Armed Forces and senior \ncitizens who never had the pleasure of meeting Mary have better lives \nbecause of her work. But it is we who knew her personally who were \ntruly pleased. Mary was kind and generous, not only to those of us who \nwere her friend but to everyone she met or with whom she came in \ncontact. Let me tell you one story.\n  Every day Mary would purchase her Washington Post from an elderly \nman. Her husband Ed used to chuckle that Mary was the only person in \nWashington who would spend $5 every day buying her newspaper.\n  Mary approached her illness with an abiding faith and remarkable \ncourage and cheerfulness, even as she underwent excruciatingly painful \ntreatments for her cancer. Whenever I called to check on her, she was \nremarkably upbeat and optimistic. She would quickly turn the \nconversation to what I or another friend was doing, rather than talking \nabout the treatments she was undergoing.\n  I am reminded of Walter Mondale's tribute to one of our greatest \nSenators, Hubert Humphrey, shortly after Senator Humphrey's death. He \nsaid: Hubert taught us how to live and he taught us how to die. Mary, \ntoo, taught us how to live and how to die.\n  Mary's boss for two decades, former Secretary of Defense and Senator \nBill Cohen, delivered an eloquent eulogy to Mary at her funeral mass on \nSunday. I ask unanimous consent that his eulogy be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Our thoughts and prayers are with Mary's wonderful \nfamily, particularly her mother, her husband Ed, and her two daughters, \nKatie and Kristen. Katie worked as an intern in my office during this \npast summer and she is so like her mother--bright, cheerful, strong, \nand hard working. Mary's legacy is reflected in those terrific \ndaughters, as well as in her professional career. I am so thankful to \nhave had the opportunity to have been her friend.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n     Eulogy by William S. Cohen of Mary Gerwin, September 22, 2001\n\n       We have all been overwhelmed and immobilized by grief in \n     the days since the terrorist attacks last week. Grief has had \n     the power to silence us, to bring us together, to rouse us to \n     action. As we have gathered around television sets since \n     September 11, staring mutely at the incomprehensible carnage \n     and horror, we may have had some acquaintance with the \n     victims or we have simply grieved for our nation and our \n     fellow citizens.\n       Today is different. Today, we are truly taking note of a \n     death in the family. A death in Mary's immediate family, of \n     course, but also in the family of unique individuals I have \n     been privileged to assemble and work with during years in \n     Congress, the Pentagon, and beyond. This is a team of \n     talented men and women who are bound together by many \n     invisible threads, who have worked together, played together, \n     sometimes fought together, and looked after each other for \n     more than 25 years.\n       Mary's death has brought us here today, and we grieve and \n     we are angry. Angry that she was so sick for so long, angry \n     that she left us at such a ridiculously young age. But even \n     in our anger and our grief, we celebrate her. Everyone in \n     this room knew Mary as a colleague, an employee, a boss, a \n     mother, a daughter, a sister, a wife, or a friend. I'd like \n     to talk about the Mary I knew, the Mary all of us knew.\n       My friendship with Mary started 20 years age. I was a \n     freshman senator, and she was a kid from Portland who had \n     just gotten out of law school. She came to work for me and, \n     unbeknownst to either of us, we started an adventure together \n     that led to writing and changing major laws in this country, \n     led to her visiting and working with US troops in Korea, \n     Bosnia and Saudi Arabia, led to her working with refugee \n     camps in Kosovo, and led to a friendship as well.\n       But it started for both of us in Maine. Mary didn't come \n     from a well-to-do family. Neither did I. Mary lost her dad \n     when she was just a baby, and her Mother worked at the \n     railroad and raised four terrific kids on her own. Mary knew \n     how real people in Maine worked and loved and struggled, and \n     that knowledge made her very effective when she helped to \n     write and rewrite the laws that affected their lives.\n       Mary and I had something else in common. We both started \n     out as practicing lawyers. But not for long. We were both \n     drawn to the greater possibilities of public service. Mary \n     graduated cum laude from Georgetown Law and spent a very \n     short and uninspiring few months at a law firm, which \n     prompted her to look for work on the Hill. It was one of the \n     luckiest things that could have happened to me.\n       It seemed there was nothing Mary couldn't do. She worked \n     closely with a great team that included another remarkable \n     young woman named Susan Collins, whose service as a United \n     States Senator today makes us\n\n[[Page S9825]]\n\n     all very proud. Together, this group ran a subcommittee that \n     oversaw how government programs are run and tried to improve \n     them. Later, Mary ran the staff of the Senate Aging Committee \n     as well, working to improve the lives of older Americans.\n       Once I got to know Mary and her work habits, I used to joke \n     with her that the Nuns must have really gotten to her in \n     Catholic school--I had never seen anyone who would stay so \n     late, work so hard, or be so easily made to feel guilty about \n     leaving anything undone. A simple raised eyebrow could send \n     her back to her desk until midnight.\n       A truly dedicated mother, Mary understood deeply the \n     difficult balance between being a good parent and being a \n     professional. But instead of complaining about it, she took \n     action--helping to create the Senate Child Care Center so \n     that her children and others could get the highest quality \n     child care and pre-school education.\n       Because of Mary Gerwin and her energy and innate sense of \n     fairness and compassion, here are some of the ways our \n     country is different, and better:\n       --Disabled Americans live in greater dignity,\n       --The savings of older Americans are better protected from \n     investment fraud,\n       --There is less fraud and abuse in the health care system,\n       --People who receive Medicaid and live in nursing homes are \n     treated better,\n       --The government spends its contracting dollars more \n     wisely, resulting in billions of dollars saved,\n       --More research money is spent fighting conditions such as \n     Parkinson's Disease and spinal cord injuries.\n       There was another effort that Mary championed, and it is \n     called the Independent Counsel Act. Not everyone loved this \n     law. My old boss, President Clinton, really didn't love it. \n     But we worked hard on it because the law said, in effect, no \n     one is above the law, even the President. Mary Gerwin kept \n     this law alive almost single-handedly. Many people, \n     particularly in our own party, opposed this effort. Mary \n     fought for it anyway, and she won.\n       When I went to the Pentagon, I asked Mary to come with me. \n     She was the person I turned to health issues affecting our \n     troops, and there were many such issues. She worked with \n     me and with a deeply talented public servant, Rudy De \n     Leon, who also became a good friend to Mary. She didn't \n     just know the right answers--she found out from the troops \n     what they needed.\n       Even in times when her illness was sapping her strength, \n     she was traveling to Korea, to Bosnia, to Saudi Arabia to \n     talk to our forces and find out how the Department of Defense \n     could serve them better.\n       She came with Janet and me in 1999 for our annual holiday \n     visit to the troops, which is a very arduous trip involving \n     several countries in just a few days and in bad weather. But \n     she wanted to go, and she brought great comfort to the many \n     troops she spent time with.\n       After I left office, Secretary Rumsfeld asked Mary to stay \n     on, and she worked well into June before she became too \n     weary. She loved working with the troops. In this way, she \n     was like the father she never knew, who was a Navy recruiter \n     and loved helping young sailors with their problems.\n       I mention a sampling of Mary's accomplishments for a \n     reason--to underscore the good that can be done in a life of \n     public service. Mary's accomplishments would be extremely \n     impressive if they were spread over a 50 year career. She had \n     such a short time, and she did so much.\n       Her accomplishments would also be impressive if they were \n     all she did. But she saved her best energy for being a wife \n     and a mother, as well as a daughter and a sister.\n       You only have to spend a few minutes with Katie and Kristen \n     to see what kind of mother Mary has been, as well as what \n     kind of father Ed has been. Katie and Kristen are exemplary \n     young women--apples who have not fallen very far from the \n     tree. And Mary and Ed had one of the best marriages I knew \n     of--supportive and positive and loving at all times, even the \n     bad times.\n       It is remarkable to reflect on Mary's degree of \n     professional accomplishment and personal success when we \n     consider the inescapable fact that the last ten years of her \n     life were spent fighting an awful illness. The pain and \n     difficulty she endured is unimaginable to most of us. Many of \n     us would have given into despair. Mary stayed positive and \n     productive even in the worst of times. She hated to be \n     thought of as sick. She hated for people to cut her any slack \n     because of her illness.\n       It is tempting for us all to be angry and feel cheated \n     about a life which ended so soon and had so much suffering in \n     the last ten years. I knew Mary for 20 years, and I wish I \n     had 20 more with her. But we know that we were lucky to know \n     her at all. Rarely in life are we fortunate enough to \n     appreciate the truly special people in our lives. Mary was \n     someone you could count on. She touched all of our lives.

Madam President, this morning I want to discuss a proposal \nwhich I think is important in light of the tragic events that unfolded \non September 11, 2001.\n  As all of us now understand, the communications infrastructure in New \nYork, Washington, DC, and indeed the whole country, was severely \nchallenged that day. Wireless telephone networks were severely \noverloaded and crashed. Wireless Internet access was suspended. \nTelephone lines were cut, and communications for people literally in \ncommunities around the east coast of the United States came to a \nstandstill. Even the immediate communication needs of rescue workers, \nvictims, families, and aid groups were a huge struggle to coordinate. \nSurvivors often couldn't let family members know they were safe, and \nfamilies of victims had no immediate central clearinghouse to find \ninformation or file missing person reports.\n  The hospitals were inundated with searches, requests for help, and \noffers of aid but with no way to match them to each other. Even some of \nthis country's premier aid organizations that have done such a \nmarvelous job helping rescue workers, survivors, and victims' families \nfaced immediate and severe challenges with respect to information \ntechnology infrastructure. The New York Times drew a conclusion with \nwhich I strongly agree. They said: There needs to be new ways to set up \nemergency information systems.\n  That is what I would like to propose this morning. It seems to me \nthat what this country needs is essentially a technology equivalent of \nthe National Guard, an emergency technology guard--I have been calling \nit in my mind Net Guard, or a national emergency technology guard--that \nin times of crisis would be in a position to mobilize the Nation's \ninformation technology, or IT, community to action quickly, just as the \nNational Guard is ready to move during emergencies.\n  It seems to me that in our leading technology companies in this \nNation there are the brains and the equipment to put in place net \nguard, or this information technology guard, that could be deployed in \ncommunities across the Nation when we face tragedies such as we saw in \nNew York City.\n  A national volunteer organization of trained and well-coordinated \nunits of information technology professionals from our leading \ntechnology companies ought to be in a position to stand at ready with \nthe designated computer equipment, satellite dishes, wireless \ncommunicators, and other equipment to quickly recreate and repair \ncompromised communications and technology infrastructure.\n  With congressional support, the leaders of our Nation's technology \ncompanies could organize themselves, sell their employees and their \nresource for this purpose. Medium- and small-sized businesses would be \nable to contribute once a national framework is put in place. Certainly \nthe resources from the standpoint of the Federal level need not be \nextensive. Individuals could be designated from existing human resource \nprograms of major and medium-sized firms and the technology \nprofessionals would be trained to perform specific tasks in the event \nof an emergency.\n\n[[Page S9826]]\n\n  I intend to use the subcommittee that I chair of the full Commerce \nCommittee that is chaired by Senator Hollings to initiate a dialog \namong congressional, corporate, military, and nonprofit leaders to \nbegin a new effort to mobilize information technology in times of \ncrises.\n  As we seek to prevent future disasters, I believe that the technology \nprofessionals of this Nation in many of our leading companies--as most \nAmericans--want to use their skills, their equipment, and their talents \nto answer this call and do their part.\n\n  I propose with a national emergency technology guard--what I call \ntech guard--that we give to the leading information technology \nprofessionals in this country a chance to use their ingenuity and \ncreativity to ensure that there is greater safety and stability for our \ncommunities and our citizens in the coming days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. BYRD. I assure her that if she wants the opportunity to proceed, \nI will resist in my remarks and take my chair.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Fine. Please proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for not to \nexceed 40 minutes. I do so with the understanding, as I have already \nindicated, I will be very glad to suspend my remarks at any time the \ndistinguished Senator from California wishes to take the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, during the August recess, The New York \nTimes Magazine ran a cover story entitled ``The Coming Space War'' The \narticle caught my interest, as I am sure that it intrigued many other \nreaders. The author's contention is that the U.S. military is \nconsidering a campaign to achieve military superiority in space similar \nto the kind of military superiority that U.S. forces seek in the air, \non land, and from the sky. Military superiority in space is deemed \ncritical in order to protect our increasing dependence on satellites \nfor communications, surveillance, commercial and military purposes. On \nAugust 24, President Bush named Air Force General Richard Myers, a \nformer chief of the U.S. Space Command and of the North American \nAerospace Defense Command, as the new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. General Myers' selection as Chairman is in keeping with \nPresident Bush's strong support for building a national missile \ndefense, NMD, the follow-on to President Reagan's Star Wars Strategic \nDefense Initiative, SDI.\n  It is certainly true that our dependence--and that of other developed \nand developing nations--on these winking, blinking objects winging \nthrough the night sky has increased exponentially over the last decade. \nIt has rapidly become almost impossible to imagine a world without the \nInternet, the World Wide Web, electronic mail on handheld computers or \ncellular phones, automated teller machines, instantaneous worldwide \ncredit card use, and other forms of global telecommunications and \nelectronic commerce. This expansion and its dependence on satellite \nlinks will continue to increase in future decades. We are all \ndependent, and, therefore, we are all vulnerable, to the seamless and \nuninterrupted access to satellites. Most people, however, do not \nunderstand these technologies. I certainly do not. Like most people, I \ncan understand that I may be vulnerable in ways that are new to me, a \nboy from the Mercer County hills in southern West Virginia. But how \nbest to address this new vulnerability?\n  The author of The New York Times Magazine article describes three \nfundamentally different philosophical approaches to this brave new \nrealm of space. The first is a military approach, which opens up a \nPandora's box of weapons in space. The military, it is reported, has \nlooked into the future and come to the conclusion that space represents \nthe ``ultimate military `high ground,' '' requiring the military to \ndevelop and deploy whatever technology is necessary to achieve what has \nbeen termed ``Global Battlespace Dominance,'' or ``Full Spectrum \nDominance.'' The tools needed might include everything from National \nMissile Defense to antisatellite laser or high-powered microwave \nweapons, or clusters of microsatellites to hyperspectral surveillance \nsatellites and other space sensors--or all of these things. Some of \nthese systems are under development now or due for testing soon, \naccording to the article, already undercutting the author's assertion \nthat the weaponization of space is coming, when, in fact, it may \nalready be upon us. Already--already--additional funding to the tune of \n$190 million is being sought in the defense authorization and \nappropriations bills for space weapons.\n  Now, if I, like most people, do not really understand the \ntechnologies behind satellite communications and cell phones, it is \neven harder to understand the technologies behind hyperspectral \nsurveillance satellites or space-based lasers. And that lack of \ntechnical expertise means, like most Americans, I must depend on the \nPentagon to explain why these new technologies are needed, why no other \nalternatives will work, and what new questions and challenges might be \nunleashed by these choices. That is not, I suggest, the best way to \nperform oversight, but, unfortunately, there are few good alternatives.\n  The second philosophical approach to space outlined by the author is \nthat of the purist, seeking to unilaterally ban weapons from space and \nseeking to return the heavens to an earlier, unsullied era--an earlier \nunsullied era. This is not, in the author's view, a realistic hope. The \nfinal philosophical approach, the one seemingly favored by the author, \nis that of the ``pragmatist''--the ``pragmatist.'' This approach \nrecognizes the inevitable migration of commerce and the military to \nspace, but hopes to hold the line at surveillance. Weapons for space \nwould, in this view, remain in the research and test phase, to be \nlaunched only in response to another nation's attempt to put weapons in \nspace. This launch-on-warning approach would come in conjunction with \nfurther diplomatic efforts to establish operating rules for space \nmodeled on those in place for blue-water ships on the open ocean.\n  In the pragmatist's scenario, existing space treaties would be \nretained: the 1967 Outer Space Treaty banning nuclear weapons in space \nand the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty which, in addition to \nestablishing the surveillance system to avoid nuclear conflict, also \nforbids most antimissile testing. One way of reducing competition and \ntensions in space proposed in the article is by ``mutually assured \nawareness'' in space. The U.S. would develop and make globally \navailable direct video access to space, so that anyone could confirm \nany hostile action in space, as opposed to mishaps from natural causes. \nI am not sure that this is technologically feasible, but who am I to \nquestion it. The concept of greater openness is the point. It is \ninteresting, in this light, to note that the 1975 Convention on \nRegistration of Objects Launched into Outer Space, operated by the \nUnited Nations, has not been very successful. In fact, the nation with \nthe largest number, if not percentage, of unregistered payloads is the \nUnited States. The United States has failed to register 141 of some \n2,000 satellite payloads. Only one nation is in full compliance--\nRussia. And, of course, it is the Bush Administration advocating the \nabrogation of the ABM Treaty in order to commence construction on the \nfirst National Missile Defense ground site in Alaska.\n\n  I cannot say at this point what philosophical camp that I might find \nmyself. The author, Jack Hitt, closes his article by pointing out that \nif the United States is not successful at holding the line at \nsurveillance, if we ``plan, test, and deploy aggressively as the lone \nsuperpower, we make certain that after a brief respite from the cold \nwar's nuclear competition, we will once again embark on a fresh and \ncostly arms race. And with it, assume the dark burden of policing a \nrapid evolution in battlespace.'' This specter rings true. It should \nconcern us, and it should be debated by the people and the people's \nrepresentatives. As it stands now, the U.S. military is moving ahead on \na trajectory that is both costly and one that\n\n[[Page S9827]]\n\ncarries with it a kind of philosophical imperialism with dangerous \nramifications.\n  Now, what do I mean by philosophical imperialism? The military's \nplans for ``full spectrum dominance,'' and space superiority, if fully \nrealized, would mean that in some not-so-distant future, the United \nStates would be in a position to (in the words of the Air Force \nStrategic Master Plan) ``operate freely in space, deny the use of space \nto our adversaries, protect ourselves from an attack in and through \nspace and develop and deploy a N[ational] M[issile] D[efense] \ncapability.'' The U.S. would presumably, then, have information \ndominance in this arena as well. Thus, the U.S. would be in a position \nto know if a conflict between two nations, say India and Pakistan, was \nabout to explode into open, even nuclear, warfare. The U.S. would also \nbe in a position to act, but how? Would we shoot down the missiles from \none side or the other, or both? If we shot down the missiles that each \nnation was firing at the other, what would happen if we missed one and \nit destroyed a city? What is our responsibility? What if we chose not \nto act because the conflict did not involve us, and tens of thousands \nor millions of innocent people died? What is our responsibility?\n  If the United States achieves, at enormous expense, space \nsuperiority, how could we avoid becoming the space marshal on this \ndangerous new frontier? If we detect a threat against a third party, do \nwe warn the third party? If we provide a warning, and are asked to \ninterdict the attack because only we can, how do we say no? How do we \navoid making our military personnel and our commercial enterprises \noverseas the targets of reprisals from those whose attacks we thwart? \nIt is difficult for me to envision a future in which we could avoid \nsuch an imperialist, if benevolent, dictatorship in space.\n  The role of global policeman and space marshal would not come \ncheaply, either, and in this period of shrinking or perhaps vanishing \nsurpluses, we cannot ignore those costs. Space dominance would not \nreplace air, land, or sea dominance, but would be additive. In fact, \ndominance in space might conceivably add to the cost of protecting \nforces on ground by making them targets for the kind of retaliation I \nmentioned previously. Gaining and maintaining a robust presence in \nspace is technologically challenging. An airborne laser, reportedly \noperational sometime around 2010, is budgeted at $11 billion. It will \ncost still more to build and deploy a space-based laser. The estimated \ncost for a working space laser test is about $4 billion--that is $4 \nbillion merely to get to a test of a laser in space. A test is expected \nas early as 2010.\n  The defense budget already consumes a bit over half of the domestic \ndiscretionary budget that Congress must allocate among programs ranging \nfrom health research to agriculture, education to highway and air \ntraffic safety, environmental protection to diplomacy. How much more \nare we willing to trade between guns and butter? How much must we \ntrade, or might alternatives be found in the course of free and open \ndebate?\n  As most people are now well aware, those large budget surpluses so \noptimistically predicted just a few weeks ago--it is not funny--while \nthe economy was booming--and so irresponsibly paid out in the form of \nvote-buying ``tax refunds'' before the actual surpluses materialized--\nare now gone, gone. Indeed, the Administration has had to employ a few \ngreen-eyeshade accounting tricks just to find a few dollars beyond the \nSocial Security surplus to spend on other priorities. And the \nadministration's No. 1 priority seems to be the defense budget--well, \nthat might be all right--but more particularly, the defense budget for \nNational Missile Defense and space weapons. The President wants an \nadditional $39 billion for defense--more, perhaps, now--including more \nthan $8 billion to research and test his missile defense plan.\n\n  I am troubled that this Administration's number one priority is a \nproject whose scientific feasibility is in doubt. That is the problem.\n  We could very well be rushing down a path that leads to spiraling \ncosts and lengthy delays. In the 1960s, Congress was told that research \nof a Super Sonic Transport plane was essential to U.S. competitiveness \nin future decades. I was here. We spent nearly a billion dollars \ndeveloping this aircraft before cancelling it in 1973, a billion \ndollars then would be much larger now. I do not think we have lost one \nwhit of competitiveness because of the cancellation of that program.\n  We traveled down the same path again when we considered funding the \nSuperconducting Super Collider. The $8 billion program was supposed to \nfulfill a supposedly vital role in basic scientific research, but we \nlearned that the true cost was nearly fifty percent greater than \nexpected, and we were not even sure it could ever work. Congress had to \nstep in to end this program in 1993. Again, I do not think that we have \nlost any crucial advantage by not going forward with that project.\n  I can think of no one who believes that a national missile defense \nsystem will be deployed on-time and under budget.\n  I am troubled, not because such weapons might be needed, but because \nwe are spending huge sums on them without being sure in our own minds \nthat the weaponization of space is the best course of action to ensure \nour security.\n  If the United States builds a missile shield to shoot down enemy \nmissiles as soon after they launch as possible, a smart adversary would \nattempt to shorten the amount of time that our defenses have to react, \nin addition to taking measures to fool our defenses. One way to shorten \nthe time between launch and impact is to launch closer to the target--\neither from a submarine offshore, or, as the seas become more \ntransparent to new technologies, from space. Another alternative for a \nwily adversary would be to switch gears entirely and employ other forms \nof weapons of mass destruction, such as chemical or biological weapons, \nthat could be dispersed without using long range or intercontinental \nmissiles whose launch points make determining the adversary a simple \nexercise in geometry. We must be aware that our actions produce \nreactions.\n  We can assume that if the United States deploys weapons in space, \neven in a purely defensive posture, even in a global policeman role, \nnot all of our friends, allies, and competitors will see this as \nbenign. We have only to consider the reaction of the world to the \nrecent statements by the Administration concerning National Missile \nDefense and the potential abrogation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile \nTreaty. Just what would we do when some other nation--friend or \ncompetitor--threatens our space superiority by deploying their own \nweapons there, even if for avowedly defensive purposes? Again the \nvision of a space marshal comes to mind, this time facing off another \ngunman down the dusty main street of space. Does the U.S. Marshal fire \nfirst, second, or is it a long, tense stand-off with weapons cocked? \nNone of the alternatives sounds particularly promising.\n  Though it is difficult to conceive, would a military competition in \nspace weaponry deter commercial satellite growth or the growth of e-\nbusiness that depends on global satellite networked communications? \nOnce weapons are in space, does the cost of doing business in space go \nup to the point that global commerce is stifled? That would be very bad \nnews for business, for consumers, and for the prospects of returning \nour national budget to surplus or even to balance.\n  These are all ramifications of our current course of action that \nmerit discussion--broad, open, public discussion and debate. I do not \nwish for the United States to be left undefended--far from it--but \nneither do I wish for the military to be left, in the face of public \nsilence, to make decisions that spend our treasure and which may create \nnew problems for us in arenas yet unconsidered.\n  In his farewell address on January 17, 1961, President Dwight D. \nEisenhower looked upon the rising power and influence of armament \nproducers and at the increasing share of technological research that is \nperformed for the federal government. He warned the councils of \ngovernment to ``guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, \nwhether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex . . .,'' \nand to ``be alert to the . . . danger that public policy could itself \nbecome the captive of a scientific-technological elite.''\n\n[[Page S9828]]\n\n Mr. Eisenhower was concerned that, among other things, ``democracy . . \n. survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent \nphantom of tomorrow.'' He urged that ``[O]nly an alert and \nknowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge \nindustrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods \nand goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.''\n  Coming from a former supreme commander of the Allied military forces \nduring World War II, President Eisenhower's words carry the weight of \nhis experience. They are also uncomfortably prophetic. Just forty years \nafter President Eisenhower gave his warning, President Bush proposes to \ninvest many billions of dollars to achieve military superiority in a \nnew realm, where there currently is no threat, jeopardizing the \neconomic health of the nation and creating instability and mistrust in \nthe hearts of other nations. This will occur unless the citizenry--and \nits elected representatives--we members of the House and U.S. Senate--\nespecially us--consider and agree upon this course of action. Silence \ndoes not equal assent. We must talk, and learn, and consider.\n  Again, I am admittedly a layman when it comes to high-tech gadgetry \non earth, let alone in space. But it seems to me that we must set aside \nthe whizbang and drama of lasers and satellites to consider the real, \nage-old questions--those that have plagued the great generals \nthroughout time. We should be taking stock of what we have to gain and \nwhat we have to lose by moving the lines of battle. We must consider \nwhether or not we have the necessary weapons to protect ourselves and \nour land before we send our military into new and vastly different \nfrontiers. We should assess the real, known threats to our Nation, and \ngauge whether we have the weapons and the resources to remain secure, \nand whether our time, talent, and treasure would be better spent \nfending off those most likely threats or devising new unproven plans of \nattack and fabulously expensive means of battle. And we should ponder \nthe awesome responsibility of militarizing space and then being the \nworld's space cop before we rush headlong into the twilight zone called \nnational missile defense.\n\n  Madam President, I believe that it would be both wise and prudent to \nback off just a little bit on the accelerator that is driving us in a \nheadlong and fiscally spendthrift rush to deploy a national missile \ndefense and to invest billions into putting weapons in space and \nbuilding weapons designed to act in space. That heavy foot on the \naccelerator is merely the stamp and roar of rhetoric. The threat does \nnot justify the pace. Our budget projections cannot support the pace.\n  Let us continue to study the matter. Let us continue to conduct \nresearch. But the threat, as I say, does not justify the pace at which \nwe are traveling.\n  Our budget projections cannot support the pace, so let us slow down a \nbit, look at the map, and consider just where this path is taking us.\n  Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from California \nwho is here prepared to manage the appropriations bill. She is waiting \npatiently.\n  I take this opportunity to congratulate her also for the excellent \nwork she has done in preparing this legislation. It was moved through \nthe full Committee on Appropriations yesterday. She is here today \nprepared to guide its way through this Senate.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \npassage of the bill, H.R. 2904, occur immediately, with the time for \ndebate on the bill to occur following the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, the bill is discharged from \nthe committee.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2904) making appropriations for military \n     construction, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my \nranking member, Senator Hutchison of Texas, to bring before the Senate \nthe 2002 military construction appropriations bill and report. I point \nout that it is a bipartisan bill, it is carefully thought out, it is \ncarefully balanced, and it is timely.\n  The bill provides $10.5 billion in new budget authority. This \nrepresents a 17.5-percent increase over the fiscal year 2001 funding \nlevel and a 5.3-percent increase over the President's budget request. \nThe bill, as reported from the committee, meets the budgetary authority \nand outlay limits established in the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  This is a robust bill, but it is a carefully considered and carefully \nbalanced bill. Our goal from the outset has been to address the highest \npriority military construction requirements, both at home and abroad. \nThe final product is the balanced mix of readiness projects, barracks \nand family housing projects, quality-of-life programs, such as child \ndevelopment centers, and an array of Reserve component initiatives.\n  It is the military construction bill that funds the installations--\nthe home ports and the home bases--of our troops and ships and \naircraft. It is the military construction bill that builds the piers \nand hangars and maintenance shops and operational centers that ready \nour troops and equipment for deployment. It is this bill that builds \nthe barracks and family housing and childcare centers and medical \nfacilities that serve America's military troops and their families. \nThis bill funds the infrastructure that provides the foundation for \ntraining and preparing our military to fight, and for housing their \nfamilies when they are away.\n  Given the events of the past few weeks, and the events that we expect \nto unfold over the coming weeks and months, this bill could not be more \ntimely. The bill was reported out of the full Appropriations Committee \nonly\n\n[[Page S9829]]\n\nyesterday. We moved it to the floor today in acknowledgement of the \npressures under which we are currently operating. Our men and women in \nuniform cannot afford any delay in getting these projects underway.\n  Although the bill exceeds the President's budget request, it barely \nscratches the surface of the enormous need for infrastructure \nimprovements at our military installations throughout the world. It is \nnot overstating the case to say that many of our men and women in \nuniform work in deplorable conditions at their installations and often \nhave no choice but to live in houses and neighborhoods that are \nsubstandard and unsafe. We have a duty to provide better for the \nmembers of our military and their families, especially at a time when \nthe President has ordered them to ``be ready'' for war.\n  Briefly, I wish to outline some of the pertinent statistics.\n  The bill provides $4.7 billion for military construction for active \nduty components and nearly $800 million for the Reserve components.\n  Total military construction funded in this bill represents a 30-\npercent increase over the fiscal year 2001 enacted level, and a 5.8-\npercent increase over the President's request.\n  A large part of this increase is due to the acceleration of our \nefforts to upgrade barracks for our troops. The military construction \ntotal includes $1.2 billion for barracks construction, a 72-percent \nincrease over the amount appropriated in fiscal year 2001.\n  The bill also includes $4.1 billion for family housing, a 12.9-\npercent increase over fiscal year 2001. As you can see from these \nfigures, barracks and family housing projects are among the highest \npriorities of the subcommittee, reflecting the importance of improving \nliving conditions for our men and women in uniform.\n  I point out that all the projects the ranking member and I and the \nsubcommittee and the committee recommended were thoroughly screened and \nvetted with the services. They meet the rigid criteria imposed by law \nand by the Senate Armed Services Committee. They are good projects and \nthey are needed projects.\n  The money added in this bill for BRAC environmental cleanup will help \nthe services to meet their most urgent requirements. But I wish to \npoint out that it is going to take far more money and far more \nrealistic budgeting--and I stress that because there has not been \nrealistic budgeting in some of the services for cleanup of closed BRAC \nbases--to meet the long-range requirements imposed by the BRAC \nenvironmental remediation process.\n  Before I yield the floor, I once again thank the ranking member, my \nfriend from Texas, Senator Hutchison. She and her staff on the \nRepublican side have been extraordinarily cooperative. I wish to \nacknowledge that and express my delight in the way in which we have \nbeen able to work together.\n  I also thank the Appropriations Committee staff for their work on \nthis bill. They have worked very hard, and I can certainly testify that \nChristina Evans and B.G. Wright of the majority staff, and Sid Ashworth \nand John Kem of the minority staff, and Matt Miller of my staff have \njust been tremendous.\n  I am very grateful for the cooperation that will make this unanimous \nvote possible. This is an important bill for our Nation and our \nmilitary forces. I now defer to the distinguished ranking member from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I, too, thank the chairman of the \nMilitary Construction Subcommittee. Senator Feinstein and I have a \nlong-time friendship. We have been able to work in a bipartisan way to \nmeet the needs of our military, and I appreciate so much the working \nrelationship we have.\n  Congress addresses the needs of our military in two separate \nappropriations bills: Defense and military construction. The bill we \nwill pass today is military construction.\n  I could not fail to begin without saying none of us anticipated that \nin September of 2001 our country would be in a war on terrorism, a war \nthat we did not expect but which we are committed to win. We are \nreminded once again, as we have been in every century of our country's \nexistence, that freedom is not free.\n  As our forefathers and mothers did before us, we will make all the \nsacrifices required to protect the freedom they delivered to us, and we \nwill pass the torch to our children. America will remain the strongest \nnation in the history of the world.\n  I am pleased to recommend the military construction bill to the \nSenate. We have sought a balanced bill that addresses military \nconstruction requirements for readiness, family housing, barracks, and \nquality of life for the Active and Reserve components. I would like to \nmake a couple of comments about overseas military construction.\n  We took a close look at the overseas construction priorities of the \nDepartment of Defense to ensure the projects are consistent with the \nlong-range policies and plans of the Department of Defense. There are a \nfew areas that are troubling that I want to bring to everyone's \nattention.\n\n  The United States maintains over 74 installations outside the United \nStates. These installations subsume funding that in some cases could \nhave been better used to maintain or improve our critical domestic base \ninfrastructure and training capabilities. It is important that we \ncontinue to closely monitor the overseas funding plans of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  In the fiscal year 2002 military construction bill, we did not fund \nthree of the overseas projects in the budget submission that either \ncould not be executed next year or are not mission essential. In a \nresource-constrained environment, these are the types of projects I \ncannot support. During conference, I expect to continue to closely \nscrutinize overseas construction.\n  I also note that this bill includes $192 million for military \nconstruction in Korea. United States forces have now served in Korea \nfor over 50 years. The funding in this bill represents a continuing \nAmerican commitment to our Korean allies. I hope that in the aftermath \nof the September 11 attack on America, our Korean allies will \ndemonstrate a similar commitment as our Nation responds to that attack.\n  Finally, our close scrutiny and review of the overseas funding \npriorities will obviously continue next year based on the results of \nthe ongoing Quadrennial Defense Review, as well as any necessary future \nmilitary construction resulting from the attack on America on September \n11, 2001.\n  This bill directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on the \noverseas basing requirements as a result of the Quadrennial Defense \nReview to the Congress no later than April 1, 2002. All the Members of \nCongress who have visited the men and women of the Armed Forces at our \ndomestic and overseas installations are aware of the critical \nshortfalls in our defense infrastructure. This bill begins to address \nthose shortfalls.\n  It improves our national security infrastructure and our ability to \nsupport the needs of our military families. This is especially vital at \nthis important time as America comes together to fight terrorism. We \nwill ask more of the men and women of our Armed Forces, and we cannot \nask them at the same time to live, train, and deploy from installations \nthat cannot support their readiness and requirements.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Our civilian and military \nleaders and our warriors must go to battle knowing the Senate is \ncommitted to ensuring that our defense and military infrastructure \nrequirements are met. America is united in our cause, and Congress will \nprovide the support to win.\n  Again, I thank Senator Feinstein for working in such a great \nbipartisan way to fund the requirements for military construction. I \nalso thank her staff, Tina Evans, and B.G. Wright, for working with my \nstaff. I want to especially point out the extraordinary experience and \nknowledge of Sid Ashworth, who has been on the Appropriations \nSubcommittee for Military Construction and who, with all due respect, \nprobably knows more than all of us put together. I thank her for her \nhelp in getting this bill done, with able help from my staff, Michael \nRalsky.\n  As I yield the floor, I am thankful for the resolve of our country \nand the unity we are showing in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n[[Page S9830]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, once again, I thank the ranking member \nfor her cooperation, and I thank the staff.\n  I want to have printed in the Record a letter from the Department of \nthe Navy specifically on the subject of the Hunters Point Naval \nShipyard cleanup. There have been real problems in this cleanup which \nhas been characterized by delay and the inability to move forward. One \nmajor event was a toxic fire underground that burned undetected for 2 \nweeks before it was put out. I think the Navy understands certainly my \ndepth of feeling, and I think it is supported by the ranking member, \nthat they move expeditiously to clean up this base. This letter states \ntheir determination to do so.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Department of the Navy,\n\n\n                              Assistant Secretary of the Navy,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Military Construction, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairman: I am writing in response to your \n     queries regarding the Department of the Navy's environmental \n     clean-up program at the former Hunters Point Naval Shipyard.\n       The Navy fully shares your commitment to completing the \n     environmental remediation of the former Hunters Point Naval \n     Shipyard. While progress on the remediation efforts may have \n     been inadequate in the past, I can assure you that the Navy \n     is committed to fully funding the cleanup of Hunters Point, \n     and to moving expeditiously to complete this top priority \n     project on schedule.\n       With help from your Committee, the Navy is prepared to \n     execute the total projected FY 2002 program of $50.6 million \n     at Hunters Point. Deputy Assistant Secretary Holaday has been \n     meeting with your staff on this issue, and is working with \n     other congressional committee staff to ensure they understand \n     the importance the Department places on receiving full \n     funding for Hunters Point.\n       I would be happy to meet with you to discuss this issue \n     more fully. I look forward to working closely with you and \n     with the local community to successfully complete the \n     environmental remediation and property transfer at Hunters \n     Point.\n\n                                                     H.T. Johnson.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1692\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself \n     and Mrs. Hutchison, proposes an amendment numbered 1692.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted''.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1693\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk. It \nhas been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1693.\n\n  The amendment (No. 1693) is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funding for a feasibility study regarding an \n            access road at the Pine Bluff Arsenal, Arkansas)\n\n       Insert at the appropriate place in the bill the following \n     new item:\n       Of the funds available under the heading ``Military \n     Construction, Defense-wide'', for the Pine Bluff Ammunition \n     Demilitarization Facility (Phase VI), the Department may \n     spend up to $300,000 to conduct a feasibility study of the \n     requirement for a defense road at Pine Bluff Arsenal, \n     Arkansas.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be added to \nthe managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1693) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The managers' amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1692) was agreed to.\n  Mr. Conrad. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for S. 1460, the Military Construction \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  The Senate bill provides $10.5 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, all classified as defense spending, which will result in new \noutlays in 2002 of $2.741 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget \nauthority are taken into account, discretionary outlays for the Senate \nbill total $9.253 billion in 2002. The Senate bill is within its \nsection 302(b) allocation for budget authority and outlays. Once again, \nthe committee has met its target without the use of any emergency \ndesignations.\n  I again commend Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens, as well as \nSenators Feinstein and Hutchison, for their bipartisan effort in moving \nthis and other appropriations bills quickly to make up for the late \nstart in this year's appropriations process. The tragic events of \nSeptember 11 demand that this bipartisanship continue and that the \nCongress expeditiously complete work on the 13 regular appropriation \nbills for 2002.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget committee \nscoring of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    S. 1460, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002 SPENDING\n                    COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     Defense     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority...............       10,500            0       10,500\n  Outlays........................        9,253            0        9,253\nSenate 302(b) allocation \\1\\:\n  Budget Authority...............       10,500            0       10,500\n  Outlays........................        9,294            0        9,284\nHouse-reported:\n  Budget Authority...............       10,500            0       10,500\n  Outlays........................        9,202            0        9,202\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............        9,972            0        9,972\n  Outlays........................        9,165            0        9,165\n \n SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation \\1\\:\n  Budget Authority...............            0            0            0\n  Outlays........................

The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1438) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2002 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Services, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we made good progress on this bill \nyesterday. Unfortunately, we weren't successful in reaching a unanimous \nconsent agreement on a finite list of amendments to this bill which \nwould allow us to move quickly to final passage.\n  But we simply must complete action on this bill. President Bush has \ndeclared a national state of emergency. Our military forces are \ndeploying around the world. We are calling the National Guard and \nReserve units to active duty to augment our active forces.\n  This bill contains critically important provisions for our national \nsecurity. It provides much needed increases in military pay and \nbenefits, including housing benefits and allowances. It contains \nauthority for bonuses and special pay to retain people with critical \nskills in the military services, and it contains a number of important \nprovisions to improve the efficiency of the Defense Department \noperations.\n  The matter which has been keeping us from proceeding and completing \nthis bill is not related to the national defense bill that is before \nus. Our leadership is working hard to try to address that issue.\n  I thank our leaders, Senator Daschle, Senator Lott, and Senator Reid, \nwho have been so actively involved for their efforts to move us forward \non this critically important bill.\n  I thank Senator Warner. He and his staff have worked tirelessly to \nadvance the bill. But adopting this bill would send a powerful signal \nto our allies and our adversaries around the world of a strong and \nunified sense of national unity and determination and our support for \nour Armed Forces.\n  So I am hopeful that we can continue to make progress. As part of \nthat effort, Senator Warner and I and our staffs worked late last night \nand this morning to develop a package of about 25 cleared amendments.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1694 through 1718, En Bloc\n\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to send 25 \namendments to the desk for consideration en bloc, that the amendments \nbe agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements related to the amendments be printed at the appropriate \nplace in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I will address in detail some of the \nremarks made earlier by my distinguished chairman, but at this point in \ntime may I say this has been worked out mutually.

Mr. President, I commend Chairman Kerry for his proposal to \nimprove access for small business to participate in joint ventures. In \nthe 1997 Small Business Reauthorization Act, we adopted provisions to \nallow small businesses to join together to compete for bundled \ncontracts that otherwise would be too large for them to perform. \nHowever, current law requires the lead contractor to perform 50 percent \nof the value of the contract. This is still a significant obstacle. The \nKerry/Bond amendment would allow the prime contractor to perform 33 \npercent of the contract if no other participant performs a greater \nproportion and if all other participants in the joint venture are small \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to thank Armed Services \nCommittee Chairman Levin and Ranking Member Warner for their assistance \non this amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2002. My amendment, cosponsored by Senator Bond, will help small \nbusinesses more effectively compete for large and/or bundled contracts.\n  Everyone knows that small businesses are vital to the U.S. economy, \naccounting for 99 percent of all private sector employers, providing 75 \npercent of all net new jobs, and accounting for 51 percent of private-\nsector output. But what many of my colleagues may not realize is the \nvital role small businesses play in providing competition and \ninnovation to our Federal procurement system. In fact, a major reason \nfor the creation of the Small Business Administration was to ensure an \nadequate private sector base for the Department of Defense. It was \nactually deemed in our national security interests to have a thriving \nsmall business sector. And this has not changed, it is actually more \nimportant than ever, not just to our national security, but to our \neconomic security as well.\n  The amendment is based on our legislation, the ``Small Business \nProcurement Competition Act of 2001,'' and begins with one simple \npremise that has been proven time and again, when it comes to large \nFederal contracts, small businesses are at a competitive disadvantage \nbecause of the amounts of money involved and the large geographic areas \nthese contracts may serve. The practice known as contract bundling, \nwhereby separate procurement contracts are combined into one contract, \nhas resulted in small businesses that do business with the Federal \nGovernment being placed at an even greater disadvantage. Unfortunately, \nprocurement streamlining has resulted in the practice of contract \nbundling becoming more and more common.\n  In fact, for Fiscal Year 2000, the Federal Government failed to meet \nits goal of 23 percent of Federal prime contracts being awarded to \nsmall businesses. Many experts blame the inability of small businesses \nto compete on large bundled contracts as a key factor in this decline. \nFor example, the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy \nbelieves that for every $100 awarded on a bundled contract, there was a \ndecrease of $33 to small businesses.\n  The Small Business Procurement Competition Act that has been included \nin this bill will address this decline in two ways. First, it draws on \nan existing principle known as ``joint ventures'' and expands the \nability of small\n\n[[Page S9839]]\n\nbusinesses to form them. Second, it raises the percentage of contracts \nthat a small business can subcontract to other small businesses.\n  Joint ventures, whereby small businesses can team together to bid on \na bundled contract, even if the combined entity is too large to be \nconsidered a small business, is not a new concept. In fact, the Clinton \nAdministration began to remove some of the obstacles to the formation \nof joint ventures. Our amendment takes this initiative, cements it into \nlaw, and makes several improvements to help and encourage the formation \nof joint ventures.\n  Many small businesses have said that they like the idea of being able \nto team with other small businesses to compete on bundled contracts, \nbut they often don't know where to begin. Worse, many small businesses \nhave said that, despite U.S. law, many contracts that should be \nconsidered bundled contracts are not, which has limited their ability \nto form joint ventures.\n\n  To combat these deficiencies, our amendment allows for the formation \nof a small business-only joint venture to bid on any contract over the \namount of $5 million, regardless of whether or not the contract is \nbundled. To combat the knowledge gap on this issue, our legislation \nrequires that the Small Business Administration, SBA, set up a database \nof companies that are actively seeking to form joint ventures. The \nlegislation also sets up a pilot program requiring the SBA to conduct \noutreach and education efforts to small businesses that want to form \njoint ventures.\n  Joint ventures are not the only means to help small businesses \ncompete for bundled contracts. Our amendment also changes the \nsubcontracting requirements for small businesses. Under current law, a \nsmall business must perform at least 51 percent of the work on a \ncontract to maintain its small business eligibility. Under our \nprovision, a small business can subcontract up to 2/3 of the work to \nother small businesses on bundled contract, provided the prime small \nbusiness contractor performs the greatest proportion of the work. In \nthis way, small businesses can bid on larger contracts that they do not \nhave the capacity to perform on their own.\n  Small businesses are vital to the economic growth of the U.S. \neconomy. Their innovations, the competition they provide and the jobs \nthey create are just some of the reasons we must ensure the success of \nour small businesses. Taken together, these provisions will help small \nbusinesses by providing them with more opportunities to compete for \nFederal contracts and help maintain the national supply chain.\n  As the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have made it a priority to ensure small businesses \nreceive their fair share of Federal procurement contracts. This \nlegislation is an important step in fulfilling that promise.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Bond for his work on another \namendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, which I am a \ncosponsor of, to make some changes to the procurement provisions \npertaining to small business in this legislation. I believe it is an \nimportant amendment and I am pleased we were able to get it included in \nthe bill.\n  Once again, I would like to thank Senator Bond for joining me in this \neffort, as well as Senator Levin and Senator Warner for their \nassistance and their courtesy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1695\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to work with \nChairman Kerry of the Small Business Committee to improve certain \nprovisions of the Small Business Act relating to Federal procurement \npolicy. These provisions will enable us to do a better job of tracking \nthe small business impact of contract bundling without imposing \nburdensome new reporting requirements on the Defense Department. The \namendment will also help a new class of firm participate in our HUBZone \nprogram to expand contracting opportunities to small businesses that \nlocate in and hire from the nation's most chronically distressed \ncommunities.\n  The amendment revises current burdensome reporting requirements of \nthe Small Business Act with respect to contract bundling, and \neliminates corresponding provisions--which would now be moot--of the \nDefense Authorization that seek to guard DoD against those burdensome \nrequirements. A new report requirement would be imposed on the SBA \nAdministrator on how to improve the market analyses currently required \nby law, to make them more systematic and meaningful. DoD would not be \nrequired to collect new data under the revised provisions, which \nthreatens to be the case under current law.\n  The amendment also alters the HUBZone Act to allow small businesses \nto participate if their stock is publicly traded. Currently, the \nHUBZone law requires all HUBZone owners to be U.S. citizens. A company \nwhose stock is publicly traded can never meet this requirement. The \ncompany does not know the citizenship of all its stockholders, and even \nif it did, it might change at any moment if someone decides to sell or \nbuy shares.\n  The amendment piggybacks on current Securities Exchange Act \ndisclosures to meet the citizenship requirement. The law requires \npeople who own 5 percent or more of a company to file disclosure \nreports, and to file subsequent amendments if that amount materially \nchanges. Under the HUBZone language proposed here, a firm would be \ndeemed to meet the HUBZone citizenship requirement if no non-citizen \n(individual or corporate entity organized under the laws of a State or \nthe United States) has filed a disclosure indicating ownership of more \nthan 10 percent of the small business concern's stock. Because \nownership can change at any moment, the language would provide that \nthis must be true at the time of application and at such other \nsubsequent times as the SBA Administrator prescribes.\n  One of the principal hurdles faced by small business is lack of \naccess to capital. It makes no sense to exclude small businesses that \nhave overcome this obstacle and gained access to the securities \nmarkets. This language would allow a publicly traded firm to rely \nreasonably on the disclosures they have received, so that they can \nparticipate in the HUBZone program. This will help stimulate new \ninvestment in our nation's most blighted inner cities, rural counties \nand Indian reservations, the areas targeted by the HUBZone Act.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1698\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to address the \nserious accounting and financial management problems in the Department \nof Defense. These problems have been exhaustively detailed in reports \nby the General Accounting Office, the Department of Defense Inspector \nGeneral's Office, and numerous independent reports on the Pentagon's \nbooks.\n  The problems with the Department of Defense's books is not a new one. \nIn 1990, Congress passed the Chief Financial Officers Act, which \nrequired the departments and agencies of the Federal Government to \nprepare annual audited financial statements. Eleven years later, the \nPentagon has yet to prepare a single financial statement that can pass \nan audit. In fact, the books are so poorly kept that the folks with the \ngreen eye shades can't even begin to make an informed opinion on the \nDepartment's ledgers. As a result, no one has a clue how much the \nDepartment spends or what it owns.\n  I first brought this issue to the attention of Secretary Rumsfeld \nduring his confirmation hearing before the Armed Services Committee on \nJanuary 11, 2001. He said at that time that he would take action on \nfinancial management, and he has since completed work on an important, \ncomprehensive review of our military's bookkeeping. These are good \nsteps, but sustained interest is needed to make progress on this issue. \nUntil the problems are straightened out, this issue will need the \npersonal attention of the Secretary of Defense, the secretaries of the \nmilitary services, and many other high-level managers. The alternative \nis to have a financial management system that diverts the taxpayer's \nmoney from important budget items, such as training, procurement, and \nour fight against terrorism, to simply generating more waste, fraud, \nand abuse.\n  My amendment capitalizes on the work done by the Armed Services \nCommittee by strengthening the Senior Financial Management Oversight \nCouncil\n\n[[Page S9840]]\n\nthat is created by this bill. My amendment creates the Financial \nManagement Modernization Executive Committee to establish guidelines \nfor improvement of the computer systems that generate unreliable \nfinancial data, and makes the Executive Committee accountable directly \nto the Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary, and the secretaries \nof the military services. It directs the Executive Committee to focus \ninvestments on improved financial systems, rather than continuing to \nspend money on systems that are hopelessly outdated.\n  In this amendment, I also strengthen the reporting requirements to \nCongress. The Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee \nneeds to know how long it will take to implement financial reform, and \nhow much it will cost. We also need to know if the Department is making \nprogress in reform, or if it is falling behind. The reporting \nrequirements in this amendment will allow Congress to exercise better \noversight of the Department's financial management reforms, and they \nare an integral part of this amendment.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Grassley, for working with me on this \nimportant issue. He has long been an advocate of improving accounting \nand business practices in the Pentagon, and his knowledge and \nexperience in financial management issues contributed greatly to the \ntext of this amendment. I look forward to working with him in the \nfuture to see that the Department effectively implements the needed \nreforms.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to cosponsor \nan amendment with the very distinguished gentleman from West Virginia, \nSenator Byrd.\n  Senator Byrd has crafted a very important and thoughtful piece of \nlegislation designed to help the new Secretary of Defense bring some \nfinancial management reform to the Pentagon.\n  This legislation is the end result of a series of questions Senator \nByrd raised at a hearing before the Armed Services Committee on January \n11th. This was the hearing on the nomination of Mr. Rumsfeld to be the \nnext Secretary of Defense.\n  Senator Byrd's questions pertained to the Pentagon's continuing \ninability to earn a passing grade, or ``clean'' audit opinion, on its \nannual financial statements.\n  Under the Chief Financial Officers or CFO Act, the Pentagon must \nprepare financial statements each year. These are supposed to be an \naccurate reflection of all the department's assets and liabilities. The \nfinancial statements are then subjected to an independent audit by \neither the General Accounting Office or the Inspector General.\n  Senator Byrd's questions pertained to the department's poor \nperformance on the latest audit.\n  Senator Byrd questioning with this telling point: ``DOD's own \nauditors say the department cannot account for $2.3 trillion, I repeat \n$2.3 trillion, in transactions in one year alone.''\n  I believe that Senator Byrd's question had a profound effect on Mr. \nRumsfeld. I think they sent shock waves through the whole department.\n  Since that time, Senator Byrd's staff and my staff have been working \ntogether to find a remedy.\n  Our amendment is a byproduct of that process, and Senator Byrd \ndeserves most of the credit for advancing this initiative through the \ncommittee review process.\n  It is a great honor and privilege for the Senator from Iowa to work \nwith someone of Senator Byrd's stature. Senator Byrd is a highly \nrespected leader in this body and throughout our government. And when \nhe tells the Pentagon, or any other agency for that matter, to shape up \nand fly right, they pay attention. They do what he asks.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have been wrestling with this \nproblem for a number of years. And quite frankly, I have not had a \nwhole lot of success in getting the job done.\n  With Senator Byrd's leadership, I am now confident of success. With \nhis leadership, I believe that meaningful reform is possible.\n  And my confidence is further reinforced by the attitude of the new \nleadership across the river over in the Pentagon.\n  My gut sense is that Mr. Rumsfeld was truly shocked by Senator Byrd's \nassessment.\n  As a former chief executive officer in a large corporation, Mr. \nRumsfeld knows and understands the importance of having accurate \nfinancial information at his fingertips. It's absolutely essential for \nmaking informed decisions. It is essential for success.\n  He understands that the financial statement audits are a valuable \ndiagnostic tool. They allow us to examine the patient's vital signs. \nIt's kind of like doing a cat-scan on the government bookkeeping \noperation. If the books are in order and the numbers add up, it's so \neasy to roll them all up into a top-line financial statement that can \nstand up to scrutiny by auditors.\n  Mr. Rumsfeld grasped the magnitude of the problem immediately. He \nknows that the Secretary of Defense cannot possibly make good decisions \nwith lousy information.\n  Having accurate, up-to-date financial information at his fingertips \nis mandatory--especially today when we appear to be on the brink of \nwar.\n  The demand for financial resources is starting to escalate rapidly. \nIf DOD does not know what it has in the inventory today and how much it \nis spending from one day to the next, then how could it possibly know \nwhat it needs?\n  I want to be certain that my colleagues understand the goal of the \nCFO Act. The key to this process is not passing some audit with flying \ncolors. That's not it at all. This is no mickey mouse bean-counter \nexercise.\n  The goal is to have accurate financial information in the hands of \nthose responsible for making decisions. A ``clean'' opinion tells us \nthat they will have it when they need it. A ``clean'' opinion will tell \nus that they are in a position to make informed decisions about what \nneeds to be done.\n\n  A disclaimer of opinion, by comparison, says they don't have it and \ncan't make informed decisions. That's bad, but that's exactly where DOD \nis today.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld's response to Senator Byrd's questions was so \nencouraging. It was music to my ears.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld's response tells me that he understands the \nproblem completely, and he wants to solve it. He knows he has to solve \nit, if he is to be a successful and effective secretary.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld made a personal commitment to me to clean up the \ndepartment's books.\n  His Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Dov Zakheim, has made a personal \ncommitment to me to fix the books.\n  And Mr. Zakheim's senior deputies, like Mr. Larry Lanzillotta, have \nmade a personal commitment to me to fix the books.\n  So, I now see a willingness in the Pentagon to get a handle on this \nproblem. That's half the battle right there, the will to get the job \ndone.\n  To my knowledge, that attitude never existed at the Pentagon in the \npast.\n  In the past, I fought endlessly with Mr. Hamre and his predecessors. \nThey denied the problem even existed. Clearly, we have moved way beyond \nthat stage.\n  Mr. Rumsfeld and his team understand the problem and want to fix it. \nIf the will is there, as I think it is, I think we can succeed this \ntime.\n  I would like to assure my colleagues that this is not an attempt to \nlegislate a solution. So long as the Secretary is committed to reform, \na legislative solution is unnecessary.\n  I see our amendment more as a device to help the Secretary get the \njob done.\n  Our only objective is to help the department acquire the tools it \nneeds to put accurate, up-to-date financial information at the \nsecretary's fingertips.\n  First, our amendment establishes a Senior Financial Management \nModernization Executive Committee.\n  This group will supervise the acquisition of highly integrated \naccounting systems and computer technology.\n  These systems will be designed to produce reliable financial \nstatements. Those capabilities simply do not exist today.\n  This group will report directly to Secretary Rumsfeld.\n  Second, the amendment provides some much needed relief. Right now, \nthe Inspector General is pouring audit resources down a rat hole. It \nmakes no sense whatsoever to audit financial statements that are \nnotoriously unreliable. It's a total waste. That practice will be \nsuspended temporarily.\n\n[[Page S9841]]\n\n  Third, while some audits are suspended, the Secretary must provide an \nestimate of when reliable financial statements will be available for \naudit.\n  Fourth, the department is put on notice that it has four years to get \nthe new systems up and running.\n  Mr. President, every member of this body understands that the \nelimination of the terrorist threat to this country is the top defense \npriority for the foreseeable future. We understand and accept that .\n  Countering this terrible threat must take priority over everything \nelse.\n  At the same time, I hope that efforts to ferret out fraud, waste, \nabuse and mismanagement are not left behind in a cloud of dust. They \nhave a place, even in the current environment.\n  It will be up to Secretary Rumsfeld to decide how and where reform \nfits into the new priorities.\n  We have been repeatedly told that the coming campaign against \nterrorism will be long and difficult. If it is long and difficult as \npredicted, then we will need to be certain that we don't waste precious \nresources. Waste and mismanagement could get in the way of our efforts \nto win the war against terrorism.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1703\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing with \nSenator Bob Smith an amendment to improve the organization and \nmanagement of the Department of Defense with respect to space programs \nand activities.\n  This amendment is more important than ever. We are about to engage in \nan extraordinary struggle against the forces of terrorism. This will be \na far-flung and difficult fight. Good intelligence will be at a premium \nand our space assets play a key role in achieving that.\n  We must do whatever we can to be sure that all our military assets \nare managed as efficiently and effectively as possible. This amendment, \nwhich is based on the recommendations of the Commission to Assess \nUnited States National Security Space Management and Organization, \n(also known as the Space Commission), is intended to do just that for \nour space assets.\n  The Commission looked at current DOD organization and management as \nit pertains to the development and implementation of national-level \nguidance, establishing requirements, acquiring and operating systems, \nand planning, programming and budgeting for national security space \ncapabilities. The Commission found that the United States is dependent \non space, creating vulnerabilities and demands on our space systems \nrequiring space to be recognized as a top national security priority. \nThe Commission also concluded that these new vulnerabilities and \ndemands are not adequately addressed by the current management \nstructure at the Department. The Commission found that a number of \nspace activities should be merged, chains of command adjusted, lines of \ncommunications opened and policies modified to achieve greater \nresponsibility and accountability. Senator Smith and I agree, and \nbelieve that space assets will be critical in the coming conflict with \nthe forces of terrorism. That is why we are introducing this amendment.\n  The Department is making some of these changes today. However, we \nbelieve Congress should show its support to our military men and women \nby providing the Secretary with authority to realign his Department to \nmake it more effective.\n  This legislation will provide the Secretary of Defense with the tools \nhe needs for more effective management and organization of space \nprogram and activities. Specifically the legislation will:\n  Provide discretionary authority for the Secretary of Defense to \nestablish an Under Secretary of Defense for Space, Intelligence and \nInformation. Right now, the Secretary does not have this authority. \nWhile he has decided for the moment not to adopt this Commission \nrecommendation, the amendment would provide him the authority to do so \nif he so chooses;\n  It would establish the Air Force as the Executive Agent for DOD space \nprograms for DOD functions designated by the Secretary of Defense;\n  It would assign the Under Secretary of the Air Force as the Director \nof the NRO and directs the Under Secretary of the Air Force to \ncoordinate the space activities of DOD and the NRO;\n  It would establish a budget mechanism to provide a better \nunderstanding of the resources we dedicate to space programs;\n  It would direct the Under Secretary of the Air Force to establish a \nspace career field to promote the growth of specialists in space \nprograms, doctrine, and operations. A budget mechanism and space career \nfield will both help provide the needed focus on space and space \nactivities;\n  And finally, the amendment would provide for joint service management \nof space programs to the maximum extent practicable, to assure that the \nArmy, Navy, and Marine Corps stay actively involved in space programs.\n  This amendment will provide DOD the authority and flexibility to move \nfaster and more efficiently in its reorganization and help provide the \nfocus and attention that space programs and activities deserve. This is \nimperative in this dangerous world, in which our forces need the best \ntechnology, training, and support.\n  I want to thank my colleague for joining with me in this effort to \nprovide the Department the tools it needs to make space a top national \nsecurity priority. We welcome all Senators to join us in support of \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am glad that the Space \nManagement Organization Amendment to this year's National Defense \nAuthorization Act has been approved. As you all know, space issues have \nlong been a keen interest of mine, even long before I served as the \nStrategic Forces Subcommittee Chairman. My interest is not derived from \nmy New Hampshire industry constituents, because there is very little \nspace business in my State. Rather, my interest in space is derived \nfrom my firm belief that whoever controls space will win the next war. \nMore and more our deployed forces are relying on the ``reach'' that \nspace communications provide and the ``high ground'' that space \nsurveillance affords. Space is absolutely critical to future war \nfighting! That is why I feel proper management and operations of our \nspace assets is absolutely critical. I look forward to working with \nSenator Reed as the Chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee to \nfurther the role of space in our strategic planning. This amendment is \nintended to capitalize on the expertise the Space Commission brought \ntogether, the Nation's greatest national security space experts from \nthe military and civilian world. Ironically, military space operations \nare not usually run by senior officers with any space experience. \nSurely this lack of experience has some impact on their ability to \nleverage, to the maximum extent, the very complex high-technology \nmilitary space assets under their command. In researching this issue, I \nfound that the reason many of these officers don't have space \nexperience is that they are required to be pilots in the ``dual-\nhatted'' relationship that U.S. Space Command has with the North \nAmerican Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD. Because of the complexity of \ntraining to fly aircraft and maintain satellites, you rarely find \nofficers with experience in both to staff appropriately U.S. Space \nCommand, with space experts, and simultaneously meet the NORAD \nrequirement for pilots. I think this current situation impacts our \nability to leverage our space assets, precludes our best space officers \nfrom holding the highest positions, and perpetuates a culture in the \nAir Force that SPACE is secondary to AIR, despite the rhetoric to the \ncontrary. This amendment is not intended to be an affront to the \ncurrent or past Commanders of the U.S. Space Command or the officers \nwho have served honorably under them. Rather, this amendment is \nintended to acknowledge that we have a defense space management issue \nand to seize the opportunity to correct it. Space is growing in \nimportance as shown in the Gulf War, the Balkans and as will be \ndemonstrated in the upcoming war against terrorism. It will be critical \nto winning the next war, and we need to establish the best space \nmanagement and operations system that this Nation can bring to bear.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1705\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have two amendments regarding the V-22 \nOsprey program. I understand that these amendments have been accepted, \nand I thank the managers, the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the\n\n[[Page S9842]]\n\nArmed Services Committee, for their cooperation on these important \namendments.\n  The Osprey program has a troubled history and an uncertain future. \nSerious allegations and serious questions continue to cloud this \nprogram. Thirty Marines have died in Osprey crashes since 1991. Many \nquestions regarding the accuracy of maintenance records and the safety \nand viability of this aircraft remain unanswered. We should proceed \nwith caution, and we should have all the facts on this program.\n  I share the Armed Services Committee's concern about ``how the Marine \nCorps and the Air Force are going to meet the requirements established \nfor the V-22 program,'' and I commend the Committee for including \nlanguage in the underlying bill that directs the Department of Defense \nto conduct a review of potential alternatives to this troubled \naircraft.\n  One of my amendments will require the Defense Department to submit a \nreport to Congress regarding the status of the Osprey program. This \nreport will be submitted to the Congress no later than 30 days before a \ndecision to resume test flights of the Osprey. The report will include \na description of how the Department is implementing or plans to \nimplement the recommendations of the Panel to Review the V-22 Program. \nThis Panel, which was formed by former Secretary of Defense William \nCohen following the December 2000 Osprey crash that killed four \nMarines, has recommended that the program be restructured and enter a \nnew ``Development Maturity Phase'' during which the Panel's design and \ntesting recommendations would be implemented.\n  In addition, the Department will be required to provide a full \nanalysis of the deficiencies in the V-22's hydraulic system components \nand flight control software and the steps that have been taken to \ncorrect these deficiencies. There are many questions about specific \ncomponents of this experimental tilt-rotor aircraft, including the \nhydraulic system and the flight control software. Extensive problems \nwith the Osprey's hydraulic system components is one of the principal \nconcerns that has been cited in numerous reports, including the report \nof the Panel to Review the V-22 Program; the report of the Judge \nAdvocate General Manual investigation into the December 2000 Osprey \ncrash; reports by the General Accounting Office and the Defense Science \nBoard; and the November 2000 report of the Director of Operational \nTesting and Evaluation. Further, the Panel recommended that no further \ntest flights of the Osprey take place until the flight control software \nhas been redesigned. The hydraulic system and the flight control \nsoftware have been blamed for the December 2000 crash.\n  In addition, there are a number of concerns regarding the \naeromechanics of the Osprey, including the so-called ``vortex ring \nstate'' phenomenon that caused the April 2000 crash that killed 19 \nMarines. The Navy commissioned the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, NASA, to conduct a study of the tilt-rotor \naeromechanics, including the vortex ring state and autorotation. The \nDepartment also will be required to include in its report to Congress \nan assessment of NASA's recommendations on tilt-rotor aeromechanics.\n  My second amendment would require the Department of Defense to \nprovide notification to Congress thirty days before the resumption of \nV-22 test flights of all waivers of any item, capability, or other \nrequirement specified in the Joint Operational Requirements Document, \nJORD, for the V-22, including the justification for such waivers.\n  As has been noted in reports including the final report of the Panel \nto Review the V-22, the November 2000 report of the Director of \nOperational Testing and Evaluation, and the Armed Services Committee \nreport accompanying this bill, there are a number of concerns regarding \nthe items that were waived during operational testing of the V-22. \nThese include: the aircraft flight envelope and clearance for air \ncombat maneuvering; defensive weapons systems; flight testing in bad \nweather conditions such as icing; nuclear, chemical, and biological \nweapons pressure protection; and the cargo handling system. The \nNovember 2000 report of the Director of Operational Testing and \nEvaluation states that ``several of these waived capabilities impact \nthe operational effectiveness and suitability of the MV-22.''\n  My amendment will help to provide Congress with a more complete \npicture of the V-22 testing program by requiring the Department of \nDefense to provide a notification of all waivers and the justification \nfor these waivers prior to a resumption of V-22 test flights.\n  Again, I thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member for accepting \nthese amendments.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, the Armed Services Committee approved an \nauthorization increase of $10 million over the budget request for \nCombat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology ``to support the \ngoals of Army transformation''. The report states that ``of this \namount, $5 million would be used for research into lightweight steels, \nvehicle weight and cost reduction, corrosion control, and vehicle \narchitecture optimization. The committee notes that novel light truck \narchitectures combined with advanced structural materials could reduce \nvehicle weight without degrading performance or increasing costs, and \ncould support the Army's transformation into a lighter, more lethal, \nsurvivable and tactically mobile force.''\n  This increase refers to the research effort, competitively selected \nby the Army in fiscal year 1999, titled ``Improved Materials and \nPowertrain Architectures for 21th Century Trucks'' (IMPACT). The IMPACT \nprogram will cover light/medium military payloads up to 5 tons, \nincluding applications with an open or closed bed configuration.\n  Kentucky is a large commercial producer and Army Base user of such \nvehicles, and through the University of Louisville's involvement in \nthis effort, plays an important research role in their design and \ntesting. The military will realize significant procurement and O cost \nsavings as a result.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is with great regret that I am come \nto the floor today to discuss Senator Inhofe's amendment to this \nlegislation. We are a nation poised for battle against a shadowy enemy \nthat has as its aim the destruction of America and all that we stand \nfor. Our President has prepared us for a sustained military campaign. \nAt this time, there can be no higher priority than to pass this \ncritically important legislation to support our armed services and the \nmen and women who we will send into this battle to defend our freedom. \nLet us join together as Americans to provide our military with the \nfunds they need, unencumbered by the distractions of debates better \nargued on another day.\n  Senator Inhofe is right to be concerned about our national energy \npolicy. I think all of us in this Chamber share with the American \npeople a sense of concern that we lack a comprehensive national energy \nplan for the future; one that combines the promises of new technologies \nand conservation with the important contribution of traditional fossil \nfuels in a responsible, efficient and clean manner.\n  But the time to debate the merits of the energy policy proposed by \nthe White House and passed by our colleagues in the House is not today, \nand certainly not as an amendment to the defense authorization bill. We \nare talking about a debate of a 500-page, $40 billion energy package. \nThe Joint Tax Committee has estimated that it will give $33.5 billion \nin tax breaks to industry over the next ten years. We cannot afford to \nbe that fiscally irresponsible as we take on the new challenges of our \nwar on terrorism.\n  More controversially, Senator Inhofe's amendment would open the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil production. In the view of \nmany, myself included, opening the refuge is not just bad environmental \npolicy, it is bad energy policy and would do little to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil. Most importantly, the refuge would not \nprovide a drop of oil for at least a decade. This 10-year figure is a \nconservative estimate that was made by the Department of Interior under \nPresident Bush's father. Hopefully, our current crisis will have passed \nten years from now.\n  Debating the merits of these, and other, provisions will take time. \nThere will be deep divisions and much disagreement. As Senator \nMurkowski said just last week, consideration of energy\n\n[[Page S9843]]\n\nlegislation on the defense bill is ``inappropriate. [T]here is a place \nfor the consideration of domestic energy development. . . . That \nbelongs in the energy bill where it should be debated by all individual \nmembers.''\n  The security of our energy supply is an essential question as we \nenter this phase in our history, and we will have that debate. But this \nis not the time nor place. We have just lost nearly seven thousand of \nour citizens to terrible attacks, and the Senate must put its \ndifferences aside. Now is the time for unity of purpose. Let us leave \nthis debate for another day and focus with moon-shot intensity on the \ntask at hand: supporting our armed forces. We cannot afford the \ndistraction that this amendment would create.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, as Chair of the Senate Armed Services \nPersonnel Subcommittee, I am very pleased to have joined with Senator \nTim Hutchinson to introduce an important change to the current method \nfor hiring Department of Defense physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and \nother health care professionals.\n  Like the private sector, the Department of Defense has been beginning \nto experience difficulties in recruiting certain health care \nprofessionals. At both the June 14, 2001, Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee hearing on the looming nursing shortage and the June 27, \n2001, Governmental Affairs Subcommittee hearing on the Federal \nGovernment's role in retaining nurses for delivery of federally funded \nhealth care services, I emphasized an alarming statistic that the \nFederal health sector, employing approximately 45,000 nurses, may be \nthe hardest hit in the near future with an estimated 47 percent of its \nnursing workforce eligible for retirement by the year 2004.\n  The need for military health care workers will be further intensified \nwith the increased need for action by our national security forces in \nlight of last week's terrorist attacks on America. Currently, the \nOffice of Personnel Management, OPM, must process all applications and \nthe response times range from 115 to 161 days. This protracted \nprocessing time contributes to the shortage of needed staff and \nsometimes losing a qualified applicant. The Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA, already has this authority and has reported an advantage \nover other Federal agencies and a more equal playing field with the \nhighly competitive private sector in recruiting needed health care \nstaff.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our amendment to the Defense \nAuthorization bill to give the DoD this needed change in their \nregulations for hiring the health care staff needed to care for our \nservicemen, women and families. Now, more than ever we need to give \nthem all the tools they need to fulfill their vital mission.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the importance of \nenergy policy to our national security and to urge my colleagues to \nspeed passage of the Department of Defense Authorization bill.\n  A sound energy policy is critical to our Nation's security. The \nUnited States is currently 56 percent dependent on foreign oil. By \n2020, this number could rise to 70 percent. At that time, over 64 \npercent of the world's oil exports will come from Persian Gulf nations. \nI shudder to think what could happen if we allow ourselves to not only \nbecome so dependent on foreign oil, but also for our nation to become \nso dependent on such an unstable part of the world.\n  Senator Chuck Schumer and I have spent a great deal of time \ndeveloping a balanced, bipartisan energy plan which both increases \nsupply and decreases demand. Our plan would increase American self \nreliance by reducing the need for energy imports. Our plan would also \nbenefit consumers by reducing energy prices. We have a lot of good \nideas, and, at the right time and on the right vehicle, we would like \nthe opportunity to have them considered by the Senate.\n  However, now is not the right time and the Defense Authorization bill \nis not the right vehicle. Our first priorities must be to provide \nassistance to victims, to prevent future attacks, and to punish those \nresponsible for the horrible acts of terror that occurred on September \n11. A sound energy policy is critically important to the long-term \nviability of our national defense, as well as to virtually every \nsegment of society. We cannot, however, respond to terrorist attacks by \nrushing through a controversial energy bill that will affect the course \nof domestic policy in the United States for decades to come.\n  Indeed, California has shown us what can happen when poor energy \npolicies are hastily adopted. Californians will suffer from excessive \nenergy prices for years upon years as a result of a poorly conceived \nenergy plan. We should not risk similarly burdening all Americans by \nhastily attaching energy legislation to a defense bill.\n  Issues of timing and appropriateness aside, some of the energy \nproposals that have been heralded as necessary in the wake of the \nterrorist attacks of September 11 are in fact poor energy policy and \npoor environmental policy. I find particularly disingenuous the \nargument that we need to make an immediate decision on opening the \ncoastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.\n  Drilling in ANWR will not provide any oil in time to help fuel our \nforces fighting the scourge of terrorism. If we were to open ANWR to \noil drilling today, it would still take up to 10 years for the oil to \nmake it to market. Furthermore, according to a report by the US \nGeological Survey, there is only about a 6-month supply of economically \nrecoverable oil in ANWR. Clearly, 6 months of oil 10 years from now \nwon't do much to help America respond to the terrible tragedies of \nSeptember 11.\n  We can achieve greater and more immediate energy security by \nincreasing our energy efficiency. According to one scientist who \ntestified before the Senate Government Affairs Committee last year, the \nUnited States could cut reliance on foreign oil by more than 50 percent \nby increasing energy efficiency by 2.2 percent per year. This is a much \ngreater benefit than the few percent improvement that drilling in ANWR \nwould provide, and the benefits could start almost immediately--not in \n10 years. I note that the United States has a tremendous record of \nincreasing energy efficiency when we put our minds to it: following the \n1979 OPEC energy shock, the United States increased its energy \nefficiency by 3.2 percent per year for several years. With today's \nimprovements in technology, 2.2 percent is easily attainable.\n  In addition, Senators Feinstein, Snowe, Schumer and I introduced \nlegislation earlier this year that would save consumers a million \nbarrels of oil per day and billions of dollars by increasing CAFE \nstandards for SUVs. That legislation would do far more to increase our \nenergy security than would drilling in the Arctic.\n  We should also do more to promote alternative fuels. According to an \nanalysis prepared by the Department of Energy, if only 10 percent of \nthe gasoline in American cars were replaced with alternative fuels, the \nprice of oil would fall by $3 per barrel and Americans would save over \n$20 billion a year, in addition to greatly improving our energy \nsecurity.\n  The chair and ranking members of the Energy Committee, Senators \nBingaman and Murkowski, have put a tremendous amount of effort into \ndeveloping comprehensive energy proposals. Each of their proposals \ncontain many, many excellent provisions. I would like to thank them and \nall members of the energy committee for their hard work. However, I \nmust emphasize that their work is too important, and the implications \nfor the entire Nation too significant, to be hurriedly attached to \nanother bill without adequate time for debate.\n  We need to adopt balanced legislation to increase our energy \nsecurity, but we need to do so in a rational manner. Energy security is \ntoo important not to be addressed on its own merits by the full Senate. \nFurthermore, our defense needs are too important not to allow the \nDefense Authorization bill to go forward. Senators Levin and Warner \nhave worked extremely hard on that bill, and have put together a bill \nthat is critical for the defense of our Nation. I implore all of my \ncolleagues, please, for the good of America, speed passage of the \nDefense Authorization bill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment to S. \n1438, the fiscal year 2002 National Defense Authorization Act, to \nprovide funds badly needed for two vital test support activities in the \nDepartment of Defense. The Big Crow program provides\n\n[[Page S9844]]\n\nDoD with highly sophisticated airborne electronic warfare capabilities \nthat enable us to test our newest weapon systems and technologies in a \nrealistic battle environment in which electronic warfare is likely to \nbe used. The system can also be used operationally if a requirement \nsuddenly occurs. The Defense Systems Evaluation, DSE, program provides \naircraft to replicate enemy and friendly aircraft in testing Army air \ndefense programs and technology. Both of these programs provide vital \ntest support assets used by all the military services. Unfortunately, \nit is typical for programs that provide cross-service support to be \ninadequately funded by their parent service organization. This year's \nPresident's budget request did not seek any funding for these programs, \nperhaps relying on the Congress, once again, to provide the emergency \nfunds needed to keep them operating.\n  Thus we find ourselves again this year, seeking the funding needed \nfor these two programs in order for them to continue to provide vital \ntest support activities for all of the military services. The \namendment, which Senator Domenici and I offer, will provide the minimum \nnecessary funding to enable Big Crow and DSE to operate during fiscal \nyear 2002.\n  There are other test support programs in the DoD that suffer the same \ncircumstance as the two for which I am seeking funding. They refer to \nthem in the Pentagon as ``the orphans.'' The Defense Science Board, \nDSB, recently completed a review of operational testing and evaluation \nin the Department of Defense and published a report containing a number \nof significant recommendations about how to improve that process to \nmake it more effective and efficient. The DSB recommended that DoD seek \nways to encourage and implement joint service testing. Among their \nrecommendations, the DSB endorsed budget oversight responsibility for \norphan programs such as Big Crow and DSE to the Director, Operational \nTest and Evaluation in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Actual \ntest and evaluation activities would remain the province of the \nmilitary services.\n  This year's Defense Authorization bill reported out by the Armed \nServices Committee contains a provision requesting the Secretary of \nDefense to review the DSB report and to submit recommendations \nregarding its implementation with the budget request submission for \nfiscal year 2003. I am hopeful that the Secretary will endorse the DSB \nfindings so that the Department will finally exercise appropriate \noversight and support for cross-service test activities. In the \nmeantime, the amendment I am introducing is necessary to keep those \nessential test activities underway. I urge my colleagues to support its \nadoption.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I urge the adoption of the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments have been agreed to by \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I am not hearing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments were agreed to by unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  If it requires that I now move to reconsider the vote and to lay that \nmotion on the table, I do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was part of the unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Now, Madam President, first, the chairman and I, together with the \ntwo senior appropriators of the Senate and our counterparts in the \nHouse, started today at the Pentagon, with the Secretary of Defense, \nhis senior staff, and the designated new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff.\n  The chairman and I open every day expressing our profound gratitude \nto the men and women of the Armed Forces and their families, and \nparticularly our concerns are everlasting for those who suffered loss \nof life and injury, and the families associated with those victims on \nSeptember 11.\n  After this meeting, I walked around again to that site where that \nplane committed a terrorist act against the symbol of the U.S. military \nstrength, the Department of Defense.\n  I am pleased to report that, in my judgment, the Secretary is moving \nforward on a broad range of fronts to address all issues that the \nPresident, in his memorable speech, raised before the Congress.\n  Expressing for myself, and I think all others, we have tremendous \nconfidence in the men and women of the Armed Forces in their ability to \ncarry out the diverse set of missions, any one of which may face them \nat any time as we address the terrorist acts inflicted on the country, \nand to take every step to prepare that it shall not be repeated.\n  I commend our President and, indeed, the Secretaries of Defense and \nState, who were here yesterday and briefed almost 90 Senators on a wide \nrange of issues.\n  So the consultation between the executive branch and the legislative \nbranch, particularly those of us who have the oversight responsibility, \nI think is more than adequate and certainly within the spirit of all \nthe various laws, beginning with our Constitution, which says that the \nSenate and the House, as a congress, are a coequal branch of the \nGovernment.\n  I join with my distinguished chairman in saying how important this \nbill is for the men and women of the Armed Forces. As we sat there at \nour breakfast this morning, there were further announcements on callups \nand movements of these individuals in uniform and the impact on their \nfamilies.\n  It is absolutely imperative we move forward with this bill. On the \nmatters that were addressed last night, which for a period of time held \nup consideration of this bill, those Senators were acting within their \nrights as Senators on matters which are of great concern. I am hopeful \nthat those two issues can be resolved.\n  As our chairman said, Senator Daschle, Senator Lott, and Senator Reid \nare around the clock working on these issues, together with other \nSenators.\n  So I am optimistic that we can move forward and continue to work on \nthis bill on Monday and proceed to a resolution and passage in a timely \nway to show that the Senate of the United States, in joining the House \nof Representatives, is prepared to have a bill to go to the President \nshortly, authorizing the very special needs we have at this time in our \nhistory.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I thank my chairman. We have \nbeen working together for at least 23 years. We have more work to do.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Neither of us shows it in terms of the youthful visage we \npresent.\n  Mr. WARNER. Whatever you say.\n  I thank my chairman. And I hope he has a safe journey wherever he is \ntraveling on this important observance of the religious holiday.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We not only want to thank our good friend from Virginia \nfor those thoughts about the religious holiday--which I am now going to \nleave here to celebrate--but I want to thank him for the sensitivity \nwhich he has shown to that issue and to every other issue that involves \npersonal lives. He has consistently done that for 23 years. It is part \nof his makeup. He has very much worried whether I would be able to \nleave here in time today to get to synagogue. I very much appreciate \nhis consideration.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my colleague for his remarks.\n  I believe we would be able to say to the Senate, having consulted \nwith the distinguished majority leader and Republican leader, that in \ndue course they may come to this Chamber with regard to certain \nprocedural situations which would address our return to this bill on \nMonday. I do not want to prejudge their final statement, but I am \noptimistic they will be forthcoming and we can reach resolution \nprocedurally on some of our matters.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Talking about optimism, as I mentioned to my friend from \nVirginia, I have been optimistic since last night that we were going to \nbe able to work out the issue which temporarily held us up yesterday. \nThat one now seems very resolvable.\n  There is one big problem relative to a matter that is not related to \nthis bill. That is the only problem that I see in the way. But our \nleaders will have more to say about that in a few minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9845]]\n\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9845-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to engage my colleagues and the American people \nin a discussion of the events of September 11, 2001. All of us \nrecognize that much of our lives have been touched and some things have \nbeen changed forever. If it is axiomatic to say that about our country \nand the communities I represent and where I live in northern New \nJersey, it may be as true as anywhere in the Nation.\n  There is not a small town or a city in northern New Jersey that has \nnot been touched or changed. At the time the final body has been found \nand the search has concluded, 2,000 to 3,000 people in New Jersey may \nhave lost their lives. It is estimated there are 1,500 orphans in my \nState. It struck everywhere.\n  In Middletown, NJ, 36 people have been lost. It is estimated it could \ngo as high as 70. In Basking Ridge, where Jon Corzine and I visited a \nfew days ago, 14 people were lost, two more than in all of World War \nII. In a single elementary school in Ridgewood, NJ, 6 children lost \ntheir fathers.\n  The loss of lives in Korea or Vietnam or World War II took years to \naccumulate. In my State of New Jersey, lives were lost in minutes.\n  We say the Nation will never be the same. We say that life has \nchanged. Those are words. We do not know what they mean. All we can \nattest is that it is large, it is dramatic, and things will be \ndifferent. Now we fill in the blanks. How will it be different and why?\n  The pain is so great and the loss is so enormous that our instinct is \nto strike immediately, overwhelmingly with the power in our possession, \nand, indeed, we will strike, but it must be thoughtful and it must be \ncareful because it must be successful.\n  Our instinct is, because we understand there is no liberty without \nsecurity, that we must immediately enhance law enforcement with money, \nwith people, and with new powers. Indeed, many of these new powers are \njustified and must be required. Everything from increasing electronic \nsurveillance to expanding wiretap authority to giving the CIA greater \naccess to grand jury materials is being proposed. Some of it is long \noverdue, and already I think the Congress can justify acting.\n  There is no reason to have a 5-year statute of limitations on \nterrorist activities. The Nation has no statute of limitations for \ntreason or for murder. Terrorism is every much as insidious and the \nstatute of limitations should be lifted.\n  The Government clearly needs to have greater powers for dealing with \nmoney laundering. We recognize this from our fight against the \nnarcotics trade, and it is true with terrorism. The laws are antiquated \nand must be changed.\n  The electronics telecommunications revolution has probably \nnecessitated change in electronic monitoring as well.\n  These things we can justify, but it is here where I urge caution \nbecause we are in pain, because we are vulnerable, and because we \nrecognize that our security is in such danger there is a rush to \njudgment on issues of civil liberties. It is here where I draw the \nline.\n  Everything can be discussed, and the Congress should be willing to \nlisten to many, but it is the responsibility of this Congress, under \nthe architecture designed by the Founding Fathers, and primarily the \nduty of this Senate where passions cool, better judgment reigns, civil \nliberties which are compromised. A Constitution which is changed to \ndeal with the necessities of an emergency is not so easily restored \nwhen the peace is guaranteed and a victory won.\n\n  If this Congress surrenders civil liberties and rearranges \nconstitutional rights to deal with these terrorists, then their \ngreatest victory will not have been won in New York but in Washington.\n  Any administration can defeat terrorism by surrendering civil \nliberties and changing the Constitution. Our goal is to defeat \nterrorism, remain who we are, and retain the best about ourselves while \ndefeating terrorism. It is more difficult, but it is what history \nrequires us to do.\n  The history of our Nation is replete with contrary examples, and we \nneed to learn by them. They are instructive. For even the greats of \nAmerican political life have given in to the temptation of our worst \ninstincts to defeat our worst enemies and lose the best about \nourselves. Indeed, the very architect of our independence, John Adams, \nunder the threat of British and French subversion, supported the Alien \nand Sedition Acts, compromising the very freedom of expression he had \nhelped to bring to the American people only a decade before. He lived \nwith the blemish of those acts on his public life until the day he \ndied.\n  Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator, the savior of our Union \nsuspended the Constitution, its right of habeas corpus, imprisoning \npolitical opponents to save the Union.\n  Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had the honor of saving the Nation not \nonce but through the Great Depression and the Second World War, \nimprisoned Japanese Americans and some German and Italian Americans in \na hasty effort at national security which has lived as a national \nshame.\n  If these great men, pillars of our democracy, compromised better \njudgment in time of national crisis, it should temper our instincts. \nTheir actions should speak volumes about the need for caution at a time \nof national challenge.\n  There is another side. There are better instincts among us. The \nAmerican people are speaking of them all across the Nation. They \nrecognize the need to balance security and civil liberties, to change \nthat which is required to assure victory, but recognizing that victory \nis measured not only by security but also by our liberties.\n  Across the Nation, the American people have provided us many measures \nof their strength as they exercise those liberties, engaging in open \ndebate about how the Nation responds, giving unprecedented levels of \ndonations--$200 million to the Red Cross alone.\n  They reached out across races and religions to express concern about \neach other and for the safety of Arab Americans and Muslim Americans.\n  They are reminders of how much the Nation has grown from previous \nsuccesses.\n  I rise in recognition of these national strengths and these concerns \nand commend in particular Senator Leahy who has extended, on behalf of \nthe Senate, our desire to work with the administration to enhance the \npowers of law enforcement and to provide the necessary resources. But I \nthink he speaks for many Members of the Senate--he certainly speaks for \nme--when he also asks that we act deliberately and prudently.\n  I ask we expand that debate because history will require, and I \nbelieve the American people will demand, that we not merely review what \nnew powers must be given to law enforcement and the intelligence \ncommunity, we must not simply debate what new resources financially are \nrequired, but there is some need for some accounting of those previous \npowers and resources.\n  At a time when we are still seeking survivors and counting the dead, \nno one wants to cast blame. I do not rise to cast blame, but I do ask \nfor accountability.\n  I may represent 3,000 families who lost fathers and mothers and \nsisters and brothers and children. They demand military protection by \nbringing our forces abroad. They ask that we strengthen law enforcement \nat home. But somebody is going to have to visit these cities and small \ntowns and answer to these families, where are the resources we gave in \nthe past? What of the enormous intelligence and security and law \nenforcement apparatus we have built through these decades? What \nhappened?\n  This is not to assess blame. It is so we can only learn how to \ncorrect these\n\n[[Page S9846]]\n\nerrors and improve these systems if we understand the failures.\n  It is reported in the media that the United States, in what would \notherwise be a classified figure, may spend $30 billion per year on \nintelligence services, including the CIA and the NSA.\n  The Washington Post reports the FBI counterterrorism spending grew to \n$423 million this year, a figure which in the last 8 years has grown by \n300 percent. It is not enough to ask for more. It is necessary to \nassess what went wrong. Did leadership fail? Were the plans inadequate? \nDid we have the wrong people, or were they on the wrong mission?\n  Earlier this week, the Washington Post reported that over the past 2 \nyears the Central Intelligence Agency had provided to the FBI the names \nof 100 suspected associates of Osama bin Laden who were either in or on \ntheir way to the United States. Yet the Washington Post concludes that \nthe FBI ``was ill equipped and unprepared'' to deal with this \ninformation.\n  Some of the allegations reported in the media are stunning and deeply \ntroubling, not simply about what happened but revealing about our \ninability to deal with the current crisis. Previous terrorist \ninvestigations, it is alleged, produced boxes of evidentiary material \nwritten in Arabic that remained unanalyzed for lack of translators. \nDuring the 1993 World Trade Center bombing trial, agents discovered \nthat photos and drawings outlining the plot had been in their \npossession for 3 years, but they had not been analyzed.\n  Since 1996, the FBI had evidence that international terrorists were \nlearning to fly passenger jets at U.S. flight schools, but that does \nnot seem to have obviously raised sufficient concern, and there was no \napparent action.\n  In August, the FBI received notice from French intelligence that one \nman who had paid cash to use flight simulators in Minnesota was a \n``radical Islamic extremist'' with ties to Afghani terrorist training \ncamps. Regrettably, this intelligence information was apparently not \nseen in the greater context of an actual threat that has now been \nrealized.\n\n  On August 23 of this year, a few weeks before the World Trade Center \nwas attacked, the CIA alerted the FBI that two suspected terrorist \nassociates of Bin Laden were in the United States. The INS confirmed \ntheir presence in the United States, and the FBI launched a search. It \nwas obviously unsuccessful.\n  It is hard to know where to begin. Life goes on, but not so quickly. \nWho here will come to New Jersey with me and visit these thousands of \nfamilies who pay their taxes and ask little of their country, maybe \nnothing of their Government, other than to keep them secure, protect \ntheir liberties, and let them live their lives? Somebody failed the \nAmerican people.\n  I know my constituents will ask me, as their representative in the \nSenate, to authorize foreign military adventures to find those \nresponsible, and I have done that, and the President has my support. \nThey will not want this pain to be shared with other Americans, so they \nwill ask my support financially and by changing Federal statutes to \nensure this never happens again, and that will have my support. Some of \nthese children, some of the widows or widowers, are going to ask: \nSenator, how did this happen? All of this money and all of these \nresources. Why was somebody not watching to defend my family, my \ncountry, my child?\n  We can postpone that accountability, but it has to happen. These \nterrorist cells that consumed these lives and shooked our Nation to the \ncore and now send us into foreign battle were not organized last month. \nThis attack was not planned on the morning of September 11, 2001. Many \nof those arrested or detained for this terrorist attack were from the \nsame area and may have had the same relationships to the 1993 bombing \nof the World Trade Center in New York. What level of surprise could \nthis represent? There needs to be an explanation.\n  On behalf of the people of my State, if I need to return to this \nChamber every day of every week of every month, this Senate is going to \nvote for some board of inquiry. I joined my colleagues after the \nChallenger accident, recognizing that that loss of life, the failure of \ntechnology and leadership, indicated something was wrong in NASA. The \nboard of inquiry reformed NASA and the technology and gave it new \nleadership, and it served the Nation well.\n  After Pearl Harbor, we recognized something was wrong militarily. We \nhad a board of inquiry. We found those responsible, we held them \naccountable, and we instituted the changes.\n  Indeed, that formula has served this Nation for years in numerous \ncrises. Now I call for it again. First, review the circumstances \nsurrounding this tragedy, the people responsible, the resources that \nwere available, where there was a failure of action, and make \nrecommendations and assign responsibility. Second, develop \nrecommendations for changes of law or resources or personnel so it does \nnot happen again. I cannot imagine we will do less. I call upon us to \ndo more. I will not be satisfied with new assignments of powers or \nappropriating more money. I want to know what went wrong, and why, and \nwho.\n  Just as we have moved forward, we need to give one glance back over \nour shoulder and give these families some answers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Having had the opportunity to visit New Jersey last \nweek, I listened intently to the comments of my good friend and must \nsay I was very moved with the presentation made by the various mayors \nwho saw fit to share the extent of that tragedy--not only the residents \nof their communities, but the tremendous burden put on these areas to \naddress the recovery efforts associated with the reality that nearly a \nthird of the estimated number lost were residents of the State of New \nJersey.\n  I extend my sympathies and assure my colleague of my willingness to \nassist him and his constituents in this terrible tragedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9846-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9846-S9851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ENERGY SECURITY\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a reality \nthat our Nation is at war. I think we all agree that never before have \nwe been so blatantly or cowardly attacked as a consequence of this new \nform of terrorism, commercial airplanes having been used as weapons of \nterrorism. As we propose to prosecute this war, we need to make certain \nour Nation, our people, and our economy are prepared and ready for the \nbattles to come.\n  I rise today to discuss one part of how America should work to ensure \none portion, and that is our energy security. The reality is that \nAmerica is dependent today on foreign sources for 57 percent of the oil \nwe consume. Further, we are importing most of this oil from unstable \nforeign regimes. It is no secret to any Member of this body. I have \nstood on the floor many times to remind my colleagues that we are \ncurrently importing a million barrels a day from Iraq, while, at the \nsame time, the inconsistency of the manner that we are enforcing a no-\nfly zone; namely, an area blockade, putting the lives of America's men \nand women at risk in enforcing this no-fly zone. We are funding Saddam \nHussein at the time when we consider him a great risk and potentially \nassociated with alleged funding of terrorists.\n  After the tragic and horrifying events of September 11, it is \npatently obvious that we must now prepare for war, and it is equally \nobvious that the tools of war are driven by one source of energy, and \nthat is oil. The aircraft, the helicopter, the gunships, and the \ndestroyers do not run on natural gas. They do not run on solar or hot \nair. In peacetime alone, our military uses more than 300,000 barrels of \noil each day. I remind my colleagues that oil must be refined. I can \nonly imagine how that number will rise in the coming weeks, the coming \nmonths. Hopefully not the coming years.\n  It should also be obvious that the country cannot depend on unstable \nregimes such as Iraq to meet our energy needs without compromising our \nnational security. I have the greatest respect for our friends \nthroughout the world, especially those in this hemisphere, especially \nmy friends in Canada. However, it only makes sense for America to take \nsteps to put its own energy house in order. We need to conserve our \nenergy, improve our energy efficiency, but we also need to produce\n\n[[Page S9847]]\n\nas much energy as we can domestically so we can lessen our dependence \non foreign sources.\n  I come today in response to comments by Canada's Environmental \nMinister, Mr. David Anderson. I will read from an article that appeared \nin Reuters news service yesterday. I ask unanimous consent it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Canada Urges Against Hasty U.S. Move on Arctic Oil\n\n                          (By David Ljunggren)\n\n       Ottawa.--Canada urged the United States yesterday not to \n     take a ``hasty and ill-considered'' decision to start \n     drilling in an Alaskan wildlife refuge, something which \n     Ottawa implacably opposes.\n       Canada has long objected to U.S. plans to drill in the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), saying it would ruin \n     the calving ground of the Porcupine caribou herd upon which \n     native Gwich'in Indians in both Alaska and Canada depend.\n       But Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe is threatening to add \n     language this week to a multibillion-dollar defense-spending \n     bill to allow drilling in ANWR as a way to secure future U.S. \n     oil supplies.\n       ``It's particularly important at times when you have a \n     crisis on your hands to make sure you don't make hasty and \n     ill-considered decisions,'' Canadian Environment Minister \n     David Anderson told Reuters.\n       ``It's also very important at times like this, when energy \n     security is a major issue, that you consider all factors and \n     not go ahead without the normal analysis and the thought that \n     would go into such a decision,'' he said in an interview.\n       Canada, which says both countries should provide permanent \n     protection for the wildlife populations that straddle the \n     border, has already slapped a development ban on areas \n     frequented by the Porcupine herd.\n       ``We still believe (drilling) to be the wrong decision, we \n     do not believe the American security situation in any way \n     justifies a change in that position,'' said Anderson.\n       Canadian Energy Minister Ralph Goodale last week said there \n     are plenty of other energy sources in North America that \n     could be developed before ANWR needed to be touched. These \n     included the vast tar sands of Alberta, which are believed to \n     be richer that the entire reserves of Saudi Arabia.\n       Supporters of opening the refuge say U.S. oil supplies from \n     the Middle East are at risk and the Alaska wilderness \n     reserves are needed to make up any possible shortfall.\n       ``That is in our view a highly questionable approach. This \n     should be based on long-term strategic considerations--none \n     of this oil, if it were drilled, is going to come on flow for \n     a number of years,'' Anderson told Reuters.\n       He said there was no evidence of a shortfall in supplies \n     from the Middle East and pointed to an almost 15 percent fall \n     in the price of crude oil yesterday as supply fears eased.\n       Anderson was speaking from the western city of Winnipeg, \n     Manitoba, after briefing provincial ministers on the \n     international efforts to combat global warming.\n       Delegates from around 180 countries failed in July to agree \n     to changes to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on cutting emissions of \n     the greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. They are due \n     to try again next month in Marrakesh, Morocco, and Anderson \n     said he expected that meeting to go ahead.\n       ``Our hope is that the civilized world will be able to deal \n     with the issue of terrorism and still maintain its values in \n     a number of areas,'' he said.\n       ``We have a large number of global issues, including global \n     warming, which cannot simply be ignored. . . . We have long-\n     term interests as nations and they continue even though we \n     clearly have a major short-to-medium-term problem--I'm \n     talking years now--on terrorism.''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Canada's Environmental Minister, Mr. Anderson, this \nweek urged America not to make hasty and ill-considered decisions to \nallow oil exploration in a tiny part of the Arctic coastal plain in \nAlaska just because of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon, which claimed more than 6,000 American lives.\n  First, I am a friend of Canada. We are neighbors. We are separated \nfrom the contiguous States by Canada. I serve on the U.S.-Canada \nInterparliamentary Conference. I have been chairman of that committee, \nand I have there a number of friends and associates. I have the highest \nregard for our relationship with Canada, which is a very unique \nrelationship, very friendly, and one based on healthy competition. For \nMr. Anderson to make such a statement, given Canada's current energy \npolicy, is truly the height of hypocrisy.\n  Let me address this in a series of charts. First, Canada has worked \nto tap energy from its own Northwest Territories, which, frankly, they \nhave every right to do, and I support. But a good portion of that \nactivity is going on within the migratory range of the Porcupine \ncaribou.\n  Let me show the division of Alaska and Canada. This map shows the \nCanadian activity on the Canadian side of the Northwest Territories and \nrecognition of significant offshore activities, as well as onshore \nactivities. This is the general manner in which the Porcupine caribou \ngo across the border. Dempster Highway goes through this area. I show \nthis because it gives folks a bit of geography for the area and a \ndescription of what we are talking about.\n  This is proposed ANWR, and the 1002 area, and the effort to address \nthe authorization by Congress to open 1.5 million acres for \nexploration. The Canadian activity is in a much broader area. It is, of \ncourse, appropriate that Canada makes its own decisions. They certainly \nhave every right to do it. I point out a good portion of the activity \nis going on within the migratory range of the Porcupine caribou herd \nand is something our Canadian friends do not want to acknowledge. This \nis the same herd that occasionally in the last 2 years was on the \nAlaskan side. Canada claims it wants to protect them, and so do we. But \nthey suggest it be done by preventing oil development in the 1002 \nregion.\n\n  Here are the facts associated with the Canadian activity. Canada \nfirst drilled 86 wells, exploration wells, in an area finding nothing. \nThis was in the Norman Wells area and they chose to make a park out of \nit. I admire and appreciate that. It is a small area and if they made a \npark out of it after they pretty well exhausted the prospects of \nfinding oil and gas, and I am perfectly willing to make a park out of \nANWR after we make a significant determination that there was oil and \ngas to address the security needs of this country, if that was the will \nof Congress.\n  In any event, in the 1970s and 1980s there were 89 wells drilled in \nthis area, including 2 in the exact area that the Nation made into what \nwe call the Ivvavik National Park. That was only after they were dry \nholes.\n  Canada built--and I want to show this on another map--the Dempster \nHighway. This is not a very vivid map. Here again is Alaska, here is \nCanada, and here is the Dempster Highway, which runs right through the \nmigratory route of the Porcupine caribou. So you see this highway goes \nright through the range. They did this to facilitate oil-drilling \nequipment moving into the region and to provide access, which is \ncertainly reasonable.\n  In the past 3 years, Canada has moved to markedly expand its own oil \nand gas development in the migratory route of the caribou. As a matter \nof fact, in 1999 and 2000, Canada, according to a series of articles in \nthe Vancouver Sun newspaper, offered six onshore lease areas for oil \nand gas exploration in the area. I ask unanimous consent the articles \nfrom the Vancouver Sun be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Vancouver Sun, June 11, 2001]\n\n                   Drilling for Oil on Gwich'in Land\n\n                           (By Stephen Hume)\n\n       Tsiigehtchic, N.W.T.--Grace Blake pauses in mid-sentence \n     and looks out the window of the Gwich'in Cultural and Social \n     Institute where she's the acting executive director.\n       Her gaze swings past the white spire of the Roman Catholic \n     Church, past the cemetery's white crosses buried in white \n     snowdrifts and slips over the frozen white confluence of the \n     Mackenzie and Arctic Red Rivers reaching for something beyond \n     what is visible to me.\n       Despite a bleached, blinding intensity to the exterior \n     landscape that seeps into the emotional landscape the two of \n     us occupy, the moment seems as still as frosted glass, \n     brittle--and it prompts a sudden memory from 30 years before.\n       ``Look for what's whiter than white,'' the old Gwich'in \n     hunter told me then, teaching me not far from here how to \n     pick-off winter plumaged ptarmigan with the lovely little \n     Browning .22 that I still have packed away in its case \n     somewhere.\n       ``Find a patch of snow that's whiter than the snow--then \n     look for the black dot. That's the eye looking at you. Shoot \n     there, won't spoil the meat.''\n       Tsiigehtchic has always been a point of convergence for the \n     old values, a place where people can still feel profound \n     spiritual connections to the land and anguish at the \n     dislocations of modernity, a place where to be a hunter is \n     not considered backward, but someone to be respected.\n       The reverence shows in the photographs of elders adorning \n     the walls where Grace supervises the recording of stories and \n     legends and research into the cultural heritage of people \n     whose ancestors might have been among the first peoples to \n     arrive in North America--\n\n[[Page S9848]]\n\n     maybe 12,000 years ago, maybe 30,000. The archaeology of the \n     Old Crow flats isn't as precise as historians might like, but \n     it was a long, long time before this, anyway.\n       The first time I was here, I visited sights where the \n     ancient habitation patterns were being uncovered by scholars \n     from the south even as a new way of life swept over the \n     Mackenzie delta. I've come back here to renew my acquaintance \n     with the place on the eve of another petroleum boom, although \n     this time the development may be transformed by the new North \n     as much as it transforms life for the people who live here.\n       More than a quarter of a century ago, when Grace was a \n     beautiful young woman with her eight children still in her \n     future, Tsiigehtchic represented an oasis of intelligent calm \n     in the petroleum boom that swept over the vast delta of the \n     Mackenzie River.\n       Back then the bush rang with the explosions of crews \n     shooting seismic surveys. Drill rigs punched more than 250 \n     wells through the permafrost and charted the outline of a \n     Canadian elephant, the nation's second largest reservoir of \n     conventional oil and natural gas--perhaps 1.5 billion barrels \n     of crude and another 10 trillion cubic feet of gas.\n       Bush planes and corporate Learjets came and went in such \n     numbers that the airport at Inuvik, a town freshly cut from \n     the raw, red banks of the Mackenzie, recorded aircraft \n     movements on a scale with Chicago and Dallas. The town of Old \n     Crow, just across the border in the northern Yukon, \n     population 300, inherited an air strip capable of handling \n     big multi-engine jets.\n       Up the winter ice highway at Tuktoyaktuk, where the \n     inhabitants still carry the names of American whalers and \n     Scottish traders who arrived under sail, the town was a \n     frenzy of marine activity. There were drilling ships, \n     resupply barges and new islands were even being built out in \n     the shallows of the Beaufort Sea so that rigs could drill \n     without fear of ice floes.\n       Through the airport lounges came a steady stream of oil \n     workers: geologists still sunburnt from work in the African \n     deserts; helicopter pilots from Vietnam wearing long-billed \n     hats and mirrored sunglasses; toolpushes fresh from \n     Indonesia; consultants with clipboards, bureaucrats with \n     briefcases and seismic crews toting sleeping bags rated for \n     60 below zero.\n       The old hunter, now long dead, had laughed at the spectacle \n     as he restrung a pair of long, wide-bodied snowshoes for his \n     nephew: ``My great-great-granddad met Alexander Mackenzie. He \n     went. These roughnecks, they'll go. You'll go. But us, we're \n     not gonna go. We'll be here as long as this river.''\n       And he was right. As abruptly as the oil boomers had come, \n     they left. I left. Businesses withered. Towns that had seemed \n     frantic fell into a Rip Van Winkle-like lassitude and the \n     vastness of the Arctic closed over another example of human \n     vanity.\n       Now, with an energy-hungry America once again eyeing the \n     North as a potential source for its long-term needs, the \n     delta quivers with an eerie sense of anticipation as \n     somewhere over the horizon the second coming of the oil rush \n     and planning for the pipelines required to carry the rich \n     resources south gather momentum.\n       Inuvik Mayor Peter Clerkson says he expects the number of \n     active rigs in the Mackenzie delta will quadruple next year \n     and double again in 2003.\n       ``This won't slow down for the next three to four years,'' \n     he says. ``If the pipeline decision goes ahead it will \n     project out a long way. That pipeline is very important for \n     long-term sustained growth. We've had booms before. We need \n     long-term growth.''\n       He's optimistic because of aboriginal involvement, not in \n     spite of it.\n       Perhaps there's a signal here for British Columbia, where \n     land claims settlements are stalled, uncertainty stunts \n     investment potential and Premier Gordon Campbell is \n     contemplating what promises to be a divisive referendum on \n     the issue, however bland the final question.\n       Yet in the Northwest Territories, generous land settlements \n     have had an enormously positive impact on natives and \n     nonnatives alike, the mayor says.\n       ``You've got land settlements, the aboriginal groups are in \n     charge and the Inuvialuit have basically gone out and joint-\n     ventured with everyone. It's a much different game. It really \n     changes things. It's not only because they are aboriginal, \n     it's because they are local. This is their home. The money \n     stays in this economy.''\n       Over at the Gwich'in Tribal Council, newly-returned \n     executive assistant Lawrence Norbert, born 42 years ago in \n     Tsiigehtchic, says he's been ``grinning from ear-to-ear since \n     I got back.''\n       ``It's much different doing business with governments and \n     corporations now,'' he says. ``It's like there's a new \n     sheriff in town and they realize that the old way of doing \n     business is over for good. That's the up-side. We all know \n     where we stand now.''\n       As he and other aboriginals wait, the new drill rigs are \n     ready to rumble north. These units are equipped with special \n     design features that enable crews to work in the harsh winter \n     environment--captured engine heat is recirculated to keep \n     roughnecks' feet warm in temperatures cold enough to freeze \n     exposed flesh in minutes, for example.\n       The rigs can require 80 or more trucks to move their \n     components and cost up to $50 million each to construct. That \n     was the price tag on each of three just built in Edmonton by \n     Akita Drilling Ltd. and bound north for next winter's \n     exploration season.\n       As with northern Alberta and northeastern B.C., the \n     financial stakes are mind-boggling.\n       N.W.T. Finance Minister Joe Handley says it's estimated \n     that if all reserves in the Arctic are fully developed, they \n     will be worth $400 billion with royalties of $76 billion \n     flowing to Canada, another $11 billion to the N.W.T. and \n     billions more to the First Nations on whose treaty lands the \n     development will occur.\n       Even more than in northern Alberta, the term \n     ``Kuwaitification'' sidles into conversations about the \n     future implications. The entire population of N.W.T. would \n     leave empty seats around the end zones if it were to meet in \n     B.C. Place. And although the North's aboriginal population of \n     21,000 forms the majority, in total it's smaller than \n     Langley's.\n       The corollary is that when the new oil rush reaches its \n     zenith, the entire weight of it is likely to descend upon the \n     inhabitants of Tsiigehtchic. The village has the misfortune \n     to sit in an oil patch so rich that crude seeps out of the \n     river banks to stain the river. And the first rig into the \n     delta in a decade has already been drilling a few kilometres \n     away.\n       So this remote village of just over 170, as far north from \n     Vancouver as Mexico is south--this is where I decide to begin \n     the Arctic leg of my energy odyssey, talking about the \n     looming future with Grace, who is old enough to remember the \n     last big boom and wise enough, after an 11-year term as \n     chief, to worry about the next one.\n       I find her on a Saturday morning at the back door to her \n     log cabin, the ground freshly splattered with the bright \n     crimson but already-frozen blood of a caribou from the \n     immense Porcupine Herd that migrates between here and its \n     calving grounds in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge where U.S. \n     President George W. Bush wants to begin exploring for oil.\n       She'll talk, she agrees, but she won't invite me in. It's \n     an act of hospitality.\n       ``I was skinning this animal last night,'' she says. \n     ``Goodness, I've got hair all over everything in there.'' And \n     she leads the unexpected visitor down to the institute \n     offices, instead, to talk about how things have changed--and \n     not changed--with respect to petroleum development.\n       Almost 30 years ago, northern aboriginal communities \n     presented an opposition to the building of pipelines to carry \n     northern oil and gas down the Mackenzie Valley that was so \n     eloquent and united in purpose that a commission on the \n     matter headed by Tom Berger called for a 10-year moratorium \n     on development.\n       With no way of transporting the resource to markets in the \n     south, further exploration guttered out just about when world \n     markets entered a period of oil glut. Prices fell. The boom \n     ended.\n       Today, northern aboriginal leaders, including the Gwich'in, \n     are receptive rather than hostile, Grace says.\n       ``People are pretty open to development now, but they want \n     control. They don't want anybody to disturb certain selected \n     lands that they consider a priority. They want control, \n     that's their only stipulation and this time around, people \n     need to listen to us in the communities.''\n       Last time, she says, what happened in other northern \n     communities provided a textbook example for what to avoid \n     this time--but she wonders if anybody really took note.\n       ``Do they even know? Do they care about the potential loss \n     of a way of life for our people? Why haven't we studied the \n     social impacts on Inuvik, Tuktoyaktuk and Aklavik so we can \n     learn what to avoid? How do we protect our way of life? We \n     don't want to lose our way--that's all we are saying. We are \n     the last people living on the Porcupine caribou herd. We \n     don't want to lose that.\n       ``The Berger Report lays out everything the people want, so \n     we don't have to reinvent the wheel. Do it right, that's what \n     people are saying. Do it, but just do it right--meaning we \n     are the inhabitants of this country and we deserve to be \n     respected. And not just our leaders, the common folk.''\n       That's a view I'll hear corroborated by Fred Carmichael, \n     chair of the Gwich'in Tribal Council in Inuvik, who says the \n     sea-change in attitudes has a simple basis: the affirmation \n     of aboriginal title through land claims and the opportunity \n     to take equity positions in any development.\n       In fact, northern aboriginal leaders have hammered out a \n     tentative deal with energy companies to acquire as much as \n     one-third ownership of a proposed $3-billion pipeline down \n     the Mackenzie Valley to hook up with North America's supply \n     grid in Alberta.\n       ``The difference is that back then, we weren't the \n     landlords. Now we are the landlords and that's a big \n     difference. At the time of the Berger hearings, we wanted a \n     10-year moratorium while we got ready. We just weren't ready \n     then. Well, we got our 10 years and now we are ready.''\n       One of those who's preparing to reap the bonanza is Paul \n     Voudrach, a renewable resource officer at Tuktoyaktuk.\n       He and his wife Norma are in the process of buying out the \n     nonnative owners of the Tuk Inn, a 16-room hotel and coffee \n     shop, so that he can qualify for the preferential bookings \n     that will come the way of a registered Inuvialuit under \n     agreements hammered out during land claims.\n       Paul endured the last boom.\n       ``What came with it was a lot of social problems,'' he \n     says. ``We had a huge amount of money coming in and people \n     who didn't know how to handle it. But our leaders are \n     knowledgeable about these things now. They\n\n[[Page S9849]]\n\n     felt the impact last time. This time I think it will be \n     something that will benefit the community.''\n       Yet there's something grim about the atmosphere. Norma's \n     face is tight and nine-year-old Trish is inside despite the \n     fact that the town's annual jamboree is on.\n       Paul's son, John, he tells me, was killed the week before \n     on the ice highway from Invuik. The 25-year-old was helping \n     his boss at a local transport company bring a new pickup \n     truck back from Edmonston when it collided with one of their \n     own loaded gravel trucks hauling to one of the oil camps.\n       ``We were just sitting here waiting for him to come home. \n     We heard that he was stranded at Eagle Plains (on the \n     Dempster Highway) waiting for the road to open after a storm. \n     then we heard he had been in an accident and had been \n     killed.''\n       It's a reminder for everyone in the community, he says, \n     that the kind of boom that's coming will be tempered with \n     things that nobody expects, good and bad, half a dozen of one \n     to six of the other when it comes to benefits and problems.\n       ``What just happened to us, it opens your eyes. You think \n     there's going to be a tomorrow but there isn't. One minute \n     you are here, the next you are not. All your plans don't mean \n     anything. At least people here are a bit more aware now that \n     when the oil company comes with a job, that job can disappear \n     pretty fast.''\n       Maria Canton, filling-in as editor at The Drum newspaper in \n     Inuvik while she waits to take up a new post at the Calgary \n     Herald, is equally cautious.\n       ``The streets are lined with shiny new pickup trucks that \n     belong to workers from the south,'' she says. ``There are \n     crews driving up and down the street all day long, all night \n     long. The bars fill up.\n       ``I guess you'd have to say that when they are here it's \n     good for the economy. They have lots of money and they don't \n     mind spending it. You have to remember that to them this is \n     just a camp. They don't think of it as home. They don't seem \n     to grasp that people actually live here all the time and have \n     no plans to leave. But when the job is done, they're gone and \n     Inuvik is left to clean up everything that comes after.''\n       One who's determined that this time things will be \n     different is Nellie Cournoyea, the tough, former leader of \n     the N.W.T. government who now directs the Inuvialuit Regional \n     Development Corporation, the powerful business entity born of \n     the treaty agreement with Canada.\n       Outside her office, a poster confronts every visitor: \n     ``Piiguqhaililugit uqauhiqput. Uqaqta Inuvialuktun uvlutaq.--\n     Do not forget our language. Let's talk Inuvialuktun every \n     day.''\n       ``I always look at the up-side,'' Nellie says of the coming \n     boom. ``A lot of people talk about social problems--we \n     already have social problems. We just have to learn to deal \n     with social problems as they arise. Jobs and income are a \n     wonderful antidote to problems with self-esteem.\n       ``We have a lot of working age people and they have to go \n     to work. The socialist system (of welfare) is not a good \n     system to follow. We've always been supportive of \n     development--but we've always wanted to be meaningful \n     participants.'' It's when I ask Grace about this coming \n     transition from traditional hunting and fishing to a wage \n     economy, the sacrifice of a life governed by the rhythms of \n     the seasons for one governed by a clock, that her gaze \n     wanders off into the white landscape.\n       And now the silence in the room is deepening like the snow \n     drifting up around the log cabins, snow that has already \n     filled the canoes, piled up on the tarps over stacked \n     firewood, smoothed all the indentations out of the landscape \n     like God's giant eraser applied to all sharp edges.\n       I wonder to myself where her gaze has gone.\n       Perhaps over the bluffs and up the river to Teetchikgoghan, \n     ``bunch of creeks piled up in one place,'' where she was born \n     in the bush almost half a century ago.\n       Perhaps she is remembering those summers as a little girl \n     growing up in the care of her grandparents, Louis and \n     Caroline Cardinal, playing beside the river, a force of \n     nature that only someone born to it can fully understand, \n     the kind of presence that T.S. Eliot described as a \n     strong, brown god, coiled for release, never the same from \n     one moment to the next and yet containing everything \n     changeless and eternal.\n       Grace told me earlier how she'd go back there in her \n     imagination to escape the pain and loneliness of residential \n     school, where ``every little thing that I knew about myself \n     was just torn right out of me and I used to pee my pants \n     right where I sat, I was so frightened.''\n       So she'd go inside herself, back to that camp where she was \n     left to roam the shore and hillsides.\n       ``My grandmother raised me as an Indian woman,'' she'd \n     said. ``The moment I went out into the world, as you call it, \n     I was supposed to erase all those experiences. It was like my \n     life wasn't my own.''\n       So I ask about the changes that now seem inevitable, the \n     end of a hunting economy and its replacement with market \n     labour and she slips away from the conversation, disappearing \n     into some deep introspection.\n       And begins to weep without sound, great, round, sudden \n     tears rolling down her face.\n       ``Why I'm crying today is because my eldest son committed \n     suicide in January,'' she finally says.\n       `` `Mum, I'm just tired,' he said. `I'm just tired of \n     everything. I'm tired of mad, sad faces. Nobody speaks \n     respectfully.' He just saw everything so clearly and it blew \n     his mind.\n       ``He was the father of five little children and he didn't \n     have a steady income. His dad taught him how to trap and how \n     to hunt and how to fish. Then he listened when they talked \n     about jobs. He got his heavy equipment licence and left the \n     bush. But they only wanted him when they needed him, not when \n     he needed work. He couldn't go back to the bush and he \n     couldn't support his family,'' she says. ``We don't have a \n     big bank account like you--we have our own bank account. Our \n     bank account is the land, the animals, the fish in the \n     rivers. You can't just come and empty out our bank account \n     without asking us.''\n       She gestures to the windown and the rig that everyone knows \n     is there but can't see. There are still beaver to trap, she \n     says, but there are no muskrats. It could be a natural cycle \n     but maybe it's a bigger thing, maybe it's because the lakes \n     are dying. The development boom is coming and there have been \n     no baseline studies of traditional environmental knowledge \n     done, she says. None. And that arrogance, that assumption \n     that the experts know best, shows the real relationship \n     between her world and the corporate world.\n       ``We are the first and the last people of this frontier,'' \n     she says. ``People are supposed to be valued. Human beings \n     have the highest value. But we see that it's not like that. \n     This corporate guy told us they will encourage kids to stay \n     in school--if they don't go to school they won't hire them. \n     That is the most foolish thing I have heard. You don't \n     encourage people by telling them they aren't good enough. \n     Our culture is not like that. We don't push people out of \n     the way--we take them in, we make a place for everybody, \n     not just the best.''\n       I thought then about the boom that's necessary to feed the \n     American superpower and her point about its structural \n     disregard for the genius of her culture, these amazing people \n     who learned to survive in the sparse boreal forest with not \n     much more than a string of animal sinew and their creative \n     imaginations.\n       This time, will things really be different as the \n     politicians and executives promise?\n       Or is there a deeper truth in the cry of grief from women \n     like Norma Voudrach and Grace Blake, already, in their own \n     ways, bearing the quickening burden of change?\n       ``My son was the first suicide in this community. The first \n     ever. It's not the people, it's the system that makes us like \n     this,'' Grace says. ``When things start to move too fast and \n     people don't feel in control of their lives, that's when they \n     turn to drugs and alcohol.

As far as the eye could see, the tundra \n     below rippled and undulated with more than 160,000 caribou. \n     The Porcupine herd on the move covered more than 60 square \n     kilometres, one of the natural wonders of the world.\n       It may be decades since I watched that herd in awestruck \n     silence but today it is no less crucial to the survival of \n     Gwich'in tribal culture here in Old Crow, a remote village \n     770 kilometres north of Whitehorse and 112 kilometres north \n     of the Arctic Circle.\n       The 300 people who live here, accessible only by air or by \n     canoe from Alaska when there's open water, represent one of \n     the last true hunting societies on Earth.\n       People here depend upon the Porcupine herd for sustenance, \n     so not surprisingly, it's here, where the herd winters each \n     year in the trees that edge the Mackenzie River delta and the \n     northern Yukon, that an American debate over whether or not \n     there's to be drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic Wildlife \n     Refuge is watched with intense interest.\n       There's been an effort to join forces with the Old Crow \n     Gwich'in to lobby the U.S. senators not to open the Arctic \n     Wildlife Refuge,'' says Grace Blake, former chief in \n     Tsiigehtchic, a village in the Northwest Territories that \n     also relies on the herd. ``It's not a big movement yet, just \n     pockets of people. We need to educate the Americans about how \n     important this is to us.''\n       As one of the last near-pristine and contiguous wilderness \n     regions in the United States, the more than eight million \n     hectares of the AWR encompass the complete migratory routes \n     and summer calving grounds of the Porcupine herd.\n       Each year the caribou, identifiable by the stark \n     silhouettes of the antlers on mature bulls, make one of the \n     most remarkable journeys on the planet. Sustained only by a\n\n[[Page S9850]]\n\n     winter diet of sparse lichens, they swim freezing rivers, \n     climb snowy mountain ranges and cross the blackfly- and \n     mosquito-infested tundra on the way to the coastal plain \n     where cold winds sweeping in from the Arctic Ocean's pack ice \n     keep the blood-sucking insects away from newborn calves. \n     Then, when they've fattened up on succulent new vegetation, \n     they retrace their route to the winter shelter of the boreal \n     forest before temperatures plunge below freezing and wind \n     chills render the open country uninhabitable to all but the \n     snowshoe hare, the muskox, the wolverine and the barrenground \n     wolf. Fifteen years ago, when then-U.S. president Ronald \n     Reagan expressed sympathy for an oil industry lobby that \n     sought access to the region which lies adjacent to the Yukon \n     border, the Gwich'in allied themselves with the powerful U.S. \n     environmental lobby to successfully block development.\n       Now, with consumers complaining about gasoline prices and a \n     former Texas oilman in the White House in the form of George \n     W. Bush, the prodevelopment lobby which has been biding its \n     time in Alaska and the Lower 48 states has reemerged with a \n     vengeance.\n       Taking point for the development lobby is Arctic Power, \n     ostensibly a grassroots citizens group which favors oil and \n     gas exploration in the protected area. It's an organization \n     which has hired professional lobbyists in Washington, D.C., \n     and was recently granted almost $2 million in funds by the \n     Alaska state legislature to do more of the same.\n       Rallying on the other side are organizations like the \n     Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, the \n     Audubon Society and nearly 500 leading U.S. and Canadian \n     scientists who have called on President Bush to stop trying \n     to change the law that prohibits oil extraction in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge.\n       They include world-renowned naturalist George Schaller, \n     Edward O. Wilson, winner of the National Medal of Science and \n     two Pulitzer Prizes for books on biology, David Klein, a \n     noted Arctic scientist at the University of Alaska and 50 \n     other Alaska scientists.\n       One major difference in the political jockeying this time \n     around is that the dispute has become an exercise in \n     political cyberwar.\n       Arctic Power has a sophisticated web site which purports to \n     explode the ``myths'' of the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. Their \n     opponents have launched their own information sites at which \n     they argue that the amount of oil available from drilling in \n     the refuge--which is the last five per cent of Alaska not \n     available to the resource industry--would meet less than two \n     per cent of U.S. annual needs even in its peak year of \n     production, which couldn't come before 2027.\n       Citizens are invited to register their opposition with an \n     e-mail petition.\n       Meanwhile, important as oil might be to the U.S. economy, \n     the fate of the Porcupine herd is just as important to the \n     social and economic fabric of the Gwich'in. And the First \n     Nation's fears for the fate of the herd are growing rapidly.\n       Numbers of Porcupine caribou have now declined by \n     approximately 20 per cent--to the present total of 129,000 \n     animals--even without the added stress of additional oil \n     exploration activity in the herd's calving grounds on the \n     North Slope of Alaska.\n       And as an example of what development might mean in the \n     future, green opponents of drilling point to Prudhoe Bay, \n     less than 100 kilometres to the west. There, they argue, \n     2,500 square kilometres of fragile tundra has become a \n     sprawling industrial zone containing more than 2,400 \n     kilometres of roads and pipelines, 1,400 producing wells and \n     three airports.\n       ``The result is a landscape defaced by mountains of sewage \n     sludge, scrap metal, garbage and more than 60 contaminated \n     waste sites that contain--and often leak--acids, lead, \n     pesticides, solvents, diesel fuel, corrosives and other \n     toxics,'' says the NRDC.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Again, Canada has every right to develop its energy. \nThey are a formidable competitor to our own domestic production, and we \nenjoy access to that market and want to encourage it. But I resent the \npot calling the kettle black, so to speak.\n  There is another chart that generally shows the extent of the \nactivity, again in a little more detail. Here is the Alaska side. This \nis the Canadian Northwest Territories. This is the identification of \nwells that have been drilled and off-shore activity. You can see, as it \nmoves through this area, the Porcupine caribou move through this area \nand it has significant exposure. And the Dempster Highway runs from \nNorman Wells on up to Inuvik.\n  The point I want to make is that as we look at the companies coming \nin, Anderson exploration and Petro-Canada, we can identify the \ncompanies that bought up the leases. Anderson alone has done nearly 600 \nsquare miles of 3-D seismic testing over the past three winters. Petro-\nCanada has already drilled exploratory wells outside of Inuvik, where \nAnderson now plans to drill in the Eagle Plain area. That is again \nshown on this chart, in this general area. It is a very significant \narea associated with the migratory path of the caribou.\n  Are these exploration plans ``hasty and ill-conceived''? I question \nthat because these are the words of Mr. Anderson, the Canadian \nEnvironmental Minister. I am sure the answer would be no; in his \nopinion they are not ill-conceived. That is their opinion and I do not \nchallenge that. But neither is America's plan to allow careful and \nenvironmentally sensitive exploration in only 2000 acres, in the sense \nof any permanent footprint occurring in the Alaska Arctic Coastal \nPlain. That is less than .01 percent of Alaska's wildlife refuge, which \nis much broader than that, containing about 17 million acres.\n  Mr. Anderson would say Canada's drilling is OK because it doesn't \ndisturb the caribou calving, but he didn't and doesn't mention that \nCanada is drilling in the midst of the herd's mating area. He doesn't \nmention that Canada is drilling in the calving area for its own herds.\n  He doesn't mention that Canada's action after building the Dempster \nHighway has probably done more to harm the health of the Porcupine herd \nthan anything that America would ever consider.\n  Consider for a moment, again, this chart and what this highway has \ndone. It has provided access. There is nothing wrong with access. Here \nis the Eagle Plains. Here is the highway. This is the migration route.\n  In the past decade, Canada reduced the previous 8-kilometer hunting \narea on both sides of the Dempster Highway, dropping it to a 2-\nkilometer zone. Thus, Canadian hunters who want access have now access \nto shoot the Porcupine caribou after only a short stroll from the \nshoulder of the Dempster Highway. The herd has fallen from 180,000 \nanimals to its current 129,000. That drop certainly has not been caused \nby any American activity.\n  The Canadian Environmental Minister, Mr. Anderson, in the past has \ncomplained opening Alaska's Coastal Plain would be unfair to the \nGwich'in Indians of Canada and Alaska who oppose the development, but \nthey certainly do not oppose it any longer in Canada. Canadian \nGwitch'in members are clearly supporting oil and gas exploration, \nprobably now because they will have a financial benefit, certainly the \nbenefit of jobs and better housing, better social care, and better \nmedicine following the completion of their land claim settlement.\n  Let me share a quote:\n\n       The difference is that back then--\n\n  Meaning previous years before the land claims--\n\n     we weren't landlords. Now we are the landlords and that is a \n     big difference. . . . Now we are ready for development.\n\n  This was Fred Carmichael, the chairman of the Gwich'in Tribal Council \nin Canada. This article, again, came from the Vancouver Sun, the quote \nto which I am referring.\n  Could Mr. Anderson's opposition to Alaska's environmentally sensitive \noil development be caused by Canada's desire to have a ready market for \nits Mackenzie Delta oil finds in America? I hope so. We would welcome \nit.\n  But according to Canadian press, Inuvik Mayor Peter Clerkson \npredicted oil drilling would quadruple in this area in the winter and \ndouble again next winter. Again, this level of activity certainly \nindicates that.\n  The Northwest Territory Finance Minister has just been quoted as \nhoping oil finds will generate $400 billion for Canada, all money being \ntransferred to Canada, mostly from the pockets of American consumers as \nwe look to Canada for energy needs.\n  Call it what you will, it is healthy competition. Mr. Anderson, the \nEnvironmental Minister, in his fears about American oil exploration, \nignores that the legislation currently pending to open the Arctic \nCoastal Plain fully protects the environment and the Porcupine caribou, \nand to all wildlife on Alaska's Coastal Plain. The House passed \nlanguage, as you know. The House did pass H.R. 4. That energy \nlegislation authorizes the opening of ANWR. It limits development to a \n2,000-acre footprint out of the 19 million-acre refuge. That would \nleave nearly 100 square miles of habitat between each oil-drilling pad, \nmore than enough for the caribou to pass through, given the new \nadvances in directional drilling, 3-D seismic.\n  So I think if we compare what Canada's footprint in the Canadian \nArctic is, and our own, the technology would speak for itself. Further, \nwe propose to\n\n[[Page S9851]]\n\nlimit development so there will be no disturbance to calving during the \nJune-July calving season. This is not about protecting the environment \nand the caribou that live in it. Mr. Anderson's objection must be about \nsomething else.\n  Look at the objections that opponents voice to exploring in ANWR. One \nis that it is an insignificant amount of oil, not worth developing. If \nit isn't, we will make a park out of it. But that is nonsense. The USGS \nestimates Alaska's portion of the Coastal Plain--I would say the \noccupant of the chair has been up there--the estimate is it contains \nbetween 6 and 16 billion gallons of economically recoverable oil. If it \nis 10 billion barrels alone, the average, it is equivalent to 30 years \nof oil we would import from Saudi Arabia at the current rate, and 50 \nyears equal to what we import currently from Iraq.\n  By the way, 16 billion barrels is 2.5 times the size of the published \nestimate of the new Canadian reserves in the Mackenzie Delta area, \nhere. It is absurd to think that ANWR only represents a 6-month supply \nof oil as some opponents say. That would assume that ANWR is this \ncountry's only source of oil.\n\n  Some say it will take too long to get ANWR oil flowing. But it \ncertainly will take less time to produce than some of the potential \ndeposits in Canada. And if we are truly at war against terrorism, we \nhave the national will to develop Alaska oil quickly, while still \nprotecting the environment.\n  We built the Pentagon in 18 months, the Empire State Building in a \nyear and built the 1,800-mile Alaska Highway in 9 months. Oil could be \nflowing out of ANWR quickly if we made a total commitment to make that \nhappen. I believe we could do this in 12 months instead of the five \nyears, some predict.\n  There are many other misstatements about Alaska's potential for oil \ndevelopment. We will have time to discuss those in this body as we work \non a national energy policy that makes sense for America. That debate \nmust occur soon; we must give the President the tools he needs to \nensure our energy security. I know members on both sides of the aisle \nare anxious to make this happen.\n  But I wanted to come and respond to the comments made by Canada's \nenvironment minister, because they were horribly unbalanced in light of \nCanada's oil drilling program in the migratory route of the Porcupine \ncaribou herd.\n  I encourage an opportunity to debate Mr. Anderson, and I stand behind \nmy assertion that, indeed, his comments don't reflect the reality nor \nthe true picture of what is going on in Canada.\n  Again, I have fondness for our Canadian friends and Canada itself. I \nam not saying they are harming the environment in the least. I am \npointing out what they are doing. The Members of this body need to know \nthat as well.\n  I welcome additional oil production in North America, as long as it \nis done in an environmentally sound manner. Again, I remind all of us \nthat we give very little thought to where our oil comes from as long as \nwe get it. We should do it right in North America, Canada, and Alaska, \nas opposed to it coming from overseas, over which we have really no \ncontrol.\n  I find the objections to be unbalanced and grossly unfair since they \ntotally ignore the environmental issues involved in oil development in \nthe Arctic.\n  I also find the Environment Minister's statement just days after the \ntragedy in New York and Washington not only untimely but unfortunate.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I wish my colleagues a good \nday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9851-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the energy \npolicy-related amendments filed by the Senator from Oklahoma. While I \nsupport moving forward with comprehensive national energy policy, the \nunderlying bill is too important to our national security to bog it \ndown with controversial amendments.\n  There are many substantive problems with these amendments, not the \nleast of which is their probable negative impact on public health and \nenvironmental quality. They take us back to the polluting past, rather \nthan forward into a cleaner, more efficient and sustainable future.\n  There are also serious procedural problems with moving on these \namendments. The committees of jurisdiction, including the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, have not completed work on important parts \nof comprehensive energy legislation.\n  Also, I would remind Senators that the administration has completed \nvery few, if any, of the reports recommended by the Vice-President's \nNational Energy Policy Development group. I believe these reports were \nintended to inform and justify to the public and Congress the need for \nany changes to existing law and programs.\n  These amendments drive us further and further away from making the \ntruly fundamental changes in our national energy policy that are \nnecessary to address global climate change.\n  The amendments will dramatically increase U.S. greenhouse gas \nemissions. That further violates our commitment in the Rio Agreement to \nreduce to 1990 levels.\n  The next Conference of Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on \nClimate Change begins in late October. Despite the terrorist attacks on \nour Nation, the attendees will hope for U.S. leadership to combat \nglobal warming.\n  Whatever the administration may present, I hope the message from the \nU.S. Senate will not be the recent adoption of a national energy policy \nthat blatantly undermines our Senate-ratified commitment to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. The underlying bill already sets us up to \nviolate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Defense Treaty. That is enough to \nweigh down one bill.\n  We should not further encroach on the good will of our global \nneighbors at a time when we are seeking their support in our efforts \nagainst terrorism. I urge the defeat of these amendments when and if \nthey are offered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Is the Senator aware that since back to and including the \nFirst World War the outcome of every war has been determined by energy? \nIs the Senator aware that we are now 56.7-percent dependent upon \nforeign countries for our ability to fight a war and that half of it is \ncoming from the Middle East? And is the Senator aware that the largest \nincrease in terms of our dependency on any one country is Iraq, a \ncountry with which we are in war right now?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am aware of the situations the Senator describes. I \nam just concerned about the methodology being utilized to try to solve \nthat. I would like to work together with the members of the committee \nto try to see if we can find common ground.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on some of the \nexperiences I have had over the last 2 weeks, and also the activity of \nthe U.S. Congress, and in particular the Senate.\n  It is hard to believe it has only been 2 weeks and 1 day since the \ntragedy of September 11. It seems such a longer period of time because \nof all the emotions and all the experiences and all the visual images \nwhich have been burned into our minds and our hearts.\n  I think so many times of that day and what happened to me. Yet when I \nmeet anyone on the street in Chicago or any part of Illinois and \nSpringfield, they all go through the same life experience. They want to \ntell me where they were and how their lives were touched and changed by \nSeptember 11. It was a defining moment for America. It is one which \nnone of us will ever forget.\n  Over 6,500 innocent Americans lost their lives on that day--the \ngreatest loss of American life, I am told, of any day in our history, \nincluding the battles of the Civil War.\n  Of course, we weren't the only country to lose lives in the World \nTrade Center. It is reported in the papers today that more German \ncitizens lost their lives to terrorism on September 11 at the World \nTrade Center than in any of the terrorist acts on record in Germany. \nThe stories are repeated many times over.\n  Yesterday, the father of one of the victims of American Flight 77 \nthat\n\n[[Page S9852]]\n\ncrashed into the Pentagon came to my office and spoke about his \nwonderful daughter. He reflected on her life and the life of so many in \nmy home State of Illinois--lives that were lost on September 11. We \nhave tried to address that.\n  Yesterday, we had a hearing on airport and airline security in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee under Chairman Joe Lieberman, the \nSenator from Connecticut. Other Members came forward to hear testimony \nfrom the appropriate Federal agencies--the FAA, the Department of \nTransportation's inspector general, as well as the General Accounting \nOffice.\n  Then we brought in a panel of those who were more directly in contact \nwith air service--the vice president of American Airlines; airport \nmanagers from Bloomington, IL; from North Carolina; from St. Louis' \nLambert; and Aubrey Harvey, who was a screener at one of the airport \nsecurity stations at O'Hare, came. If I am not mistaken, he was the \nfirst person actually involved in that profession who came forward to \ntell his side of the story about airport security.\n\n  It was an important hearing. I think it dramatized the need for us to \nfocus on several achievements as a nation.\n  First and foremost, we must restore the confidence of the American \npublic to get back on airplanes. That will require several actions. It \nrequires, first, to have an immediate visible security response to what \noccurred on September 11. Changes have taken place in every airport. I \nhave been to O'Hare and to Dulles and to Baltimore, as well as to St. \nLouis since that event. I have seen the changes. They are important. \nThey are significant. They may not be enough. We need to do more. We \nneed to do it quickly.\n  I have noted that after Secretary Mineta, of the Department of \nTransportation, testified last week, I suggested that he immediately \nwrite to every airport manager and communicate to them the need to put \nin place at every airport security checkpoint a uniformed law \nenforcement officer.\n  Secretary Mineta, whom I respect and admire so very much, said some \nairports have done that. I urged him to make sure every airport does \nthat because I think it changes the environment of the airport. It \nmakes security a more serious matter.\n  I do not know if it was a coincidence or what, but when I went up to \nBaltimore to catch the plane last Friday, as I went through the airport \nsecurity, there were five or six very serious screening employees and \ntwo law enforcement personnel there. They not only went through my \nluggage--which was something I invited them to do--then they did the \nwand all over me, and then checked to see if there was any explosive \nresidue on my briefcase. I do not know if they knew who I was, but \nthey, frankly, responded with the most amazing display of security I \nhave ever seen at one time at an airport; and I travel a lot.\n  Let me tell you something else. I do not begrudge a single moment of \nthe time they asked of me, and neither should any other American. There \nis a little inconvenience involved in this, but for our safety and \nsecurity it is not too much to ask. When I think about giving up 30 \nseconds or a minute of my life, I reflect on how many people are making \nsuch extraordinary sacrifices of their time and their lives in the \ninterest of the security of America. That is not too much to ask any \nairline passenger.\n  But now we see in airports across America a change in attitude and a \nchange in approach. At all the airports I visited--four in the last 2 \nweeks--I have seen a much more serious approach to security.\n  Yesterday we talked about the security on the ramp, as well, in terms \nof all of those people who have access to airplanes. We focused on \npassengers and what they bring on board, but we should also focus on \nevery single person who can enter that airplane at any time; not only \nthe pilot and crew, but also those who are responsible for baggage \nhandling, fueling the plane, catering services, cleanup crews. All of \nthose people have access to that airplane.\n  A search of one of the grounded airplanes after the event found one \nof those notorious box cutters wedged in the cushion of a seat of the \nplane. Whether the passenger left it there or it was planted is \nunknown, but it at least raises an important security question.\n\n  So when we talk about security in airports, it is not just the \nscreening, it is not just the questions asked of passengers, it is to \nmake sure that the ramp and the perimeter around the airport is secure, \nthat we know the people who are coming in contact with that plane, that \nthey have been checked out, that they are hard-working, good people, \nwho are not going to be involved in anything that would endanger the \nlife of another.\n  One of the baggage handlers from O'Hare called me. I spoke to him in \nmy office the other day. He told me about his experience. Did you know \nbaggage handlers at O'Hare start at $8.50 an hour? I did not know that. \nIn a few years they can get as high as $19 an hour, but, again, it \nreminds us that many of the people who are in direct contact with the \nairplane and its contents are people in starting-wage jobs that require \nperhaps minimal education and minimal training. I think that has to \nchange.\n  I think we need to raise the standards, the skills, and the \ncompensation to the people who are involved in security. I think we \nhave to consider security as not just part of the process of taking a \nflight but an element of law enforcement. When you take that into \nconsideration, you start changing your standards as to what you might \nexpect.\n  So I believe we should federalize this activity. There have been a \nnumber of suggestions on how to do it. Some have said we should \nactually have Federal employees directly involved. I am not opposed to \nthat concept. I am open to it. I am trying to keep an open mind to the \nmost cost-efficient way to guarantee the security as best we can of \nairline travel.\n  Others have asked, how about a governmental corporation that has this \nresponsibility that operates under the rules and standards promulgated \nby the Federal Government? That, too, is an approach which I think we \nshould consider. But more than anything, we have to make it clear to \nthe American people that we are going to do something, and we are going \nto do it soon, and that it is safe for them to get back on airplanes.\n  I am still flying commercial flights. Most of my colleagues in the \nSenate are--in fact, all of them. I think it is a testament to our \nbelief that we have confidence in air travel. We have to convince the \nrest of the American people.\n  Let me address another issue that was raised a few moments ago in \nthis Chamber by my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Torricelli. It is \none which I have heard him express before, and one I have reflected on, \nand on which I have come to an agreement with him. It is the question \nof our preparedness as a nation for what occurred on September 11.\n  Back before the United States was engaged in World War II, President \nFranklin Roosevelt called on George Marshall, an Army general, to \nprepare the United States for the possibility of war. I remember, in \nreading the biography of George C. Marshall, one of our Nation's \nheroes, they talked of his first trip to the so-called War Department, \nI believe it was, in 1940.\n  He went to the War Department, and he asked what battle plans were \nthere for him to review. They went to the vault, opened it, and pulled \nout the battle plan--the one battle plan --which had been prepared for \nthe War Department of the United States of America in 1940.\n  George Marshall opened the folder to discover that battle plan was \nfor the invasion of Mexico. That is all he had. No one had thought \nahead about other possibilities. And in a short period of time, America \nwas involved in a world war. We were not prepared and had to race to \nbecome prepared, not only to provide the goods and services and \nresources for our allies in the war but to make sure we could defend \nourselves. America rose to that challenge, but we lost valuable time \nbecause we were not prepared.\n\n  The obvious question we must ask, as Members of Congress, is, Were we \nprepared for September 11? Well, clearly, the answer is no. For the \nUnited States to have faced the greatest invasion, the greatest attack, \nthe greatest crisis in our history, is to say, on its face, that we \nwere not prepared.\n  And I have to point to a number of areas. Whether it is in the \nmilitary\n\n[[Page S9853]]\n\nfield or law enforcement or intelligence, in all three levels there are \nimportant questions that need to be asked and answered about our \nfailure to avert this terrible crisis.\n  We have identified some 19 alleged hijackers who were involved in \nthis endeavor. I think we understand that there probably were hundreds \nmore who had some part to play in this sad and tragic drama that cost \nso many lives. But to think what they have done to America--those \npeople, one day in our history--it has changed our Nation.\n  I would like to say that we can brush it off and go on about our \nbusiness. Everybody knows better. Life in this country is going to be \ndifferent, and it must be different so we can avert that kind of crisis \nin the future and be prepared for our own defense.\n  Now we have requests coming to us from agencies representing the U.S. \nmilitary, law enforcement, such as the FBI, and the intelligence \nagencies, for additional resources and additional authority. I join \nevery other Member of the Senate in a bipartisan, solid vote giving the \nPresident and his administration all of the resources and authority \nthey have asked for. I think we feel that party labels should be put \naside. We have to stand together in Congress to wage this war against \nterrorism. We want to provide the President what he needs to be \nsuccessful in that effort. We want to provide him the resources he \nneeds so the men and women in uniform, and everyone involved in this \neffort, have the tools they need to succeed.\n  Now we are receiving requests from the Attorney General, and from \nothers, to change the laws of the United States to provide additional \nauthority to those who are involved in fighting terrorism. I do not \nthink that is an unreasonable thing to do. In fact, some of the \nrequests that have been made by the Department of Justice are eminently \nsensible.\n  I think it is important that we have changes, for example, in the \nauthority to eavesdrop or have wiretaps to reflect new technology. In \nthe old days, the FBI would turn over the name of a person and the \ntelephone number and ask for authority from the court to put a wiretap \non a phone.\n  Today, of course, that suspected person may have in fact a dozen cell \nphones and change three or four numbers a day. We have to be prepared \nto follow them through all of the different levels of technology people \ncan use against us. I don't think that is unreasonable.\n  Changing the statute of limitations on crimes of terrorism? Of \ncourse, we should. We have to view this as more than just a garden \nvariety crime because we have seen the terrible disaster that occurred \non September 11.\n  Other requests have been made by the FBI and CIA for the collection \nof more information beyond what I have just mentioned. It raises an \nimportant point that we should pause and study. We have seen in the \npast that these information-gathering agencies have collected enormous \namounts of data, whether it is electronic data or data from human \nintelligence resources. And many times that data has not been \nassimilated, formulated, or distributed so that it can be used in \neffective law enforcement and the deterrence of the kind of disaster \nand tragedy we experienced on September 11.\n  I ask, at least as part of this debate, that Congress come to these \nsame agencies and ask them what they have done in the past with similar \ninformation, how much of a backlog of unprocessed information they \ncurrently have, and what they are going to do with any new information \nthey receive.\n  Before we expand this authority to collect more information, it is \nreasonable to ask the capacity of these agencies to assimilate and to \nuse this information in a valuable fashion.\n  How many Arabic speakers are available at the CIA and FBI if we are \ngoing to focus on those who are involved in this latest terrorism and \nany conversations among people who use that particular language? That \nis an important question and one which I think we will come to find is \nnot answered to our satisfaction. We have to do better.\n  I also have to relate that for the first time in 20 years, the \nJudiciary Committee, just a few months ago, had a thorough \ninvestigation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and came up with \nsome major concerns. It is hard for me to believe that this premier law \nenforcement agency in America is still so far behind the times when it \ncomes to important technology such as computers. The computer \ncapability of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was described as 10 \nyears behind the rest of America. At a time when it should be on the \ncutting edge, it is that far behind. That needs to change. It needs to \nchange immediately.\n  Providing access to more information without the ability to \nassimilate it, to process it, to distribute it is, frankly, a waste of \nour time. We cannot afford to waste a moment in this war against \nterrorism.\n  I have the greatest confidence in Bob Mueller, who has been appointed \nas the new Director of the FBI. I salute President Bush and those who \nwere instrumental in naming him. He is an excellent choice. I believe \nhe and Attorney General Ashcroft have an opportunity to work together \nto not only give more authority and resources to the FBI but to also \nchange the climate at the FBI in terms of how it works internally and \nhow it works with other agencies.\n  Yesterday Attorney General Ashcroft told us that the FBI's wanted \nlist and list of dangerous individuals in America had not been shared \nwith the Federal Aviation Administration before September 11. What that \nmeant was that those names that were suspicious were never given by the \nFAA to the airlines so they could monitor the travel of these people. \nThat seems so basic. It reflects, unfortunately, a sad state of affairs \nwhen it comes to the exchange of this information.\n\n  Let me speak for a moment about the daunting task we face in \nchallenging terrorism around the world. The President is right. He has \ndone the appropriate thing in warning the American people that this is \na long-term commitment, that we need to take a look and find the \nresources of this global terrorism network and cut them off where we \ncan--financial resources, political resources, whatever they are \ngathering from other nations, organizations, and persons. We have to \nstop that flow, to try to choke off this global terrorism. That is \ngoing to take quite a bit of effort and patience.\n  The other day I met with a prosecutor who had spent most of his \nprofessional life prosecuting the Osama bin Laden terrorists. For 30 \nminutes he sat down and described for me from start to finish his \nexperience with this group. I came away with the following impression: \nThey are educated; they are determined; they are invisible; they are \npatient; and they hate us.\n  I was sobered by that presentation because he went through, chapter \nand verse, every single item he had discovered in the course of \nprosecuting these terrorists. I came away with the belief that we are \nnot dealing with a ragtag bunch that got lucky, in their view, on \nSeptember 11 with terrorism. They know what they are doing.\n  We have to know what we are doing. We have to be prepared to fight \nthis battle and to win it as quickly and as decisively as possible.\n  Let me suggest that as we get into this, as we make this dedicated \neffort to fight terrorism as a nation, we should stop and we should \nreflect on the state of affairs on September 11, 2001, in America. It \nis time to ask the painful and hard questions of where the intelligence \ncommunity failed, where law enforcement failed, where our Government \nfailed, when it came to averting that crisis.\n  This is not an easy task. Some have suggested maybe we should put \nthat aside for another day. I don't think so. There were clear \nomissions, and there were clear problems within our collection of \nintelligence that led to what happened on September 11. We need to know \nwhat they were. We need to know if they changed. We need to know, for \nexample, whether this exchange of information by law enforcement \nagencies has now changed for the better and decisively.\n  To do that, I agree with Senator Torricelli, we should establish a \nboard of inquiry that asks these hard and difficult questions and \nreports back to Congress, to the President, and to the American people \nabout what we did wrong and how we need to change it.\n  There is a rich tradition of this sort of inquiry. Senator Harry \nTruman of\n\n[[Page S9854]]\n\nMissouri was involved in a similar inquiry in the 1940s when it came to \ndefense contractors and whether they were wasting taxpayer dollars. As \nhas been noted, the Challenger disaster led to a board of inquiry that \nchanged the way the National Aeronautics and Space Administration did \ntheir business. There were inquiries throughout our history when \nsomething important and catastrophic was happening in America.\n  We can do no less today than to dedicate resources to an inquiry that \ngets to the heart of what our deficiencies are when it comes to \nfighting terrorism.\n  I suggest my colleagues consider that there are many we can turn to, \nto help us in this effort. Certainly there are committees of Congress \non both sides of the aisle in the House and the Senate that could have \na legitimate role to play in this question.\n\n  We might consider turning to some of our former colleagues to \nestablish this kind of commission of inquiry to ask about what we \nfailed to do and how we failed to avert the crisis of September 11. As \nI sat here today reflecting, names came to mind immediately: Senator \nBob Kerrey, former Senator from Nebraska, recipient of the \nCongressional Medal of Honor, former chairman of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee; Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, Republican majority \nleader; Sam Nunn, former Senator from Georgia, well respected for his \nexpertise when it comes to the armed services; former Senator from \nMissouri John Danforth, who just recently conducted an investigation of \nthe FBI on the Waco incident, and his findings were accepted by all as \nbeing thorough and professional; John Glenn, former Senator from Ohio, \nwho has a legendary reputation not only on Capitol Hill but across \nAmerica; Mark Hatfield of Oregon, who served as chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee; Chuck Robb, former marine in Vietnam and \nSenator from Virginia; Warren Rudman from New Hampshire.\n  These are eight names that could come together quickly and be willing \nto serve this country in a commission of inquiry as to what went wrong \nat the CIA and the FBI and the Pentagon and throughout the Government \non September 11. I believe they can give us a roadmap so we can talk \nabout changes that need to be made, and made immediately, to avert any \nfuture crisis.\n  I agree with Senator Torricelli: This is something we should not put \noff. We ought to do it and do it soon. It is not a reflection of \ndisunity on the part of those of us who suggest it but just the \nopposite. As we have stood with the President to make sure he is \neffective in fighting this war for America, let us stand together in a \nbipartisan fashion to concede our weaknesses and shortfalls from the \npast so we don't repeat those terrible mistakes.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by noting one other event that \nhappened in the last several weeks, which has been nothing short of \namazing. It is a rebirth of patriotism in America the likes of which I \nhave never witnessed. There was a time during the Vietnam war when the \nAmerican flag lapel pin was worn by some in support of the war and \nshunned by others as an indication of supporting a war they thought was \nwrong.\n  That has changed so much. You will find Americans across the board \nproud of their flag, proud of their country. I was in Chicago Saturday \nmorning and stopped at a car rental agency, and the lady behind the \ndesk recognized my name when I filled out the contract.\n  She said: Senator, I can't find a flag anywhere, and I am trying to \nget one I can wear.\n  I pulled out this ribbon from my pocket--a lapel pin that many \nMembers have been wearing. I said: Why don't you take this one.\n  She said: I think I am going to break down and cry. It meant so much \nfor her to have it, to be able to wear it. I also gave one to the lady \nworking with her. I thought how quickly we have come together as a \nnation.\n  You have seen it in so many ways, large and small. Huge rallies are \ntaking place at the Daly Center in Chicago. There are long lines of \npeople waiting to donate blood. Donations are being given to the United \nWay and Red Cross and all of the charitable organizations. There is an \nintense feeling of pride and patriotism at public events across the \nboard.\n  I have noticed that people are listening more carefully to our \nNational Anthem--to the words that we used to say by memory --perhaps \nwithout thinking so many times. There is that pause when we get to the \npoint in that great National Anthem when we say:\n\n       O say, does that star-spangled Banner yet wave,\n       O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n\n  I think those words have special meaning for us because the Star \nSpangled Banner, our national flag, still waves--not just on porches \nand buildings across America and across Illinois, downstate and in \nChicago, but in our hearts as well. We will prevail.\n  Those who thought they could bring us to our knees have brought us to \nour feet. This country will be victorious.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be in order for me to make my remarks while seated at my desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9854-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9854-S9856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AMERICAN SERVICE MEMBERS PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, after those dastardly terrorists \ndeliberately murdered--and I use those words advisedly--thousands of \nAmerican citizens in New York, Washington, and in the plane crash in \nPennsylvania, President Bush instructed our armed services to ``be \nready.''\n  Mr. President, our Nation is at war with terrorism. Everybody knows \nthat. Thousands in our Armed Forces are already risking their lives \naround the globe, preparing to fight in that war. We bade farewell to \n2,000 or 3,000 marines from North Carolina last week.\n  These are all courageous men and women who are not afraid to face up \nto evil terrorists, and they are ready to risk their lives to preserve \nand to protect what I like to call the miracle of America.\n  And that is why I am among those of their fellow countrymen who \ninsist that these men and women who are willing to risk their lives to \nprotect their country and fellow Americans should not have to face the \npersecution of the International Criminal Court--which ought to be \ncalled the International Kangaroo Court. This court will be empowered \nwhen 22 more nations ratify the Rome Treaty.\n  Instead of helping the United States go after real war criminals and \nterrorists, the International Criminal Court has the unbridled power to \nintimidate our military people and other citizens with bogus, \npoliticized prosecutions.\n  Similar creations of the United Nations have shown that this is \ninevitable.\n  Earlier this year, the U.N. Human Rights Commission kicked off the \nUnited States--the world's foremost advocate of human rights--to the \ncheers of dictators around the globe.\n  The United Nation's conference on racism in Durban, South Africa, \nthis past month, became an agent of hate rather than against hate. With \nthis track record, it is not difficult to anticipate that the U.N.'s \nInternational Criminal Court will be in a position not merely to \nprosecute, but to persecute our soldiers and sailors for alleged war \ncrimes as they risk their lives fighting the scourge of terrorism.\n  Therefore, now is the time for the Senate to move to protect those \nwho are protecting us.\n  I have an amendment at the desk to serve as a sort of insurance \npolicy for our troops. My amendment is supported by the Bush \nadministration and is based on the ``American Service Members \nProtection Act,'' which I introduced this past May. It is cosponsored \nby Senators Miller, Hatch, Shelby, Murkowski, Bond, and Allen. I ask \nunanimous consent that the amendment be filed with the DOD \nauthorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be filed.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, many Americans may not realize that the \nRome Treaty can apply to Americans even without the U.S. ratifying the \ntreaty. This bewildering threat to America's men and women in our Armed \nForces must be stopped.\n\n[[Page S9855]]\n\n  And that is precisely what my amendment proposes to do--it protects \nAmericans in several ways:\n  (1) It will prohibit cooperation with this kangaroo court, including \nuse of taxpayer funding or sharing of classified information.\n  (2) It will restrict a U.S. role in peacekeeping missions unless the \nU.N. specifically exempts U.S. troops from prosecution by this \ninternational court.\n  (3) It blocks U.S. aid to allies unless they too sign accords to \nshield U.S. troops on their soil from being turned over to the ICC.\n     And\n  (4) It authorizes any necessary action to free U.S. soldiers \nimproperly handed over to that Court.\n  My amendment to the Defense authorization bill incorporates changes \nnegotiated with the executive branch giving the President the \nflexibility and authority to delegate tasks in the bill to Cabinet \nSecretaries and their deputies in this time of national emergency.\n  The Bush administration supports this slightly revised version of the \nAmerican Service Members Protection Act. I have a letter from the \nadministration in support of this amendment, which I will soon read.\n  Nothing is more important than the safety of our citizens, soldiers, \nand public servants. The terrorist attacks of September 11 have made \nthat fact all the more obvious.\n  Today, we can, we must, act to protect our military personnel from \nabuse by the International Criminal Court.\n  The letter I received dated September 25 from the U.S. Department of \nState is signed by Paul V. Kelly, Assistant Secretary for Legislative \nAffairs:\n\n       Dear Senator Helms: This letter advises that the \n     administration supports the revised text of the American \n     Servicemembers' Protection Act, dated September 10, 2001, \n     proposed by you, Mr. Hyde and Mr. Delay.\n       We commit to supporting enactment of the revised bill in \n     its current form based upon the agreed changes without \n     further amendment and to oppose alternative legislative \n     proposals.\n       We understand that the House ASPA legislation will be \n     attached to the State Department Authorization Bill or to \n     other appropriate legislation.\n\n  Signed, Paul V. Kelly, as I indicated earlier.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold his suggestion?\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I send to the desk a second-degree \namendment to the Helms amendment and ask unanimous consent that it be \nconsidered in context with the Helms amendment on the DOD authorization \nbill when we return to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nconsideration. I had asked my second-degree amendment to the Helms \namendment be considered in that context upon returning to the DOD \nauthorization bill. Mr. President, I send that amendment to the desk as \na second degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be filed.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may make my \nremarks seated at my desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nappear in the Record as presented.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will speak briefly to it because I know \nthere is other business to be conducted.\n  It is, first and foremost, very important that I say I agree with the \ngeneral premise of the amendment that Senator Helms has offered this \nafternoon. It is clearly of utmost importance that we speak as a nation \nto the world and say that our men and women in uniform may never and \nwill never become subject to an International Criminal Court. That is \nthe sovereign right of this Nation.\n  We, in general, object to what the Criminal Court under the Rome \nTreaty proposes. In fact, in the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations \nbill, just 2 weeks ago I offered an amendment to strike all necessary \nmoneys that would bring about our activity in the Preparatory \nCommission and the implementation of the Criminal Court.\n  My amendment goes a step beyond what Senator Helms has proposed \nbecause the International Criminal Court is not specific to men and \nwomen in uniform. It says all citizens of the world in essence; anyone \nover 18 years of age. Is it possible to assume that a rogue prosecutor \nunder the Criminal Court of the United Nations could suggest that Colin \nPowell is in violation and, therefore, to be prosecuted before the \nCriminal Court for his conduct as it relates to pursuing international \njustice in relation to terrorists? Yes, it is.\n  As a result of that, my amendment proposes to protect all citizens, \nnot just those men and women in uniform. That is critically necessary \nand important.\n  We have spoken out as a nation in general opposition to the ICC, and \nwhen the treaty was signed by former President Clinton, he talked about \nthe inequities and the problems.\n  My amendment also addresses those problems, and it would remove \nlanguage indicating that the United States may eventually become a \nparty to the ICC.\n  There is a gratuitous endorsement of the U.N.'s ad hoc tribunals. We \nhave just been through one of those episodes in South Africa where the \nUnited States and Israel had to walk away because of an intent to \nsuggest that charges of racism be pursued against one of those nations. \nAd hoc tribunals and the very principle with which we are trying to \ndeal in the ICC should suggest that we do not necessarily endorse or \nsupport the U.N.'s ad hoc tribunals.\n  There is a new section 1411 that has been added to permit U.S. \ncooperation with the ICC on a case-by-case basis, including that of \ngiving classified information to the ICC. We reject that.\n  Lastly, there is no mention of American sovereignty. I think it is \nalways important when we are addressing international bodies or our \nrelationship to them that we speak so clearly to the right of this \nNation to determine its own destiny and, more importantly, that we will \nnot be signatories to, nor will we endorse as a Senate or as a \nGovernment, concepts in the international arena that take from us our \nright of American sovereignty and the right, therefore, of our judicial \nsystem over the citizens of this country away from that of an \ninternational body.\n  That is the intent of my second degree. Without question, and I have \ndiscussed this with Senator Helms, he and I stand strongly together in \nsupport of the protection of our troops, our men and women in uniform, \nin not being subject to an international criminal court of justice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Again, Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Let me just add a footnote to the remarks of Senator Craig. We have \nbeen working closely together on this issue of the International \nCriminal Court, and we see eye to eye on the danger of this Court \npresented to our fighting men and women. I appreciate very much the \nefforts of Senator Craig, who I understand may be offering a second-\ndegree amendment, which he has already done.\n  I want to assure the Senate, as Senator Craig has, that Senator Craig \nand I will continue working together on this and other important issues \nin the future.\n  As I indicated earlier in my remarks, my amendment--the underlying \namendment, that is--is supported by the Bush administration. Vice \nPresident Cheney has personally seen to it the language in my \nunderlying amendment has the approval of the State Department, the \nDefense Department, the\n\n[[Page S9856]]\n\nNational Security Council, the Justice Department, along with other \nparts of the Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9856-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DISCHARGE AND REFERRAL--H.R. 788\n\n  Mr. REID.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 1860, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1860) to reauthorize the Small Business \n     Technology Transfer Program, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I rise to urge passage of H.R. 1860, \nthe Small Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act of \n2001. H.R. 1860 passed the House of Representatives on September 24, \n2001. This bill is a companion to my bill, cosponsored by Ranking \nMember Kit Bond, S. 856 which passed the Senate unanimously on \nSeptember 13, 2001. This legislation reauthorizes the Small Business \nAdministration's highly successful Small Business Technology Transfer \nProgram for an additional eight years and doubles its size. Absent \nlegislative action to reauthorize the Small Business Technology \nTransfer program, it will expire on September 30, 2001.\n  The STTR program funds research and development, R, projects \nperformed jointly by small companies and research institutions as an \nincentive to advance the government's research and development goals. \nIt complements the Small Business Innovation Research, SBIR, program, \nwhich was reauthorized last year. The SBIR program funds R projects \nat small companies. STTR funds R projects between a small company and \na research institution, such as a university or a Federally funded R \nlab. STTR projects help participating agencies achieve their goals in \nthe research and development arena. It also helps convert the billions \nof dollars invested in research and development at our nation's \nuniversities, Federal laboratories and non-profit research institutions \ninto new commercial technologies.\n  The STTR program was started in 1992. The program was reauthorized in \n1997 for four years. The program is funded out of the extramural R \nbudgets of Federal agencies or departments with extramural R budgets \nof $1 billion or more. Such agencies must award at least .15 percent of \nthat money for STTR projects. This bill increases program funding to .3 \npercent of that money for STTR programs in FY 2004 and thereafter. Five \nagencies currently participate in the STTR program: the Department of \nDefense, DoD, the National Institutes of Health, NIH, the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, the National Science \nFoundation, NSF, and the Department of Energy, DoE.\n  There are three phases of the STTR program. Phase I is a one-year \naward for $100,000, and its purpose is to determine the scientific and \ncommercial merits of an idea. Phase II is a two-year grant for \n$500,000, and its purpose is to further develop the idea. In FY 2004 \nand thereafter this bill increases Phase II awards to $750,000. Phase \nIII is used to pursue commercial applications of the idea and cannot be \nfunded with STTR funds.\n  I thank my friend from Missouri, Senator Bond and his staff and all \nof the Members of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship \nCommittee for working with me and my staff on this important \nlegislation. I would also like to recognize the cooperation and support \nfrom the House Small Business Committee, Chairman Don Manzullo, Ranking \nMember Nydia Velazquez, Subcommittee Chairman Roscoe Bartlett and their \nstaffs as well as Chairman Boehlert and Ranking Minority Member Hall \nand their staffs on the House Science Committee for their work on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to pass H.R. 1860.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues in the Senate \nto support H.R. 1860, the Small Business Technology Transfer Program \nReauthorization Act of 2001. This bill is identical to S. 856, which \npassed the Senate unanimously on September 13, 2001. Subsequently, the \nHouse of Representatives amended its version of this important \nlegislation with the entire text of the Senate-passed bill, and it \npassed the House of Representatives yesterday on its Suspension \nCalendar. Our approval of this bill today will clear the measure for \nthe President to sign it into law.\n  The STTR Program was created in 1992 to stimulate technology transfer \nfrom research institutions to small firms while, at the same time, \naccomplishing the Federal government's research and development goals. \nThe program is designed to convert the billions of dollars invested in \nresearch and development at our nation's universities, federal \nlaboratories and nonprofit research institutions into new commercial \ntechnologies. The STTR Program does this by coupling the ideas and \nresources of research institutions with the commercialization \nexperience of small companies.\n  To receive an award under the STTR Program, a research institution \nand small firm jointly submit a proposal to conduct research on a topic \nthat reflects an agency's mission and research and development needs. \nThe proposals are then peer-reviewed and judged on their scientific, \ntechnical and commercial merit.\n  The STTR Program continues to provide high-quality research to the \nFederal government. The General Accounting Office (GAO) reported in the \npast that Federal agencies give high ratings to the technical quality \nof STTR research proposals. The Department of Energy, for example, \nrated the quality of the proposed research in the top ten percent of \nall research funded by the Department\n  Report after report demonstrates that small businesses innovate at a \ngreater and faster rate then large firms. However, small businesses \nreceive less than four percent of all Federal research and development \ndollars. This percentage has remained essentially unchanged for the \npast 22 years. Increasing funds for the STTR Programs sends a strong \nmessage that the Federal government acknowledges the contributions that \nsmall businesses have and will continue making to government research \nand development efforts and to our nation's economy.\n  Mr. President, Senator Kerry and I have worked together to produce a \nsound, bi-partisan bill. This legislation is good for the small \nbusiness high-technology community and will ensure that our Federal \nresearch and development needs are well met in the next decade. I trust \nthat the bill will receive overwhelming support of my colleagues.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the third \ntime, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, with \nno intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1860) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9856-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9856-S9857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2001\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I would like to inquire of the Senator from \nMaryland, Chairman Sarbanes, as to the status of legislation \nreauthorizing the Defense Production Act?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his question. The \nDefense Production Act reauthorization that is awaiting further action \nin the Senate would currently reauthorize the act for two years and \nwould make a number of technical corrections.\n  Mr. ENZI. As the chairman is aware, I feel the DPA is an important \ntool for supporting our national defense and for ensuring that our \narmed forces have the latest equipment available, in a timely manner, \nand that they are prepared and able to defend our Nation's interests. \nWhen used properly, the DPA not only ensures military contracts are \nfilled in a timely manner, but it also ensures that industries are \nprotected from liabilities that could arise from being required to \nprioritize military requests ahead of other private agreements. I am \nconcerned, however, that the DPA also has a number of possible \napplications that may not be in the best interest of the United States. \nIt is my fear that, in the name of national security, the DPA can be \nused in a way that creates a serious rippling effect on many other \nsectors of our Nation. The chairman is aware that I have supported just \na one-year reauthorization of this act, and that I feel it is important \nthat we conduct a complete review and reevaluation of the act to make \nsure it gives the President the power he needs to conduct his business \nwithout exposing the rest of the nation to possible abuse.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In light of U.S. national security needs, I feel \nCongress is justified in extending the DPA's authorization for two \nyears. I am prepared, however, to work with the Senator from Wyoming to \nreview his concerns with the DPA when the Banking Committee considers \nits future reauthorization.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate concur in the House \namendments to the Senate amendment, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of families and S. \nRes. 160 that dedicates October 2001 as Family History Month.\n  The concept of designating October as Family History Month began \nseveral years ago. According to the National Genealogical Society, \nConnecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, \nNevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and \nVirginia all passed ``proclamations'' in the last few years declaring \nOctober as Family History Month.\n  Within the last month some 14,167,329 people researched their family \nhistory and 24 million people have used the Web and email to locate \nfamily or friends with whom they had lost touch. Researching ancestry \nis a very important component to self identity. It can lead to long-\nsought-after family reunions or allow for life saving medical \ntreatments that only genetic links will allow.\n  At present there are some 2,500 genealogical societies in the United \nStates that represent approximately one million people. Genealogy is \ncurrently the 2nd largest hobby in the country and is very unique in \nthat it crosses over all religions, ethnic backgrounds, and age groups. \nEssentially, we are all immigrants to this country. Our ancestors came \nfrom different parts of the globe and by searching for our roots, we \ncome closer together as a human family.\n  Researching family history has now moved into the digital age with \nthe advent of the Internet. There has been an explosion of interest in \nfamily history online in fact genealogy internet sites are some of the \nmost popular sites on the World Wide Web. My church, The Church of \nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has family history information on \nnearly 500 million individuals on its family history Web site \n(www.familysearch.com).\n  I thank the 84 members who cosponsored this important resolution and \nurge all my colleagues to join with me in drawing attention to our \nhuman heritage by voting for this resolution.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, first of all, I want to share with my \ncolleagues my expressions of gratitude to our President, President \nBush, and his team as they have conducted the affairs of our state over \nthese last number of days since the tragedy of September 11. As has \nbeen said over and over again, both in this Chamber and elsewhere, they \nhave done, I think, a superlative job. They have done so with the \ncomplete, total cooperation of the distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Daschle, the Democratic leader in the House, Richard Gephardt, \nalong with Speaker Hastert and, of course, the minority leader, Senator \nLott, and others.\n  The past days have been a wonderful expression of the kind of unity \nand support that the country expected, and, I think, deserved. We are \non the right track, in my view. None of us knows, as the President said \nso eloquently just a few feet from here in the other Chamber almost a \nweek ago, if we can say with any certainty what course this response of \nours will take or how long it will take--but we know the outcome. And \nthe outcome for certain is that democracy will trump terrorists. It may \ntake us weeks or months--even years--but I stand with those who say \nthat in the final analysis, maybe long after those of us who are \nMembers of this Chamber today are gone from our service here, we will \nprevail. And to those who share our values and commitment to the \neradication of international terrorism, we stand with them.\n  So it is with that as a backdrop, in a way, that I rise to speak this \nafternoon, because I was so disheartened to be in my office a little \nwhile ago to hear the proposal of an amendment or two that would be \noffered next week to the Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  I listened just about 2 hours ago to my President speak to the \nemployees of the Central Intelligence Agency, along with George Tenet, \nthe Director. The President's words were once again eloquent, and \ncertainly captured my feelings, my sense of gratitude to the men and \nwomen who work in our intelligence-gathering agencies for the \ntremendous job they do, under tremendous pressures, with tremendously \nhigh expectations.\n  The President, once again, reminded his audience there, as he has the \nAmerican audience, and the audience of this world, that the ultimate \noutcome of this effort we are now undertaking will absolutely, without \nany equivocation, depend upon international cooperation.\n  The idea, somehow, that the United States, with all of our strength--\neconomically, militarily--will be able unilaterally to seek out, find, \nand destroy international terrorism is a myth.\n  I know there are those who suggest we may be left with no one else \nbut ourselves to deal with this. That may be the case. I doubt it, but \nit may be the case. But the idea that somehow we\n\n[[Page S9860]]\n\nare going to be able to, on our own, go after terrorism, in what the \nPresident has described as at least 60 other nations that harbor these \ngroups, is totally a myth. What is going to be absolutely essential, if \nwe are going to succeed--and I have no doubt we will--in dealing with \nthis problem, for however long it takes, will be cooperation by our \nallies, by friends, by even some who may not be our friends today but \nwho share the common goal of eradicating the scourge of terrorism.\n  That is going to require a herculean effort, on behalf of our people, \nby very bright, sophisticated leaders. I happen to think we have those \nleaders. I have great confidence in General Colin Powell, the Secretary \nof State. We have not always agreed over the years on various matters, \nbut he is a patriot, a person who understands the kind of world in \nwhich we live.\n  I think Don Rumsfeld demonstrated, beyond any question of a doubt, \nhis courage and patriotism on September 11, as he stayed in the bunker \nof the Pentagon during the assault on that institution.\n  I have no doubt that Condoleezza Rice too will serve our country \nwell--I continue down the list. I think these are not just good people, \nthey are bright people. They are competent people who can do a good job \nto go out and develop and build those relationships.\n  Whether this problem is solved diplomatically, militarily, or by a \ncombination of the two, it is going to require international \ncooperation.\n  Mr. President, why do I focus on this? Because I hear that we are \nabout to vote and consider an amendment to the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill that would absolutely prohibit the United States \nfrom being involved in developing a court of international justice, an \ninternational criminal court.\n  I cannot believe that at this hour this great body of the U.S. Senate \nis about to go on record, at the very moment we are asking the world to \njoin us in apprehending the thugs and criminals who took 6,000 lives in \nNew York and several hundred here in Washington, that this Chamber, \nthis body, this Government, at this hour, would say we will have \nnothing to do with the establishment of an international criminal \ncourt. So I come to the Chamber to express my outrage that we might \nconsider such a proposal. I do not object to the notion that, as \npresently crafted, the treaty of the Rome statute, which would \nestablish the court, is flawed. In fact, if, for some reason, \nmiraculously the proposal were brought to this Senate Chamber this \nafternoon, and I were asked to vote on it as is, I would vote against \nit because it is a flawed agreement. But that is not to say we should \nnot stay at the table to try to work it out so that it becomes a viable \nproduct which we can support and gather behind.\n\n  So when I hear, on the one hand, how we need to develop international \ncooperation to go after these people, and we turn around and walk away \nfrom an institution which could make a significant contribution to \ndealing with this problem, I find it stunning. My fervent hope would be \nif, for whatever reason, this matter, as it is presently structured, \ncomes up for a vote, that we would vote against it.\n  I do not know what vehicles may be available to me, but I am going to \nstrenuously object to the idea we would consider such a proposal. God \nknows that the horrific acts we witnessed 2 weeks ago suggest that an \ninternational forum for bringing to justice those who commit terrorist \nacts or acts against humanity is now more needed than ever.\n  Let me step back a little bit in history, if I can. It was the United \nStates, at the end of World War II, under our leadership, that created \nthe U.N. system. With all of its warts, with all of its shortcomings, \nwith its mounds of bureaucracy that infuriate from time to time, I do \nnot know of any sensible person who believes that the world would be a \nsafer or better place in the absence of that building on the East River \nin New York, where the world can gather to resolve, or attempt to \nresolve, some of the most difficult disputes and problems we face. It \nhas not solved all of them by any stretch--and I can't prove a \nnegative; I don't know how many were avoided because of its existence--\nbut I happen to believe that most people--reasonable people--believe \nthat the establishment of a U.N. system has been a worthwhile endeavor. \nIt has made the last 50 years, with all of its various problems around \nthe globe, a safer 50 years than it would have been had that \ninstitution not existed.\n  What a great irony it is that the very people who understood the \nvalue of having a U.N. system--people such as General George Marshall, \npeople such as Harry Truman, people who came after in terms of the \nwisdom of our foreign policy, the John Foster Dulles giants, who said \nwe really do need to establish these forums to try to act as a buffer, \nas a place where some of these efforts can be resolved without using \nthe historic means of resolution; and that is armed confrontation--how \nironic, indeed, that this great Nation, which fought tooth and nail to \nestablish the U.N. system, the genocide convention is now shirking its \ninternational duty.\n  In fact, you will forgive me if I indulge in a little personal \nobservation. As some of my colleagues here are aware, I was a 1-year-\nold child in 1945 when my father left my mother and five of us to go to \na place called Nuremberg where for the next year and a half he was an \nexecutive trial counsel at the first Nuremberg trials.\n  I grew up as a child, after my father returned, hearing about what \nthat tribunal had tried to accomplish, what it had been able to do, and \nhow my father in many ways regretted there had not been in the 1930s \nsuch a forum in existence where we might have been able to bring a thug \nlike Adolf Hitler to justice. He would often say the existence of a \ncriminal tribunal that could take the Hitlers and Milosevics to task \nmight just have avoided the problems that later emerged.\n  It is stunning to me, as I have said already, that at this very \nmoment where we have watched the most significant and historic attack \non innocent civilians in our Nation's history, and where we are calling \nwith one voice for international cooperation to help find not only \nthose responsible but to develop a system that would minimize these \nevents from occurring again, that we might take a step away from the \nestablishment of a forum that would be a place where those who are \nresponsible could be brought to a bar of justice.\n  We saw the difficulty that occurred when we finally were able to \ndetermine who was responsible for the terrorist attack on Pan Am Flight \n103, and we know how hard it was to find a forum where those people \ncould be tried. It ultimately took a Scottish court and significant \nnegotiations to bring those criminals to justice. Had we had an \nInternational Criminal Court as we do today in the Hague for other such \nmatters, we might have had a forum where that matter could have been \nresolved without going through the difficulties we saw.\n  One of the arguments that has been raised is that we don't want young \nmen and women in uniform, who are going out today to the far corners of \nthe world to deal with this issue, to be apprehended and tried before \nsome kangaroo court. I do not want that either. But whether we are a \npart of drafting this agreement or not, it may get established--in \nfact, it is likely to--without our participation. And our young men and \nwomen in uniform are going to be subjected to that jurisdiction whether \nwe like it or not.\n  The fact that we are not a signatory to the court doesn't mean that \nsomehow our servicemen and women are exempt from its jurisdiction. All \nit means is that when we retreat from helping craft this court our \nability to structure it in a way that would minimize the threat of \ninnocent men and women in uniform being brought before it is gone. The \nmessage we are sending right now is that we are going to walk away from \nthis process and leave our young men and women subjected to the \npotential vagaries of such a court because we do not want to be \ninvolved in the discussions surrounding its creation.\n  This amendment is called, ironically, the American Servicemen's \nProtection Act. It is anything but. The establishment of this amendment \nplaces our men and women in uniform in greater jeopardy than they would \nbe if we were to participate in trying to develop the structures of \nthis court to minimize problems.\n  We are simply sticking a finger, at the very hour we ought to be \ndoing otherwise, in the eyes of our friends.\n\n[[Page S9861]]\n\n Clearly, war criminals and terrorists must be thrilled at the notion \nthat an international bar of justice continues to be blocked by their \narch enemy, the United States of America.\n  I am prepared to take whatever steps I can in the next few days to \nsee to it that this amendment is defeated. It was in this very Chamber \non the night of September 10 that I stood and objected to the Craig \namendment, which eliminated all funding for us to get involved in \nestablishment of this court. I was urged not to ask my colleagues for a \nrecorded vote. I didn't. I regret so now.\n  Within less than 24 hours of that night, we saw an international act \nof terrorism take the lives of many of our fellow citizens. I am not \nsuggesting the adoption or the defeat of that amendment would have \nchanged the course of history, but how ironic that on the eve of the \nSeptember 11th attack, this body went on record as saying we are not \neven going to finance a commission of the United States to go in and \ntry and improve the Rome treaty, to try to make it more workable and \nmore acceptable to the United States.\n  That amendment was adopted as part of the State-Justice-Commerce \nappropriations bill. The question now is whether or not we are going to \ntake the language under this so-called American Servicemen's Protection \nAct and incorporate it as part of the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  I am disheartened because I understand that the administration, \ndespite the fact they had expressed some opposition to such an approach \nonly a few days ago, has now decided to give their endorsement to this \nproposal in exchange for which apparently the Republican leadership in \nthe House are going to release the U.N. arrearages. That is the \ntradeoff apparently.\n  To their credit, the administration has negotiated some waiver \nauthority in these proposals. But the overall message we are sending to \nthe international community is a terrible one, in my view. On the one \nhand, the Secretary has called on everyone to stand with us, while on \nthe other hand, we are once again suggesting that we can go it alone. \nIt is contradictory, to say the very least.\n  It is just like the approach we have taken on too many other issues. \nI won't go into all of them here. But if we are going to be asking the \nworld to cooperate, we have to send a better message on some of these \nother issues. I favor increased security measures here at home as well \nas additional authorities for law enforcement. I will take a back seat \nto no one in our common determination to improve the quality of safety \nin this country. But as all of my colleagues, I believe it ought to be \ndone thoughtfully so that we don't wake up one day and find that our \nNation as we know it exists no longer.\n  I don't want my country to become a gated community internationally. \nI don't want to have to go through all sorts of walls and metal \ndetectors to get in to visit some friends. I want my country to still \nbe a free and open place. I want us to be engaged in the world. You \ncan't be a gated community in the international sense and also be a \nmajor player globally and economically. You certainly are not going to \nbe successful in going after terrorists if you decide we are going to \nbecome a gated community and retreat from international agreements. \nThen the terrorists victory is vastly in excess of what it was on \nSeptember 11.\n  That day they destroyed buildings and took lives and we will never \nforget their actions. But if beyond that they are also able to do \nthings to cause us to walk away from international agreements and \ncreate that gated community here at home, then their victory is far \nbeyond the terrible success they had only a few short days ago.\n  I hope my colleagues over the weekend will give some thought to this \namendment. Don't be deceived by the title. It is anything but \nprotecting our service men and women.\n  Finally, it seems to me that it is time to be honest with ourselves \nabout why international terrorism has become such a growing threat. We \nneed only look into the oppressed faces of citizens of some of the \ngovernments we, frankly, have supported despite their less than \nacceptable treatment of their own citizenry over the years. The \nchildren, teenagers, of many of these countries grow up hating their \nleaders and, frankly, our own country for keeping them in power, \nsupporting them as they stay in power. These young people become foot \nsoldiers who are all too readily persuaded by the likes of the Osama \nbin Ladens of this world that violence is the answer to their \ngrievances. And I would hope, as we analyze what we need to do at home \nto protect our security and how we can play a more constructive role \ninternationally and build those coalitions that are essential for our \nlong-term success in overcoming this threat, that we also take time to \nstand up to some of these regimes and be on the side of humanity \neverywhere.\n\n  Our Founding Fathers did not only talk about those in the United \nStates when they talked about inalienable rights; they wisely wrote \nabout all people, not only those who lived within the borders of the \nthen-Thirteen Colonies of what would constitute the United States. They \nspoke to the aspirations and hopes of other people as well.\n  We are that legacy, if you will. We are the generations that will \ncome after to perpetuate those very values. This is a vastly different \nworld than those who founded this country faced. Today, we are talking \nabout billions of people around the globe, and about a nation whose \npower is vastly in excess of what is was 220 years ago. If we are going \nto live up to the ideals incorporated in the Declaration of \nIndependence and the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, then we need \nto understand and hear those voices out there who cry out for some \nleadership, cry out for advocates. We ought to step back and look and \nsee whether or not our short-term policy needs are satisfying the long-\nterm security needs of the Nation.\n  We must also come to grips with the Muslim faith. That doesn't mean \ntrying to keep secular governments in place in countries where the will \nof the people is otherwise. It means beginning to understand the \nunderlying premises of that faith, and by conveying our respect. It \nmeans a commitment by our Government to spend resources so that we \nunderstand them better.\n  That is what President Kennedy was trying to do when he created the \nPeace Corps 40 years ago. The Peace Corps is a wonderful organization. \nI was proud to have been a member of the Peace Corps some 35 years ago. \nHowever, it has not been as active, in my view, as it could have been, \nparticularly in Muslim countries where we might have been better served \nby having hundreds of thousands of young Americans working in those \npoor communities.\n  It is not an easy task for the Peace Corps to go everywhere, but the \nfocus should be on those areas where the need is the greatest like \nAfghanistan and Pakistan and Indonesia. Taking the time to recruit the \npeople with the language skills and ability and knowledge of these \ncultures could do an awful lot to change some of the anti-American \nattitudes we see, in my view. We should be getting started now so that \nin the aftermath of the military actions we are going to take, \nparticularly in some of the Muslim countries, we will be ready to show \na different face of our country, one that isn't simply militarily \nstrong, but one that also incorporates justice and humanity and respect \nfor religious faiths, in accordance with the true principles deeply \nimbedded in our own value systems that call for the exercise of freedom \nin our own Nation.\n  It is time to take a hard look at our path. Yes, we need to act in \nthe coming days to address the immediate threats, as I mentioned \nalready--the challenges confronting our Nation in the international \ncommunity that stem from the tragedy at the World Trade Center and our \nPentagon. But we have to take a longer and harder look at those actions \nat home and abroad that will make not only ourselves safer, but the \nworld safer for our citizens and the citizens of this globe.\n  History will judge how we act, not only in the short term, protecting \nour shores, which is our primary responsibility, but also the kind of \nframework we establish and the kind of reaching out that will be \nnecessary. So when the history of our generation is written on how we \nresponded to this great crisis at home, historians will write about a \ngreat nation that did not close its doors and create a gated community,\n\n[[Page S9862]]\n\nbut truly reached out to the international community and respected the \nrights of all human beings and made an effort to understand the \ngrievances that built up in the ranks of these madmen terrorists that \nallowed them to carry out their savage attacks as they did on the World \nTrade Center and the Pentagon. That is a complicated task.\n  The world is looking to us. We are the greatest power on the face of \nthe Earth--economically, politically, and militarily. They are looking \nto see how we respond to this. If next week we adopt amendments here \nthat walk away from international criminal courts, and we just go in \nmilitarily and don't understand what is behind some of these reactions \nwe are seeing in these places, then I think history will judge us \nharshly. So our first responsibility is to protect our citizens--not \njust the generation we presently represent, but the generations we also \nrepresent who are yet unborn whose very fate may be determined by the \nactions we take in the coming days.\n  I have no doubt that President George Walker Bush and his team are \nnot only competent but are dedicated and have the ability to lead us. \nThey have a Congress and a nation that wants to follow them.\n  I only urge that they act wisely and not cut deals and make \narrangements for short-term success that could do our Nation some very \nlong-term harm.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9862-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9862-S9864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking my colleague \nfor those eloquent and passionate and insightful remarks, and for his \nextraordinary leadership, not only in this time but as he shows \nthroughout all of our work in Congress. I thank him for his guidance on \nthis issue which is so important. I look forward to joining him on this \nissue when we reconvene next week.\n  Mr. President, as the Senator from Connecticut so eloquently spoke \nabout for the last half hour or so--about the importance of alliances \nat this time, the importance of international alliances, the \nextraordinary opportunity that has been given to us out of this tragedy \nto build a new framework of mutual trust and mutual cooperation for the \nbenefit of all citizens of this world who love freedom, who hope for a \nbetter life, who want only for themselves, their children, and their \ngrandchildren to live free of oppression, free from fear, free from \nhunger, free from want, it is really an extraordinary time.\n  I want to acknowledge the leadership that I have seen in this body in \na way that I never thought I would. I am certain that most people in my \nState and in many States don't completely really understand yet the \nextraordinary length to which the Members of this body, both Democrats \nand Republicans, have worked to overcome some very difficult issues in \ntrying to work so closely with the President, and have done this in a \nremarkable way under his tremendous leadership, as the Senator from \nConnecticut also pointed out.\n  I think we have made great progress in the last 2 weeks, since \nSeptember 11. We are on the right track and at the right pace. We just \nhave to steady our course and continue to support our President and \ndebate where we need to and not give up our right to judgment, and do \nit in a way that will strengthen our country and will honor the spirit \nthat Americans everywhere are showing us around the world and move \nforward to win this war.\n  I want to spend a few minutes before we close today speaking about an \nimportant part of this effort, an important part of the Defense \nauthorization bill, which we have been engaged in debating now under \nthe great leadership of Senator Levin from Michigan and the Senator \nfrom Virginia, Senator Warner.\n  In my mind, the cold war finally ended at 8:45 a.m. eastern time on \nTuesday, September 11. Literally, up until that moment, this Congress \nhad engaged in something akin to shadowboxing.\n  We swung our arms about in search of enemies, and in search of a \nunifying purpose to our national security. Yet in life, it is often \ntragedy and crisis that lifts the fog from our eyes. Suddenly, we see \nthe world with crystal-like clarity. We understand better that which is \ntrivial and that which is absolutely essential. We look back on our \npriorities before this crisis, and I think many of us have been shaking \nour heads wondering: What could we possibly have been thinking?\n  One truth that should now be evident to America's collective world \nview is that we need a strong and practical relationship with Russia. \nThere is a bond between the United States and Russia that defies \ncoincidence. Of course, we share the common experience of the cold war. \nIt was not a pleasant experience, it was not a good experience, but it \nwas an experience that we shared. Now it appears we will share the \nexperience of fighting in Afghanistan.\n  Russia itself has been attacked by terrorists, supported by elements \nof the Arab Afghan army, the very force that we trained during the cold \nwar and now has unleashed its terror upon us.\n  In short, our countries have a history of lashing out at each other. \nYet when we do, we inevitably hurt ourselves. It is an instinct we \nlearned during the cold war, but we must unlearn that instinct to \nsucceed in this silent war. Hopefully, on September 11, we closed for \ngood that chapter in our relationship.\n  There are many things that make me proud about this Defense \nauthorization bill that we have been debating and will hopefully \nconclude that debate when we reconvene next week, but one of the things \nthat makes me proudest about this year's Defense authorization bill is \nthat even before the events of the 11th, we understood the importance \nof our relationship with Russia. Senators Nunn and Lugar deserve the \nthanks of the whole of the American public for their extraordinary \nforesight. They realized that at the end of the cold war, in the \ntremendous vacuum that was created, we needed to be aggressive in \nforming a new relationship with Russia. It would not be a relationship \nbased on fear, deception, and suspicion. Rather, it would be a \nrelationship grounded in our common history, our common roles as great \npowers, and our mutual interest in establishing a world where our \ncitizens could flourish.\n  The only way forward to this goal is up the trail blazed by Senators \nNunn and Lugar. The Cooperative Threat Reduction Program sponsored by \nthe Department of Defense has been under assault in this Congress since \nI joined the Armed Services Committee. It was derided as welfare to ex-\nCommunists. We slashed and hamstrung the programs, claiming to react to \nmismanagement.\n  With the hard work of my friend and now partner, Mr. Roberts, the \nSenator from Kansas, we reversed that trend this year. The subcommittee \nmark for the Emerging Threats included full funding for the Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program at $403 million. Of these funds, $50 million \nis dedicated to chemical demilitarization of the Soviet Union.\n  The facts before us should be crystal clear to everyone. There should \nbe no more urgent priority for this country than to secure and destroy \nthe chemical, biological, and nuclear stockpiles of the former Soviet \nUnion.\n  On that exact point, there was a beautifully written op-ed piece by \nformer Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia. I ask unanimous consent to print \nthe op-ed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Sept. 16, 2001]\n\n                   Living in a New Era of Insecurity\n\n                             (By Sam Nunn)\n\n       The bitter events of last week will never pass from the \n     American memory. But whether they are remembered as an \n     isolated, unrepeated horror or the first nightmare in a new \n     era of insecurity may well depend on what we do now.\n       The terrorists who planned and carried out the attacks of \n     Sept. 11 showed there is no limit to the number of innocent \n     lives they are willing to take. Their capacity for killing \n     was restricted only by the power of their weapons.\n\n[[Page S9863]]\n\n       As we strengthen airport and airplane security, we must \n     automatically assume that the next attack against America \n     will be like the one we just experienced.\n       Though we may not yet know with certainty which group \n     sponsored these attacks we do know that Osama bin Laden \n     declared in 1998 that acquiring weapons of mass destruction \n     is ``a religious duty.'' This statement should not be taken \n     lightly. We have had a look at the face of terrorist warfare \n     in the 21st century, and it gives us little hope that if \n     these groups gained control of nuclear, biological and \n     chemical weapons they would hesitate to use them.\n       As America prepares a response, we must build a new \n     framework for national security that protects us from the \n     full range of new dangers we face.\n       Ten years ago a communist empire broke apart. Its legacy: \n     30,000 nuclear warheads; more than 1,000 tons of highly \n     enriched uranium; 150 tons of plutonium; 40,000 tons of \n     chemical weapons; 4,500 tons of anthrax and tens of thousands \n     of scientists who know how to make weapons and missiles but \n     don't know how to feed their families. Russia's dysfunctional \n     economy and eroded security systems have undercut controls on \n     these weapons, materials and know-how and increased the risk \n     that they may flow to hostile forces.\n       Our nation understands from heart-shattering experience \n     that America is targeted for terrorist attack. But we do not \n     fully grasp how Russia's loose controls over weapons, \n     materials and know-how dramatically increase our \n     vulnerability to an attack with nuclear, biological and \n     chemical weapons. In 1998, an employee at Russia's premier \n     nuclear weapons laboratory was arrested for trying to sell \n     documents on weapons design to agents of Iraq and \n     Afghanistan. Just this year, former Bin Laden associate \n     admitted to a federal grand jury his role in a plot to \n     purchase uranium.\n       Threats of terrorism and threats of weapons of mass \n     destruction are not separate but interrelated and \n     reinforcing. The world's security now depends in great part \n     on who is faster and smarter--those trying to get weapons, \n     materials and know-how, or those trying to stop them.\n       To reduce these threats to our own security, we have--for \n     the past 10 years--helped the Russians secure weapons and \n     weapons materials to prevent theft, convert nuclear weapons \n     facilities to civilian purposes and employ their weapons \n     scientists in peaceful pursuits. But we need to do much more.\n       Russia itself has experienced terrible terrorist attacks in \n     recent years, and its outpouring of support in the past few \n     days indicates there may be a real opportunity for enhanced \n     U.S.-Russia cooperation.\n       Early this year, a distinguished bipartisan task force \n     declared loose weapons, materials and know-how in Russia \n     ``the most urgent unmet national security threat to the \n     United States,'' and called for a fourfold funding increase \n     to reduce these threats. We need to reflect this sound advice \n     in our budget priorities. Keeping weapons of mass destruction \n     out of terrorists' hands is either a priority or an \n     afterthought. If it is an afterthought, after what?\n       The tragic events of this week have given us a rare \n     opportunity to lead a world coalition against terrorism. \n     NATO, for the first time in 52 years, has formally declared \n     that the alliance has been attacked, and 19 democracies are \n     now committed to join America in hitting back. We also have \n     other partners in Europe Asia, the Middle East, Latin \n     America, and Africa.\n       To carry out the Bush Administration's declaration of war \n     against terrorism, we must:\n       Prevent terrorist groups from getting nuclear, biological \n     or chemical weapons, weapons materials and know-how.\n       Eliminate terrorist cells wherever they are, including in \n     the United States.\n       Enlist the support of our coalition partners to destroy the \n     infrastructure and cut off the funding of terrorist groups \n     wherever they are.\n       Make no distinction between the terrorists who committed \n     these acts and those who knowingly harbor them, as President \n     Bush has said.\n       Take every feasible and reasonable step in our military \n     planning to avoid inflicting large numbers of civilian \n     casualties that will only sow the seeds of the next \n     generation of fanatical, suicidal terrorists.\n       Make it clear by our words and actions that our war is \n     against terrorist, not a war against Islam at home or abroad.\n       Continue to address the underlying conflicts and condition \n     around the world that breed fanatical hatred and terrorism--\n     probably our most difficult challenge.\n       Promote and enhance the diplomacy, intelligence gathering \n     and cooperation that are our first line of defense.\n       In implementing this strategy, we must make sure that we \n     don't undercut the international cooperation we need to \n     protect ourselves against a wide range of dangers.\n       The United States cannot identify and eliminate terrorist \n     groups, destroy their funding and support, apply pressure to \n     rogue regimes, secure dangerous materials, limit the spread \n     of weapons of mass destruction and gather intelligence \n     without the support and active cooperation of allies and \n     former adversaries. While we must be prepared to act alone if \n     necessary, if we are going to go after terrorists before they \n     come to our shores, we must have partners abroad.\n       We must develop a comprehensive defense against the full \n     range of threats, based on relative risk and supported by \n     strong alliances so that the pain of today will not be known \n     by the children of tomorrow.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to quote a few sentences from \nthis beautifully written piece. He says:\n\n       The terrorists who planned and carried out the attacks of \n     Sept. 11 showed there is no limit to the number of innocent \n     lives they are willing to take. Their capacity for killing \n     was restricted only by the power of their weapons.\n       Though we may not yet know with certainty which group \n     sponsored these attacks, we do know that Osama bin Laden \n     declared in 1998 that acquiring weapons of mass destruction \n     is ``a religious duty.'' This statement should not be taken \n     lightly. We have had a look at the face of terrorist warfare \n     in the 21st century, and it gives us little hope that if \n     these groups gained control of nuclear, biological and \n     chemical weapons they would not hesitate to use them.\n       As America prepares a response, we must build a new \n     framework for national security that protects us from the \n     full range of the new dangers we face.\n\n  Mr. President, we cannot, we should not try, it would be foolhardy to \nbegin to try to build this framework without a strong partnership with \nRussia.\n  We know of nearly 400 incidents to purchase or smuggle this material \nsince the end of the cold war. We can safely assume that for every \npurchase or smuggling operation we stopped--and we stopped many--others \nsucceeded. Yet the technology and framework for locking down these \nstockpiles is within our grasp.\n  Today we fund the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program at $403 \nmillion a year. We spent 100 times that amount of money in 1 day to \nrespond to the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\n  Let me repeat that. Today we fund this Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram at $403 million a year. We spent 100 times that amount in 1 day \nto deal with the crisis that hit us at the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon 2 weeks ago.\n  Keep in mind that this is the immediate cost only to the \nstabilization, rescue, and cleanup of these sites. We will be spending \nbillions more.\n  Now imagine the cleanup costs that result from an attack by a weapon \nof mass destruction. As horrific and as heartwrenching and as merciless \nas were the attacks and the casualties from those attacks on September \n11, a weapon of mass destruction promises to be a whole scale of \nmagnitude worse. The devastation could be beyond our imagination.\n  Yet there have been many reports on this subject. The Baker-Cutler \nreport notes that we need to spend, in their estimation, nearly $30 \nbillion to address just the nuclear side of this equation over the next \n8 to 10 years. At our current rate of $3 billion a year, that would \nrequire a tenfold increase.\n  Furthermore, it is my opinion that we cannot wait 8 to 10 years, and \nwe must address all weapons of mass destruction in a more direct, \nfocused, urgent, and intelligent way.\n  All of this is a long way of saying that Russia's stockpiles of \nweapons of mass destruction constitute a vital national security \ninterest second to none. No resource should be spared, no bureaucratic \nhurdle left standing, no diplomatic initiative left unexplored to \neliminate the risk these weapons represent.\n  The preamble of our Constitution makes it incumbent on this Congress \nto ``provide for the common defence . . . and secure the Blessings of \nLiberty to ourselves and our Posterity.'' If we take the lessons \nlearned from September 11 and destroy these weapons, we will have done \nourselves and our posterity a great service.\n  As we embark on this extended and silent war against terrorism, I \nbelieve that nonproliferation represents one of the true front lines. \nIf we lose the momentum necessary to destroy these stockpiles now, the \noutcome of this war must be in doubt.\n  I know the American people understand the heavy costs we will have to \nbear. This is surely one of those costs, but I am confident, because I \nhave seen on the faces of Americans everywhere--people in my home \nState, children who have stopped to talk with me, friends who have \ncalled, strangers who have walked in my office and left notes and \nmissives, telephone calls I have received--that the American people are \nready, they are united, they are willing, strong enough, and without \nfear to accomplish this goal.\n\n[[Page S9864]]\n\n  I believe there are a variety of answers to that question when people \nask: When will we know this war has been won? I will say this: One of \nthe best indications of whether or not we are winning this war is our \nsuccess in cooperative threat reduction. The struggle is on, but this \nis an objective that freedom-loving people must take and hold.\n  I have every confidence the Members of this body, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, regardless of their views, will understand, and with new \ninsight will appreciate, because of the tragedy that is before us, the \nurgency of this subject. I am looking forward to doing my part, with \nother committees that obviously have influence in this area, to work \nacross party lines, to work with House leaders, to work with men and \nwomen who have served before in this body, who have quite an expertise \nin this area, as well as our private sector, think-tanks, our \nuniversities, to put all of our best thoughts and efforts in action and \nto be focused as a laser so we can provide for the common defense of \nthis Nation, the common defense of civilizations and freedom-loving \npeople around the world, and that Americans will do what Americans do \nbest, which is to put our best foot forward with clarity, with \ncommitment, with purpose, with the practical way that Americans move \nforward to take on this task and to do it well. I am confident that as \nwe do, we will be successful in this endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9864-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9864-S9865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE SEZNA FAMILY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I apologize to my colleagues and to my \nconstituents for being absent from the Senate this morning, and \nespecially for missing the vote on the Military Construction \nAppropriations bill. I was attending one of the, tragically, many \nfuneral services being conducted across the country.\n  If my colleagues will permit me a point of personal privilege, this \nfuneral service had a special and profound impact on me, for the victim \nwas a brilliant young man who was the oldest son, and best friend, of \none of my very good friends, Davis Sezna.\n  The young man who was killed on the 104th floor of the World Trade \nCenter's Tower II, where he had arrived on September 11th for just his \nsixth day of work there, was Davis Grier Sezna, Jr., known to his \nfamily and to all who loved him as ``Deeg.'' His parents, Gail and \nDavis Sezna, are community leaders in Delaware; they are people I \nadmire and respect; and, again, they are my good friends. Deeg is also \nsurvived by a younger brother, Willy, who is a senior in high school, \nand by his grandmother, Mrs. W.W. Sezna, his grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. \nH.G. Ingersoll, and numerous aunts, uncles and cousins and seemingly \ncountless friends.\n  As inconceivable as it is, Deeg, who was 22 years old, was \npredeceased by his youngest brother, Teddy, who died in a boating \naccident last year at the age of 15. So the Sezna family has been \nstruck twice by the sudden, tragic death of a healthy, vibrant and much \nloved son, brother and grandson. Like so many of our fellow citizens, \nthey were so full of life, and then they were gone.\n  As inconceivable as the tragedy is, even more remarkable to me is the \nway in which the Sezna family has responded to loss that would cripple \nmany people's faith and spirit. When Deeg was still listed as \n``missing,'' they held onto hope as long as they could, joining the \nlegions of loved ones in New York, searching hospitals and talking with \nthe rescue workers and local officials, determined to do everything \nthey humanly could, and asking for God's help, for themselves and for \nothers. As Davis said then, ``It would be very selfish at a time like \nthis for anyone to just pray for themselves. We need to pray for all of \nus. We're not in this alone.''\n  When it became undeniable that everything had been done, and that \nthere was no more hope of bringing Deeg home alive, his family \ncontinued to reach out to others. This grieving father, who had been in \nthe boat accident in which his youngest son was lost and who had been \non the streets of New York searching for his oldest son, this man, who \nhad more reason to feel despair and rage and fear and to just give up \nthan almost anyone, he called me and said, ``I will go and stand with \nyou anywhere, any time, any place to tell people, `Don't be afraid.' ''\n  With those words, Davis Sezna became more than my friend, he became \none of my heroes. When you feel like your world is ending, and I don't \nknow what can do that more than the death of a child, there is \nimmeasurable courage behind the power to believe in the future. In one \nof the great inspirations I have ever known, the Sezna family still \nbelieves; as Davis told Sports Illustrated, when they interviewed him \nfor a profile on Deeg as one of the athletes killed in the terrorist \nattacks, all the Seznas have been great golfers, ``I live for tomorrow. \nI'm inspired by tomorrow. There will always be tomorrow.''\n  In our efforts to respond to the events of September 11th, I can \nthink of no higher goal for us as a nation, than to endeavor to justify \nthe Sezna family's courageous faith in tomorrow.\n  And I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the Sports \nIllustrated profile be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n               [From Sports Illustrated, Sept. 24, 2001]\n\n                            Unplayable Lies\n\n                         (By Michael Bamberger)\n\n       A father was on the golf course, and his son was at work. \n     The morning was crisp, bright, perfect. Twenty-two-year-old \n     Davis G. Sezna Jr., known as Deeg, was working in the south \n     tower, 2 World Trade Center. His father, Davis Sr., was \n     playing at Pine Hill, a new public course in southern New \n     Jersey, just down the road from Pine Valley.\n       ``Dad,'' Deeg would sometimes ask, ``do you think someday \n     I'll be Pine Valley material?'' Augusta National, Cypress \n     Point, Seminole, Pine Valley. Those are the four sacred \n     corners of the shawl that wraps private-club golf in the U.S. \n     For many of its members, Pine Valley is the ultimate \n     sanctuary, Davis Sezna, 48, is one of those members.\n       Deeg was employed by another Pine Valley member, Jimmy \n     Dunne, a managing principal at Sandler O'Neill & Partners, a \n     financial-services company. The father made the introduction, \n     but from there the son was on his own. Dunne and Deeg played \n     a round of golf together. Golf reveals a man; that's what \n     Dunne believes, Davis Sr. does too. ``Golf's a great \n     interview,'' he says. Later Deeg came into the office for a \n     sit-down meeting with Dunne and the firm's other principals. \n     Deeg was wearing a suit. He was serious, energetic, \n     respectful. He was offered a job.\n       ``Can I start on May 14, Mr. Dunne?'' Deeg asked. In other \n     words, graduate from Vanderbilt on a Friday, take the weekend \n     off, then begin work on Monday.\n       ``No, you cannot,'' Dunne answered. ``Take the summer off. \n     Kiss a pretty girl. You don't have to call me Mr. Dunne, and \n     you don't have to wear a suit.''\n       Deeg took the summer off. He started work the day after \n     Labor Day. Wore a suit every day. Called his boss Mr. Dunne. \n     He will make it here doing something, Jimmy Dunne remembers \n     thinking. Banker, trader, salesman, something. On Sept. 11, \n     Deeg's sixth day on the job, he arrived for work a little \n     after seven.\n       Deeg's father works in golf. He's an owner of a busy public \n     course outside Philadelphia, Hartefield National, the site of \n     a Senior tour event in 1998 and '99. He's going into business \n     with the owner of Pine Hill, which is why he was there on \n     that beautiful Tuesday morning that so abruptly turned grim \n     and gray. Somebody pulled him off the course when the first \n     plane smashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center. \n     He was watching the terror unfold on TV when the second plane \n     struck his son's building. ``I knew Deeg was on the 104th \n     floor,'' he says. ``The plane hit, an hour passed, the \n     building crumpled. A friend drove me home.''\n       The Sezna house is in Delaware, in the rolling countryside \n     outside Wilmington, near the Brandywine River, the pastoral \n     land the Wyeths have been painting for three generations. The \n     kitchen dates to the 17th century. The backyard is a long, \n     sweeping hill, ending at a pond. The three Sezna boys would \n     hit wedge shots and take divots out of that lawn all summer \n     long. Gail Sezna, their mother, would look the other way. Her \n     father-in-law was a superb golfer. Her husband was the 1973 \n     Delaware Open champion. Her sons were being raised in the \n     game as well.\n       ``My dad used to say, `A golfer is a gentleman,' '' Davis \n     Sr. says. ``I raised my sons to understand that. The first \n     time I brought Deeg to the course, he was five. As we left, \n     he said, ``Was I a gentleman today, Daddy?'' He dabs his eyes \n     with a napkin embossed with scallop shells.\n       This was last Thursday, two days after the attack. The \n     father had spent the previous day in the detritus of the \n     World Trade Center, searching for his son. Now he was in his \n     backyard, in the ``final innings of hope,'' as he put it. \n     Friends were visiting. The men were golfers, members of Pine \n     Valley, Semi-nole, Merion, all clubs to which the father \n     belongs. Sezna also owns several popular restaurants in \n     Delaware. He was pouring good wine and slicing aged cheddar. \n     It only looked like a late-summer cocktail party. The chatter \n     could not mask the sorrow. Tom Fazio,\n\n[[Page S9865]]\n\n     the course architect, telephoned. He's a Pine Valley member \n     too.\n       ``Jimmy Dunne, God bless him, he was in there in the rubble \n     with us,'' the father told Fazio. Dunne's firm had 125 \n     employees on the 104th floor. Half of them were missing. More \n     than a few were serious golfers, or the sons of serious \n     golfers. Dunne is a serious golfer. He wasn't in the office \n     on that horrid Tuesday morning because he was attempting to \n     qualify for the U.S. Mid-Amateur, a lifelong dream for him.\n       The conversation with Fazio came to a close. ``They can rip \n     off your arms and legs, Tom, you just don't want them taking \n     your children,'' Davis Sr. told him. ``I love you, Tom Fazio. \n     Give Sue and your kids a big hug from me.''\n       Deeg once got his handicap down to four. Every third year, \n     on a midsummer weekend, he'd play in the two-day Father-Son \n     tournament at Pine Valley. One year the Seznas were in \n     contention as they stood on the 16th tee in the second round. \n     The format was alternate shot. One generation hits a shot, \n     then the other generation plays the next. The son hooked his \n     drive. The father needed to hit a big sweeping hook to reach \n     the green, which is bordered by a water hazard on the right.\n       ``Why don't you punch a safe one down in front, I'll chip \n     up, and you'll make the putt for par,'' the son said.\n       ``Nah, I can hook a five-iron on,'' the father said.\n       The five-iron shot didn't hook a bit. As it was heading for \n     the water, Deeg said, ``How old do I have to be before you'll \n     start listening to me?'' He was 15. From that double bogey \n     on, his father listened.\n       Last Thursday, Davis Sr. was showing a friend a picture of \n     his favorite foursome. Three boys and their father, all in \n     shorts and polo shirts and smiles, standing on the 14th tee \n     at Seminole, in North Palm Beach, Fla., the Atlantic Ocean \n     behind them, nothing but years of golf in front of them. The \n     father was on the far right, looking proud. He started to \n     identify his boys. ``That's Willie next to me,'' said Davis \n     Sr. ``He's a senior in high school, plays to a three \n     [handicap]. That's Deeg on the left. Between them, that's . . \n     . . ''\n       The name never came out. The boy was Teddy, the youngest \n     child of Gail and Davis Sezna. He died last year, at age 15, \n     on the first Saturday in July in an early-morning boating \n     accident. The father and son were cruising in a 30-foot \n     motorboat when they ran into a steel light pole. It took two \n     hours for rescuers to find Teddy's body. It took seven hours \n     to get everyone through the receiving line.\n       Last Saturday the father was backed in Manhattan, searching \n     for signs of his namesake in hope's final at bat. Somehow the \n     father found the courage, wisdom and grace to say, ``I live \n     for tomorrow. I'm inspired by tomorrow. There will always be \n     tomorrow.''\n       Willie Sezna now has a standing offer to join his father, \n     every summer, in the Pine Valley Father-Son. They'll play in \n     Deeg's memory. They'll play in Teddy's memory. They'll play \n     until the day comes when they can play no more. When that day \n     will be, no one can say. The Seznas know that far too well.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Mr. President, I support the nomination of Ms. Mary Peters \nto be the next Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration. I \nask my colleagues to support her as well. Ms. Peters is a true \ntransportation professional. She served in several senior positions \nwithin the Arizona Department of Transportation, including the position \nof Director of the Department. In that capacity, she was responsible \nnot only for that state's highway system but also for several other \naspects of the State's transportation program.\n  I had the privilege of meeting with Ms. Peters this afternoon and \nfound her to be an extraordinarily pleasant individual, well versed in \nthe issues that will require her attention as Federal Highway \nAdministrator. I specifically had the opportunity to discuss\n\n[[Page S9867]]\n\nwith her the importance of implementing measures that will expedite the \ncompletion of the numerous highway projects for which America's \ntaxpayers have been waiting for a great many years. Ms. Peters \nexplained that she is committed to pursuing efforts to streamline the \nfederal approval process. I look forward to working with her in this \neffort.\n  I again urge my colleagues to support the confirmation of Mary Peters \nto be our next Federal Highway Administrator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate has just confirmed almost 30 \npeople for various positions in the Federal Government, and that number \nwill be more than that counting all the military people. So it is a \ngood day for us.

SHEFFIELD\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today family and friends gathered outside \nDetroit to pay their final respects to Federal Protective Services \nOfficer Ronald C. Sheffield and to remember a life of sacrifice and \nservice to others. Last Friday, September 21, 2001, Officer Sheffield \nwas shot and killed while on duty at the McNamara Federal Building in \ndowntown Detroit. My largest State office is in the McNamara Building \nand many members of my staff were in the building when the shooting \noccurred. His loss will be felt by the entire McNamara Building family \nbut most deeply by those closest to him, particularly his daughters \nJessica Lynn and Jinelle Marie. Officer Sheffield spent his career \nprotecting Americans and defending our great country. He was a sergeant \nin the Marines during combat operations in the Persian Gulf War and a \npolice officer with the Veterans Administration before joining the GSA.\n  The past 2 weeks have made all Americans even more aware of the \ndedication and bravery of the thousands of law enforcement officers, \nfirefighters, military and emergency personnel who risk their lives \nevery day to protect us. Officer Sheffield now joins the ranks of those \nAmerican heros who have made the ultimate sacrifice. My thoughts and \nprayers are with Officer Sheffield's family, friends and fellow \nofficers who are grieving. And my sincere thanks and admiration go out \nto law enforcement officers, firefighters, military and emergency \npersonnel across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9867-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred August 1998 \nin Bridgeport, PA.

Mr. President, I rise today to draw the Senate's \nattention to the continuing political and economic crisis in Zimbabwe.\n  This summer, the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee held a hearing on this crisis. The \noverwhelming consensus of the witnesses at that hearing, witnesses from \nthe administration, from NGOs, and from academia, was that Zimbabwe \nwould continue in a downward spiral, with potentially disastrous \nresults for the entire Southern African region, unless the rule of law \nis sufficiently restored to create conditions for a fair Presidential \nelection next year.\n  I regret that recent events suggest that the Government of Zimbabwe \nis intent on taking the opposite approach. Zimbabwean authorities have \nexpelled representatives of the widely-respected International \nFoundation for Electoral Systems, better known to many in this body as \nIFES. An IFES team had traveled to Zimbabwe to monitor pre-election \nconditions, which are critically important to a free and fair election. \nIf the only information available to voters is state-controlled \npropaganda, if opposition party leaders and supporters are intimidated, \nand if the administrative structure established to prepare for and \ngovern elections is biased, the deck is stacked against democracy \nbefore voting even begins. Without international monitors in place, the \ninternational community cannot adequately assess these important \nissues.\n  In fact, despite recent encouraging reports that the government of \nZimbabwe had agreed to a rule-governed land reform strategy in return \nfor significant assistance from Britain, conditions continue to be grim \nwithin the country. Reports indicate that 900 of 1,150 farms are unable \nto continue normal operations because they are still under occupation, \nand food supplies are inadequate.\n  I strongly support rule-governed land reform in Zimbabwe. It is \nclearly urgently needed and the United States should provide \nsignificant assistance to such an effort. But the most pressing problem \nin Zimbabwe is not about land. It is about the systematic destruction \nof the rule of law; it is about the intimidation of independent \njournalists; it is about executive interference with the judiciary; and \nit is about the abuse of Zimbabweans who support the opposition party \nor have the misfortune of standing between ruling party-financed thugs \nand the objects of their desire. So far no evidence has come to light \nindicating that these fundamental issues have been resolved.\n  As the United States quite rightly devotes itself to fighting \nterrorism, we must not let the horrific attacks of September 11 deter \nus or distract us from our other important foreign policy goals and \ninterests. This country must continue speaking out against oppression \nand in favor of freedom all over the world. Sham elections will not be \nlegitimized by the international community, and President Mugabe's \ngovernment cannot regain credibility\n\n[[Page S9868]]\n\nif international monitors are barred from the country. The United \nStates and the international community must work to keep the pressure \non the government in Harare and to support the forces of democracy in \nZimbabwe. I have joined my colleague, Senator Frist, in sponsoring the \nZimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act for this very purpose. The \nbill has passed the Senate unanimously, and I urge my colleagues in the \nHouse to take it up. In Zimbabwe, where many courageous citizens \ncontinue to struggle to protect their institutions and to save their \ncountry from lawlessness, our honesty and our solidarity is needed now \nmore than ever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9868-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9868-S9870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        REPORT ON FOREIGN TRAVEL: TAIWAN, CHINA, AND SOUTH KOREA\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, from August 4-11, 2001, I joined Senate \nForeign Relations Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, Senator Paul \nSarbanes and Senator Fred Thompson on a congressional delegation to \nTaiwan, mainland China, and South Korea, with a brief stopover in \nHonolulu, Hawaii, and Pearl Harbor Naval Base.\n  During our very brief time in Hawaii, the delegation met with Admiral \nDennis Blair, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Command. In \npreparation for our scheduled meetings with various Asian heads of \nstate, Admiral Blair outlined U.S. preparedness and presence in the \nAsian Pacific region.\n  In Taipei, following an extensive briefing from the American \nInstitute of Taiwan Director Raymond Burghardt on the status of cross-\nStrait relations, the delegation met with Taiwanese President Chen \nShui-bian at the Presidential Palace on Monday, August 6, 2001. \nPresident Chen seemed genuinely pleased that Taiwan was the first stop \non our delegation's multi-country jaunt, and recognized and appreciated \nthe U.S. Congress's longstanding friendship with the Republic of China.\n  The President discussed his efforts as Mayor of Taipei to improve \ncross-Strait relations, and stressed his resolve to continue down this \npath as President. He said he believed that he has made ``good sincere \ngestures'' to the People's Republic of China, but continues to be \ndisappointed in what he sees as rebuffs of his efforts by Beijing. He \ncited Beijing's disregard for Taiwan's plan for tourism by citizens of \nmainland China as an example of this lack of Chinese engagement.\n  I raised the point that many in the U.S. are concerned about several \nissues involving Southeast Asia, such as China's allegedly illegal \nsales of weapons of mass destruction and China's human rights record. \nWhen facing whether to grant permanent normalized trade relations, \nPNTR, with China, I let him know my view that I believed it better to \nleave trade status subject to annual review to retain leverage in U.S.-\nChina talks on proliferation, human rights, and many other items.\n  President Chen countered that in order for all countries' \nrelationships with China to improve, China must become a trustworthy \nmember of the international community and abide by international laws. \nHe believed that PNTR would help this process along, and he would \nsupport the granting of such status by the U.S.\n  President Chen said he believed that the U.S. could play a more \nactive role in the region, but that belief seemed to be tempered by his \nrecognition that it is inappropriate for the U.S. to act as a mediator. \nHe said he will continue to attempt to engage the mainland in cross-\nStrait talks, and that he is not discouraged by the failure of past \nefforts.\n  From Taipei we traveled to Shanghai, China, on Tuesday, August 7, \n2001, for another brief stay, and conducted a working lunch meeting \nwith members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. That \nafternoon, we conducted a large ``roundtable'' discussion with a \nhandful of professors and approximately 100 undergraduate students \nenrolled in the Center for American Studies at Fudan University. It was \nenlightening to learn how young Chinese men and women view the United \nStates and our involvement in the region. The session provided a real \nopportunity to assess how our Southeast Asia policy is perceived among \nChinese citizens in general and among future leaders in particular.\n  Upon arrival in the Chinese capital of Beijing on Wednesday, August \n8, 2001, we immediately proceeded to the seaside town of Beidaihe, \nlocated 3-3.5 hours outside of the city by car. Beidaihe, a resort town \npopular among vacationing working class Chinese, is the site of the \nvery private Chinese leadership retreat compound, where party leaders \nspend much of their summer months. Our delegation was honored to be the \nfirst Westerners invited to attend meetings on the grounds.\n\n  The delegation first met with General Chi Hao-tian, the Chinese \nDefense Minister, and again raised the nonproliferation issue. We \nexpressed our grave concerns about recent intelligence reports \ndescribing the sale or transfer of missile hardware and technology to \nPakistan, despite China's November 2000 pledge to cease assisting other \ncountries develop missile capabilities.\n  General Chi denied the missile sales allegations, saying that China \nalways sticks to its commitments. The General went on to blast the U.S. \nmedia for creating distrust of China, and called the reports of missile \nsales ``totally baseless.'' He also countered with his assertion that \nthe U.S.'s sales of arms to Taiwan violate the ``One China'' \narticulated since the Nixon administration.\n  In our discussions later that afternoon with Chinese President Jiang \nZemin, many of the same hot-button issues such as nonproliferation and \nChina-Taiwan relations were raised. However, our audience with the \nPresident afforded an opportunity to delve more into some human rights \nand religious freedom concerns as well. We were dismayed to hear \nPresident Jiang, unprovoked, refer to the Falungong movement as a \n``cult.'' But overall, the President's tone was positive, and he called \nChina a connected nation with a strong market economy.\n  With regard to arms sales to Pakistan, President Jiang joined General \nChi in a blanket denial of any wrongdoing, saying China did not violate \n``any rule.'' He said that China does maintain arms sales to friendly \nnations, but always within international rules. He further claimed that \nChina had done nothing to contribute to missile development in North \nKorea or Taiwan.\n  I discussed briefly with President Jiang my previous two visits to \nthe People's Republic of China in 1982 and 1994. On PNTR, I conveyed my \nreluctance to support normalized trade status with his country due to \nconcerns about proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Despite \nhis denials of such activities at the commencement of our meeting, I \nagain raised the allegations of illegal weapons sales to Pakistan, \nSaudi Arabia, and Iran, as these were weighty matters on the minds of \nthe international community.\n  Of particular concern to me during my visit to China were questions \nof religious freedom and detention of U.S. citizens by Chinese \nauthorities. I asked President Jiang about the case of Mr. Yongyi Song, \nthe librarian from Dickinson College in Pennsylvania who had been held \nfor five months without formal charges or the benefit of legal counsel. \nThe matter of Mr. Song was only resolved after Congressional \nintervention with the Chinese ambassador to the U.S. and introduction \nof a Senate resolution calling for Mr. Song's release. I told President \nJiang that I was extremely concerned about cases like these, and I \ncalled on China to develop standards of judicial practice and a \nreasonable rule of law that would sustain international scrutiny.\n  President Jiang responded that I had made a good suggestion, and that \nChina had been working for years to establish a rule of law. He went on \nto say that the Chinese constitution guarantees citizens religious \nfreedom, with the exception of Falungong, a group he again \ncharacterized as a cult. The President concluded with a description of \nhis hopes for the future of China in the coming decades, that his \ncountry will have completed the transformation to a market economy, \naccompanied by a strong infrastructure of appropriate judicial and \npolitical systems.\n  On Thursday, August 9, 2001, the delegation traveled to Beijing's \nGreat Hall of the People to meet with Chinese Premier Zhu Rong-ji. The \nPremier was quite generous with his time, and during an hour and a half \nlong meeting, outlined barriers and misperceptions\n\n[[Page S9869]]\n\nwhich can hinder U.S.-China relations. It was made clear that it is in \nboth countries' interests to engage one another economically, but that \ncertain actions on weapons proliferation and stifling of human rights \nwill have consequences in the U.S. This meeting was valuable in laying \nout our countries' priorities and understanding each sides' domestic \n(both public and governmental) pressures which inevitably affect \nbilateral relations.\n\n  I was pleased that Premier Zhu acknowledged that there are some \ndeficiencies in China's human rights and judicial policies, and that he \nsaid that he was willing to work on both. I raised the detention of Mr. \nSong, the Dickinson librarian, a case which brought into sharp focus \nwhat can happen to American citizens detained in China. I pointed out \nto Premier Zhu that cases like these are major irritants to U.S.-China \nrelations. I suggested that he consider an agreement with the U.S. that \nwhen China detains an American citizen or U.S. resident and perhaps \nothers, that those individuals be guaranteed basic points of due \nprocess, such as written documentation of charges, a limitation of time \nin detention, the right to an attorney, and a public legal proceeding \nso the U.S. and the press can review the evidence. I further suggested \nthat the Chinese government should work with programs like the Temple \nUniversity School of Law curriculum on Chinese rule of law recently \nestablished in Beijing since universities can be an excellent, non-\npolitical training ground for judges, attorneys, and other judicial \nofficials.\n  Premier Zhu responded that he was not familiar with the specific case \nof Mr. Song, but that whatever the circumstances surrounding his \ndetention, he was confident that the Chinese could learn from his case. \nI asked Premier Zhu if China would be willing to consider an agreement \nbetween the United States and China dealing with due process rights for \ndetained American citizens and perhaps others. Premier Zhu responded \nthat such an agreement was a ``possibility''.\n  Over a working lunch Thursday afternoon at Ambassador Clark Randt's \nresidence in Beijing, the delegation had a fascinating discussion with \ntwo Chinese experts on weapons proliferation, Dr. Zhu Feng, Director of \nBeijing University's International Security Program; and Dr. Yang Ming-\nJie, Director of Arms Control and Security Studies at the China \nInstitute of Contemporary International Relations, a think tank loosely \naffiliated with China's People's Liberation Army.\n  Dr. Yang articulated some very interesting points about Chinese \npublic opinion on weapons proliferation, that in fact one-third of the \npeople believe that proliferation is a good thing. Interestingly, when \nasked about reports of illegal arms sales to Pakistan and other \ncountries, neither gave the patent denials we had heard all week from \nChinese officials. Instead, they insisted that any shipments must not \nhave been new deals, but vestiges of past contracts.\n  The two experts discussed the fact that the Chinese do not think the \nU.S. is setting a good example by refusing to sign the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty, CTBT, and by continuing to sell arms to Taiwan. They \nwondered why China should be first to disarm when the U.S. does not \nappear to be serious about its own role in international disarmament. \nThis leads to the approach, the deadly cycle of each side reacting to \nwhat we perceive the other to be doing, thus making both countries more \nresolute in our respective positions to not disarm first.\n  On Thursday afternoon, the delegation met with Chinese Foreign \nMinister Tang at the impressive new Ministry of Foreign Affairs \nbuilding. This meeting again focused primarily on weapons issues, and \nMinister Tang's denials of violations of international nonproliferation \nagreements were startlingly similar to those made by General Chi, \nPresident Jiang and Premier Zhu. The Foreign Minister called \naccusations of illegal sales to Pakistan ``totally baseless'' and was \nadamant that China always honors agreements in good faith.\n  With regard to general concerns about democratization, human rights, \nreligious freedom and rule of law, he admitted that deficiencies remain \nbut chose to describe the progress already made, such as shifting the \nculture away from rural agriculture and improving the quality of life \nfor the average Chinese citizen.\n  I asked Minister Tang pointedly about whether he believes that it \nstill made sense for a country to develop intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles, ICBMs, as deterrents to nuclear war. He then reiterated that \nChina is ``firmly opposed'' to the proliferation of ICBMs and that his \ncountry will cooperate in further discussions on the matter. He said \nthat China is therefore opposed to the U.S. development of national \nmissile defense, as it will undermine international disarmament and \nupset the nuclear balance, posing a real threat to China.\n\n  On Saturday, August 11, 2001, our delegation was received at the Blue \nHouse in Seoul, South Korean, to meet with President Kim Dae-jung. We \ncomplimented President Kim on his far-sighted commitment to democracy, \nand for his patient policy of engagement with North Korea. We were \ninterested to learn his views on what the U.S. and the world can do to \nbring North Korean President Kim Jong-il to the bargaining table. \nPresident Kim urged the U.S. to stop calling North Korea a rogue nation \nand the principal cause of our need to develop national missile \ndefense. He believed that such language was not helpful in cultivating \na circumstance in which the North Koreans would enter into a verifiable \nagreement to end its nuclear ballistic missile program.\n  I raised the issue of Jamie Penich of Derry, Pennsylvania, who was \nviolently killed in a motel room in Seoul, South Korea, in March of \nthis year. Jamie, a 21-year old University of Pittsburgh student, had \nstopped in Seoul on her way to study at Keimyung University in Taegu, \nSouth Korea, and was found stomped to death in her motel room by her \nfriend. There was no evidence of a sexual assault and nothing was \nstolen from the room.\n  I explained the circumstances of the case to President Kim, as well \nas my understanding that the Korean police have sole jurisdiction over \nthe case, but that the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, CID, \nand the FBI are assisting in the investigation. There have been no \nleads in the case thus far. I asked President Kim if he would check on \nthe progress of the investigation. Although he was not familiar with \nthe case, he agreed to inquire about its status and to work with the \nKorean police force and American embassy staff on facilitating its \nswift resolution.\n  I also talked to President Kim about Boeing's bid to sell F-15 \nfighter aircraft to South Korea. The Republic of Korea Air Force aims \nto replace its aging fleet of F-4D/Es and F-5s, and Boeing is among \nfour competitors to provide the $4 billion contract for the new \naircrafts. The F-15s cultivated an outstanding win record during the \nGulf War, while the competing French aircraft have never been battle \ntested. President Kim seemed familiar with the Boeing plane's exemplary \nrecord in the Gulf War. I also stressed to President Kim that the \nU.S.'s substantial contributions to South Korea should merit special \nconsideration in awarding this contract to U.S. company. The French, \nthe competitor for the contract, have contributed much less.\n  For the remainder of Saturday afternoon prior to our late evening \ndeparture from Osan Air Force Base, the delegation was escorted to the \nJoint Security Area by Lieutenant General Daniel Zanini, Commanding \nGeneral, Eighth U.S. Army, and Chief of Staff for the United Nations \nCommand, Combined Forces Command, and U.S. Forces Korea. Upon arrival \nat Camp Bonifas at the base of the JSA, Lieutenant Colonel William \nMiller, Commander of the U.N. Command Security Battalion-JSA. gave the \ndelegation a tour of the demilitarized zone and outlined the status of \ntensions at the border of North and North Korea. The group then \nproceeded down to Camp Casey and received a tour of the soldiers' \nbarracks, which are in exceedingly poor shape. General Zanini also \ndescribed the need for additional vehicle maintenance facilities and \nfor generally improved living conditions for the 375,00 U.S. troops who \nhelp ensure peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. It was obvious \nthat the living conditions were substandard and require considerable \nimprovement.\n\n[[Page S9870]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9868-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9868-S9870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        REPORT ON FOREIGN TRAVEL: TAIWAN, CHINA, AND SOUTH KOREA\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

He said \nthat China is therefore opposed to the U.S. development of national \nmissile defense, as it will undermine international disarmament and \nupset the nuclear balance, posing a real threat to China.\n\n  On Saturday, August 11, 2001, our delegation was received at the Blue \nHouse in Seoul, South Korean, to meet with President Kim Dae-jung. We \ncomplimented President Kim on his far-sighted commitment to democracy, \nand for his patient policy of engagement with North Korea. We were \ninterested to learn his views on what the U.S. and the world can do to \nbring North Korean President Kim Jong-il to the bargaining table. \nPresident Kim urged the U.S. to stop calling North Korea a rogue nation \nand the principal cause of our need to develop national missile \ndefense. He believed that such language was not helpful in cultivating \na circumstance in which the North Koreans would enter into a verifiable \nagreement to end its nuclear ballistic missile program.\n  I raised the issue of Jamie Penich of Derry, Pennsylvania, who was \nviolently killed in a motel room in Seoul, South Korea, in March of \nthis year. Jamie, a 21-year old University of Pittsburgh student, had \nstopped in Seoul on her way to study at Keimyung University in Taegu, \nSouth Korea, and was found stomped to death in her motel room by her \nfriend. There was no evidence of a sexual assault and nothing was \nstolen from the room.\n  I explained the circumstances of the case to President Kim, as well \nas my understanding that the Korean police have sole jurisdiction over \nthe case, but that the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, CID, \nand the FBI are assisting in the investigation. There have been no \nleads in the case thus far. I asked President Kim if he would check on \nthe progress of the investigation. Although he was not familiar with \nthe case, he agreed to inquire about its status and to work with the \nKorean police force and American embassy staff on facilitating its \nswift resolution.\n  I also talked to President Kim about Boeing's bid to sell F-15 \nfighter aircraft to South Korea. The Republic of Korea Air Force aims \nto replace its aging fleet of F-4D/Es and F-5s, and Boeing is among \nfour competitors to provide the $4 billion contract for the new \naircrafts. The F-15s cultivated an outstanding win record during the \nGulf War, while the competing French aircraft have never been battle \ntested. President Kim seemed familiar with the Boeing plane's exemplary \nrecord in the Gulf War. I also stressed to President Kim that the \nU.S.'s substantial contributions to South Korea should merit special \nconsideration in awarding this contract to U.S. company. The French, \nthe competitor for the contract, have contributed much less.\n  For the remainder of Saturday afternoon prior to our late evening \ndeparture from Osan Air Force Base, the delegation was escorted to the \nJoint Security Area by Lieutenant General Daniel Zanini, Commanding \nGeneral, Eighth U.S. Army, and Chief of Staff for the United Nations \nCommand, Combined Forces Command, and U.S. Forces Korea. Upon arrival \nat Camp Bonifas at the base of the JSA, Lieutenant Colonel William \nMiller, Commander of the U.N. Command Security Battalion-JSA. gave the \ndelegation a tour of the demilitarized zone and outlined the status of \ntensions at the border of North and North Korea. The group then \nproceeded down to Camp Casey and received a tour of the soldiers' \nbarracks, which are in exceedingly poor shape. General Zanini also \ndescribed the need for additional vehicle maintenance facilities and \nfor generally improved living conditions for the 375,00 U.S. troops who \nhelp ensure peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. It was obvious \nthat the living conditions were substandard and require considerable \nimprovement.\n\n[[Page S9870]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9870-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             THE 350th ANNIVERSARY OF NEW CASTLE, DELAWARE\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we in Delaware, the first State to \nratify the Constitution, take great pride in our history, and a special \npart of that history is represented by the City of New Castle, which is \ncelebrating its 350th anniversary this year.\n  New Castle was founded by the Dutch in 1651 as Fort Casimir. Because \nof its strategic location on what is now the Delaware River, the \nsettlement was sought and held by a series of colonial powers, the \nDutch, the Swedes and, finally, the British.\n  When William Penn was given authority over the so-called ``lower \nthree counties,'' which became the State of Delaware, he traveled to \nNew Castle to take possession. When the counties were granted an \nindependent legislature, New Castle became the colonial capital, and \nbriefly, the first State capital, of Delaware.\n  Despite a devastating fire in 1824, which destroyed many of the \nstructures on the historic, river-front street called The Strand, and \nall the changes and pressures of the intervening years, New Castle's \ncolonial history is still a defining and very visible part of the \ntown's life and character.\n  Several of its remaining colonial era buildings have been converted \ninto museums, including the Dutch House, which dates to the 17th \nCentury, and the Old Court House, which was built in 1732 and was the \nmeeting place for the colonial and State assemblies from that year \nuntil 1777. George Read was one of three signers of the Declaration of \nIndependence who lived in New Castle; although his house was destroyed \nby the Great Fire, the current Read House, which was built by his son \nin 1801, is one of the most striking attractions of the town.\n  But New Castle itself is not a museum. It is a residential town, it \nis a vibrant community. New Castle is home to two churches that date \nback to the earliest part of the 18th Century, and they have active \ncongregations today. Families live in the homes that were built so long \nago, families who add their own mark to those of previous owners, with \na sensitivity and obligation to preserve the unique character of the \ntown, New Castle is, not surprisingly, a National Landmark Historic \nArea.\n  With its history as a colonial seat for the legislature and the \ncourts, New Castle has a tradition of political activity and public \nleadership, and many of its citizens have played prominent roles \nthroughout the history of Delaware and our nation.\n  In addition, as a personal point, although I know it is a perspective \nshared by many Delawareans, New Castle is one of my favorite places in \nour State. It is more than historic and scenic; it is, simply, \nbeautiful, a place where the past and present meet with remarkable \nharmony and spirit. It is inspiring.\n  I share the pride of Delaware with the Senate, and with the Nation, \ntoday, in marking the 350th anniversary of the founding of New Castle, \nand I am proud to extend congratulations and best wishes to the mayor, \ncity council, trustees and all the citizens and friends of the town, \nwhich is a valued and unique treasure to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9870-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO LARRY WADE MORRIS\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. \nLarry Wade Morris from Alexander City, AL who assumed the presidency of \nthe Alabama State Bar this past July. Larry has worked hard throughout \nhis extensive career to gain a reputation as one of the premier trial \nlawyers in the Nation. He has also endeavored to become a civic leader \nand an outstanding public servant. I want to congratulate Larry on his \ntremendous accomplishments and to recognize his progression from \npromising young lawyer out of the University of Alabama in 1968 to the \ndistinguished President of the Alabama State Bar in 2001.\n  If you looked up the definition of a true Alabamian in the \ndictionary, you would not find a better description than Larry Morris. \nHis character and work ethic are beyond reproach, and the Southern \nvalues instilled in him in from his youth continue to guide him today. \nBorn in Alexander City, AL, Larry grew up attending public school in \nMontgomery. He graduated from Robert E. Lee High School and finished \nhis undergraduate education at Auburn University. At that point, Larry \nmade the decision to attend law school at the University of Alabama and \njoin the long list of prominent Alabamians who have attended this \nrespected legal institution. He received his law degree from the \nUniversity in 1968, and had the distinction of serving as the president \nof the Student Bar Association. After graduation, Larry returned to his \nhometown of Alexander City to begin his impressive career in the legal \nprofession. Larry is now the Senior Partner in the firm of Morris, \nHaynes & Hornsby.\n  Larry has demonstrated exceptional leadership abilities throughout \nhis scholastic and professional careers. His service as president of \nthe Student Bar Association was very highly regarded and helped to hone \nthe skills that he has demonstrated during his professional and \npolitical life. In 1973, he served as the president of the Young \nLawyer's Section of the Alabama State Bar. He is a past president of \nthe Chamber of Commerce for Alexander City, has served on the Task \nForce for Judicial Elections for the Alabama State Bar and is also a \npast president of the Alabama Trial Lawyers Association. From 1974 \nthrough 1978, he was elected to serve in the Alabama State Legislature. \nDuring this time, he had the distinction of being named Outstanding \nFreshman Legislator by the Alabama Press Association.\n  Larry Morris is a loyal, dedicated man who has always been very \ngenerous with his time and support for community affairs. In addition \nto his duties as president of the Alabama State Bar Association, Larry \nis also a member of the University of Alabama Law School Foundation and \nthe Leadership Committee for the College of Arts and Sciences at the \nUniversity of Alabama. He is a member of the American Board of Trial \nAdvocates, and serves on the Task Force for Multidisciplinary Practice \nfor the Alabama State Bar.\n  The many accomplishments and accolades of Larry Morris attest to his \ndedication to civic leadership and his deep belief in the law. I could \nnot think of a better individual to represent the state of Alabama as \nthe president of the State Bar Association. I join Larry's wife, \nBeverly, and their four children, Mark, Clark, Brian and Kevin Russell, \nin honoring his achievements. I know that they are proud of Larry, as \nare the many of us who have known him over the years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9870-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9870-S9871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE BEACH BOYS\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, The Beach Boys' sunny vocal \nharmonies are one of the signature sounds of the modern era. Over four \ndecades, the California quintet has become one of the most successful \nAmerican bands in the history of rock and roll and their songs remain \nan important part of America's cultural landscape.\n  The Beach Boys were largely a family affair that came together in the \nLos Angeles suburb of Hawthorne, CA, in 1961. The three brothers, \nBrian, Carl and Dennis Wilson, formed the group with their cousin, Mike \nLove, and a friend, Alan Jardine They were joined by another of their \nfriends, Bruce Johnston, in 1965.\n  Brian Wilson and Mike Love cowrote the majority of the band's many \nhit singles which were known for their harmonic invention and complex \nvocal and instrumental arrangements. The lyrics are celebrated today \nfor their deft use of technical lingo balanced with youthful naivete.\n  The Beach Boys have ridden a wave of success for almost 40 years. \nThey have recorded number one singles, garnered a huge fan base, and, \nby creating a sound that was uniquely their own, secured their position \nin Americana. They have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of \nFame and have been honored with the National Association of Recording \nArts and Sciences Lifetime Achievement award which they received at \nthis year's Grammy awards.\n  As we approach the 40th Anniversary of both the release of their \nfirst single and their first tour, I would like to recognize the \ncontribution that these men have made, not only to the landscape\n\n[[Page S9871]]\n\nof American music, but to the lives of their fans and fellow Americans. \nI have always been a fan of The Beach Boys' music, but I came to \nrecognize their devotion to other causes when I met Mike Love through \nour mutual work with veterans. He told me that the group as a whole and \nthe members individually have supported important causes throughout \ntheir years together. I learned about the Carl Wilson Foundation, which \nraises millions of dollars each year for cancer patients and research, \nand I discovered that the group has always been involved in fund-\nraising performances that benefit a variety of groups. Bruce Johnston \nis dedicated to environmental causes and has been a member of the Board \nof Directors of the Surfrider Foundation since it inception in the mid-\n1980's.\n  Mike Love has been a longtime supporter of environmental causes and \nwas among speakers at the Earth Summit in Rio DeJaniero in 1992 and \nEarth Day 2000 on the Mall in Washington, DC. Mike created the Love \nFoundation, which supports national environmental and educational \ninitiatives. He is a member of the Board of Directors of the Incline \nAcademy in Incline Village, Nevada, and has been responsible for \nraising over $1 million to benefit the school.\n  While the Beach Boys are known and loved for their musical \naccomplishments, the men and women whose lives the group has touched \nare perhaps The Beach Boys' greatest legacy. As Winston Churchill said, \n``What is the use of living if it be not to strive for noble causes and \nto make this muddled world a better place for those who will have it \nafter we are gone?''\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the accomplishments \nof The Beach Boys and wishing them continued success in their future \nmusical and personal journeys.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9871-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING JOHN O. QUINN\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr President, I bring to the attention of the \nSenate the accomplishments of one of my constituents who recently \nsuffered a most tragic and untimely death. John O. Quinn, born on \nOctober 27, 1968 and originally from New Jersey, was senselessly \nmurdered on August 25, 2001 while living in Puerto Cortes, Honduras.\n  John had moved to Honduras in November of 1999 to help the residents \nof Puerto Cortes, Honduras recover from the devastation that Hurricane \nMitch wreaked on the country. Up to the time of his death he was still \nliving in the country and providing humanitarian and development aid to \nthe people of Honduras.\n  Now an act of violence has cut short this promising young life. While \nwe hope his killers will quickly be brought to justice, I want today to \npay tribute to what John did in the brief years of his life.\n  John O. Quinn was a truly special person. He possessed a quality that \nvery few people exhibit. He took joy in helping others. His \nunselfishness and passion for helping the less fortunate will always be \nremembered and will never be forgotten by those to whom he so \ngenerously dedicated his time.\n  John was committed to helping people all over the world. His desire \nto help impoverished people took him to Honduras, Guatemala, Mozambique \nand Ecuador. In all of these countries he vigorously sought out people \nwho were in desperate need of the development and humanitarian aid that \nhe enthusiastically provided.\n  John was the cofounder and executive director of the organization \nAction for Community Transformation, ACT. He founded ACT in January \n2000 as an international development organization dedicated to \nempowering people in need to find their own sustainable solutions to \nproblems of poor health, lack of education and poverty. Action for \nCommunity Transformation provides assistance in four major areas of \ndevelopment: healthcare; youth development; education and vocational \ntraining; and income generation.\n  As executive director of ACT, John's work was guided by the belief \nthat respect for people comes first, urgent situations call for rapid \nresponses, and greater participation leads to greater commitment. This \nlast principle is the very definition of John's lifework. When John \nparticipated in development and aid projects, he did so with all his \nheart. He committed himself to helping others. The focus of his life \nwas the people and communities that he felt it was his responsibility \nto serve. The help that John provided to victims of Hurricane Mitch in \nPuerto Cortes, Honduras illustrates John's dedication to and enthusiasm \nfor helping people who desperately needed help.\n  While working in Puerto Cortes, Honduras, John developed a micro \nlending program which allowed 45 families who lost everything during \nHurricane Mitch to start micro enterprises. He was also responsible for \nthe design and installation of a potable water system in Puerto Cortes, \nHonduras. He helped build a school and kindergarten that is attended by \nninety-one students and he contributed to the construction of a medical \nclinic and over eighty houses for locals whose homes were destroyed by \nHurricane Mitch. Characteristically, when John had time off from his \nactivities associated with ACT, he spent it instructing the residents \nof the area in the English language. He was always looking for new \npeople that he could help.\n  Felicita Carcamo, a teacher in Puerto Cortes, Honduras \nenthusiastically praised John in the local newspaper. She said that \nQuinn loved the poor and was dedicated to the people of the area. A man \nwho will be remembered in such a fashion must have been a truly \nwonderful person. John was this kind of a person.\n  John's desire to help the poor and less fortunate began well before \nhe came to the aid of the victims of Hurricane Mitch in Honduras and \nGuatemala. After graduating from the University of Vermont in 1991 he \nimmediately joined the Peace Corps. As a member of the Peace Corps, \nJohn was stationed in Macas, Ecuador for three years. While there he \nworked to develop community health programs; community development \nprograms; and livestock and agroforestry programs.\n  In a procession honoring John's life, residents of Puerto Cortes, \nHonduras carried signs that read ``John Quinn, the community cries now \nthat you have left us, and you will always live with us'' and ``for \nyour dedication to others, God has thanked you.''\n  In memory of his death, John's family has established the John Quinn \nMemorial Scholarship Fund that goes towards paying for the education of \nchildren living in Honduras.\n  The help that John provided to the people of Honduras, Guatemala, \nMozambique and Ecuador and his desire to help those who could not help \nthemselves, must never be forgotten. Even though his life has been \ntragically cut short, he accomplished much in his lifetime and touched \nmany lives. His family can be justly proud of John, even as they mourn \nhis loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9871-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9871-S9872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ACADEMY OF THE SACRED \n                                 HEART\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this month people in my \nhome state of Michigan gathered to celebrate the 150th birthday of the \nAcademy of the Sacred Heart an institution that, even though it was \nfounded for the ``sake of one child,'' has been providing excellence in \neducation to countless individuals. This celebration culminated on \nSunday, September 16, 2001, when His Eminence Adam Cardinal Maida, \nArchbishop of Detroit conducted a celebratory liturgy for this the \noldest independent school in the State of Michigan.\n  This year marks the third centenary anniversary of Detroit, MI. In \nthat time, many changes have dramatically altered the city as it \nevolved from a small trading outpost into an international center of \ncommerce and industry. Through all these changes, one thing has \nremained constant for the past century and a half: the Society of the \nSacred Heart's commitment to educating the youth of metro Detroit. \nDuring this time, the Academy of the Sacred Heart has been an \ninstitution dedicated to the education of mind, body and spirit. This \nfocus on educating the whole person has enabled the Academy to develop \nstudents that embody the hallmarks of a Catholic education: \nintellectual rigor combined with service to God and others.\n  The Academy began in 1821 when the co-founder of the University of \nMichigan, Father Gabriel Richard asked the Society of the Sacred Heart \nto establish a foundation in Detroit. In 1849,\n\n[[Page S9872]]\n\nthe Society was given the land necessary to establish a school, and the \ndoors to the first school opened on Jefferson Avenue, between St. \nAntoine and Beaubien Streets, in 1861.\n  In its first 20 years, this institution--dedicated to the pursuit of \n``faith seeking understanding'' and the service of others--underwent a \ntenfold increase in enrollment. Detroit's economic growth paralleled \nthe school's increasing enrollment, and the school found itself \nsurrounded by factories and warehouses. The changing demographic led \nthe school to sell its building, in 1918, to the Packard Motor Co. The \nschool relocated to the corner of Lawrence and Woodrow Wilson Avenues. \nFurther development and the establishment of the Lodge Freeway \nseparated this new facility from the neighborhoods it served and \nenrollment dropped. This led the school to seek yet another new campus.\n  The third incarnation of the Academy of the Sacred Heart led it to \nits present location in Bloomfield Hills, MI. Today, the Academy \ncontinues to build on its tradition of faith and dedication to service. \nAttendance has blossomed at the school with nearly 500 students, of \nmany faiths and cultural backgrounds, from all across the Detroit area. \nIn addition to receiving quality academic instruction, students at the \nAcademy learn by performing community service through various \norganizations in Detroit.\n  The entire Academy of the Sacred Heart community--the Society of the \nSacred Heart, the faculty, alumni and current students--can take pride \nin the school's long and honorable service to the people of Michigan. I \nhope my Senate colleagues will join me in saluting the Academy of the \nSacred Heart for a century and a half of achievement and in wishing \nthem well on the next century and a half of continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9872-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n               enrolled bill and joint resolution signed\n\n  At 9:30 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill and joint resolution:\n\n       S. 248.

A bill to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development \nAct to provide grants for special environmental assistance for the \nregulation of communities and habitat (``SEARCH grants'') to small \ncommunities; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nauthorize a national environmental grants program called Project \nSEARCH. Project SEARCH is a simplified, flexible program that targets \nsmall communities most in need of assistance in meeting environmental \ngoals.\n  I am particularly excited about the proposal. I have heard from \npartners interested in helping with the legislation and from colleagues \nwho recognize the unique challenges small communities face achieving \nenvironmental goals. Because of our mutual interest in helping small \ncommunities respond to environmental problems, I invite my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this measure.\n  The national Project SEARCH, Special Environmental Assistance for the \nRegulation of Communities and Habitat, concept is based on a pilot \nprogram that operated with great success in Idaho in 1999 and 2000. In \nshort, the bill establishes a simplified application process for \ncommunities with populations under 2,500 to receive assistance grants \nfor meeting a broad array of Federal, State, or local environmental \nregulations. Grants would be available for initial feasibility studies, \nto address unanticipated costs arising during the course of a project, \nor when a community demonstrates that other sources of funding are \nunavailable or insufficient.\n  Some of the major highlights of the program are: a simplified \napplication process--no special grants coordinators required; \ncommunities must first have attempted to receive funds from traditional \nsources; it is open to studies or projects involving any environmental \nregulation; applications are reviewed and approved by citizens panel of \nvolunteers; the panel chooses the number of recipients and size of \ngrants; the panel consists of volunteers representing all regions of \nthe state; and no local match is required to receive the SEARCH funds.\n  Over the past several years, it has become increasingly apparent that \nsmall communities are having problems complying with environmental \nrules and regulations due primarily to lack of funding, not a \nwillingness to do so. They, like all of us, want clean water and air \nand a healthy natural environment. Sometimes, they simply cannot \nshoulder the financial burden with their limited resources.\n  In addition, small communities wishing to pursue unique collaborative \nefforts might be discouraged by grant administrators who prefer \nconformity. Some run into unexpected costs during a project and have \nborrowed and bonded to the maximum. Others are in critical habitat \nlocations and any project may have additional costs, which may not be \nrecognized by traditional financial sources. Still others just need \nhelp for the initial environmental feasibility study so they can \nidentify the most effective path forward.\n  With these needs in mind, in 1998, I was able to secure $1.3 million \nfor a grant program for Idaho's small communities. Idaho's program does \nnot replace other funding sources, but serves as a final resort when \nall other means have been exhausted.\n  The application process was simplified so that any small town mayor, \ncounty commissioner, sewer district chairman, or community leader could \nmanage it without hiring a professional grant writer. An independent \ncitizens committee with statewide representation was established to \nmake the selections and get the funds on the ground as quickly as \npossible. No bureaucratic or political intrusions were permitted.\n  Forty-four communities in Idaho ultimately applied, not including two \nthat failed to meet the eligibility requirements. Ultimately, twenty-\none communities were awarded grants in several categories, and ranged \nin size from $9,000 to $319,000. Communities serving Native Americans \nand migrants, as well as several innovative collaborative efforts were \nincluded in the successful applicants. The communities that were not \nselected are being given assistance in exploring other funding sources \nand other advice.\n  The response and feedback from all participants has been \noverwhelmingly positive. Officials from the state and federal \ngovernment who witnessed the process have stated that the process \nworked well and was able to accomplish much on a volunteer basis. There \nwas even extraordinary appreciation from other funding agencies because \nsome communities they were not able to reach were provided funds for \nfeasibility studies.\n  The conclusion of all participants was that Project SEARCH is a \nprogram worthy of being expanded nationally. So many small communities \nin so many states can benefit from a program that assists underserved \nand often overlooked communities. This legislation provides us the \nopportunity to help small communities throughout the United States.\n  I have been encouraged by statements from regulatory officials at the \nFederal, State, and local level that have identified small communities \nas particularly in need of assistance in this area. Environmental \norganizations have also made favorable remarks about the importance of \nassisting small communities with the compliance costs of environmental \nregulations. Finally, I should also note that organizations \nrepresenting small towns and rural areas recognize this long overlooked \nproblem.\n  I invite my colleagues to take this opportunity to assist small \ncommunities in each of their States. Although the grant program \nprovided for in this bill is not large in comparison to other things \nthe Federal Government funds, these resources could be put to good and \neffective use, as Idaho has proven. Moreover, I will remind everyone \nthat nowhere does this measure contemplate a change in environmental \nregulations or standards. This is simply about relief for small \ncommunities that would not otherwise be able to serve the public \ninterest or the environment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Akaka, \n        Mr. Feingold, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 1467. A bill to amend the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of \n2000 to extend the deadlines for application and payment of fees; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Bruce Vento \nHmong Veterans' Naturalization Extension Act. The Act is named after my \nlate colleague and dear friend, Congressman Bruce Vento. Congressman \nVento dedicated much of his career to working with the Hmong community\n\n[[Page S9877]]\n\nin Minnesota. He worked for a decade to ensure the passage of the Hmong \nVeterans Naturalization Act. This bill would make it possible for all \neligible Hmong veterans and their wives to receive the benefits they \nare due under this Act by extending the application deadline from \nNovember 26, 2001 to May 26, 2003.\n  With less than 3 months remaining before the deadline passes for most \nof those covered under the Act, only 25 percent of all eligible \napplicants have filed for citizenship. Advocates for the Hmong believe \nit will be impossible for all those eligible to file by the deadline. \nThe Hmong community has faced many challenges in getting veterans and \ntheir wives filed. The Department of Justice did not release its \nguidelines for 2\\1/2\\ months and many INS regional offices were \nunfamiliar with the guidelines for a period of time after that, \nresulting in eligible Hmong applicants being turned away. The language \nbarrier that created the need for the Hmong Veteran Naturalization Act \nin the first place has meant that many Hmong needed assistance from \nHmong community advocates to understand the citizenship process and to \nfill out the citizenship application. These advocacy organizations are \nvastly under-resourced and are overwhelmed by the demand for help from \nHmong applicants.\n  I want to make it clear. This bill would not increase the number of \neligible applicants. It in no way would change the other requirements \nof the law. It simply would provide a necessary extension for existing \neligible applicants.\n  As the Senator from Minnesota, I am proud to represent one of the \nlargest Hmong populations in America. My experience as a Senator has \nbecome much richer as a result of coming to know the history and \nculture of the Hmong people in Minnesota. I deeply respect their \nextraordinary efforts in support of the American people. I urge my \ncolleagues' strong support of this legislation. The original Act was \npassed because of Hmong veterans' tremendous sacrifice on behalf of the \nUnited States during the Vietnam War and because of the unique literacy \nchallenges the Hmong community faces. It would be wrong to deny the \nbenefits of the Act to eligible veterans for reasons that are beyond \ntheir control. Let us fulfill the intent of the Act we passed last year \nand ensure that these veterans and their families receive the benefits \nthey are due.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S. 1468.

A bill to amend the Head Start and Early Head Start programs \nto ensure that children eligible to participate in those programs are \nidentified and treated for lead poisoning, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague, \nSenator Torricelli of New Jersey, to introduce two pieces of \nlegislation we believe are absolutely critical to our ongoing effort to \ncombat childhood lead poisoning. These two bills, the Early Childhood \nLead Poisoning Prevention Act and the Children's Lead SAFE Act, are \nintended to improve our ability to detect and treat children at high \nrisk of lead poisoning, as well as expand our network of Federal \nprogram sites where children at increased risk of lead poisoning can be \nscreened.\n  The Early Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Act requires WIC and \nHead Start/Early Head Start programs with children under age 3 to \nassess whether a child participant has been screened for lead, and \nprovide and track referrals for any child who has not been \nappropriately screened. The bill also calls upon WIC and Head Start/\nEarly Head Start grantees to ensure that all enrolled children are \nscreened for lead poisoning and grants these entities the authority to \nperform or arrange blood lead screening for program participants. \nLastly, the bill allows WIC clinics and Head Start/Early Head Start \ngrantees to seek reimbursement through Medicaid or the State Children's \nHeath Insurance Program, CHIP, for eligible children who have received \na lead screening test in accordance with CDC recommendations or \nMedicaid policy.\n  The Children's Lead Screening Accountability for Early Intervention \nAct, or the Children's Lead SAFE Act, would require Medicaid \ncontractors to comply with existing requirements to provide screening, \ntreatment and any necessary follow-up services for Medicaid-eligible \nchildren who test positive for lead poisoning. To be clear, this is not \nimposing any new mandate on State Medicaid contractors. It is simply \ntrying to make current law more effective by explicitly requiring \nhealth care providers to comply with Federal lead screening \nrequirements that have been in existence since 1992.\n  This new, stronger mandate has become necessary because 82 percent of \nchildren ages one through five have never been screened for lead \npoisoning, even though they were receiving health care benefits or \nservices through Medicaid, WIC, or the Health Centers program, \naccording to a recent report from the General Accounting Office, GAO, \ndespite long standing Federal requirements. This means that of the \nestimated 890,000 children in the U.S. with elevated blood lead levels, \nover 400,000 have never been identified or treated. Even more \ndisconcerting is that 50 percent of our States do not have screening \npolicies that are consistent with Federal requirements.\n  The reason why our two bills specifically focus on specific Federal \nprograms stems from the GAO report, which indicated that 77 percent of \nU.S. children with high levels of lead in their blood are enrolled in \nFederal programs, highlighting the viral role of these programs in \nhelping to eliminate the preventable tragedy of childhood lead \npoisoning. Better involvement by Federal programs in promoting \nscreening and treatment is also critical to reducing the significant \nhealth care and special education costs associated with the \nirreversible effects of lead poisoning, which include the impairment of \nmental and physical development.\n  We need to find the will and the resources to eradicate lead hazards \nfor millions of at-risk children. We also need to make more Americans \naware of the dangers of lead poisoning. I am committed to addressing \nthis crisis, and I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting these \nbills and other lead poisoning prevention efforts.\n  I ask consent that the text of the Early Childhood Lead Poisoning \nPrevention Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1469\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a demonstration program for school \ndropout prevention; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nDropout Reduction Outreach Program Act of 2001 known as DROP. I have \nbeen deeply concerned about the high number of students dropping out of \nschool in Oregon and around the country. We all know that for children \nat risk, having a relationship with a caring adult in school is often \nthe only reason students choose to stay in school. But many of our \nschools, facing tight budgets, have had to cut guidance counselors, the \nvery people whose top priority is helping our kids manage the difficult \nterrain of middle and high school academies and social life.\n  This bill will provide funds to demonstrate what we know by instinct: \nthat these guidance counselors can make a significant difference in \nreducing our dropout rates. Funding will help districts with \nparticularly high dropout rates hire more counselors, and train \nteachers and administrators in the most effective methods for working \nwith at-risk students.\n\n[[Page S9879]]\n\n  We have spent many hours in this chamber this year debating the way \nahead for education in this country. We discussed and provided funding \nfor many programs that should allow every child in this country the \nopportunity to receive a high quality education. And yet, recent \nnumbers from my State project that nearly one in five children in \nOregon will drop out of school before graduation.\n  If you think this statistic is sobering, consider that the dropout \nrate for minority students is higher still. Dropout rates among \nHispanic, Native American, and African American children in Oregon are \nall in double digits for each year of high school.\n  We know some of the warning signs for dropping out: getting behind in \ncoursework, working more than 15 hours each week, dysfunctional home \nlife, substance abuse, pregnancy, and lack of parental support for \neducation, but spotting these indicators and keeping students in school \nare not the same.\n  With the economy increasingly dependent on highly trained technical \nworkers, a high school diploma is now a minimum credential for success \nin American society. Keeping students in school is one way we can help \nAmerica's young people achieve success in their lives, while \nmaintaining our status as a world leader.\n  The DROP Act will establish a multi-state demonstration program that \nwill fund school counselor positions in middle and high schools with \nhigh dropout rates. it will also offer specialized training to guidance \ncounselors and teachers who work with ``at risk'' students. The effects \nof these demonstration projects will be carefully monitored, and \nevaluations reported back to the Secretary of Education, who will then \nshare them with Congress, states, and educators who wish to address \nthis problem.\n  While the DROP Act requires only a small financial commitment, it has \nthe potential to have far-reaching implications as our society gears up \nto lead the world into the 21st century. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation as a way to help all our nation's children \nachieve their highest potential.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Carnahan, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1471. A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security \nAct to ensure that Children enrolled in the Medicaid and State \nchildren's health insurance program are identified and treated for lead \npoisoning; to the committee on Finance.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague, \nSenator Reed of Rhode Island, to introduce the Children's Lead \nScreening Accountability for Early-Intervention Act of 2001 and the \nEarly Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Act of 2001.\n  Lead poisoning is one of the dangerous environmental health hazards \nfor young children. It is estimated that 890,000 children nationally \nsuffer from elevated blood lead levels. Lead poisoning causes damage to \nthe brain and nervous system, loss in IQ, impaired physical development \nand behavioral problems. High levels of exposure to lead can result in \ncomas, convulsions and death. Poor and minority children are most at-\nrisk of lead poisoning because of inadequate diets and exposure to \nenvironmental hazards such as old housing.\n  In an effort to alleviate this problem, in 1992, Congress instructed \nthe Health Care Financing Administration to require States to lead \nscreen Medicaid children under the age of two. The screening would have \nenabled the highest-risk children to be tested and treated before lead \npoisoning impaired their development. Despite the Federal law, however, \na study from the General Accounting Office indicates that currently \ntwo-thirds of all Medicaid children remain unscreened and that only \nhalf the States have screening policies consistent with the law. In New \nJersey, only 30% of children covered by Medicaid are tested.\n  The Children's Lead Screening Accountability for Early-Intervention \nAct or Children's Lead SAFE Act will create a lead screening safety net \nthat will, though the Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance, \nSCHIP, programs, ensure that children enrolled in these programs \nreceive blood lead screenings and appropriate follow-up care. \nSpecifically, this legislation will require state Medicaid contracts to \nexplicitly require health management organizations to comply with \nfederal rules related to lead screening and treatment. The bill will \nexpand Medicaid coverage to include lead treatment services and \nenvironmental investigations to determine the source of the poisoning.\n  The Early Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Act of 2001 requires \nthe Head Start, Early Head Start and Women, Infants and Children, WIC, \nprograms to determine if enrolled children under age three have \nreceived a blood lead screening test appropriate for their age and risk \nfactors. This legislation also requires that these programs provide and \ntrack referrals for any child who has not been screened for lead \npoisoning. Importantly, this legislation authorizes WIC, Head Start and \nEarly Head Start programs to seek reimbursement through Medicaid or the \nSCHIP program for eligible children who have received a lead screening \ntest.\n  The health and safety of our children would be greatly enhanced with \nthe passage of these important measures. Childhood lead poisoning is \neasily preventable and I hope my colleagues will join us in support of \nthis legislation.\n  At this time, I ask that the text of the Children's Lead Screening \nAccountability for Early-Intervention Act of 2001 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1471\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) lead poisoning remains a serious environmental risk, \n     especially to the health of young children;\n       (2) childhood lead poisoning can cause reductions in IQ, \n     attention span, reading, and learning disabilities, and other \n     growth and behavior problems;\n       (3) children under the age of 6 are at the greatest risk of \n     suffering the effects of lead poisoning because of the \n     sensitivity of their developing brains and nervous systems, \n     while children under the age of 3 are especially at risk due \n     to their stage of development and hand-to-mouth activities;\n       (4) poor children and minority children are at \n     substantially higher risk of lead poisoning;\n       (5) three-fourths of all children ages 1 through 5 found to \n     have an elevated blood lead level in a Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention nationally representative sample were \n     enrolled in or targeted by Federal health care programs, \n     specifically the medicaid program, the special supplemental \n     nutrition program for women, infants, and children (WIC), and \n     the community health centers programs under section 330 of \n     the Public Health Service Act, equating to an estimated \n     688,000 children nationwide;\n       (6) the General Accounting Office estimates that \\2/3\\ of \n     the 688,000 children who have elevated blood lead levels and \n     are enrolled in or targeted by Federal health care programs \n     have never been screened for lead;\n       (7) although the Health Care Financing Administration has \n     required mandatory blood lead screenings for children \n     enrolled in the medicaid program who are not less than 1 nor \n     more than 5 years of age, less than 20 percent of these \n     children have received such screenings;\n       (8) the Health Care Financing Administration mandatory \n     screening policy has not been effective, or sufficient, to \n     properly identify and screen children enrolled in the \n     medicaid program who are at risk;\n       (9) only about \\1/2\\ of State programs have screening \n     policies consistent with Federal policy; and\n       (10) adequate treatment services are not uniformly \n     available for children with elevated blood lead levels.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create a lead \n     screening safety net that will, through the medicaid and \n     State children's health insurance program, ensure that \n     children enrolled in those programs receive blood lead \n     screenings and appropriate followup care.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act to extend and improve the collection of maintenance \nfees, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pesticide \nMaintenance Fees Reauthorization Act of 2001 on behalf of myself and my \nfriend, Senator Lugar. This legislation reauthorizes several existing \nlegislative provisions addressing pesticide fees.\n  As Senator Lugar and my colleagues know, the legal authorization for \nthe collection of so-called maintenance fees for the reregistration of \npesticides expires at the end of this month. This expiration means that \nEPA will face a significant funding shortfall as it continues its \nimplementation of FQPA.\n  This legislation has been negotiated between the Senate and House \nAgriculture Committees and representatives of the environmental and \nagri-chemical industry. It would require industry to pay $20 million a \nyear to reevaluate pesticides approved by EPA prior to 1984. In return, \na controversial proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency to more \nthan quadruple the amount of fees paid by the pesticide industry will \nbe shelved.\n  The $20 million per year represents an increase over the previous fee \nschedule that had ranged from $14 to $17.6 million a year. $20 million \nreflects the amount of money that EPA says is necessary to pay the \nsalaries and expenses of the 200 employees that review older \npesticides.\n  If this reauthorization were not provided, EPA would have to make up \nthe money from elsewhere in its budget or layoff some of those \nemployees. If that were to happen there is widespread concern that \nEPA's review of pesticides would slow down significantly. EPA has been \ncharged with reviewing all pesticides to make sure they are safe for \nthe environment and safe for kids. The last we need is for EPA to lose \nthe workers vital to accomplishing that.\n  I hope that the Senate will be able to move quickly on this \nlegislation, and I thank Senator Lugar for working with me to get it \nintroduced.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1475. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan appropriate and permanent tax structure for investments in the \nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico and the possessions of the United States, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of \nthe Economic Revitalization Tax Act of 2001. This legislation is \ndesigned to revitalize one of America's most important economic \npartners. As we discuss economic stimulus measures for our Nation \nduring these difficult times, it is important the we do not leave \nbehind the 3.9 million U.S. citizens of the Commonwealth of Puerto \nRico.\n  Puerto Rico purchases over $16 billion a year in goods and services \nfrom the rest of the United States. This is more than much larger \nnations such as Russia, China, Italy and Brazil. A strong economy in \nPuerto Rico helps generate over 320,000 jobs in the U.S. mainland. It \nis important that we maintain this economic partnership as strong as \never.\n  The economy of Puerto Rico was weak even before the current national \ncrisis. Since the beginning of the year, plant closures have been \nannounced affecting over 7 percent of the manufacturing workforce. \nSince Congress repealed tax incentives for investment in Puerto Rico in \nOctober 1996, manufacturing employment has declined by over 15 \npercent--more than any state in the U.S. mainland. Employment in other \nsectors of the economy has not increased enough to offset the loss in \nmanufacturing jobs. Consequently, total employment in Puerto Rico has \ndeclined over the last five years. By contrast, during the same period, \njobs increased by over 10 percent in the average state, and no state \nexperienced a net job loss.\n  The negative economic impacts of the current state of national alert \nwill be felt most in those regions of the country that are dependent on \ntourism and air transportation. As a small island, Puerto Rico is four \ntimes more dependent on external trade as a share of GDP than the U.S. \nmainland, and 45 percent of Puerto Rico's trade is transported by air, \ncompared to only 5 percent for the U.S. American Airlines which employs \nthousands at its major hub in Puerto Rico will be dramatically affected \nby the reduction in air travel.\n  Tourist expenditures are an essential component of Puerto Rico's \neconomy.\n\n[[Page S9882]]\n\nOccupancy rates at Puerto Rico hotels have already been cut in half, \nwith more losses expected as convention cancellations mount. Absent a \nturnaround, a significant portion of Puerto Rico's economy is directly \nat risk, with ripple effects beyond the tourism sector.\n  Puerto Rico's economy is closely linked to the U.S. economy. When the \nUnited States goes into recession, the impact is immediately felt on \nthe Island where the rate of unemployment currently is running at about \n13 percent. Retail sales are down over 30 percent since the terrorist \nacts.\n  It is essential to adopt measures to help Puerto Rico, like the rest \nof the country, recover economically and financially. Proposed national \neconomic recovery legislation will not, without special provisions, \nhelp Puerto Rico. For example, because Puerto Rico is considered a \nseparate taxing jurisdiction, investment tax credits and other business \nincentives do not apply to investments in Puerto Rico.\n  ``The Economic Revitalization Tax Act of 2001,'' will materially \nassist in mitigating the impact of the expected economic losses in \nPuerto Rico as a result of the tragic recent events, as well as halt \nthe continuing loss of manufacturing jobs due to the 1996 repeal of \nU.S. tax incentives. This legislation would provide a new tax regime to \nencourage American companies to retain their Puerto Rico operations and \nto re-invest profits earned in Puerto Rico and the U.S. possessions in \nthe United States on a tax preferred basis. This will not only help \nPuerto Rico directly, but it will also help the American economy by \nreturning profits to the U.S. where they can be invested in other job \ncreating activities.\n  Puerto Rico is a vital partner in the American family. The new \nadministration of Governor Sila Maria Calderon, is bringing a renewed \nvision of a prosperous Puerto Rico and is implementing a coherent \ndevelopment plan that will make that vision a reality. Governor \nCalderon understands that reform of the Commonwealth government and its \neconomic development policies are necessary for Puerto Rico's economic \ndevelopment. She is doing this in close collaboration with business and \ncommunity leaders in Puerto Rico.\n  This proposal is a win-win situation for Puerto Rico and for the \nAmerican worker and taxpayer. We help create jobs in Puerto Rico, and \nthose jobs will help create jobs in the U.S. mainland.\n  Please join me in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/26/senate-section/article/S9882-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1691.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Nation's prosperity and way of life are sustained \n     by energy use;\n       (2) the growing imbalance between domestic energy \n     production and consumption means that the Nation is becoming \n     increasingly reliant on imported energy, which has the \n     potential to undermine the Nation's economy, standard of \n     living, and national security;\n       (3) energy conservation and energy efficiency help maximize \n     the use of available energy resources, reduce energy \n     shortages, lower the Nation's reliance on energy imports, \n     mitigate the impacts of high energy prices, and help protect \n     the environment and public health;\n       (4) development of a balanced portfolio of domestic energy \n     supplies will ensure that future generations of Americans \n     will have access to the energy they need;\n       (5) energy efficiency technologies, renewable and \n     alternative energy technologies, and advanced energy systems \n     technologies will help diversify the Nation's energy \n     portfolio with few adverse environmental impacts and are \n     vital to delivering clean energy to fuel the Nation's \n     economic growth;\n       (6) development of reliable, affordable, and \n     environmentally sound energy efficiency technologies, \n     renewable and alternative energy technologies, and advanced \n     energy systems technologies will require maintenance of a \n     vibrant fundamental scientific knowledge base and continued \n     scientific and technological innovations that can be \n     accelerated by Federal funding, whereas commercial deployment \n     of such systems and technologies are the responsibility of \n     the private sector;\n       (7) Federal funding should focus on those programs, \n     projects, and activities that are long-term, high-risk, \n     noncommercial, and well-managed, and that provide the \n     potential for scientific and technological advances; and\n       (8) public-private partnerships should be encouraged to \n     leverage scarce taxpayer dollars.\n\n     SEC. 2003. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this division are to--\n       (1) protect and strengthen the Nation's economy, standard \n     of living, and national security by reducing dependence on \n     imported energy;\n       (2) meet future needs for energy services at the lowest \n     total cost to the Nation, including environmental costs, \n     giving balanced and comprehensive consideration to \n     technologies that improve the efficiency of energy end uses \n     and that enhance energy supply;\n       (3) reduce the air, water, and other environmental impacts \n     (including emissions of greenhouse gases) of energy \n     production, distribution, transportation, and use through the \n     development of environmentally sustainable energy systems;\n       (4) consider the comparative environmental impacts of the \n     energy saved or produced by specific programs, projects, or \n     activities;\n       (5) maintain the technological competitiveness of the \n     United States and stimulate economic growth through the \n     development of advanced energy systems and technologies;\n       (6) foster international cooperation by developing \n     international markets for domestically produced sustainable \n     energy technologies, and by transferring environmentally \n     sound, advanced energy systems and technologies to developing \n     countries to promote sustainable development;\n       (7) provide sufficient funding of programs, projects, and \n     activities that are performance-based and modeled as public-\n     private partnerships, as appropriate; and\n       (8) enhance the contribution of a given program, project, \n     or activity to fundamental scientific knowledge.\n\n     SEC. 2004. GOALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), in order to \n     achieve the purposes of this division under section 2003, the \n     Secretary should conduct a balanced energy research, \n     development, demonstration, and commercial application \n     portfolio of programs guided by the following goals to meet \n     the purposes of this division under section 2003.\n       (1) Energy conservation and energy efficiency.--\n       (A) For the Building Technology, State and Community \n     Sector, the program should develop technologies, housing \n     components, designs, and production methods that will, by \n     2010--\n       (i) reduce the monthly energy cost of new housing by 20 \n     percent, compared to the cost as of the date of the enactment \n     of this Act;\n       (ii) cut the environmental impact and energy use of new \n     housing by 50 percent, compared to the impact and use as of \n     the date of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (iii) improve durability and reduce maintenance costs by 50 \n     percent compared to the durability and costs as of the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n       (B) For the Industry Sector, the program should, in \n     cooperation with the affected industries, improve the energy \n     intensity of the major energy-consuming industries by at \n     least 25 percent by 2010, compared to the energy intensity as \n     of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (C) For Power Technologies, the program should, in \n     cooperation with the affected industries--\n       (i) develop a microturbine (40 to 300 kilowatt) that is \n     more than 40 percent more efficient by 2006, and more than 50 \n     percent more efficient by 2010, compared to the efficiency as \n     of the date of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (ii) develop advanced materials for combustion systems that \n     reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides by 30 to 50 percent while \n     increasing efficiency 5 to 10 percent by 2007, compared to \n     such emissions as of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n[[Page S9896]]\n\n       (D) For the Transportation Sector, the program should, in \n     cooperation with affected industries--\n       (i) develop a production prototype passenger automobile \n     that has fuel economy equivalent to 80 miles per gallon of \n     gasoline by 2004;\n       (ii) develop class 7 and 8 heavy duty trucks and buses with \n     ultra low emissions and the ability to use an alternative \n     fuel that has an average fuel economy equivalent to--\n\n       (I) 10 miles per gallon of gasoline by 2007; and\n       (II) 13 miles per gallon of gasoline by 2010;\n\n       (iii) develop a production prototype of a passenger \n     automobile with zero equivalent emissions that has an average \n     fuel economy of 100 miles per gallon of gasoline by 2010; and\n       (iv) improve, by 2010, the average fuel economy of trucks--\n\n       (I) in classes 1 and 2 by 300 percent; and\n       (II) in classes 3 through 6 by 200 percent,\n\n     compared to the fuel economy as of the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (2) Renewable energy.--\n       (A) For Hydrogen Research, to carry out the Spark M. \n     Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration \n     Act of 1990, as amended by subtitle A of title II of this \n     division.\n       (B) For bioenergy:\n       (i) The program should reduce the cost of bioenergy \n     relative to other energy sources to enable the United States \n     to triple bioenergy use by 2010.\n       (ii) For biopower systems, the program should reduce the \n     cost of such systems to enable commercialization of \n     integrated power-generating technologies that employ gas \n     turbines and fuel cells integrated with bioenergy gasifiers \n     within 5 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (iii) For biofuels, the program should accelerate research, \n     development, and demonstration on advanced enzymatic \n     hydrolysis technology for making ethanol from cellulosic \n     feedstock, with the goal that between 2010 and 2015 ethanol \n     produced from energy crops would be fully competitive in \n     terms of price with gasoline as a neat fuel, in either \n     internal combustion engines or fuel cell vehicles.\n       (C) For Geothermal Technology Development, the program \n     should focus on advanced concepts for the long term. The \n     first priority should be high-grade enhanced geothermal \n     systems; the second priority should be lower grade, hot dry \n     rock, and geopressured systems; and the third priority should \n     be support of field demonstrations of enhanced geothermal \n     systems technology, including sites in lower grade areas to \n     demonstrate the benefits of reservoir concepts to different \n     conditions.\n       (D) For Hydropower, the program should provide a new \n     generation of turbine technologies that will increase \n     generating capacity and will be less damaging to fish and \n     aquatic ecosystems.\n       (E) For Concentrating Solar Power, the program should \n     strengthen ongoing research, development, and demonstration \n     combining high-efficiency and high-temperature receivers with \n     advanced thermal storage and power cycles, with the goal of \n     making solar-only power (including baseload solar power) \n     widely competitive with fossil fuel power by 2015. The \n     program should limit or halt its research and development on \n     power-tower and power-trough technologies because further \n     refinements to these concepts will not further their \n     deployment, and should assess the market prospects for solar \n     dish/engine technologies to determine whether continued \n     research and development is warranted.\n       (F) For Photovoltaic Energy Systems, the program should \n     pursue research, development, and demonstration that will, by \n     2005, increase the efficiency of thin film modules from the \n     current 7 percent to 11 percent in multi-million watt \n     production; reduce the direct manufacturing cost of \n     photovoltaic modules by 30 percent from the current $2.50 per \n     watt to $1.75 per watt by 2005; and establish greater than a \n     20-year lifetime of photovoltaic systems by improving the \n     reliability and lifetime of balance-of-system components and \n     reducing recurring cost by 40 percent. The program's top \n     priority should be the development of sound manufacturing \n     technologies for thin-film modules, and the program should \n     make a concerted effort to integrate fundamental research and \n     basic engineering research.\n       (G) For Solar Building Technology Research, the program \n     should complete research and development on new polymers and \n     manufacturing processes to reduce the cost of solar water \n     heating by 50 percent by 2004, compared to the cost as of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (H) For Wind Energy Systems, the program should reduce the \n     cost of wind energy to three cents per kilowatt-hour at Class \n     6 (15 miles-per-hour annual average) wind sites by 2004, and \n     4 cents per kilowatt-hour in Class 4 (13 miles-per-hour \n     annual average) wind sites by 2015, and further if required \n     so that wind power can be widely competitive with fossil-\n     fuel-based electricity in a restructured electric industry. \n     Program research on advanced wind turbine technology should \n     focus on turbulent flow studies, durable materials to extend \n     turbine life, blade efficiency, and higher efficiency \n     operation in low quality wind regimes.\n       (I) For Electric Energy Systems and Storage, including High \n     Temperature Superconducting Research and Development, Energy \n     Storage Systems, and Transmission Reliability, the program \n     should develop high capacity superconducting transmission \n     lines and generators, highly reliable energy storage systems, \n     and distributed generating systems to accommodate multiple \n     types of energy sources under common interconnect standards.\n       (J) For the International Renewable Energy and Renewable \n     Energy Production Incentive programs, and Renewable Program \n     Support, the program should encourage the commercial \n     application of renewable energy technologies by developed and \n     developing countries, State and local governmental entities \n     and nonprofit electric cooperatives, and by the competitive \n     domestic market.\n       (3) Nuclear energy.--\n       (A) For university nuclear science and engineering, the \n     program should carry out the provisions of subtitle A of \n     title III of this division.\n       (B) For fuel cycle research, development, and \n     demonstration, the program should carry out the provisions of \n     subtitle B of title III of this division.\n       (C) For the Nuclear Energy Research Initiative, the program \n     should accomplish the objectives of section 2341(b) of this \n     Act.\n       (D) For the Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization Program, the \n     program should accomplish the objectives of section 2342(b) \n     of this Act.\n       (E) For Nuclear Energy Technologies, the program should \n     carry out the provisions of section 2343 of this Act.\n       (F) For Advanced Radioisotope Power Systems, the program \n     should ensure that the United States has adequate capability \n     to power future satellite and space missions.\n       (4) Fossil energy.--\n       (A) For core fossil energy research and development, the \n     program should achieve the goals outlined by the Department's \n     Vision 21 Program. This research should address fuel-flexible \n     gasification and turbines, fuel cells, advanced-combustion \n     systems, advanced fuels and chemicals, advanced modeling and \n     systems analysis, materials and heat exchangers, \n     environmental control technologies, gas-stream purification, \n     gas-separation technology, and sequestration research and \n     development focused on cost-effective novel concepts for \n     capturing, reusing or storing, or otherwise mitigating carbon \n     and other greenhouse gas emissions.\n       (B) For offshore oil and natural gas resources, the program \n     should investigate and develop technologies to--\n       (i) extract methane hydrates in coastal waters of the \n     United States, in accordance with the provisions of the \n     Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000; and\n       (ii) develop natural gas and oil reserves in the ultra-\n     deepwater of the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico. Research \n     and development on ultra-deepwater resource recovery shall \n     focus on improving the safety and efficiency of such recovery \n     and of sub-sea production technology used for such recovery, \n     while lowering costs.\n       (C) For transportation fuels, the program should support a \n     comprehensive transportation fuels strategy to increase the \n     price elasticity of oil supply and demand by focusing \n     research on reducing the cost of producing transportation \n     fuels from natural gas and indirect liquefaction of coal.\n       (5) Science.--The Secretary, through the Office of Science, \n     should--\n       (A) develop and maintain a robust portfolio of fundamental \n     scientific and energy research, including High Energy and \n     Nuclear Physics, Biological and Environmental Research, Basic \n     Energy Sciences (including Materials Sciences, Chemical \n     Sciences, Engineering and Geosciences, and Energy \n     Biosciences), Advanced Scientific Computing, Energy Research \n     and Analysis, Multiprogram Energy Laboratories-Facilities \n     Support, Fusion Energy Sciences, and Facilities and \n     Infrastructure;\n       (B) maintain, upgrade, and expand, as appropriate, and in \n     accordance with the provisions of this division, the \n     scientific user facilities maintained by the Office of \n     Science, and ensure that they are an integral part of the \n     Department's mission for exploring the frontiers of \n     fundamental energy sciences; and\n       (C) ensure that its fundamental energy sciences programs, \n     where appropriate, help inform the applied research and \n     development programs of the Department.\n       (b) Review and Assessment.--The Secretary shall perform an \n     assessment that establishes measurable cost and performance-\n     based goals, or that modifies the goals under subsection (a), \n     as appropriate, for 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 for each of \n     the programs authorized by this division that would enable \n     each such program to meet the purposes of this division under \n     section 2003. Such assessment shall be based on the latest \n     scientific and technical knowledge, and shall also take into \n     consideration, as appropriate, the comparative environmental \n     impacts (including emissions of greenhouse gases) of the \n     energy saved or produced by specific programs.\n       (c) Consultation.--In establishing the measurable cost and \n     performance-based goals under subsection (b), the Secretary \n     shall consult with the private sector, institutions of higher \n     learning, national laboratories, environmental organizations, \n     professional and technical societies, and any other persons \n     as the Secretary considers appropriate.\n       (d) Schedule.--The Secretary shall--\n       (1) issue and publish in the Federal Register a set of \n     draft measurable cost and performance-based goals for the \n     programs authorized by this division for public comment--\n\n[[Page S9897]]\n\n       (A) in the case of a program established before the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, not later than 120 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (B) in the case of a program not established before the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, not later than 120 days \n     after the date of establishment of the program;\n       (2) not later than 60 days after the date of publication \n     under paragraph (1), after taking into consideration any \n     public comments received, transmit to the Congress and \n     publish in the Federal Register the final measurable cost and \n     performance-based goals; and\n       (3) update all such cost and performance-based goals on a \n     biennial basis.\n\n     SEC. 2005.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as ``Department of Energy \n     University Nuclear Science and Engineering Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2302. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) United States university nuclear science and \n     engineering programs are in a state of serious decline, with \n     nuclear engineering enrollment at a 35-year low. Since 1980, \n     the number of nuclear engineering university programs has \n     declined nearly 40 percent, and over two-thirds of the \n     faculty in these programs are 45 years of age or older. Also, \n     since 1980, the number of university research and training \n     reactors in the United States has declined by over 50 \n     percent.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Fusion Energy Sciences \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2502. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) economic prosperity is closely linked to an affordable \n     and ample energy supply;\n       (2) environmental quality is closely linked to energy \n     production and use;\n       (3) population, worldwide economic development, energy \n     consumption, and stress on the environment are all expected \n     to increase substantially in the coming decades;\n       (4) the few energy options with the potential to meet \n     economic and environmental needs for the long-term future \n     should be pursued as part of a balanced national energy plan;\n       (5) fusion energy is an attractive long-term energy source \n     because of the virtually inexhaustible supply of fuel, and \n     the promise of minimal adverse environmental impact and \n     inherent safety;\n       (6) the National Research Council, the President's \n     Committee of Advisers on Science and Technology, and the \n     Secretary of Energy Advisory Board have each recently \n     reviewed the Fusion Energy Sciences Program and each strongly \n     supports the fundamental science and creative innovation of \n     the program, and has confirmed that progress toward the goal \n     of producing practical fusion energy has been excellent, \n     although much scientific and engineering work remains to be \n     done;\n       (7) each of these reviews stressed the need for a magnetic \n     fusion burning plasma experiment to address key scientific \n     issues and as a necessary step in the development of fusion \n     energy;\n       (8) the National Research Council has also called for a \n     broadening of the Fusion Energy Sciences Program research \n     base as a means to more fully integrate the fusion science \n     community into the broader scientific community; and\n       (9) the Fusion Energy Sciences Program budget is inadequate \n     to support the necessary science and innovation for the \n     present generation of experiments, and cannot accommodate the \n     cost of a burning plasma experiment constructed by the United \n     States, or even the cost of key participation by the United \n     States in an international effort.\n\n     SEC. 2503. PLAN FOR FUSION EXPERIMENT.\n\n       (a) Plan for United States Fusion Experiment.--The \n     Secretary, on the basis of full consultation with the Fusion \n     Energy Sciences Advisory Committee and the Secretary of \n     Energy Advisory Board, as appropriate, shall develop a plan \n     for United States construction of a magnetic fusion burning \n     plasma experiment for the purpose of accelerating scientific \n     understanding of fusion plasmas. The Secretary shall request \n     a review of the plan by the National Academy of Sciences, and \n     shall transmit the plan and the review to the Congress by \n     July 1, 2004.\n       (b) Requirements of Plan.--The plan described in subsection \n     (a) shall--\n       (1) address key burning plasma physics issues; and\n       (2) include specific information on the scientific \n     capabilities of the proposed experiment, the relevance of \n     these capabilities to the goal of practical fusion energy, \n     and the overall design of the experiment including its \n     estimated cost and potential construction sites.\n       (c) United States Participation in an International \n     Experiment.--In addition to the plan described in subsection \n     (a), the Secretary, on the basis of full consultation with \n     the Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee and the \n     Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, as appropriate, may also \n     develop a plan for United States participation in an \n     international burning plasma experiment for the same purpose, \n     whose construction is found by the Secretary to be highly \n     likely and where United States participation is cost \n     effective relative to the cost and scientific benefits of a \n     domestic experiment described in subsection (a). If the \n     Secretary elects to develop a plan under this subsection, he \n     shall include the information described in subsection (b), \n     and an estimate of the cost of United States participation in \n     such an international experiment. The Secretary shall request \n     a review by the National Academies of Sciences and \n     Engineering of a plan developed under this subsection, and \n     shall transmit the plan and the review to the Congress not \n     later than July 1, 2004.\n       (d) Authorization of Research and Development.--The \n     Secretary, through the Fusion Energy Sciences Program, may \n     conduct any research and development necessary to fully \n     develop the plans described in this section.\n\n     SEC. 2504.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Clean Coal Power \n     Initiative Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 5001. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) reliable, affordable, increasingly clean electricity \n     will continue to power the growing United States economy;\n       (2) an increasing use of electrotechnologies, the desire \n     for continuous environmental improvement, a more competitive \n     electricity market, and concerns about rising energy prices \n     add importance to the need for reliable, affordable, \n     increasingly clean electricity;\n       (3) coal, which, as of the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, accounts for more than \\1/2\\ of all electricity \n     generated in the United States, is the most abundant fossil \n     energy resource of the United States;\n       (4) coal comprises more than 85 percent of all fossil \n     resources in the United States and exists in quantities \n     sufficient to supply the United States for 250 years at \n     current usage rates;\n       (5) investments in electricity generating facility \n     emissions control technology over the past 30 years have \n     reduced the aggregate emissions of pollutants from coal-based \n     generating facilities by 21 percent, even as coal use for \n     electricity generation has nearly tripled;\n       (6) continuous improvement in efficiency and environmental \n     performance from electricity generating facilities would \n     allow continued use of coal and preserve less abundant energy \n     resources for other energy uses;\n       (7) new ways to convert coal into electricity can \n     effectively eliminate health-threatening emissions and \n     improve efficiency by as much as 50 percent, but initial \n     deployment of new coal generation methods and equipment \n     entails significant risk that generators may be unable to \n     accept in a newly competitive electricity market; and\n       (8) continued environmental improvement in coal-based \n     generation and increasing the production and supply of power \n     generation facilities with less air emissions, with the \n     ultimate goal of near-zero emissions, is important and \n     desirable.\n\n     SEC. 5002. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this division:\n       (1) Cost and performance goals.--The term ``cost and \n     performance goals'' means the cost and performance goals \n     established under section 5004.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Energy.\n\n     SEC. 5003.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Government, through the Atomic Energy \n     Commission, acquired the Rocky Flats site in 1951 and began \n     operations there in 1952. The site remains a Department of \n     Energy facility. Since 1992, the mission of the Rocky Flats \n     site has changed from the production of nuclear weapons \n     components to cleanup and closure in a manner that is safe, \n     environmentally and socially responsible, physically secure, \n     and cost-effective.\n       (2) The site has generally remained undisturbed since its \n     acquisition by the Federal Government.\n       (3) The State of Colorado is experiencing increasing growth \n     and development, especially in the metropolitan Denver Front \n     Range area in the vicinity of the Rocky Flats site. That \n     growth and development reduces the amount of open space and \n     thereby diminishes for many metropolitan Denver communities \n     the vistas of the striking Front Range mountain backdrop.\n       (4) Some areas of the site contain contamination and will \n     require further response action. The national interest \n     requires that the ongoing cleanup and closure of the entire \n     site be completed safely, effectively, and without \n     unnecessary delay and that the site thereafter be retained by \n     the United States and managed so as to preserve the value of \n     the site for open space and wildlife habitat.\n       (5) The Rocky Flats site provides habitat for many wildlife \n     species, including a number of threatened and endangered \n     species, and is marked by the presence of rare xeric \n     tallgrass prairie plant communities. Establishing the site as \n     a unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System will promote \n     the preservation and enhancement of those resources for \n     present and future generations.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are--\n       (1) to provide for the establishment of the Rocky Flats \n     site as a national wildlife refuge following cleanup and \n     closure of the site;\n       (2) to create a process for public input on refuge \n     management before transfer of administrative jurisdiction to \n     the Secretary of the Interior; and\n\n[[Page S9926]]\n\n       (3) to ensure that the Rocky Flats site is thoroughly and \n     completely cleaned up.\n\n     SEC. 3173.

Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Miller, Mr. Allen, Mr. Bond, Mr. \nHatch, and Mr. Murkowski) submitted an amendment intended to be \nproposed by him to the bill H.R. 1438, to authorize appropriations for \nfiscal year 2002 for military activities of the Department of Defense \nfor military constructions, and for defense activities of the \nDepartment of Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal \nyear for the Armed Forces, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the end of division A, add the following new title:\n\n       TITLE XIV--AMERICAN SERVICEMEMBERS' PROTECTION ACT OF 2001\n\n     SEC. 1401. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``American Servicemembers' \n     Protection Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 1402. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 17, 1998, the United Nations Diplomatic \n     Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an \n     International Criminal Court, meeting in Rome, Italy, adopted \n     the ``Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court''. The \n     vote on whether to proceed with the statute was 120 in favor \n     to 7 against, with 21 countries abstaining. The United States \n     voted against final adoption of the Rome Statute.\n       (2) As of April 30, 2001, 139 countries had signed the Rome \n     Statute and 30 had ratified it. Pursuant to Article 126 of \n     the Rome Statute, the statute will enter into force on the \n     first day of the month after the 60th day following the date \n     on which the 60th country deposits an instrument ratifying \n     the statute.\n       (3) Since adoption of the Rome Statute, a Preparatory \n     Commission for the International Criminal Court has met \n     regularly to draft documents to implement the Rome Statute, \n     including Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Elements of \n     Crimes, and a definition of the Crime of Aggression.\n       (4) During testimony before the Congress following the \n     adoption of the Rome Statute, the lead United States \n     negotiator, Ambassador David Scheffer stated that the United \n     States could not sign the Rome Statute because certain \n     critical negotiating objectives of the United States had not \n     been achieved. As a result, he stated: ``We are left with \n     consequences that do not serve the cause of international \n     justice.''\n       (5) Ambassador Scheffer went on to tell the Congress that: \n     ``Multinational peacekeeping forces operating in a country \n     that has joined the treaty can be exposed to the Court's \n     jurisdiction even if the country of the individual \n     peacekeeper has not joined the treaty. Thus, the treaty \n     purports to establish an arrangement whereby United States \n     armed forces operating overseas could be conceivably \n     prosecuted by the international court even if the United \n     States has not agreed to be bound by the treaty. Not only is \n     this contrary to the most fundamental principles of treaty \n     law, it could inhibit the ability of the United States to use \n     its military to meet alliance obligations and participate in \n     multinational operations, including humanitarian \n     interventions to save civilian lives. Other contributors to \n     peacekeeping operations will be similarly exposed.''.\n       (6) Notwithstanding these concerns, President Clinton \n     directed that the United States sign the Rome Statute on \n     December 31, 2000. In a statement issued that day, he stated \n     that in view of the unremedied deficiencies of the Rome \n     Statute, ``I will not, and do not recommend that my successor \n     submit the Treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until \n     our fundamental concerns are satisfied''.\n       (7) Any American prosecuted by the International Criminal \n     Court will, under the Rome Statute, be denied procedural \n     protections to which all Americans are entitled under the \n     Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution, such as the \n     right to trial by jury.\n       (8) Members of the Armed Forces of the United States should \n     be free from the risk of prosecution by the International \n     Criminal Court, especially when they are stationed or \n     deployed around the world to protect the vital national \n     interests of the United States. The United States Government \n     has an obligation to protect the members of its Armed Forces, \n     to the maximum extent possible, against criminal prosecutions \n     carried out by the International Criminal Court.\n       (9) In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States to the risk of international criminal \n     prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the \n     President and other senior elected and appointed officials of \n     the United States Government may be prosecuted by the \n     International Criminal Court. Particularly if the Preparatory \n     Commission agrees on a definition of the Crime of Aggression \n     over United States objections, senior United States officials \n     may be at risk of criminal prosecution for national security \n     decisions involving such matters as responding to acts of \n     terrorism, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, and deterring aggression. No less than members \n     of the Armed Forces of the United States, senior officials of \n     the United States Government should be free from the risk of \n     prosecution by the International Criminal Court, especially \n     with respect to official actions taken by them to protect the \n     national interests of the United States.\n       (10) Any agreement within the Preparatory Commission on a \n     definition of the Crime of Aggression that usurps the \n     prerogative of the United Nations Security Council under \n     Article 39 of the charter of the United Nations to \n     ``determine the existence of any . . . . act of aggression'' \n     would contravene the charter of the United Nations and \n     undermine deterrence.\n       (11) It is a fundamental principle of international law \n     that a treaty is binding upon its parties only and that it \n     does not create obligations for nonparties without their \n     consent to be bound. The United States is not a party to the \n     Rome Statute and will not be bound by any of its terms. The \n     United States will not recognize the jurisdiction of the \n     International Criminal Court over United States nationals.\n\n     SEC. 1403. WAIVER AND TERMINATION OF PROHIBITIONS OF THIS \n                   TITLE.\n\n       (a) Authority To Initially Waive Sections 1405 and 1407.--\n     The President is authorized to waive the prohibitions and \n     requirements of sections 1405 and 1407 for a single period of \n     one year.

A waiver under \n     this subsection may be issued only if the President at least \n     fifteen days in advance of exercising such authority--\n       (1) notifies the appropriate congressional committees of \n     the intention to exercise such authority; and\n       (2) determines and reports to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that the International Criminal Court--\n       (A) remains party to, and has continued to abide by, a \n     binding agreement that--\n       (i) prohibits the International Criminal Court from seeking \n     to exercise jurisdiction over the following persons with \n     respect to actions undertaken by them in an official \n     capacity:\n\n       (I) covered United States persons;\n       (II) covered allied persons; and\n       (III) individuals who were covered United States persons or \n     covered allied persons; and\n\n       (ii) ensures that no person described in clause (i) will be \n     arrested, detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned by or on behalf \n     of the International Criminal Court; and\n       (B) has taken no steps to arrest, detain, prosecute, or \n     imprison any person described in clause (i) of subparagraph \n     (A).\n       (c) Authority To Waive Sections 1404 and 1406 With Respect \n     to an Investigation or Prosecution of a Named Individual.--\n     The President is authorized to waive the prohibitions and \n     requirements of sections 1404 and 1406 to the degree such \n     prohibitions and requirements would prevent United States \n     cooperation with an investigation or prosecution of a named \n     individual by the International Criminal Court. A waiver \n     under this subsection may be issued only if the President at \n     least 15 days in advance of exercising such authority--\n       (1) notifies the appropriate congressional committees of \n     the intention to exercise such authority; and\n       (2) determines and reports to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that--\n       (A) a waiver pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of the \n     prohibitions and requirements of sections 1405 and 1407 is in \n     effect;\n       (B) there is reason to believe that the named individual \n     committed the crime or crimes that are the subject of the \n     International Criminal Court's investigation or prosecution;\n       (C) it is in the national interest of the United States for \n     the International Criminal Court's investigation or \n     prosecution of the named individual to proceed; and\n       (D) in investigating events related to actions by the named \n     individual, none of the following persons will be \n     investigated, arrested, detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned \n     by or on behalf of the International Criminal Court with \n     respect to actions undertaken by them in an official \n     capacity:\n       (i) Covered United States persons.\n       (ii) Covered allied persons.\n       (iii) Individuals who were covered United States persons or \n     covered allied persons.\n       (d) Termination of Waiver Pursuant to Subsection (c).--Any \n     waiver or waivers exercised pursuant to subsection (c) of the \n     prohibitions and requirements of sections 1404 and 1406 shall \n     terminate at any time that a waiver pursuant to subsection \n     (a) or (b) of the prohibitions and requirements of sections \n     1405 and 1407 expires and is not extended pursuant to \n     subsection (b).\n       (e) Termination of Prohibitions of This Title.--The \n     prohibitions and requirements of sections 1404, 1405, 1406, \n     and 1407 shall cease to apply, and the authority of section \n     1408 shall terminate, if the United States becomes a party to \n     the International Criminal Court pursuant to a treaty made \n     under article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1404.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader has been extremely \npatient on this Defense bill. We tried for days to get a finite list of \namendments. Two Senators held us up from doing this and held us up from \nmoving forward on a bill that deals with what this country is all about \ntoday, problems that our military can only solve.\n  In Nevada and all over the country, Guard and Reserve units are being \ncalled up. This bill has many provisions for them. It has funds for \nactive duty forces, pay raises for those who are on active duty, and \nmany other provisions. It is a very important bill.\n  I am glad the majority leader has made the decision to move forward \nwith invoking cloture, and we will do that. This bill is far too \nimportant. Ninety-eight Senators are ready to move forward on the \nlegislation and two are not. It is just too bad we are not today \ncelebrating the completion of this bill, rather than having to wait now \nuntil next Tuesday to invoke cloture and then, as you know, the rule \nallows several more days if people decide to use the time.\n  It is too bad this has had to occur. This country is going to do \neverything it can to support the service men and women of this country. \nInvoking cloture is one way we can show our support for this \nlegislation.
