Mr. President, President Bush has just returned from his \ntrip to Europe, and the newspapers are full of glowing accounts. Some \nof the headlines include the following: ``Europe sees Bush's Trip \nExceeding Expectations.'' That from the New York Times on June 18. The \nInternational Herald Tribune: ``President Climbs in European Esteem.''\n  Similarly, other headlines and stories noted the fact that the \nPresident was successful in communicating his views on a wide variety \nof subjects, including most especially our view of national security \nissues and specifically the question of missile defense.\n  I want to spend a few minutes talking about the President's \nsuccessful trip, his vision for the future in a new post-cold-war era, \nand the acceptance of those views by most of our allies and even, to \nsome extent, by those whom he characterizes as friends, countries that \ncould, indeed, someday perhaps be allies, countries such as Russia, \nfollowing especially his visit with President Putin during the course \nof this trip.\n  I think the pundits had a good time as the President was preparing \nfor his\n\n[[Page S6388]]\n\ntrip, speculating about whether this President, who had not extensively \ntraveled abroad and did not have a great deal of international \nexperience, would be able to impress these savvy international leaders.\n  What they found--and it was interesting--on the Sunday morning talk \nshows they were all doing a little bit of a retreat, which pleased me \nbecause I had seen the same kind of questioning of the President when \nhe was beginning his run for the Presidency as Governor of Texas.\n  There were those who said: He is a very congenial fellow, but does he \nreally have what it takes? I think we all saw, and even my Democratic \ncolleagues who supported Vice President Gore at the time concluded, \nthat this is a man who not only has great charm but also significant \nsubstance and a view of the world which is in keeping with the times as \nwe commence our journey into this 21st century.\n\n  He proved that during the campaign. He proved it in domestic affairs, \nachieving a milestone of success with the tax cuts we passed and he \nsigned into law a little over a week ago, and then this foreign trip, \nwhich was the first major trip, the trip to Europe, to visit with our \nNATO allies and other leaders in the region. We heard the same kind of \nquestions: Was the President prepared to meet these leaders?\n  There is a problem here, Mr. President, as you know, and that is that \nmost of the countries of Western Europe--the majority, I should say--\nare governed by left-of-center political leaders. They are, obviously, \nnot of the same political viewpoint as President Bush, but our alliance \nwith our NATO allies has gone through a series of changes where we have \nhad generally conservative leadership, more left-of-center leadership, \nand then a combination of the two.\n  We have always been able to accommodate our differences politically \nbecause of the common goal of providing a defense for the members of \nthe NATO alliance and in working together in national security matters \nthat go beyond just the question of the NATO alliance, especially \nduring the cold war as we were dealing with the then-Soviet Union and \nsubsequent to that time dealing with other challenges, including the \nBalkans and, of course, in dealing with the evolution of the changes \nthat have been occurring in the country of Russia itself.\n  That was the state of play when the President made this journey. Yet \nwhat we found was, notwithstanding the political differences of these \nleaders, there still is more that binds us than divides us. President \nBush is one of those innate leaders who has the capacity to bring \npeople together because of the force of his personality, which is one \nof reaching out, of showing that he is willing to listen, that he is \nwilling to accommodate, but also making it very clear he has some very \nfirm principles upon which U.S. policy is going to be based.\n  At the conclusion of my remarks, I am going to ask unanimous consent \nto print in the Record two very fine pieces by one of the finest \ncolumnists and political writers of our time, Charles Krauthammer. One \nof them appeared in the Weekly Standard in the June 4 issue. It is \nentitled ``The Bush Doctrine, ABM, Kyoto, and the New American \nUnilateralism.'' The other is an op-ed the Washington Post carried on \nJune 18 in which he makes a similar point that the type of \nunilateralism President Bush took to Europe and is intent on pursuing \nwith respect to United States interests throughout the world is not a \nunilateralism that says the United States is going to do what we want \nto do no matter what anybody else thinks and basically ignores their \npoints of view at all, but, rather, as Charles Krauthammer carefully \npoints out, this new Bush doctrine is a subtle change from the past in \nthis regard.\n  It says we are going to identify what we believe is in the best \ninterests of the United States of America and in the interests of the \nrest of the family of nations of the world.\n  We are going to pursue a course that achieves the goals that sustain \nthose interests, and we are not going to be deterred by naysayers, by \ncountries that, frankly, do not have the same goals in mind or by any \nkind of international view that everything has to be done by \ninternational accord or it cannot be done at all. We are not going to \nhave our national security interests vetoed by any other country of the \nworld. So we will pursue our national interests, and we are not going \nto allow other countries of the world that do not share those goals to \ndictate the results.\n  However, that does not mean we are simply going to try to impose our \nwill on others or that we are going to go our own way and to heck with \nthe rest of the world. Not at all. As Mr. Krauthammer points out, \nPresident Bush has very carefully conducted an overarching strategy, \nand then the tactics of achieving that strategy include a very heavy \ndose of consultation, especially with our allies and particularly with \nour NATO allies. It also involves consultation with other friends of \nthe United States, countries such as Russia and India, and other \ncountries such as China, with which we have had some difficulties in \nrecent times.\n  But the point of these consultations is not to tell other leaders \nwhat we are going to do come heck or high water but, rather, to say: \nLook, this is what we believe is in our best interests and your best \ninterests. Let's work together to try to find a way to achieve these \ngoals. There is some room for discussion. We have not finalized \neverything we plan to do, so there is an opportunity for everybody to \nhelp shape the future of the world as we begin this next century. But \nthere are certain goals and objectives we are going to attempt to \nachieve. If you want to be with us we would like to have you come along \nand help us find the right way to do that. In that spirit, he visited \nwith these European leaders.\n  We all know the President is very convincing. I realize the situation \nthere is a little different. In politics, it is not the typical kind of \ndiplomacy coming out of the State Department or other areas of \ndiplomatic expertise, in our country and in others, where subtlety and \nthe spoken word are so very important. President Bush is a man who \nmeans and says what he means very plainly. There is a certain advantage \nto that when you are dealing with foreign leaders who do not know you \nso well. It quickly becomes apparent to them that what you are telling \nthem is exactly what you believe, exactly what the United States \nintends to do, and that there is no guile, there is no hidden agenda.\n  I think it has an effect of disarming some leaders who might be \nlooking for hidden agendas or games that sometimes people in the \npolitical world like to play. President Bush is not like that. He has \nbeen very straightforward. He has been very clear about his vision. He \nhas not wavered from that, which is, of course, tempting to do when \nvisiting with other world leaders who do not totally share your world \nview.\n  The net result of that diplomacy and the new American vision of \nnational security for the family of nations of the world has been an \nacceptance by many of the European leaders, expressed very overtly. As \nthe headlines noted, a view among even those who do not necessarily \ntotally share the President's view is that there is room to work with \nthis President on these common goals.\n  Our NATO allies, countries such as Spain and Italy, the Czech \nRepublic, Vaclav Havel, made some very eloquent statements in support \nof the President. The Polish Government, even some statements from \nleaders of the British Government, Hungary, and other countries in \nEurope, have in one way or another expressly supported the President's \nplans for missile defense to protect the United States, our troops \ndeployed abroad, and our allies. Vaclav Havel said:\n\n       The new world we are entering cannot be based on mutually \n     assured destruction. An increasingly important role should be \n     played by defense systems.\n\n  There are many similar quotations in these various news stories that \nwere filed by the reporters covering the President's trip.\n  While there were many European leaders who overtly expressed support \nfor what the President was trying to do, as I said, there were others \nwho were not specific in their endorsement but who made it very clear \nthey believed President Bush was somebody with whom they could sit \ndown, talk these things over with, and reach some kind of mutual \nconclusion.\n  I was especially pleased this morning to find President Putin being \nquoted over and over again, in the lead story\n\n[[Page S6389]]\n\nin the Washington Post saying he believed there was room for the United \nStates and Russia to talk about these issues.\n  He was talking about something that has been very fundamental, from \nthe Russian point of view, to the relationship between Russia and the \nUnited States, the ABM Treaty. There is a suggestion it is no longer \nabsolutely necessary that that treaty remain in existence as the \ncornerstone of the strategic relationship between Russia and the United \nStates, as he has characterized it. President Bush has said it no \nlonger is the cornerstone. That was a treaty developed during the \nheight of the cold war when the Soviet Union and the United States \ntotally mistrusted each other. Whether or not it helped keep the peace \nduring that time is totally irrelevant to the circumstances of today, \nwhere the threat of mutually assured destruction simply cannot be the \nbasis for the relationship, the strategic relationship between the \nRussian people and the American people.\n  It has even been put into the context of a moral statement. Dr. Henry \nKissinger was one of the architects of the ABM Treaty. He was there at \nthe creation. He has testified to Congress, and he has told many of us, \nthat it is time to scrap this treaty. He knew why it was put into place \nin 1972. He knew the function it might perform at that time. But he now \nfully appreciates that it no longer serves that function and, more \nimportantly, leaves us nude, unprotected, vulnerable to attack by \ncountries that were not parties to that treaty and never would be. Here \nis what he said during testimony in 1999:\n\n       The circumstances that existed when the treaty was agreed \n     to were notably different from the situation today. The \n     threat to the United States from missile proliferation is \n     growing and is, today, coming from a number of hostile Third \n     World countries. The United States has to recognize that the \n     ABM Treaty constrains the nation's missile defense programs \n     to an intolerable degree in the day and age when ballistic \n     missiles are attractive to so many countries because there \n     are currently no defenses against them. This treaty may have \n     worked in a two-power nuclear world, although even that is \n     questionable. But in a multinuclear world it is reckless.\n\n  He was even more blunt during a press conference with then-Governor \nBush on May 23, 2000, when he said:\n\n       Deliberate vulnerability when the technologies are \n     available to avoid it cannot be a strategic objective, \n     cannot be a political objective, and cannot be a moral \n     objective of any American President.\n\n  He is correct. For any President of the United States or Congress to \ndeliberately leave the United States vulnerable to attack when we \nunderstand that there is a growing threat of that attack, and to leave \nin place any kind of legal regimes that would inhibit us from \ndeveloping the means of protecting ourselves, is intolerable; it is \nmorally indefensible, especially, as Dr. Kissinger says, when the \ntechnology is there to provide a defense.\n  One of the questions raised by some of our European friends was, Is \nthe technology really there?\n  By the way, I am somewhat amused by the twin arguments of opponents. \n``This thing will be so effective that it will start another arms \nrace.'' That is argument No. 1. Argument No. 2: ``It will never be \neffective.'' It is going to be effective or it is not going to be \neffective. I think it will be effective. I also do not think it will \nstart another arms race.\n  But what about the state of technology?\n  The Bush administration has decided that, because of the immediacy of \nthe threat identified in the Rumsfeld Commission report 3 years ago, we \nneed to get on with this now; that we cannot test forever to try to \ndevelop the perfect system. There will never be a perfect system, at \nleast for the amount of money we are willing to spend, and right now we \ndo not need a perfect system. The threat is from an accidental launch \nor rogue nation, and those are not the most robust threats to have to \ndefeat.\n  So I think what Secretary Rumsfeld and the President have in mind \ndoing is fielding, as soon as possible, whatever technology we have, \nunderstanding that it is not necessarily the best and it may not work \nin all circumstances.\n  Now, is that an indictment of what they intend to do? I do not think \nso. It is an honest acknowledgement of the fact that there is no such \nthing as a perfect shield, and that we are in the beginning stages of \nactually fielding this equipment.\n  We have done a lot of research, to be sure. But, frankly, for \npolitical reasons, a lot of that research has been wasted because the \nsystems that could take advantage of that research have been stopped \nfrom development and eventual deployment. So we have had a lot of \nstarts and stops, but we have never gone the next step, which is to \nactually put it out in the field and see how it works.\n  What Secretary Rumsfeld has said is go back to the gulf war. That was \nan emergency. We knew the Iraqis had Scud missiles. In fact, they were \nbeginning to shoot them toward Israel. We did not have a missile \ndefense. But Secretary of Defense Cheney at that time said: Don't we \nhave anything that we might employ here? And the answer from the \nPentagon was: Yes, we have the Patriot. It is an anti-aircraft system, \nbut it is very good at that, and it might be able to shoot down some \nScud missiles.\n  So they tinkered with it. They took the Patriot batteries that we \nhad--I think some of them were even test batteries--and put them into \nthe field. And those Patriots did a remarkably good job. I think that \nthe end result was somewhere in the neighborhood of about one-third of \nthe Scud missiles were brought down by the Patriot.\n  That is important when you recognize--and you will recall, Mr. \nPresident--that the single biggest loss of life of U.S. servicemen in \nthe gulf war occurred when 28 American soldiers were killed by one Scud \nmissile.\n  It is a very lethal weapon if you don't have a defense against it. So \nwhat Secretary Rumsfeld and President Bush have decided to do is to \ntake what we have--such as the Patriot missile of the gulf war time--\nget it into the field and begin working with it, all the while \ncontinuing to test more and more advanced systems. In this way, we will \nactually have a rudimentary defense to begin with, and we can continue \nto build on that as the technology evolves.\n  I will give you an analogy. We build ships in classes. We will start \nthe Los Angeles class of attack submarines, for example. The first of \nthe Los Angeles class submarines that came out of the dock was a good \nsubmarine, but it was not nearly as good as the last Los Angeles class \nsubmarine that came out many years later. Throughout the time that \nbasic class of submarines was built, changes were being made and \nembodied in that submarine, so that the last one that came off the \ndock, in many respects, was not much like the very first one; it was \nmuch, much improved and, frankly, was the basis for the evolution to \nthe next generation of attack submarines.\n  And so it is with missile defenses. I believe what the Secretary and \nthe President have in mind is fielding a combination of air and space \nand land systems, combined with the satellite and radar that is \nnecessary to detect a launch, and continue to follow a rogue missile, \nand then provide information at the very end of its flight for \nintercept and shootdown.\n  That combination might include the airborne laser, something with \ngreat promise. It might include standard missiles aboard the so-called \nAegis cruisers, cruisers with very good radar, and a missile which \ntoday is, obviously, not capable against the most robust of \nintercontinental ballistic missiles but at least has some capability if \nespecially you are able to sail the cruisers close enough to the \nlaunching point of the missile.\n\n  As those missiles are made bigger, and another stage is added to \nthem, and a more sophisticated seeker is put on top of that missile, it \nwill become more and more robust, to the point that at some point it \nwill have the capability of stopping just about any missile that might \nbe launched against us. We also have the potential for land-based \nsystems.\n  The point is this: The President has in mind moving forward, getting \noff the dime. Almost no one, any longer, denies the threat. Even \nPresident Putin has pointed that out.\n  So the question is: Do you test forever, until you are absolutely \ncertain, or do you move forward?\n  I saw my little nephew over the weekend. He is just now trying to \ncrawl and walk; and he is falling down\n\n[[Page S6390]]\n\nmore than he is walking, but he is trying. And the next time I see him, \nI suspect he is going to be walking. You don't quit just because you \nfell down the first time. And we don't stop just because we had a \ncouple tests that were not totally successful.\n  The point is, we will continue to test; we will continue to develop; \nwe will deploy what we have as we get it ready to deploy, and we will \ncontinue to evolve those systems until we are satisfied that we have a \nsystem that can work.\n  To those critics who say we don't have the technology or we won't \nhave it, I say, give us a chance. Let's try. Let's see. Don't say, you \ncan't do it, and we never start and we never try. The consequences are \nsimply too great. As Dr. Kissinger said, it would be literally reckless \nand immoral for us not to try when the technology is there.\n  Another question in this respect that the allies asked is, What would \nthe reaction from Russia be? It is a fair question. Russia has some \nconcerns. But Russia should not have concerns. Does anybody believe \nthat the United States intends to attack Russia? Even the Russians have \nto acknowledge that is no longer the relationship between our two \ncountries. And we don't believe they intend to attack us. Why would \nthey?\n  So these large inventories of nuclear weapons that both sides have, \nfrankly, are going to come down. We are not going to maintain that \nlevel of warhead, and we do not think the Russians are either. In fact, \nthey have made it clear they cannot afford to do so. Frankly, we would \nrather not have to spend the money on all those weapons so both sides \ncan draw down their nuclear weapons.\n  For anybody to suggest that our building the rudimentary defense is \ngoing to cause the Russians to begin spending billions more to build \nnew weapons, when they cannot afford to keep the ones they have, is, I \nthink, ludicrous. It is not going to happen. It is a misplaced fear.\n  I acknowledge the concern that these people express, but I ask them \nto think about the facts. Even Russian leaders have acknowledged they \nwould not be able to maintain more than about 1,500 warheads--down from \nabout 6,000 or more that they have today.\n  So I do not think it makes sense to argue that we should not prepare \nto defend ourselves just because the Russians might be fearful somehow \nand, therefore, might decide to spend billions more that they do not \nhave in developing new weapons. Nor do I think that argument applies to \nanyone else.\n  What we are talking about is building a defense that rogue nations \nwill understand, making it unprofitable for them to develop and deploy \nthe technology of missile defenses.\n  Are there other threats out there from these countries such as the \nso-called suitcase bomb? Yes, we are spending a lot to try to deal with \nthat, too. The cruise missile is another challenge that we have to \nmeet. But the mere fact that we have other kinds of challenges as well \ndoes not mean that we ignore the one that is first and foremost on the \nminds of these rogue leaders. Why else would they be spending the \nbillions of dollars they are spending to develop or buy the technology \nfor these missiles and the weapons of mass destruction that they put on \ntop of the missiles? Why?\n  This kind of weapon offers them a blackmail potential. In the wrong \nhands, with this kind of weapon a country can essentially say to the \nrest of the world--at the time they intend to attack someone else, or \nwant to get something from the rest of the world--look, you know we can \nlaunch this missile against you. We have done it in the past. We will \ndo it again. So you better give us what we want, or you better stay out \nof our way, or you better do whatever we want you to do. It is that \nblackmail component that worries so many of our leaders the most.\n  Go back to the Persian Gulf war again. If Saddam Hussein had had the \nweapons that could put a missile on London or Paris or Berlin or Rome \nor any other country in that area of the world, do you think we would \nhave had the same quality of allied contingent to face him down in that \nPersian Gulf war? Do you think other countries would have been as \nwilling to join the United States? And if, in fact, those weapons could \nhave killed a lot more Americans, would the United States have been as \nanxious to kick him out of Kuwait?\n  The argument would have been: Kuwait is of no interest to us, \nespecially when he can rain so much destruction down upon us. So you \nneed the kinds of defenses that prevent these rogue nations from \ncarrying out their aggressive intentions.\n  That is why--just getting back to the President's visit in Europe \nthis week--I am so heartened by not only the way he has laid this \nvision out but the way he has stuck to his guns, all the while being \nvery open in his discussions with allied leaders, as well as the \nRussians.\n  I must say, I was also heartened by the descriptions of the policy, \nand the steadiness with which Secretary of State Colin Powell and \nNational Secretary Adviser Condoleezza Rice presented this case again \nSunday on the talk shows. Dr. Rice, despite, I would say, bating by the \nquestioner, was very calm and very firm in articulating that the United \nStates will do what it takes to protect the citizens of the United \nStates and the interests of other freedom-loving people around the \nworld but that we will do so in a way in which we engage these other \nleaders. We will listen to what they have to say, and to the extent we \nare able to do so, within the confines of what is necessary for the \nUnited States, we will find ways to accommodate their needs as well.\n  One of these would be to actually provide that kind of missile \ndefense protection for them as well.\n  I applaud the President. I congratulate him for a successful trip. I \nhope we will have more opportunities to discuss this important issue in \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two articles by Charles \nKrauthammer be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Weekly Standard, June 4, 2001]\n\n                           The Bush Doctrine\n\n             ABM, Kyoto, and the New American Unilateralism\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n\n                         i. the world as it is\n\n       Between 1989 and 1991 the world changed so radically so \n     suddenly that even today the implications have not adequately \n     been grasped. The great ideological wars of the twentieth \n     century, which began in the '30s and lasted six decades, came \n     to an end overnight. And the Soviet Union died in its sleep, \n     and with it the last great existential threat to America, the \n     West, and the liberal idea.\n       So fantastic was the change that, at first, most analysts \n     and political thinkers refused to recognize the new \n     unipolarity. In the early '90s, conventional wisdom held that \n     we were in a quick transition from a bipolar to a multipolar \n     world: Japan was rising, Europe was uniting, China was \n     emerging, sleeping giants like India were stirring, and \n     America was in decline. It seems absurd today, but this \n     belief in American decline was all the rage.\n       Ten years later, the fog has cleared. No one is saying that \n     Japan will overtake the United States economically, or Europe \n     will overtake the United States diplomatically, or that some \n     new anti-American coalition of powers will rise to replace \n     the Communist block militarily. Today, the United States \n     remains the preeminent economic, military, diplomatic, and \n     cultural power on a scale not seen since the fall of the \n     Roman Empire.\n       Oddly enough, the uniqueness of this structure is only \n     dimly understood in the United States. It is the rest of the \n     world that sees it--undoubtedly, because it feels it--\n     acutely. Russia and China never fail in their summits to \n     denounce explicitly the ``unipolarity'' of the current world \n     structure and to pledge to do everything to abolish it. The \n     French--elegant, caustic, and as ever the intellectual leader \n     in things anti-American--have coined the term ``hyperpower'' \n     to describe America's new condition.\n       And a new condition it is. It is not, as we in America tend \n     to imagine, just the super-powerdom of the Cold War writ \n     large. It is something never seen before in the modern world. \n     Yet during the first decade of unipolarity, the United States \n     acted much as it had during the preceding half-century.\n       In part, this was because many in the political and foreign \n     policy elite refused to recognize the new reality. But more \n     important, it was because those in power who did recognize it \n     were deeply distrustful of American power. They saw their \n     mission as seeking a new world harmony by constraining this \n     overwhelming American power within a web of international \n     obligations--rather than maintaining, augmenting, and \n     exploiting the American predominance they had inherited.\n       This wish to maintain, augment, and exploit that \n     predominance is what distinguishes the new foreign policy of \n     the Bush administration. If successful, it would do what \n     Teddy Roosevelt did exactly a century ago: adapt America's \n     foreign policy and military posture to its new position in \n     the world. At the dawn of the 20th century, that meant\n\n[[Page S6391]]\n\n     entry into the club of Great Powers. Roosevelt both urged and \n     assured such entry with a Big Stick foreign policy that built \n     the Panama Canal and sent a blue water navy around the world \n     to formally announce our arrival.\n       At the dawn of the 21st century, the task of the new \n     administration is to develop a military and foreign policy \n     appropriate to our position of overwhelming dominance. In its \n     first four months in office, the Bush administration has \n     begun the task: reversing the premises of Clinton foreign \n     policy and adopting policies that recognize the new \n     unipolarity and the unilateralism necessary to maintain it.\n\n\n                      ii. abm: burying bipolarity\n\n       In May 2000, while still a presidential candidate, George \n     W. Bush gave a speech at the National Press Club pledging to \n     build a national missile defense for the United States. A \n     year later, as president, he repeated that in a speech at the \n     National Defense University. This set off the usual reflexive \n     reaction of longtime missile defense opponents. What was \n     missed both times, however, was that Bush was proposing far \n     more than a revival of the missile defense idea that had been \n     put on hold during the Clinton years. Bush also declared that \n     he would make unilateral cuts in American offensive nuclear \n     arms. Taken together, what he proposed was a radical new \n     nuclear doctrine: the end of arms control.\n       Henceforth, the United States would build nuclear weapons, \n     both offensive and defensive, to suit its needs--regardless \n     of what others, particularly the Russians, thought. Sure, \n     there would be consultation--no need to be impolite. Humble \n     unilateralism, the oxymoron that best describes this \n     approach, requires it: Be nice, be understanding. But, in the \n     end, be undeterred.\n       Liberal critics argue that a missile defense would launch a \n     new arms race, with the Russians building new warheads to \n     ensure that they could overcome our defenses. The response of \n     the Bush administration is: So what? If the Russians want to \n     waste what little remains of their economy on such weapons, \n     let them. These nukes are of no use. Whether or not Russia \n     builds new missiles, no American defense will stop a massive \n     Russian first strike anyway. And if Russia decides to enlarge \n     its already massive second strike capacity, in a world in \n     which the very idea of a first strike between us and the \n     Russians is preposterous, then fine again.\n       The premises underlying the new Bush nuclear doctrine are \n     simple: (1) There is no Soviet Union. (2) Russia--no longer \n     either a superpower or an enemy, and therefore neither a \n     plausibly viable nor an ideological threat--does not \n     count. (3) Therefore, the entire structure of bilateral \n     arms control, both offensive and defensive, which was an \n     American obsession during the last quarter-century of the \n     Cold War, is a useless relic. Indeed, it is seriously \n     damaging to American security.\n       Henceforth, America will build the best weaponry it can to \n     meet its needs. And those needs are new. The coming threat is \n     not from Russia, but from the inevitable proliferation of \n     missiles into the hands of heretofore insignificant enemies.\n       Critics can downplay and discount one such threat or \n     another. North Korea, they say, is incapable of building an \n     intercontinental ballistic missile. (They were saying that \n     right up to the time when it launched a three-stage rocket \n     over Japan in 1998). Or they will protest that Iraq cannot \n     possibly build an effective nuclear capacity clandestinely. \n     They are wrong on the details, but, even more important, they \n     are wrong in principle: Missile technology is to the 21st \n     century what airpower was to the 20th. In 1901, there was not \n     an airplane in the world. Most people did not think a \n     heavier-than-air machine could in theory ever fly. Yet 38 \n     years later, the world experienced the greatest war in \n     history, whose outcome was crucially affected by air power \n     and air defenses in a bewildering proliferation of new \n     technologies: bombers, fighters, transports, gliders, \n     carriers, radar.\n       It is inconceivable that 38 years from now, we will not be \n     living in a world where missile technology is equally \n     routine, and thus routinely in the hands of bad guys.\n       It is therefore inexplicable why the United States should \n     not use its unique technology to build the necessary defense \n     against the next inevitable threat.\n       Yet for eight years, the U.S. government did nothing on the \n     grounds that true safety lay in a doctrine (mutually assured \n     destruction) and a treaty (the antiballistic missile treaty) \n     that codifies it. The logic of MAD is simple: If either side \n     can ever launch a first. And because missile defenses cast \n     doubt on the efficacy of a second strike capacity, they make \n     the nuclear balance more unstable.\n       This argument against missile defense was plausible during \n     the Cold War. True, it hinged on the very implausible notion \n     of a first strike. But at the time, the United States and the \n     Soviet Union were mortal ideological enemies. We came \n     close enough in Berlin and Cuba to know that war was \n     plausible. But even then the idea of a first strike \n     remained quite fantastic because it meant initiating the \n     most destructive war in human history.\n       Today, the idea of Russia or America launching a bolt from \n     the blue is merely absurd. Russia does not define itself as \n     our existential adversary. It no longer sees its mission as \n     the abolition of our very way of life. We no longer are nose-\n     to-nose in flashpoints like Berlin. Ask yourself: Did you \n     ever in the darkest days of the Cold War lie awake at night \n     wondering whether Britain or France or Israel had enough of a \n     second strike capacity to deter an American first strike \n     against them? Of course not. Nuclear weapons are not in \n     themselves threats. They become so in conditions of extreme \n     hostility. It all depends on the intent of the political \n     authorities who control them. A Russian or an American first \n     strike? We are no longer contending over the fate of the \n     earth, over the future of Korea and Germany and Europe. Our \n     worst confrontation in the last decade was over the Pristina \n     airport!\n       What about China? The fallback for some missile defense \n     opponents is that China will feel the need to develop a \n     second strike capacity to overcome our defenses. But this too \n     is absurd. China does not have a second strike capacity. If \n     it has never had one in the absence of an American missile \n     defense, why should the construction of an American missile \n     defense create a crisis of strategic instability between us?\n       But the new Bush nuclear doctrine does not just bury MAD. \n     It buries the ABM treaty and the very idea of bilateral \n     nuclear coordination with another superpower. Those \n     agreements, on both offensive and defensive nuclear weapons, \n     are a relic of the bipolar world. In the absence of \n     bipolarity, there is no need to tailor our weapons to the \n     needs or threat or wishes of a rival superpower.\n       Yet the Clinton administration for eight years carried on \n     as if it did. It spent enormous amounts of energy trying to \n     get the START treaties refined and passed in Russia. It went \n     to great lengths to constrain and dumb down the testing of \n     high-tech weaponry (particularly on missile defense) to be \n     ``treaty compliant.'' It spent even more energy negotiating \n     baroque extensions, elaborations, and amendments to the ABM \n     treaty. Its goal was to make the treaty more enduring, at a \n     time when it had already become obsolete. In fact, in one \n     agreement, negotiated in New York in 1997, the Clinton \n     administration amended the ABM treaty to include as \n     signatories Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus, thus making \n     any future changes in the treaty require five signatures \n     rather than only two. It is as if Britain and Germany had \n     spent the 1930s regulating the levels of their horse \n     cavalries.\n       That era is over.\n\n\n                iii. kyoto: escape from multilateralism\n\n       It was expected that a Republican administration would \n     abrogate the ABM treaty. It was not expected that a \n     Republican administration would even more decisively discard \n     the Kyoto treaty on greenhouse gases. Yet this step may be \n     even more far-reaching.\n       To be sure, Bush had good political and economic reasons to \n     discard Kyoto. The Senate had expressed its rejection of what \n     Clinton had negotiated 95-0. The treaty had no domestic \n     constituency of any significance. Its substance bordered on \n     the comic: It exempted China, India, and the other massively \n     industrializing polluters in the Third World from \n     CO2 restrictions. The cost for the United States \n     was staggering, while the environmental benefit was \n     negligible. The exempted 1.3 billion Chinese and billion \n     Indians alone would have been pumping out CO2 \n     emissions equal to those the United States was cutting. In \n     reality, Kyoto was a huge transfer of resources from the \n     United States to the Third World, under the guise of \n     environmental protection.\n       All very good reasons. Nonetheless, the alacrity and almost \n     casualness with which Bush withdrew from Kyoto sent a message \n     that the United States would no longer acquiesce in \n     multilateral nonsense just because it had pages of \n     signatories and bore the sheen of international comity. \n     Nonsense was nonsense, and would be treated as such.\n       That alarmed the usual suspects. They were further alarmed \n     when word leaked that the administration rejected the \n     protocol negotiated by the Clinton administration for \n     enforcing the biological weapons treaty of 1972. The reason \n     here is even more obvious. The protocol does nothing of the \n     sort. Biological weapons are inherently unverifiable. You can \n     make biological weapons in a laboratory, in a bunker, in a \n     closet. In a police state, these are unfindable. And police \n     states are what we worry about. The countries effectively \n     restricted would be open societies with a free press--\n     precisely the countries that we do not worry about. Even \n     worse, the protocol would have a perverse effect. It would \n     allow extensive inspection of American anti-biological-\n     warfare facilities--where we develop vaccines, protective \n     gear, and the like--and thus give information to potential \n     enemies on how to make their biological agents more \n     effective against us.\n       Given the storm over Kyoto, the administration is looking \n     for a delicate way to get out of this one. There is nothing \n     wrong with delicacy. But the thrust of the administration--to \n     free itself from the thrall of international treaty-signing \n     that has characterized U.S. foreign policy for nearly a \n     decade--is refreshing.\n       One can only marvel at the enthusiasm with which the \n     Clinton administration pursued not just Kyoto and the \n     biological protocol but multilateral treaties on everything \n     from chemical weapons to nuclear testing. Treaty-signing was \n     portrayed as a way to build a new structure of legality and \n     regularity in the world, to establish new moral norms that \n     would in and of themselves restrain bad behavior. But the \n     very idea of a Saddam Hussein being morally constrained by, \n     say, a treaty on chemical weapons is simply silly.\n\n[[Page S6392]]\n\n       This reality could not have escaped the liberal \n     internationalists who spent the '90s pursuing such toothless \n     agreements. Why then did they do it? The deeper reason is \n     that these treaties offered an opportunity for those who \n     distrusted American power (and have ever since the Vietnam \n     era) to constrain it--and constrain it in ways that give the \n     appearance of altruism and good international citizenship.\n       Moreover, it was clear that the constraints on American \n     power imposed by U.S.-Soviet bipolarity and the agreements it \n     spawned would soon and inevitably come to an end. Even the \n     ABM treaty, the last of these relics, would have to expire of \n     its own obsolescent dead weight. In the absence of \n     bipolarity, what was there to hold America back--from, say, \n     building ``Star Wars'' weaponry or raping the global \n     environment or otherwise indulging in the arrogance of power? \n     Hence the mania during the last decade for the multilateral \n     treaties that would impose a new structure of constraint on \n     American freedom of action.\n       Kyoto and the biological weapons protocol are the models \n     for the new structure of ``strategic stability'' that would \n     succeed the ABM treaty and its relatives. By summarily \n     rejecting Kyoto, the Bush administration radically redefines \n     the direction of American foreign policy: rejecting the \n     multilateral straitjacket, disenthralling the United \n     States from the notion there is real safety or benefit \n     from internationally endorsed parchment barriers, and \n     asserting a new American unilateralism.\n\n\n                   IV. The Purposes of Unilateralism\n\n       This is a posture that fits the unipolarity of the 21st \n     century world. Its aim is to restore American freedom of \n     action. But as yet it is defined only negatively. The \n     question remains: freedom of action to do what?\n       First and foremost, to maintain our preeminence. Not just \n     because we enjoy our own power (``It's good to be the \n     king''--Mel Brooks), but because it is more likely to keep \n     the peace. It is hard to understand the enthusiasm of so many \n     for a diminished America and a world reverted to \n     multipolarity. Multipolar international structures are \n     inherently less stable, as the catastrophic collapse of the \n     delicate alliance system of 1914 definitively demonstrated.\n       Multipolarity, yes, when there is no alternative. But not \n     when there is. Not when we have the unique imbalance of power \n     that we enjoy today--and that has given the international \n     system a stability and essential tranquility it had not known \n     for at least a century.\n       The international environment is far more likely to enjoy \n     peace under a single hegemon. Moreover, we are not just any \n     hegemon. We run a uniquely benign imperium. This is not mere \n     self-congratulation; it is a fact manifest in the way others \n     welcome our power. It is the reason, for example, the Pacific \n     Rim countries are loath to see our military presence \n     diminished.\n       Unlike other hegemons and would-be hegemons, we do not \n     entertain a grand vision of a new world. No Thousand Year \n     Reich. No New Soviet Man. By position and nature, we are \n     essentially a status quo power. We have no particular desire \n     to remake human nature, to conquer for the extraction of \n     natural resources, or to rule for the simple pleasure of \n     dominion. We could not wait to get out of Haiti, and we would \n     get out of Kosovo and Bosnia today if we could. Our principal \n     aim is to maintain the stability and relative tranquility of \n     the current international system by enforcing, maintaining, \n     and extending the current peace. Our goals include:\n       (1) To enforce the peace by acting, uniquely, as the \n     balancer of last resort everywhere. Britain was the \n     balancer of power in Europe for over two centuries, always \n     joining the weaker coalition against the stronger to \n     create equilibrium. Our unique reach around the world \n     allows us to be--indeed dictates that we be--the ultimate \n     balancer in every region. We balanced Iraq by supporting \n     its weaker neighbors in the Gulf War. We balance China by \n     supporting the ring of smaller states at her periphery \n     (from South Korea to Taiwan, even to Vietnam). One can \n     argue whether we should have gone there, but our role in \n     the Balkans was essentially to create a micro-balance: to \n     support the weaker Bosnia Muslims against their more \n     dominant ethnic neighbors, and subsequently to support the \n     (at the time) weaker Kosovo Albanians against the dominant \n     Serbs.\n       (2) To maintain the peace by acting as the world's foremost \n     anti-proliferator. Weapons of mass destruction and missiles \n     to deliver them are the greatest threat of the 21st century. \n     Non-proliferation is not enough. Passive steps to deny rogue \n     states the technology for deadly missiles and weapons of mass \n     destruction is, of course, necessary. But it is insufficient. \n     Ultimately the stuff gets through.\n       What to do when it does? It may become necessary in the \n     future actually to preempt rogue states' weapons of mass \n     destruction, as Israel did in 1981 by destroying the Osirak \n     nuclear reactor in Iraq. Premption is, of course, very \n     difficult. Which is why we must begin thinking of moving to a \n     higher platform. Space is the ultimate high ground. For 30 \n     years, we have been reluctant even to think about placing \n     weapons in space, but it is inevitable that space will become \n     militarized. The only question is: Who will get there first \n     and how will they use it?\n       The demilitarization of space is a fine idea and utterly \n     utopian. Space will be an avenue for projection of national \n     power as were the oceans 500 years ago. The Great Powers that \n     emerged in the modern world were those that, above all, \n     mastered control of the high seas. The only reason space has \n     not yet been militarized is that none but a handful of \n     countries are yet able to do so. And none is remotely as \n     technologically and industrially and economically prepared to \n     do so as is the United States.\n       This is not as radical an idea as one might think. When \n     President Kennedy committed the United States to a breakneck \n     program of manned space flight, he understood full well the \n     symbiosis between civilian and military space power. It is \n     inevitable that within a generation the United States will \n     have an Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Space Force. \n     Space is already used militarily for spying, sensing, and \n     targeting. It could be uniquely useful, among other \n     things, for finding and destroying rogue-state missile \n     forces.\n       (3) To extend the peace by spreading democracy and free \n     institutions. This is an unassailable goal and probably the \n     most enduring method of promoting peace. The liberation of \n     the Warsaw Pact states, for example, relieved us of the \n     enormous burden of physically manning the ramparts of Western \n     Europe with huge land armies. The zone of democracy is almost \n     invariably a zone of peace.\n       There is a significant disagreement, however, as to how far \n     to go and how much blood and treasure to expend in pursuit of \n     this goal. The ``globalist'' school favors vigorous \n     intervention and use of force to promote the spread of our \n     values where they are threatened or where they need \n     protection to burgeon. Globalists supported the U.S. \n     intervention in the Balkans not just on humanitarian grounds, \n     but on the grounds that ultimately we might widen the zone of \n     democracy in Europe and thus eliminate a festering source of \n     armed conflict, terror, and instability.\n       The ``realist'' school is more skeptical that these goals \n     can be achieved at the point of a bayonet. True, democracy \n     can be imposed by force, as both Germany and Japan can \n     attest. But those occurred in the highly unusual circumstance \n     of total military occupation following a war for \n     unconditional surrender. Unless we are willing to wage such \n     wars and follow up with the kind of trusteeship we enjoyed \n     over Germany and Japan, we will find that our interventions \n     on behalf of democracy will leave little mark, as we learned \n     with some chagrin in Haiti and Bosnia.\n       Nonetheless, although they disagree on the stringency of \n     criteria for unleashing American power, both schools share \n     the premise that overwhelming American power is good not just \n     for the United States but for the world. The Bush \n     administration is the first administration of the post-Cold \n     War era to share that premise and act accordingly. It \n     welcomes the U.S. role of, well, hyperpower. In its first few \n     months, its policies have reflected a comfort with the \n     unipolarity of the world today, a desire to maintain and \n     enhance it, and a willingness to act unilaterally to do so. \n     It is a vision of America's role very different from that \n     elaborated in the first post-Cold War decade--and far more \n     radical than has generally been noted. The French, though, \n     should be onto it very soon.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Weekly Standard, June 4, 2001]\n\n                            Big Rotten Apple\n\n\n                      New York City after Giuliani\n\n                           (By James Higgins)\n\n       Liberalism, or paleoliberalism to some, is what New Yorkers \n     are told will return to City Hall when term limits force \n     mayor Rudolph Giuliani to depart in 2002. Four Democrats are \n     vying to succeed him.\n       But the potential return of unreconstructed liberalism is \n     not the most menacing aspect of this fall's election. The \n     greater threat is the potential return of unreconstructed \n     crime. Not the kind in the streets, but the kind in the \n     suites--the suites of city government and the Democratic \n     party.\n       Everyone old enough to have watched TV in the 1980s and \n     early 1990s knows that New York City before Giuliani was \n     where foreign tourists came to pay the world's highest hotel \n     taxes while waiting to be robbed and shot. But the depth and \n     breadth of corruption in the city's Democratic establishment \n     during the pre-Giuliani years may be difficult for non-New \n     Yorkers to grasp. The problem was not just a few rotten \n     apples at the top. Under a series of Democratic mayors--\n     Abraham Beame, Edward Koch, and David Dinkins--the whole tree \n     was rotten. It was corruption that the New York City \n     Democrats stood for even more than liberalism, and it was \n     corruption at least as much as liberalism that brought \n     Giuliani to office. It was as if, having jailed much of the \n     leadership of New York's ``Five Families'' of crime while he \n     was U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, \n     Giuliani had to become mayor to flush out this Sixth Family.\n       To appreciate the significance of the upcoming election, \n     it's essential to know this background. The chief reason the \n     rot was not always visible to outsiders is the canniness of \n     Dems in the Big Apple. Unlike their counterpart New Jersey \n     crew, the New York City Democratic leadership has refrained \n     from putting into the highest offices sticky-fingered \n     characters like U.S. senators Harrison Williams and Robert \n     Torricelli. The New York Democrats could have been working \n     from the template of the mobsters who once\n\n[[Page S6393]]\n\n     controlled Las Vegas: They've always chosen clean front \n     men. There was never a hint of personal corruption on the \n     part of Beame, Koch, or Dinkins. Their administrations \n     were another story. Consider:\n       Under Ed Koch, the entire city department charged with \n     inspecting restaurants had to be closed because there was \n     almost no one left to do the job after investigators arrested \n     the inspectors who were taking bribes. Not long afterwards, \n     the department that inspected taxicabs had to be closed for \n     exactly the same reason.\n       Over an extended period of the '80s and early '90s, the \n     felony rate among Democratic borough leaders in New York City \n     approached 50 percent. Criminal defense lawyers tell me that \n     if senior managers of a private business used their jobs to \n     commit crimes at this rate, the entire enterprise would be \n     inviting a RICO indictment.\n       The Beame, Koch, and Dinkins administrations approved a \n     contract with school custodians that was close to being \n     criminal on its face: The custodians were required only to \n     maintain schools to ``minimum standards,'' and the contract \n     precluded any effective enforcement mechanism. The lucky \n     custodians then personally got to keep whatever money in \n     their budgets they didn't spend doing their jobs. This type \n     of contract came to an end only after a 1992 60 Minutes \n     segment showed the custodians spending less time at the \n     filthy schools they were ostensibly maintaining than \n     attending to the yachts they acquired--and did maintain--at \n     taxpayer expense.\n       As pre-Giuliani taxi and limousine commissioner Herb Ryan \n     described the system after he was caught taking bribes, \n     ``Everybody else has their own thing. I just wanted to get my \n     own thing.'' The literal translation of ``Our Thing'' is, of \n     course, La Cosa Nostra.\n       This is just a small sample of what the Sixth Family \n     Democrats and their appointees did--indeed, just a small \n     sample of what they were caught doing. That predicate \n     criminal activity is a major part of what in 1989 lured \n     political rising star and crime-fighter Rudy Giuliani to run \n     for mayor, a job that for more than a century had been a \n     political dead end.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 18, 2001]\n\n                      . . . From a No-Wobble Bush\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       ``Remember George, this is no time to go wobbly.'' So said \n     Margaret Thatcher to the first President Bush just days after \n     Saddam Hussein attacked Kuwait. Bush did not go wobbly. He \n     invaded.\n       A decade later, the second George Bush came into office and \n     immediately began a radical reorientation of U.S. foreign \n     policy. Now, however the conventional wisdom is that in the \n     face of criticism from domestic opponents and foreign allies, \n     Bush is backing down.\n       Has W. gone wobbly? In his first days, he offered a new \n     American nuclear policy that scraps the 1972 anti-Ballistic \n     Missile Treaty, builds defenses against ballistic missile \n     attack and unilaterally cuts U.S. offensive nuclear forces \n     without wrangling with the Russians over arms control, the \n     way of the past 30 years. He then summarily rejected the \n     Kyoto protocol on climate control, which would have forced \n     the United States to undertake a ruinous 30 percent cut in \n     CO2 emissions while permitting China, India and most of \n     humanity to pollute at will.\n       Bush's assertion of American freedom of action outraged \n     those--U.S. Democrats, Europeans, Russians--who prefer to see \n     the world's only superpower bound and restrained by treaty \n     constraints, whether bipolar (ABM) or multipolar (Kyoto), in \n     the name of good international citizenship.\n       The word now, however, is that Bush has gone soft. He sends \n     Secretary of State Colin Powell to Europe to try to get \n     agreement on missile defenses. He tries, reports the New York \n     Times in high scoop mode, to cook an ABM deal with the \n     Russians--shades of the old days. He then concedes there is \n     global warming and promises action. ``When President Bush \n     announces . . . that he will seek millions of dollars for new \n     research into the causes of global warming,'' reported the \n     Times just one week ago, ``. . . it will mark yet another \n     example of how global and domestic politics have forced him \n     to back away from the hairline pronouncements of his first \n     five months in the White House.''\n       The Bush administration, explained Newsweek, began by \n     ``playing the bully.'' But then ``the Bushies began to see \n     that they could not simply impose their agenda on a balky and \n     complex world.''\n       The alleged cave has been greeted with smug satisfaction \n     from those on the left who see Bush returning, after a brief \n     flirtation with the mad-dog ideological right, to the basic \n     soundness of post-Cold War foreign policy as established by \n     the Clinton administration.\n       Dream on.\n       Has Bush gone wobbly? Not at all.\n       Ask yourself: If you really wanted to reassert American \n     unilateralism, to get rid of the cobwebs of the bipolar era \n     and the myriad Clinton-era treaty strings trying Gulliver \n     down, what would you do? No need for in-your-face arrogance. \n     No need to humiliate. No need to proclaim that you will \n     ignore nattering allies and nervous enemies.\n       Journalists can talk like that because the trust is \n     clarifying. Governments cannot talk like that because the \n     truth is scary. The trick to unilateralism--doing what you \n     think is right, regardless of what others think--is to \n     pretend you are not acting unilaterally at all. Thus if you \n     really want to junk the ABM Treaty, and the Europeans and \n     Russians and Chinese start screaming bloody murder, the trick \n     is to send Colin Powell to smooth and sooth and schmooze \n     every foreign leader in sight, have Condoleezza Rica talk \n     about how much we value allied input, have President Bush in \n     Europe stress how missile defense will help the security of \n     everybody. And then go ahead and junk the ABM Treaty \n     regardless. Make nice, then carry on.\n       Or, say you want to kill the Kyoto protocol (which the \n     Senate rejected 95-0 and which not a single EU country has \n     ratified) and the Eueopeans hypocritically complain. The \n     trick is to have the president go to Europe to stress, both \n     sincerely and correctly, that the United States wants to be \n     in the forefront of using science and technology to attack \n     the problem--but make absolutely clear that you'll accept no \n     mandatory cuts and tolerate no treaty that penalizes the \n     United States and lets China, India and the Third World off \n     the hook.\n       Be nice, but be undeterred. The best unlateralism is \n     velvet-glove unilateralism.\n       At the end of the day, for all the rhetorical bows to \n     Russia, European and liberal sensibilities, look at how Bush \n     returns from Europe: Kyoto is dead. The ABM Treaty is \n     history, Missile defense is on. NATO expansion is relaunched. \n     And just to italicize the new turn in American foreign \n     policy, the number of those annual, vaporous U.S.-EU summits \n     has been cut from two to one.\n       Might the administration yet bend to the critics and \n     abandon the new unilateralism? Perhaps. But the crowing of \n     the Washington foreign policy establishment that this has \n     already occurred is wishful thinking.\n       Will he wobble? Everything is possible. But anyone who has \n     watched Defense Secretary Rumsfield, read Deputy Secretary \n     Wolfowitz known Vice President Cheney or listened to \n     President Bush would be wise to place his bet at the ``no \n     wobble'' window.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to address the issue of \nembryonic stem cell research and cloning. The two issues are \ninexplicably tied together. I want to discuss this in the narrow \ncontext of Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research and \ncloning. The two are tied together in what is currently being \ndiscussed. They take an embryo, raise it to a certain age, kill the \nembryo, take the stem cell out of the embryo--the young stem cells \ninside that are reproducing on a rapid basis--and use those in \nresearch, or use those for human development and in the capacity of \nmaking other organs in the future.\n  The next step will be to take the Presiding Officer's DNA material, \nmy DNA material, the Official Reporter's DNA material, or the DNA \nmaterial of some of the new interns, take it out, and put it into an \nembryo that has been denuclized, take that DNA material, put it into \nthe embryo, and start the growth that is again taking place so you will \nhave a cloned individual.\n  That is an individual who has exactly the same DNA as somebody else. \nScientists grow it to a certain age, kill the embryo, and take those \nstem cells from that embryo to be used to make an organ, or make brain \ncells, or make something else.\n  These two topics are tied together. It is a gate which shouldn't \nopen.\n  Initially, I think we need to talk about Federal funding in Congress. \nWe need to discuss the issue raised regarding Federal funding of \ndestructive embryonic research. My position is that federally funded \nhuman embryonic stem cell research is illegal, it is immoral, and it is \nunnecessary for where we are and what we know today. We have other \nsolutions that are legal, ethical, moral, and superior to where we are \ngoing with these Federal funds today regarding embryonic stem cell \nresearch and cloning.\n  The issue of destructive embryo research has come into better focus \nover the past few weeks as the new administration prepares to take \ndefinitive action on the Clinton-era guidelines which call the \ndestruction of human embryos for the purposes of subsequent federal \nfunding for the cells that have been derived through the process of \nembryo destruction.\n  Currently, we say, OK. You can't destroy the embryo, but you can use \nwhat is taken from the destruction of\n\n[[Page S6394]]\n\nthat embryo. It would be like saying of the Presiding Officer, you \ncan't kill him, but you can take his heart, you can take his lungs and \nbrain, and his eyes out. And, if you get those, even though somebody \nkills him, that is OK.\n  Well, that doesn't seem to be right to most of us. It certainly \ndoesn't seem to be right to me, nor the Presiding Officer. Yet that is \nwhat is being proposed, and currently taking what applies under the \nClinton-era guidelines which call for the destruction of human embryos \nfor the purpose of subsequent Federal funding for the cells that have \nbeen derived from the process of embryo destruction.\n  During the Presidential campaign, then Governor Bush stated, in \nresponse to a questionnaire, ``I oppose using Federal funds to perform \nfetal tissue research from induced abortions. Taxpayer funds should not \nunderwrite research that involves the destruction of live human \nembryos.''\n  Later, after assuming the Presidency, his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, \nstated that the President, ``would oppose federally funded research for \nexperimentation on embryonic stem cells that require live human embryos \nto be discarded or destroyed.''\n  I would like to applaud the President for his bold and principled \nstand in defense of the most innocent human life. It has never been, \nand it will never be, acceptable to kill one person for the benefit of \nanother--no matter how big, or how promising the purported benefit.\n  Few issues make this point as clearly as the issue of destructive \nembryo research.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, Congress outlawed federal funding \nfor harmful embryo research in 1996 and has maintained that prohibition \never since. The ban is broad-based and specific; funds cannot be used \nfor ``research in which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed, \ndiscarded or knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death.'' The \nintent of Congress is clear--if a research project requires the \ndestruction of human embryos no federal funds should be used for that \nproject.\n  The NIH, during the Clinton administration, published guidelines that \nsought to circumvent this language. At the time, several of my \ncolleagues, and myself, sent a letter to the NIH stating our opposition \nto the guidelines.\n  It read, in part,\n\n       Despite their title, the NIH guidelines do not regulate \n     stem cell research. Rather, they regulate the means by which \n     researchers may obtain and destroy live human embryos in \n     order to receive Federal funds for subsequent stem cell \n     research. Clearly, the destruction of human embryos is an \n     integral part of the contemplated research, in violation of \n     the law.\n\n  That is simply because to get embryonic stem cells you have to kill \nthe embryo. You kill an embryo to ``harvest'' stem cells and use them. \nThis is destructive human embryonic research.\n  The letter that I cited was signed by, among others, Senators Trent \nLott, Don Nickles, John McCain, Michael DeWine, and John Ashcroft.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                 February 4, 2000.\n     Stem Cell Guidelines,\n     NIH Office of Science Policy,\n     Bethesda, MD.\n       To Whom It May Concern: Since 1996 Congress has banned \n     federal funding for ``research in which a human embryo or \n     embryos are destroyed.'' We believe the draft guidelines \n     published December 2 by the National Institutes of Health for \n     ``human pluripotent stem cell research'' do not comply with \n     this law, which we support and which remains in effect.\n       Despite their title, the NIH guidelines do not regulate \n     stem cell research. Rather, they regulate the means by which \n     researchers may obtain and destroy live human embryos in \n     order to receive federal funds for subsequent stem cell \n     research. Clearly, the destruction of human embryos is an \n     integral part of the contemplated research, in violation of \n     the law.\n       Because Congress never intended for the Executive Branch to \n     facilitate destructive embryo research, we urge the National \n     Institutes of Health to withdraw these guidelines as contrary \n     to the law and Congressional intent.\n         Sam Brownback, Pete V. Domenici, Don Nickles, George V. \n           Voinovich, Trent Lott, John Ashcroft, Chuck Hagel, Rick \n           Santorum, Kit Bond, Bob Smith, Rod Grams, John Kyl, \n           Jeff Sessions, Michael B. Enzi, Mike DeWine, Jesse \n           Helms, Tom Harkin, Conrad Burns, Jim Bunning, John \n           McCain.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, in order to provide the justification \nfor the NIH guidelines, the Department of Health and Human Services \nwrote a legal opinion reviewing the ban just mentioned above and \nwhether or not Federal money could be used to conduct research on so-\ncalled human pluripotent stem cells that had been derived from an \nembryo. My conclusion--and that of many of my colleagues--is that this \nresearch is illegal. it is illegal for this reason: the deliberate \nkilling of a human embryo is an essential component of the contemplated \nresearch; and without the destruction of the embryo the proposed \nresearch would be impossible, which brings us to a discussion of the \nmorality of this research.\n  Recently there was a bill introduced, the Stem Cell Research Act of \n2001, seemingly based on the NBAC recommendations, which seeks to allow \nFederal funding for researchers to kill living human embryos.\n  Under this bill federal researchers would be allowed to obtain their \nown supply of living human embryos, which they would then be allowed to \nkill for research purposes.\n  The very act of harvesting cells from live human embryos results in \nthe death of the embryo. Therefore, if enacted, this bill would result \nin the deliberate destruction of human embryos--human life in its most \ninfant stage.\n  This bill even violates current Federal policy on fetal tissue, which \nallows harvesting of tissue only after an abortion was performed for \nother reasons and the unborn child is already dead. Under this bill, \nthe Federal Government will use tax dollars to kill live embryos for \nthe immediate and direct purpose of using their parts for research. Is \nthat something that we want to do? I don't think so.\n  Taxpayer funding of this research is problematic for a variety of \nreasons. First among those concerns is that if Congress were to approve \nthis bill, it would officially declare for the first time in our \nNation's history that Government may exploit and destroy human life for \nits own, or somebody else's purposes. We don't want to go there.\n  Human embryonic stem cell research is also unnecessary.\n  I think there is a point that is lost to many in the broader debate \nabout when human life begins. Where should we protect it, and how do we \nprotect? But the point is that human embryonic stem cell research, and, \nthus, cloning, is also unnecessary.\n  There are legitimate areas of research which are showing more promise \nthan embryonic stem cell research, areas which do not create moral and \nethical difficulties.\n  In the past, Congress has increased funding for NIH. New advances in \nadult stem cell research, being reported almost weekly, show more \npromise than destructive embryo research, and I believe should receive \na significant increase in funding.\n  The Presiding Officer, myself, and everyone else in the room have \nstem cells within us.\n  It has been a discovery within the past couple of years. These stem \ncells reproduce other cells within our body. We have them in our fat \ntissue, our bones, and our brain. These are cells that can now be taken \nout, grown, and they have multiple actions of other material, other \ntissue they can replace. It is very exciting and very promising.\n  It does not have the ethical problems of killing another life and \ndoes not have the immune rejection problems like taking DNA material \nfrom another life and putting it into someone else. It is our own DNA. \nIt is our own material, and it is showing great promise. I want to read \nsome of the significant advances that have taken place in recent times \nin adult stem cell research, which I strongly support, and I support \nour increasing funding in a substantial way for adult stem cell \nresearch.\n  Research has shown the pluripotent nature of adult stem cells. In \nother words, they can have a multitude of options. Research shows the \nability of a single adult bone marrow stem cell to repopulate the bone \nmarrow, forming functional marrow and blood cells, and also \ndifferentiating into functional cells of liver, lung, gastrointestinal \ntract--esophagus, stomach, intestine, colon--and skin, with indications \nit\n\n[[Page S6395]]\n\ncould also form functional heart and skeletal muscle. The evidence \nshows the stem cells home to sites of tissue damage.\n  In other words, these stem cells can go to the place where the damage \nis and start to reproduce and build up the damaged material.\n  This was a May 4, 2001, study that was just released on this \npluripotent nature of adult stem cells. Adult stem cells can repair \ncardiac damage.\n  Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine found adult bone marrow \nstem cells could form functional heart muscle and blood vessels in mice \nwhich had heart damage. They note their results demonstrate the \npotential of adult bone marrow stem cells for heart repair and suggest \na therapeutic strategy that eventually could benefit patients with \nheart attacks. The results also suggest that circulating stem cells may \nnaturally contribute to repair of tissues.\n\n  Also, scientists at Duke University Medical Center showed that adult \nstem cells from a liver could transform into heart tissue when injected \ninto mice. They say, ``Recent evidence suggests that adult-derived stem \ncells, like their embryonic counterparts, are pluripotent. . . .'' They \nhave a multitude of options of this stem cell conforming into bone, \nheart, and other types of tissue, and ``these results demonstrate adult \nliver-derived stem cells respond to the tissue microenvironment. . . \n.''\n  In other words, what is the environment that the tissue is placed \ninto, and that is what it is responding to and developing.\n  Researchers at New York Medical College report results that show \nregeneration of heart muscle is possible after heart attack, possibly \nfrom heart adult stem cell.\n  I have several others I want to read, but one in particular I think \nis interesting is that scientists have found stem cells in our fat. So \nnow we can take fat stem cells, of which we do not have a shortage in \nAmerica, and those adult stem cells can be derived and made into other \ntypes of cells and grown.\n  A new report shows umbilical cord blood can provide effective \ntreatment of various blood disorders in adults. It had previously been \nassumed that there were too few stem cells in cord blood to treat \nadults and only children were treated.\n  The results of this study show that cord blood stem cells can \nproliferate extensively and provide sufficient numbers of cells for \nadult treatments.\n  My point is we do not have to destroy another life to have the great \nsuccess of stem cell work. We can take it out of our own bodies. We can \ntake it out of our own fat and be able to grow these things, and we do \nnot need to go down the route of what is called therapeutic cloning, to \nwhich destructive embryonic stem-cell research is going to lead.\n  In the future, people are going to say they want embryonic stem \ncells, but what they really want is to be able to clone you, to clone \nanother individual, take that DNA material from you, from me, from \nsomebody in this room, destroy a young human embryo, put the DNA \nmaterial in there, start this to reproducing for a while, kill that \nembryo, take the stem cells out, and work with those because they are \nexact copies of the DNA from us. We do not want to open this door of \ngoing the route of cloning, and that is where this is leading.\n  Mr. President, that is why today I have spoken out on this topic. We \nshould not be going this route. We do not need to go this route. It is \nillegal for us currently to go this route. I ask that we stop. This is \na view that I believe the President shares. In fact, in a letter \nwritten to the Culture of Life Foundation, President Bush states:\n\n       I oppose Federal funding for stem-cell research that \n     involves destroying living human embryos.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the President's letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2001.\n     Mr. Robert A. Best,\n     President, The Culture of Life Foundation, Inc., Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Best: Thank you for your letter about the \n     important issue of stem cell research.\n       I share your concern and believe that we can and must do \n     more to find the causes and cures of diseases that affect the \n     lives of too many Americans.\n       That's why I have proposed to double funding for National \n     institutes of Health medical research on important diseases \n     that affect so many American families, such as breast cancer. \n     My proposal represents the largest funding increase in the \n     Institutes' history, I also have called for an extension of \n     the Research and Development tax credit to help encourage \n     companies to continue research into life-saving treatments.\n       I oppose Federal funding for stem-cell research that \n     involves destroying living human embryos. I support \n     innovative medical research on life-threatening and \n     debilitating diseases, including promising research on stem \n     cells from adult tissue.\n       We have the technology to find these cures, and I want to \n     make sure that the resources are available as well. Only \n     through a greater understanding through research will we be \n     able to find cures that will bring new hope and health to \n     millions of Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   George W. Bush.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I fully anticipate that President Bush \nwill settle the issue of Federal funding of embryonic stem cell \nresearch within the context of the existing embryo research ban in the \nvery near future, and I hope we take up the issue of cloning and ban \nit. It is a place we should not and do not need to go. I applaud the \nPresident in advance for his defense, for his clear statement on \ncloning, as well, and his defense of the most innocent human life.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The \n     Environmental Protection Agency\n     (EPA) and [        ] registers pesticides for that use. EPA \n     continues to examine registered pesticides to determine that \n     use of\n\n[[Page S6397]]\n\n     the pesticides in accordance with instructions printed on the \n     label does not pose unreasonable risks to human health and \n     the environment. Nevertheless, EPA cannot guarantee that \n     registered pesticides do not pose risks, and unnecessary \n     exposure to pesticides should be avoided. Based in part on \n     recommendations of a 1993 study by the National Academy of \n     Sciences that reviewed registered pesticides and their \n     potential to cause unreasonable adverse effects on human \n     health, particularly on the health of pregnant women, \n     infants, and children, Congress enacted the Food Quality \n     Protection Act of 1996. That law requires EPA to reevaluate \n     all registered pesticides and new pesticides to measure their \n     safety, taking into account the unique exposures and \n     sensitivity that pregnant women, infants, and children may \n     have to pesticides. EPA review under that law is ongoing.

Mr. President, I rise today to announce a landmark \nagreement regarding the use of pesticides in our Nation's schools. This \nagreement marks the first time that the Federal Government will \ninstitute regulations on pesticides and schoolchildren. The Senate \nunanimously accepted my amendment to the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, which passed in the Senate late last week. For the first \ntime, parents in all fifty States will be notified when pesticides are \nused in schools.\n  This agreement was reached after seven weeks of negotiations between \nmy staff, environmental health groups, a broad coalition of pesticide, \nagriculture, and education groups. It was developed with these various \ngroups to achieve a balance between the need to protect children from \npests and addressing the concerns about the safety of pesticide \napplications.\n  A recent study by the General Accounting Office found that no \ncredible statistics exist regarding the amount of pesticides used in \npublic schools and no information exists about students' exposure to \npesticides or their health impacts. We can and must do a better job of \nproviding accurate information to parents and staff at our Nation's \nschools regarding pesticide use and the potential effects on our \nchildren.\n  This amendment requires local educational agencies and schools to \nimplement a school pest management plan. This plan must incorporate \npest control methods that minimize health and environmental risks in \nschool and around schools. This amendment does not ban any pesticide. \nIt simply states that the area of the pesticide application must remain \nunoccupied during the treatment, and for some pesticides, the area must \nremain unoccupied for up to 24 hours after the treatment.\n  Perhaps the most important component of this amendment is the \nrequirement for schools to provide universal notification to parents \nthree times throughout the year. The universal notice must include a \nsummary of the school pest management plan, a statement about \npesticides, information on how to sign up to be notified prior to all \npesticide applications, notice of pesticides that are exempt from \nnotification requirements, and information on who to contact for \nadditional information regarding pesticide applications at the school. \nThe amendment also gives parents the option of being notified at least \n24 hours in advance of every pesticide application. Between universal \nnotification and this additional notice option, parents will be armed \nwith the knowledge they need to protect their children from potentially \nharmful pesticides when they send them to school. It is an enormous and \nhard fought victory for the health of our children.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators Boxer and Reid for \njoining me in introducing this important amendment. Their strong \nsupport for the protection of our children against exposure to \npesticides was critical to the passage of this amendment. They have \nboth been leaders on this issue for years, and I look forward to their \ncontinued advocacy on behalf of our Nation's children.\n  I extend my thanks to the majority leader, Senator Daschle, for \nworking to address the concerns of all sides. I appreciate the \nwillingness of the managers of the bill, Chairman Kennedy and Senator \nGregg, to have this important issue considered in the context of the \nESEA bill. In addition, I wish to thank the many groups whose support \nthis amendment enjoys, including: Beyond Pesticides/National Coalition \nAgainst the Misuse of Pesticides, the National Pest Management \nAssociation, Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment, American \nCrop Protection Association, Consumer Specialty Products Association, \nChemical Producers and Distributors Association, and the International \nSanitary Supply Association. I also appreciate the support of the New \nJersey Pest Management Association, and the New Jersey Environmental \nFederation. Finally, this amendment would not have been possible \nwithout the work of Joe Fiordaliso of my staff.\n  I look forward to working with members of the conference on ESEA to \nensure that this amendment is included in the final bill, which is \npresented to President Bush.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6398-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6398-S6402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to address in morning business an \nissue, which will be the focus of debate in the Senate for the next 2 \nweeks. Many times our debates in this Chamber are about issues that a \nlot of people across America wonder what can this possibly mean to me, \nmy family, or my future. This debate, believe me, will affect every \nsingle one of us.\n  What we do--whether we pass a law or fail to pass a law--can have a \ndirect impact on everyone witnessing this debate and virtually everyone \nliving in this country. What could that issue possibly be? Health care. \nIt is about whether or not our health insurance will be there when we \nneed it.\n  Yesterday in Springfield, IL, my hometown, I had a press conference. \nI invited three local doctors and two local nurses to talk about health \ncare today. They came and told stories which were chilling, stories of \ntheir efforts to provide quality medical care to the people of my \nhometown and how time and again they ran into roadblocks, obstacles, \nand barriers from HMOs, and other health insurance companies, which \ntried to overrule medical decisions.\n  A cardiologist who came forward said: I brought a person into my \noffice who was complaining of pain, thinking he suffered a heart \nattack. I was prepared to provide emergency care and I did, only to \nlearn that his health insurance company would not pay me because I did \nnot happen to be in their network. This person who showed up at my \noffice, afraid he was going to die, was supposed to read his health \ninsurance policy, look for the appropriate doctor, and make an \nappointment.\n  That is the reality of dealing with HMOs and health insurance \ncompanies today.\n  A lady who is an OB/GYN in my hometown talked about women under her \ncare preparing to deliver a baby who, because the employer of that \nwoman changed health insurance companies, were told in the closing days \nof the pregnancy that she could no longer be treated by her \nobstetrician, but had to go to a new doctor, an approved doctor, \nsomeone who had never seen her during the course of her pregnancy \nsimply because this health insurance company thought it could save a \ndollar by referring this care to a different obstetrician.\n  The cases went on and on and on. Frankly, it should not come as a \nsurprise. We have known for years that HMOs, health maintenance \norganizations, are really cost containment organizations. Their job is \nto reduce the cost of health care. What is secondary in their \nconsideration is really quality medical care that all of us count on \nwhen we go to a doctor or a hospital or rely on a nurse's advice. That \nhas been the casualty in this debate.\n  Yesterday, in Springfield, IL, these health professionals came \nforward. They joined ranks with 500 organizations which have endorsed a \nbill we will begin debating today on the floor of the Senate. Let me \nadd just a postscript to that--I hope we will begin debating it today. \nYesterday we tried to take up this bill, to talk about a Patients' Bill \nof Rights. There was an objection from the Republican side of the \naisle. They wanted more time.\n  I suggest to those who are following this debate, this particular \nissue has been debated for a long time. In 1973, the Health Maintenance \nOrganization Act became law, allowing employers to offer managed care \ninsurance options. That was 28 years ago.\n\n[[Page S6399]]\n\n  In 1995, our current President, then Governor George Bush, vetoed a \nTexas bill providing protection for HMO patients.\n  By 1996, the first Federal law regulating private insurance, this one \nallowing workers to keep coverage when changing their jobs, opened the \ndoor to patients' rights. The battle went on from there.\n  We have known for years that we need to provide patients and their \nfamilies and people working for businesses across America the \nprotection of a Patients' Bill of Rights. What we have before us today, \nwhat we will be debating this week, is a bipartisan Patients' Bill of \nRights. Senator John McCain, a leading Republican, is one of the \nleading sponsors of this bill; Senators Arlen Specter and Lincoln \nChafee also Republicans support the bill as well; and virtually every \nDemocratic Senator. On the House side the same can be said. Republican \nleaders, as well as Democrats, and some 60 Republicans voted for this \nbill when it came up.\n  So this is a bill that has been here for a long time. It is a bill \nthat now has strong bipartisan support, and it has been subjected to a \nlot of give and take and compromise to come up with a reasonable \napproach. Yet still we run into the obstacles that are being presented \nby its opponents, the major opponents, of course, the health \nmaintenance organizations.\n  Why are they opposed to this bill? Why don't they want to create a \nPatients' Bill of Rights? Frankly, they think it is going to cost them \nin terms of their profits. They don't want to give up the rights they \nhave to make life-and-death decisions and overrule doctors and nurses \nto save a buck. That is what this debate comes down to.\n  If you happen to visit Washington, DC, and turn on television, you \nare likely to see their television advertising. These HMOs are going to \ndump millions of dollars into advertising, trying to tell the people \nacross America that giving you the right to have your doctor make a \nmedical decision is not in your best interests, that they are the ones \nwho should be entrusted with our health care, they are the ones who \nshould make the call in life-or-death decisions when it comes to \nmedical treatment, when it comes to prescription drugs that are \nnecessary to sustain your life. They say, frankly, we don't need a \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  That is understandable, because do you know what is at issue here? \nWhat is at issue here is accountability. We just finished 7 weeks of \ndebate about education. The key word in that debate was \n``accountability.'' People should be held accountable, students by \ntests, teachers by the results of those tests, principals--everyone to \nbe held accountable. But when it comes to health care, the HMOs do not \nwant to be held accountable. They believe they should take their \nprofits and not be accountable.\n\n  Let's take a step back and look at the big picture. Who in the United \nStates can be held accountable for their conduct in a court of law? \nFrankly, all of us--every individual, every family, every business--\nwith only two exceptions. There are two special classes in the United \nStates who cannot be brought into court and held accountable for their \nwrongdoing:\n  One, diplomats. You have heard of those cases. Diplomats who come to \nthe United States, get involved in traffic accidents, and race away to \ntheir home country, never having to face a court of law. That happens \nto be part of a treaty. We are stuck with it.\n  What is the second special and privileged class in America that \ncannot be held accountable for its wrongdoing? HMOs, health insurance \ncompanies. That is right. If they make a decision denying you coverage \nand you suffer bodily injury or die as a result of it, the HMO or the \nhealth insurance company cannot be sued. That is why they oppose the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. They want to maintain their special status.\n  The HMOs think they are royalty in this country, that they should be \nabove the law. I disagree with that completely. This bipartisan Patient \nProtection Act protects all patients across America. It doesn't pick \nand choose like the Republican alternative. It says that you should \nhave access to specialists. If your doctor says your son or daughter \nhas cancer and that a pediatric oncologist is the right person for your \nchild, that should be the final word. You should not leave it to some \nbean counter, some accountant, some clerk in an insurance company 100 \nmiles away.\n  It says you should be able to go out of network for a specialist. In \nother words, if the HMO does not have that doctor on the list, that \nshould not be the deciding factor when determining who is the best \ndoctor for your wife or your husband when they are facing a serious \nillness.\n  Care coordination, standing referrals--all of these mean that you can \nget good health.\n  Coverage for clinical trials. Clinical trials are efforts a lot of \npeople get into when they receive a diagnosis of a condition or disease \nthat might otherwise be incurable. They take a drug that is being \ntested by the Food and Drug Administration to see how it might apply to \nyour cancer, your heart disease, your special problem. A lot of \ninsurance companies say: We will not pay for clinical trials, you are \non your own. Well, who can pay for it? Who in their right mind can say \nan average person in an average family in America can pay the tens of \nthousands of dollars necessary for life-or-death treatment in a \nclinical trial?\n  That is what is at issue here; that is what is behind this bill. The \nPatients' Bill of Rights say these insurance companies must cover the \nclinical trials that are necessary to save your life.\n  What about coverage for emergency care? Imagine your son falls out of \na tree in the backyard and breaks his arm while you are visiting \nsomebody, and you race to the nearest hospital only to learn they \ncannot treat you because you don't happen to be on the approved list \nfor your health insurance. Who in the world is going to carry their \nhealth insurance policy around in the glove compartment of their car to \nfind out which is the hospital that the HMO will allow you to go to? \nWhen it comes to emergency care, people should not be second-guessed. \nYou go where you need to go when you are in an emergency situation. You \nshould not have to face some insurance company clerk who is second-\nguessing that.\n\n  Direct access to OB/GYN providers--I mentioned the illustration in \nSpringfield.\n  Access to doctor-prescribed drugs. Do you know what the HMOs do? They \nput down a list of drugs for which they will pay. They pick and choose \nthe ones where they get the deepest discounts from the pharmaceutical \ncompanies. So you come in with a problem and your doctor takes a look \nand says: This is the drug. You need it. Is a breakthrough drug, and it \nis available, and I think I can get it for you. I say: Doctor, is it \nexpensive? And he says it is because it is new, but it is just what you \nneed. Then he says: Will your company cover this? Is it on their \napproved list, their formulary?\n  Sadly, a lot of HMOs have picked a list that doesn't include all the \ngood drugs a doctor can prescribe. The Patients' Bill of Rights says \nthe doctor has the last word. If this is the right drug that can cure \nyour disease and give you a good life, you should not have to get into \na debate or an appeals process with an HMO or a health insurance \ncompany over it.\n  Finally, access to point-of-service plans. We have to make certain \nthat people across America, when they need access to good health care, \nhave it. The HMOs and health insurance companies that put up these \nobstacles should not have the final word.\n  This is the debate we are about to have for the next 2 weeks. This is \nwhat the Senate will focus on. Is there anything more important than \nour health? What would you give up for your health? I don't think \nanyone would give up anything for their health. That is the most \nimportant thing in your life. Now we face an onslaught of opposition \nfrom the HMOs and the health insurance companies that say no to the \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  I salute Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, because he said \nthis at a rally that we just held on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. He \nsaid the Senate will stay in session until we pass a Patients' Bill of \nRights. He has given notice to all of us in the Senate: Put on hold \nyour Fourth of July parades and your picnics back at the ranch. We are \nall talking about staying here and getting the job done.\n  There are going to be fireworks on The Mall, if you want to stick \naround\n\n[[Page S6400]]\n\nhere and you don't want to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. We can look \nout the back window here, skip the parades and picnics, and stay at \nwork until we pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. I guarantee, you may or \nmay not see fireworks on The Mall, but we will see fireworks on the \nfloor of the Senate because the HMOs and health insurance companies are \nnot going to give up easily. They are going to fight us every step of \nthe way.\n  Who are on the different sides in this debate? On one side are 550 \nhealth organizations and consumer organizations, standing for families \nand individuals across America--doctors and nurses and consumer groups.\n  Who is on the other side, opposing our bill? One group, and one group \nonly, the HMOs, the health insurance companies. They know what is at \nstake here. What is at stake is their profit, and they are going to \nfight us tooth and nail to try to stop this bill.\n  I can guarantee this. We are going to fight for a real Patients' Bill \nof Rights, not a bill of goods. We are not going to pass some phony law \nand say to America we have solved your problem. We are going to fight \nand stay here for this fight until we pass it. For everyone who \nwitnesses this debate, I cannot think of a more important topic for us \nto face.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to my colleague from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I have been here this morning listening to the Senator's \nstatement, and of course it is very good and beautiful. But I would \nlike to ask the Senator a couple of questions.\n  We have been working on this bill for years. I have been impressed \nwith a couple of people who have stood out in recent weeks. They are \nRepublicans--one by the name of John McCain and the other by the name \nof Charlie Norwood. They are both Republicans. One is a dentist from \nGeorgia, the other is a Senator from the State of Arizona who, among \nother things, spent 5 or 6 years in a prisoner-of-war camp, most of \nthat time in solitary confinement.\n  The Senator from Illinois and I came with Senator McCain to the House \nof Representatives in 1982. We have long acknowledged his courage; have \nwe not?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. I have been impressed with the courage of Charlie Norwood \nfrom Georgia. Is the Senator from Illinois also impressed?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The fact that he has stood up and announced last Friday \nthat he has tried to work with the HMOs, tried to work with the \nRepublican leadership and with the White House and has virtually given \nup because they, frankly, will not support a real Patients' Bill of \nRights. Congressman Norwood, a Republican, has said he will openly \nsupport the Democrats. If I am not mistaken--perhaps I am--the Senator \nfrom Nevada can correct me--I think every medical doctor in the House \nof Representatives now supports the Democratic approach, the bipartisan \napproach we are offering on the floor.\n  Mr. REID. The reason I asked the Senator this question is that the \nSenator in his chart said it is a bipartisan bill. McCain a Republican, \nEdwards a Democrat from the South, Kennedy a Senator from \nMassachusetts, they are the chief sponsors of this legislation. This is \nbipartisan legislation. We have some courageous people who have said we \nhave had enough of this.\n  This legislation, I have heard the Senator say, is supported by every \nconsumer group in America plus every medical group in America, \nsubspecialty group, specialty group, the American Medical Association, \nand even the lawyers support this. I don't know of a time in the past \nwhere you have the American Medical Association and the trial lawyers \ntogether. Does the Senator know another occasion?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I certainly don't. Usually they fight like cats and dogs. \nWhen it comes to this bill, both sides believe the HMOs and the health \ninsurance companies should not be above the law. They should not be a \nspecial class. They should be held accountable like every other \nAmerican and every other business for their wrongdoing. They should, in \nbeing held accountable, understand when they make life-or-death \ndecisions and they are wrong, they may face a jury of a dozen Americans \nwho will decide whether or not it was fair.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator made reference to the advertisements being paid \nfor by the HMOs. They are running in Washington and all over America. \nWhat they are focusing on is this is a bill that the lawyers want. \nWould the Senator agree with me that those managed care entities that \noppose this legislation are trying to divert attention away from the \nconsumer protections in this bill and making it a lawyer-versus-the-\nrest-of-us piece of legislation?\n  Mr. DURBIN. There is no question about it. I often try to reflect on \nwhether or not the Congress of the United States could have enacted \nSocial Security or Medicare or the Americans with Disabilities Act if \nsome of the most well-financed special interest groups in America \ndecided they wanted to buy large amounts of TV airtime on television of \nAmerica. That is what is happening. They have done it before. They are \ntrying to do it now. They are trying to twist and distort this debate \nto try to undermine the public's sentiment for real change and real \nprotection for patients.\n  They are going to lose because the people of America know stories in \ntheir own family and their neighbor's family. I will share for a \nmoment--I see two of my colleagues coming to the floor--with my \ncolleague from the State of Nevada one of the things I think really \ntells the whole story. You can listen to Senators come and go on the \nfloor of the Senate. We can talk about politics and law and all the \nrest of it. Let me introduce you to a little fellow I met a year or so \nago named Roberto Cortes from Elk Grove Village, IL. This wonderful \nlittle kid is fighting for his life every single day on a respirator.\n\n  His mom and dad are real-life American heroes. They get up every \nmorning and try to make a life for themselves and their family. They \ndedicate every waking moment so this little boy stays alive. This is a \nfight that goes on every minute of every day. If you can imagine, if \nhis respirator stopped he would die, and they know this. They have him \nat home, and they watch him constantly. This is a fight they are \nwilling to take on. They didn't know when they were fighting for \nRoberto's life that they would also have to fight the insurance \ncompanies. His problem is spinal muscular atrophy, a leading genetic \ncause of death in kids under the age of 2.\n  Last year, they sent me an e-mail to talk about the battles they have \nhad with their health insurance company. He needs a drug called Synagus \nto protect him against respiratory infection. Do you know what the \ninsurance company said? No. No. His doctor said, this little boy needs \nthis drug to protect him against an infection when he is on a \nrespirator, and the health insurance company said no.\n  Imagine that for a minute. Imagine that you are battling every single \nday to save this beautiful little boy, and meanwhile you have a health \ninsurance company denying you access to a drug that his doctor says he \nneeds to stay alive. Can it get any worse than that?\n  That is what this debate is all about. Forget all of us in suits and \nties and fancy dresses in the Senate and remember Roberto Cortes of Elk \nGrove Village, IL. Remember his mom and dad. That is what the debate is \nall about.\n  We can't match the health insurance industry when it comes to all the \ntelevision advertising they are buying but, believe me, if I could tell \nRoberto's story to moms and dads across America, I know what would \nhappen when this bill finally comes up for final passage. I thank my \ncolleague from Nevada for joining me.\n  Mr. REID. If I may ask the Senator one more question, I hope Roberto \nis doing OK. Senator Dorgan and I held a hearing in Las Vegas, NV, \nwhere a mother's testimony was not as optimistic. It was sad. She had \nhad dealings with an HMO, and her son is now dead. That was her \ntestimony. Senator Dorgan and I will talk about that more as the debate \ngoes on. The Senator from Illinois is right; the HMOs deal with \npeople's health: Roberto, the boy in Las Vegas, parents, mothers, \nbrothers and sisters. There is nothing that is more devastating than \nhaving someone sick and you can't get what you know needs to be done. \nThat is what the debate is all about.\n  It is about accountability. Are people going to be held to a standard \nthat is\n\n[[Page S6401]]\n\nfair? We are not asking for a standard that is unfair or unreasonable \nor that has not been in place in the past. We are asking to have the \nstandard where a doctor makes a decision as to the care their patient \nreceives and it is not made by some clerk in a room in Baltimore or San \nJose; it is made by that doctor who is taking care of that patient. \nWill the Senator agree?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree, and I thank the Senator from Nevada for joining \nme. I see the Senator from Minnesota is here seeking recognition.\n  Let me say, this is one of the most important debates of the year. \nUntil the Senate leadership changed 2 weeks ago, this bill was buried \nin committee. The health insurance companies had us right where they \nwanted us. They stuck this bill in committee and said: You will not \nhear a national debate about the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a new \nday in the Senate. There is new leadership, and there is a new agenda. \nI am proud of the fact that my party has brought forward as the first \nbill that we will debate a Patients' Bill of Rights. I am proud of it \nbecause I believe that is what we are all about.\n\n  Frankly, on a bipartisan basis with Senator McCain and Congressman \nNorwood and others, we are making this a strong bipartisan fight. It \nisn't a fight so that at the end of the day we can say our party won; \nthis politician won. It is a fight so that at the end of the day \nRoberto Cortes has a chance, and his mom and dad can focus on this \nlittle boy's life and that daily struggle, not a struggle with the \nhealth insurance companies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, if I might add a refrain to what my \ndistinguished colleagues have been talking about, last year I helped \nset up a health care hot line in Minnesota. I started getting a flood \nof calls, just as the Senator from Illinois described, from parents who \nare fighting those same kinds of battles. I don't have pictures here, \nbut I can see them in my mind's eye, the young boys and girls and the \ngrieving families, fighting families who are trying to deal with the \ntragedy of their lives and have heaped on them the further tragedy of \nHMOs or insurance companies not providing or not paying for the care. \nSuddenly they are incurring tens of thousands of dollars of debt, in \naddition to God-awful personal losses.\n  So I certainly rise in support of the legislation. I agree with the \nSenator from Illinois that the change in the leadership of this body--\nthe now-majority leader and assistant majority leader are making the \ndifference in this legislation coming to the Senate floor. I hope we \ncan commence debate on it today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise on this first day of \nconsideration of the Patients' Bill of Rights to say that this is a \nglorious day, that finally, after a 5-year wait, the Senate can take up \nthis important legislation.\n  It is my hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \nnot block this legislation, as has been rumored all over the Capitol \ntoday. We have heard that there will be all kinds of efforts to delay \nand distract.\n  This issue is way too important for this country to withstand such \npotentially dilatory tactics. Indeed, the people of this country \nembrace patient protection and they embrace it in a bipartisan and, \nindeed, a nonpartisan fashion.\n  What does this bill do? It simply addresses a grievous wrong under \nAmerican law. Currently, health care providers are held accountable for \ntheir mistakes and their malpractice, save for one type of health care \nprovider--an insurance entity known as a health maintenance \norganization.\n  An HMO is exempt under the law. So this Patients' Bill of Rights \nbrings to the floor of this Senate the opportunity to change the law so \nthat HMOs are held accountable for their grievous mistakes. This is \njust common sense and clearly, a standard of fairness. This is why we \nare seeing wide acceptance of the principles of this legislation \nreflected in the polls all over this country.\n  Now let's not be deceived. Those who want to torpedo this legislation \nsay that they support a Patients' Bill of Rights, and then they get all \nmired in the discussion of the technical details. But it is clear cut: \nEither you are for the patient or for the HMO when it comes down to the \nquestion of accountability for grievous mistakes.\n  Now there has, in the course of this discussion, arisen a very \nlegitimate concern. HMOs are a major provider of insurance for \nemployers. Therefore, an employer is quite concerned that they might \nhave some liability because they engage the particular HMO as their \ninsurance company. So, quite naturally, an employer does not want to \nhave joint liability with an HMO that has perpetrated some grievous \nmalpractice.\n  In this bipartisan legislation offered by Senators McCain, Edwards, \nand Kennedy, there is protection for the employer, and the employer \nwould only be liable if the employer had participated in that grievous \nmalpractice.\n  So as that issue arises, particularly among the business community, \nwhich legitimately ought to be concerned with that issue, don't be \ndeceived, because you are protected. As we get into the discussion of \nthis legislation, let's remember what this is all about. You are either \nfor protecting patients or you are for the status quo, which protects \nHMOs. Current law states that an HMO cannot be sued for any grievous \nwrongs, whereas a physician, a nurse, a hospital, or any other health \ncare provider who commits a grievous wrong against a patient can be \nheld accountable.\n  So it is a stark choice: Do you want to protect the patients, or do \nyou want to protect HMOs? You will get all the other arguments about \nwhether or not this is going to increase the cost to patients. There \nwill be some increase, but often as we consider the formulation of law, \nwe have to consider the tradeoffs. Is this protection of a patient's \nright worth the tradeoff of a small--a very small--increase in the \ncost? Eighty percent of the American people clearly say they want the \nrights of a patient protected.\n  I am glad that we finally have this issue before us.\n  One of the greatest experiences in my professional life and a great \nhonor for me was having served for the last 6 years as the elected \ninsurance commissioner of the State of Florida. In that capacity, I \ndealt weekly with insurance companies, health insurance rates, and what \nit took to keep those insurance companies and HMOs financially viable, \nwhile at the same time being able to protect patients' rights.\n  I see this discussion of a Patients' Bill of Rights as the tip of an \niceberg in a discussion of the overall reform of the entire health care \ndelivery system. Ultimately, this will become a discussion of the \nreform of the Medicare system in this country. I hope and have clearly \nhad assurances from our great assistant majority leader, the Senator \nfrom Nevada, and our great leader, the Senator from South Dakota, that \nwe are going to take up Medicare reform later this year.\n  We have a great opportunity for taking the first steps addressing the \ncomprehensive question of health care reform and health insurance \nreform that will ultimately address the fact that 44 million people in \nthis country do not have health insurance, 2\\1/2\\ million of these \npeople are in my own State of Florida. Clearly, they get health care. \nThey often get it at the most expensive place, which is the emergency \nroom, and at the most expensive time when the sniffles have turned into \npneumonia. But that is a discussion for another day.\n  The discussion, however, starts today along the long, tortuous road \nof health care reform with a most important first step; that is, \nenacting a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I am proud to come to the floor and be able to address this. I intend \nto speak out on this important issue again and again over the course of \nthe next several days, and the next couple of weeks, until we pass this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6402]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, the Senate will begin serious \nconsideration of one of the most important issues for every family in \nAmerica--genuine protections for patients in managed care plans. As \nmany of my colleagues know, this issue has been one of my top \npriorities for a very long time and I am very pleased that real debate \nhas begun on the McCain, Edwards, Kennedy bill--a bipartisan compromise \nfor a meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  It is important to note that there has been a tremendous amount of \nwork done to get to this point. This truly is a compromise. It is truly \nbipartisan. I congratulate my colleagues for working so hard. I am very \nproud to be one of the cosponsors of this bill.\n  I strongly believe that every person has a right to affordable \nquality health care. Whether we are talking about access to nursing \nhomes, prescription drugs for seniors, or the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nI have fought to improve health care for every American.\n  As we start this debate, I remind all of my colleagues that this \ndebate is about real people and their real experiences with HMOs.\n  We have not made this up. This is about real people who have come to \nus who have expressed concerns. They paid for health care. They assumed \nthat their families would have it when they needed it. Too many people \nfind out that when it is time for that care to be given, whether it is \nin an emergency room, whether it is a doctor recommending a form of \ntreatment, they are not able to receive it for their family. It is not \nright. That is why we are here.\n  I want to share one story today about a young woman named Jessica and \nher family in Royal Oak, MI. Jessica's story is one example of many of \nwhy we need to pass these important patient protections.\n  I am proud to have worked with this family, speaking on behalf of \nfamilies all over this country.\n  Jessica was born in 1975 with a rare metabolic disorder that required \nvigilant medical care. Unfortunately, her disorder was not curable and \nshe passed away September 10, 1999.\n  During the last year of her life, Jessica's health insurance changed. \nHer family doctor, who had been treating her all of her life, was not \ncovered by the new HMO that she was forced into, and Jessica had to \nseek treatment through another physician. Her disease, however, was so \ncomplex that she and her family could not find a new doctor with the \nHMO.\n  Mrs. Luker talks about going name by name, page by page, and book by \nbook through all of the physicians in the HMO, and none of them were \nwilling to treat Jessica.\n  As her mother said, when Jessica's family should have been spending \nprecious time--she used to like to sit on the porch and read books and \nblow bubbles--with Jessica in her final year of life, they were forced \nto spend countless hours fighting with the HMO bureaucrats about her \ncare.\n  Jessica's insurance plan was changed just days before she was \nadmitted to the hospital for surgery. After months of trying to figure \nout what to do about her seizures--she had 60 seizures in a row--her \nfamily worked with the doctor who had been treating her. This is prior \nto the change. They said she needed an operation. It was scheduled for \nMay 12 of 1999. Unfortunately, her insurance changed to the HMO on May \n1 without their knowledge. She had the operation on May 12.\n  On May 17, they got a notice that the insurance had changed and they \nwouldn't cover it because she didn't have preauthorization.\n  This is not a new story. We hear story after story about people who \nfind themselves in situations where they didn't have preauthorization \nfor things that were beyond their knowledge at the time.\n  Unfortunately, to this day, that surgery was not paid for, and the \nLukers are paying for that themselves, while at the same time after \nthey found out that she had the HMO, they would not allow her doctor of \n14 years to treat her--and in her final year of life.\n  Jessica's story demonstrates why we need patient protections. We must \nmake sure when our families have insurance and believe the health care \nwill be there when their families need it that they can count on that \nto happen; that they are not fighting about what day they got a notice \nabout a change in the insurance; or they are not fighting about their \ndoctor who has been treating a family member for years not being able \nto continue because they do not fit into the list of the HMO.\n  This is just one example. I have heard stories throughout Michigan. \nBut today we have an opportunity to begin the process to change it.\n  When I came to Washington as a United States Senator from Michigan, I \nbrought a picture of Jessica. The picture is sitting on my desk in my \noffice in the Hart Building. That picture is going to remain there \nuntil we pass this bill. This bill is for Jessica and every person who \nhas ever needed care and been denied it by an HMO.\n\n  This picture I want to be able to take down pretty soon. It has been \nthere long enough. Families have had to fight long enough. I am looking \nforward to the day when I can give that picture back to Mr. and Mrs. \nLuker and say: We did it.\n  Today we can begin that process. Let's not fight about all the \nvarious wranglings of the internal politics of this body. Let's keep \nour focus on the Jessicas and on the families of this country. If we do \nthe right thing, everybody will be able to celebrate that we have \ncreated the important patient protections that our families in this \ncountry need.\n  I yield back, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nNevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6402-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6402-S6403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID. My understanding is that the hour of morning business is \nnow terminated; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this is an important day--and one that \nhas been a long, long time coming.\n  It has been nearly 5 years since President Clinton, at the time, \nappointed an independent panel of health care experts and asked them to \ncome up with a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  It has been more than 4 years since President Clinton urged Congress \nto pass a Patients' Bill of Rights reflecting the panel's \nrecommendations.\n  It has been more than 3 years since the first bipartisan Patients' \nBill of Rights was introduced in the House.\n  And, it has been nearly 2 years since the last time we debated a real \nPatients' Bill of Rights here in the Senate.\n  We have talked long enough. There is only one thing left to do. We \nneed to pass a real, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights now.\n  The reason we are debating this bill is because so many people--\ninside and outside of Congress--refused to give up. I especially want \nto thank the Senate sponsors: my colleague, Senator Kennedy, who has \nspent his entire adult life--nearly 40 years--working to improve health \ncare for all Americans; my colleague, Senator John Edwards, who has \nplayed an indispensable role in finding an honest, honorable middle \nground on the difficult question of liability; and my colleague, \nSenator John McCain, for having the courage--once again--to disregard \nparty labels and challenge the special interests in order to change \nwhat needs to be changed.\n  This bill matters--deeply matters--to America's families. More than \n70 percent of all Americans with insurance and 80 percent of all \nAmericans who get their insurance on the job--are now in some kind of \nmanaged care program. To them, this isn't a political issue; it can be \na life-or-death issue.\n  This bill ensures that doctors, not insurance companies, make medical \ndecisions. It guarantees patients the right\n\n[[Page S6403]]\n\nto hear all of their treatment options--not just the cheapest ones. It \nsays you have the right to go to the nearest emergency room when you \nneed emergency care. It guarantees you the right to see a specialist if \nyou need one. It gives women the right to see an OB-GYN without having \nto see another doctor first to get permission. And it guarantees that \nparents can choose a pediatrician as their child's primary care \nprovider, if they need one.\n  But rights without remedies are no rights at all. That is why our \nbill guarantees people the right to appeal decisions by their HMO to an \nindependent review board, and to get a timely response. Finally, if the \nHMO ignores the review board, our bill allows people to hold HMOs \naccountable--the same way doctors and employers, and everyone else in \nAmerica is held accountable for their actions. The 85 million Americans \nenrolled in Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal health programs \nalready have each of the protections in our bill. So does every Member \nof this Senate.\n  Our bill extends them to all privately insured Americans--no matter \nwhat State they live in, or what insurance plan their employers choose.\n  Opponents claim that guaranteeing these rights will cost too \nmuch. They say people will lose their insurance because insurance \npremiums will go through the roof. But the facts show otherwise. \nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, our bill \nwould increase employee premiums an average of about $1.20 a month for \nreal rights that can be enforced--$1.20 a month.\n\n  Many things have changed since the first time this Senate passed a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. The bill itself has changed. We started with \na bipartisan compromise: the Norwood-Dingell Patients' Bill of Rights. \nThis bill is a bipartisan compromise on a bipartisan compromise.\n  One of the most important compromises concerns liability. This bill \nsays very clearly that employers cannot be held liable unless they \nparticipate directly in a decision to deny health care. The only \nemployers who can be held liable are the small fraction of companies \nthat are large enough to run their own health care plans--less than 5 \npercent of all American businesses. Small businesses never make \ntreatment decisions, so they would never be sued.\n  We have also compromised on where people can seek justice. Instead of \nallowing all disputes to be heard in State courts, this bill says \ndisputes about administrative questions should be heard in Federal \ncourts. Only cases involving medical decisions should go to State \ncourts--just like doctors who make medical decisions.\n  Support for a Patients' Bill of Rights has grown--inside and outside \nof Congress. In the Senate, we have Senators McCain, Edwards, and \nKennedy. In the House, we have Congressman John Dingell and two \nconservative Republicans, Charlie Norwood and Greg Ganske. Outside of \nCongress, 85 percent of all people surveyed--and 79 percent of \nRepublicans--support the protections in this plan, and so do more than \n500 major health care, consumer and patient-advocate groups all across \nthe country.\n  There has been one other significant change since the first time we \ndebated a Patients' Bill of Rights. Before, we could only guess what \nwould happen if people were able to hold HMOs accountable. Now we know. \nTexas and California have both passed Patients' Bills of Rights.\n  Texas passed its law in 1997. In nearly 4 years, 17 lawsuits have \nbeen filed--about five a year. In the last 6 months since California \npassed its law, 200 disputes have gone through the independent appeals \nprocess. None--not one--has gone to court. And two-thirds of the \ndisputes were resolved in favor of the HMO. Experience from the two \nlargest States--the two best laboratories--show that the scare tactics \nused by opponents of this bill are simply that: scare tactics.\n  There are some important things that have not changed in the years \nsince we started this debate. Americans are still being hurt by our \ninaction. Every day that we delay passing a real Patients' Bill of \nRights, 35,000 Americans are denied access to specialty care--and \n10,000 doctors; see patients who have been harmed because an insurer \nrefused to pay for a diagnostic test.\n  Despite the growing support inside and outside of Congress, we still \nface formidable opposition from the special interests.\n  HMOs and their allies reportedly are spending $15 million on ads to \ntry to kill this bill this week. We welcome an honest and open debate \non the issues. We hope opponents will resist the temptation to kill \nthis bill by loading it up with amendments that make passage difficult.\n  Our hope is that this debate will be like the one we had not long ago \non another important reform--campaign finance reform. In fact, I have \npersonally suggested to Senator Lott that we take up this bill under \nthe exact same understanding that we took up campaign finance reform; \nthat we have a good debate on amendments; that we offer the motion to \ntable, if that would be offered; if it is not tabled, that it be \nsubject to second degrees. I think it worked as well on the campaign \nfinance reform as any bill I have recently had the opportunity to \nconsider, and I hope we can do the same thing for the Patients' Bill of \nRights. I am hopeful our Republican colleagues will agree to that this \nafternoon.\n  There is one more important change that has occurred since the first \ntime we debated a Patients' Bill of Rights. We now have a new \nPresident. Members of his staff have said President Bush will veto our \nbill if this bill makes it to his desk. We remain hopeful that the \nPresident will decide to join us once he hears the debate and sees what \nour bill actually does.\n  In the second Presidential debate, then-Governor Bush said:\n\n       It's time for our nation to come together and do what's \n     right for people. . . . It's time to pass a national \n     Patients' Bill of Rights.\n\n  We agree. The American people have been waiting too long. Working \ntogether in good faith we can end this wait and pass a real Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  I announce to all of my colleagues that it is my intention to stay on \nthis bill for whatever length of time it takes. Obviously, we have this \nweek and next week that are full weeks for consideration of the bill. \nMy expectation is that if we finish the bill a week from this Thursday \nnight, there would not be a session on Friday preceding the recess.\n  If we are not finished Thursday night, we will then debate the bill \nand continue to work on it Friday, Saturday, Sunday. We will not have a \nsession on the Fourth of July, but we will pick up again on July 5 and \ngo on as long as it takes. We will finish this bill. It is also my \nexpectation that if we finish this bill in time, I would be inclined to \nbring up the supplemental appropriations bill following the completion \nof the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Those two pieces of legislation are bills I have already indicated to \nthe Republican leader would be my hope that we could complete before \nthe July 4th recess. In fact, it is my expectation and absolute \ndetermination to finish at least in regard to the Patients' Bill of \nRights. We will see what happens with regard to the supplemental in the \nHouse and here in the committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6403-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6403-S6415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          BIPARTISAN PATIENT PROTECTION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 75, S. 1052, the \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I now move to proceed to S. 1052.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is debatable.\n  The Majority Leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I regret we are not in a position to \nbegin consideration of this important legislation at this time. I \nremain hopeful that by the end of the day we will be able to do so. In \nthe event that the Senate cannot proceed to the bill today, it is my \nintention to file cloture on the motion. Under the rules, this cloture \nvote would occur on Thursday morning 1 hour after the Senate convenes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S6404]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reiterate my support for the majority \nleader's unanimous-consent request. I believe it is fair and also \ncrucial for allowing us to finally engage in a real and meaningful \ndebate that will get Americans the protections they need and want.\n  This unanimous-consent request is exactly along the lines of that \nwhich governed the campaign finance reform debate. Most Americans, no \nmatter how they felt on that issue, believed that it was a fair, open, \nand honest debate in which the issues were ventilated and the majority \nof the Senate worked its will. That is how most Americans think we \nshould function and, unfortunately, all too often we do not.\n  Under this unanimous-consent agreement, unlimited amendments can be \noffered, and each one will be provided a significant period of time, 2 \nhours, and after debate the amendment would be voted on by the full \nSenate.\n  I am struggling to understand why we can't agree that this is not \nonly a fair proposal but truly it affords each and every one of us with \nan opportunity for engaging in a free and spirited debate. This format \nembodies the full spirit of the traditional Senate and should not be \nignored or misconstrued as anything but a reasonable and honest \nproposal.\n  I think Americans are watching us to see if we can come together on \nan issue of great importance to everyone across our Nation. I don't \nthink delay is warranted. We should not obstruct.\n  I am confident that engaging in a truly open debate on this issue, \nwithout stringent time restraints or limits on amendments, will result \nin the passage of a strong bipartisan patients' protection bill that \ncan be signed into law by President Bush.\n\n  I want to reiterate, it is my sincere and profound commitment to see \nthat we enact a bill that the President of the United States can sign. \nIt would serve no one's purpose to go through the debate and amending \nprocess in the Senate and in the other body and conference and then \nhave a bill the President will not sign.\n  I will make a couple of additional comments. There has been some \ndebate as to who supports and who does not support this legislation. I \nhave a list of over 300 organizations that are in support of this \nlegislation--not only the nurses and doctors of America but traditional \nconsumer advocacy groups, including health groups such as the American \nCancer Society, the American Dental Association, the American Nurses \nAssociation, a long list of organizations that have traditionally \nadvocated for the health of Americans either in a specialized or \ngeneral way.\n  We have a clear division here between the health maintenance \norganizations, which according to a CNN USA Today poll enjoy the \napproval of some 15 percent of the American people, and the nurses and \ndoctors and those who are required to and do commit their lives to \ntaking care of the health of our citizens.\n  I have been asked many times why is it that I am involved in this \nissue, why is it that I have worked very hard to try to fashion a \nbipartisan agreement that we could use as a base for amending and \nperfecting a bill that we can have signed by the President. In my \nPresidential campaign, in hundreds of town hall meetings attended by \nthousands and thousands of Americans, time after time after time after \ntime, average citizens stood up and talked about the fact that they \nhave been denied reasonable and fair health care and attention they \nbelieve they deserve and need.\n  This is an issue of importance to some 170 million Americans who \nwould be covered by this legislation. This is an issue to average \nAmericans who are members of health maintenance organizations. This is \na challenge and a problem.\n  These Americans want the decisions made by a doctor and not an \naccountant. These Americans want and need and deserve a review process \nthat is fair. These Americans are not receiving the fundamental health \ncare they deserve as members of health maintenance organizations and, \nfrankly, that is available to other Americans who have larger incomes.\n  Mr. President, this is not something we should delay any longer. This \nis an issue we should take up and address, amend, debate, and then come \nto a reasonable conclusion. I want to repeat my commitment to working \nwith the White House, to working with all opponents of the legislation \nin its present form. For us to do nothing, as has been the case over \nthe last several years, as time after time this issue has been brought \nup and blocked through parliamentary procedures, is not fair. It is not \nfair and honest to the American people to refuse to address the issue.\n  As I said with campaign finance reform, if the result of the debates \nand amendments is not to my liking and I don't agree with the result, I \nwill respectfully vote against it. But I will not try to block it. I \nhope Members on both sides of the aisle will make that commitment as \nwell because of the importance of the issue to the American people. It \ndeserves a full and complete debate and vote.\n  I want to work together with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. We have had meaningful negotiations. We have had good \ndiscussions. As a result of amendments, we will have further \ndiscussions. I hope that over time we will be able to reach an \nagreement. I again express my support for the unanimous consent request \nthe majority leader propounded because I think it is a fair and honest \nway, providing no advantage to either side on this debate.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their commitment and involvement in \nthis issue, but most of all I want to thank these 300-some \norganizations--the nurses and the doctors of America, in particular--\nwho have committed themselves to addressing this issue so that all \nAmericans can receive the health care they deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of organizations supporting the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nProfessional Groups and Grassroots Organizations Supporting the McCain-\n      Edwards-Kennedy Bill--The Bipartisan Patient Protection Act\n\n       Abbott House of Irvington, NY;

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks I be followed by Senator Kennedy, who is also \na sponsor of this legislation.\n\n[[Page S6407]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona, who \nworked with me over a period of many months to help put together this \nlegislation--after work had been done for many years by a number of \nMembers of the Senate, led by Senator Kennedy.\n  The law for many years in this country has been on the side of big \nHMOs and insurance companies. They have been treated like no other \nperson in America is treated, like no other business, small or large; \nthey are privileged citizens. The American people want to take away \nthat privileged status from HMOs and insurance companies. They are the \nonly group in America that can say to a family: Your child is not going \nto get the medical care your doctor thinks they need.\n  They can overrule the decision of a medical doctor that has been made \nafter many years of training and experience, even though they may have \nno experience or training whatsoever. Some young clerk sitting behind a \ndesk somewhere can overrule a medical expert, and if they do it, there \nis absolutely nothing that can be done about it.\n  The HMOs, the insurance companies, are accountable to no one. Their \njudgment can't be questioned; their decision can't be reversed; and \nthey can't be challenged anyplace, including in court.\n  That is what this bill is about. What we are about--Senator McCain, \nSenator Kennedy, I, and all of the sponsors of this legislation--is \nchanging the law. We want to move the law from the side of big \ninsurance companies and HMOs and finally put the law on the side of \npatients, nurses, and doctors.\n  Every one of us, in traveling around our home States, has heard \nhorror story after horror story of families and patients being run over \nby big HMOs. Let me recount one I heard in North Carolina.\n  A young man, Steve Grissom, contracted leukemia. In the course of his \ntreatment, he had to get a blood transfusion. As part of the blood \ntransfusion, he got AIDS. He got sicker and sicker and sicker. He was \nbeing seen by a heart specialist at Duke University Hospital. That \ndoctor prescribed 24-hour-a-day oxygen for Steve because he needed it. \nThis was a doctor with many years of training at one of the leading \nmedical institutions in the country. Steve's wife's employer changed \nHMOs. Some clerk sitting behind a desk somewhere, without medical \ntraining, having never seen Steve Grissom, knowing nothing about it, \ndecided they weren't going to pay for this oxygen anymore. They \nliterally cut off his oxygen.\n  Steve had nowhere to go. Why? Because under the law of the land, as \nwe stand here today, HMOs can do exactly what they did to Steve \nGrissom, and no one can do a single thing about it. You can't question \ntheir decision; you can't question their judgment; you can't reverse \nit; and you can't take them to court. So somebody such as Steve, who \nhas a terrible time trying to pay for this oxygen himself, is stuck--\neven though they have paid premiums and paid for coverage, and any \nreasonable physician in America knows he needs this care.\n  That is what this act is about. The Bipartisan Patient Protection Act \nchanges that. We are going to change the law so that finally patients, \nnurses, doctors, and health care providers who know how to make these \nmedical decisions and families who are involved and whose children are \nbeing affected by these decisions will have some power of the law on \ntheir side.\n  Let me talk briefly about some specifics of our legislation. We \nprovide and guarantee access by women to OB/GYNs as their primary care \nprovider. They don't have to get permission from anybody. They can do \nthat. If a child needs to see a specialist, a pediatrician--a child \nwith cancer who may need to be seen by a pediatric oncologist--that \nchild has an absolute right to go see that specialist if they need it \nfor their life-sustaining care.\n  Emergency room care. If a patient or a family experiences an \nemergency and they need to get to the doctor, to the hospital, to the \nemergency room, they don't have to call a 1-800 number; they don't have \nto call the HMO; they don't have to get written permission. What any \nfamily will do when under an emergency situation such as that and they \nneed care quickly, quality care, they can go straight to the nearest \nemergency room without worrying about whether the HMO will cover. Under \nour law, they are covered, period.\n  Scope. Our bill specifically provides that every American who has \nhealth insurance or HMO coverage is covered by our bill, period. They \nhave at least the protections provided in this bipartisan legislation. \nIf a State has better protections for the patient, better protections \nfor the doctor, those protections stay in place. But our bill provides \na floor below which no State can go.\n  So the basic protections provided in our bill--access to specialists, \nwomen being able to go see an OB/GYN, going to the nearest emergency \nroom, access to clinical trials, which is critical to many Americans--\nthey will have under this legislation an absolute right to those \nprotections.\n  Finally, accountability. Mr. President, these rights mean nothing if \nthey are not enforceable. If they are not enforceable, this is not a \nPatients' Bill of ``Rights;'' it is a patients' bill of \n``suggestions.'' But because we have accountability and we have \nenforceability, these are substantive rights that in fact can be \nenforced. Finally, HMOs are going to be treated as everybody else in \nAmerica. They are going to be held accountable, held responsible, which \nmeans at the outset that they have an incentive to do the right thing, \nwhich is what this legislation is about--having the HMO do the right \nthing from the beginning and having the patient, if they don't, be able \nto do something about it.\n  What we do is set up a system that is designed to avoid lawsuits. We \nhave, first, an internal review process so that if the HMO says they \nare not going to cover a particular kind of care or treatment, the \npatient can go through an internal review at the HMO. Second, if that \nprocess is unsuccessful, the patient can then go to an independent \nexternal review. This is a panel of doctors, health care providers, who \naren't connected to the HMO, aren't connected to the patient or the \ntreating doctor, who can make a fair and objective decision about \nwhether this treatment is necessary. So the patient now has two \ndifferent ways to get the HMO's decision reversed.\n  If that is unsuccessful, if for whatever reason the appeals process \ndoes not work, as a last resort, if the patient has been unsuccessful \nafter doing all of that and if the patient has been injured as a result \nof what the HMO did, then as a matter of last resort the patient can go \nto court.\n  Now, first of all, with respect to employers, we specifically provide \nthat employers cannot be held responsible. They cannot be sued; they \ncannot be liable. Employers are specifically protected under our bill. \nThe only exception to that is if the employer actually makes a medical \ndecision--if they step into the shoes of the HMO and do what no small \nor medium-sized employer in America would do if they actually make a \nmedical judgment.\n  By the way, this provision that employers can only be held \nresponsible if they make a medical decision and otherwise they are \nprotected is identical to President Bush's principle on this issue. His \nprinciple provides that employers may only be held responsible if they \nmake medical decisions. That is precisely what our bill does.\n  On this issue, the protection of employers, the President's \nprinciples and our bill are exactly the same.\n  If it becomes necessary after a patient has gone through the appeals \nprocess--internal and external review--and a patient has been injured \nfor the case to go to court, we start with a very simple principle. \nThat principle is this: We want to treat HMOs and insurance companies \njust as the other health care providers. They are making health care \ndecisions. They have decided to overrule a doctor who decided a patient \nneeded a particular kind of care. When they decide to overrule the \ndoctor and step into the shoes of the doctor, we think they ought to be \ntreated like the doctor, just like the hospitals, just like the nurses.\n  What we provide is they can be taken to State court, just like the \ndoctors, just like the hospitals, and they are subject to whatever \nlimitations exist under State law by way of recovery.\n\n[[Page S6408]]\n\n  The majority of the States in this country have caps or limits on \nrecovery, limits on noneconomic damages, in some cases, what is called \npain and suffering, limits on punitive damages, and some States provide \nyou cannot recover punitive damages.\n  The bottom line is this: Whatever the State law is, that law applies \nto the HMO, just exactly as it applies to the doctor, to the nurse, to \nthe hospital, to everybody else in the State. We start with the basic \nidea that HMOs are not privileged citizens; that they are just the same \nas the rest of us and ought to be treated the same as the rest of us. \nThat is what our bill does: It treats the HMOs the same as the other \nhealth care providers when they, in fact, overrule a doctor and make a \nhealth care decision.\n  That structure--sending those cases to State court--is what has been \nrecommended by the Judicial Conference of the United States headed by \nChief Justice Rehnquist. It is what is recommended by the American Bar \nAssociation. It is what is recommended by the State attorneys general.\n  People who understand the court system but are objective, not on one \nside or the other of this debate, have decided this is the place these \ncases should go for a variety of reasons. No. 1, it treats the HMOs the \nsame as doctors and hospitals are treated. No. 2, they are courts \naccustomed to handling these types of cases. It makes it more likely \nthe patient can get their case heard more quickly.\n  It is fair. It is equitable. It is supported by every group of \nobjective experts--Judicial Conference, the ABA, the State attorneys \ngeneral--and, by the way, follows exactly the outline set forth by the \nU.S. Supreme Court in the Pegram decision.\n  This idea of sending these cases to State court is an idea that is \nsupported by the big legal organizations across the country and as \noutlined by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Pegram case.\n  The basic principle is we treat HMOs exactly the same way we treat \ndoctors and hospitals if they are going to be in the business of making \nmedical decisions.\n  The only cases that would go to Federal court under this bill are the \ncases that have, since 1974, been decided in Federal court. Those are \nthe cases involving pure language of the contract. For example, whether \na particular provision has been met or whether the 90-day waiting \nperiod has been met. Those cases go to Federal court. They have always \nbeen in Federal court. We leave them exactly where they are.\n  What we do not do is what has been proposed by some, which is to send \nevery case against an HMO to Federal court. The Federal courts are \nbacklogged so that is a way to bury the cases and assure they never get \nheard. It is more difficult to get attorneys because many attorneys do \nnot practice in Federal court, and many people are a long way from the \nnearest Federal courthouse. There is almost always a State courthouse \nclose by, but Federal courthouses, especially in rural America, are \nhundreds of miles away in many cases.\n  We have a system that works. It has been outlined by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. It is what legal experts say should be done. Most importantly, \nit is fair. It treats the HMOs the same as everybody else, which is the \ngoal of this legislation.\n  Finally, we do require, in order for a case to be brought to court, \nthat, first, all appeals be exhausted. That is, the patient must first \ngo to the internal review and, second, to the external review. What we \nhave learned from the two States that have served as models for this \nlegislation--Texas and California--is almost all cases are resolved by \nthat process. The reason is we structured the bill to avoid lawsuits. \nIt has, in fact, worked in the two States that have followed our \nmodel--California and Texas, two of the biggest States in the country, \ntwo of the States where there has been historically the largest amount \nof litigation in the country.\n  There have been 16, 17 lawsuits since those bills have been enacted \nin those two States. The vast majority of cases have been resolved \nexactly as our bill provides. They have been resolved through the \nprocess of the appeal.\n  There has been some argument made about health care costs going up \nand people losing their insurance. The majority leader spoke to this \nearlier. Our bill, according to the Congressional Budget Office, raises \ninsurance premiums about 4 percent over 5 years. Not 4 percent \nannually, 4 percent over 5 years.\n  The competing bill, the Frist-Breaux provision, raises insurance \npremiums about 3 percent over 5 years. So there is very little \ndifference between the two bills.\n  In addition to that, of the 4 percent increase in our bill, the vast \nmajority of that has to do with better health care. It has nothing to \ndo with lawsuits, nothing to do with litigation.\n  Mr. President, .8 percent, less than 1 percent, has to do with \nlitigation. The remainder, over 3 percent, has to do with better access \nto the clinical trials, better access to specialists, better access to \nemergency rooms.\n  It specifically provides better care. When people get better care, it \ncosts a little bit more, and they will get a better product.\n  On balance, both bills increase costs slightly--3 percent in 1 case \nover 5 years; 4 percent in our case over 5 years. But as a direct \nresult of this legislation being passed, people will have better \nquality care, and the cost has very little to do with the fact the HMOs \ncan now be held accountable and be taken to court.\n  It is not an accident that the American Medical Association and over \n300 health care and consumer groups in America support our bill. It is \nnot an accident that the big HMOs and their lobby are spending millions \nof dollars to defeat our bill. It is not an accident that the HMOs like \nthe Frist-Breaux bill and do not like our bill.\n  As we go through this debate, it will become clear that on every \nsingle difference, between the legislation we have offered and the \ncompeting legislation, whether it is coverage and whether States can \nopt out, whether it is access to specialists outside the plan, whether \nit is a truly independent review that the HMO can have no control over, \nwhether it is going to court and which court you go to, in every single \ndifference we protect the patients, they protect the HMOs.\n  Their bill, as Dr. Norwood, a Republican House Member from Georgia \nwho has fought on this issue for years, has described it, is an HMO \nprotection act. It is not an accident that all the health care groups \nin America and the American Medical Association support our bill.\n  These are people who deal with these issues every single day, and \nthey know that on all these important issues--access to specialists, \nwho is covered, emergency room, access to a true independent review \nprocess--our bill protects the patients; their bill protects the HMOs.\n  All of us have worked long and hard on this issue for a substantial \nperiod of time. Some have worked on it, including Senator Kennedy, for \nmany years. It is time to quit talking about doing something about HMOs \nand HMO reform and actually do something about it. The American people \nare not interested in the politics--Republicans, Democrats, \nIndependents--and their positions politicizing this issue. What they \ncare about is that when their child needs to see a specialist, they \nwant to be sure that child can see that specialist. When they need to \ngo to the emergency room, they need to know they can go to the \nemergency room without having to worry if the HMO is going to pay for \nit. If the HMO does something wrong and runs over them and runs over \ntheir family and overrules a doctor's medical decision, they want to be \nable to do something about that. They want the HMOs to be treated just \nas all the rest of us.\n\n  Ultimately that is what this bill is about. The bottom line question \nis, with whom do we stand? Do we stand with the big HMOs and the big \nHMO lobbies or do we stand with the doctors, nurses, and families of \nAmerica?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves, I wonder if he \nmight respond to a question or two as one of the principal sponsors.\n  First of all, I wonder if he shares with me a certain degree of \ndisappointment that we are not going to have the opportunity to debate \nthese protections that are so important for American families. Every \nday that we fail to\n\n[[Page S6409]]\n\ntake action, families are being hurt. Without this legislation, more \nthan 50,000 of our fellow citizens today are going to suffer further \ninjury or pain. This is the result of failing to take action.\n  I want to make some general comments along the lines of those that \nthe Senator made. I first say that that was an outstanding presentation \nwith regard to the substance. It is difficult for me to understand the \nopposition to this, other than, as the Senator pointed out, the special \ninterests of the HMO industry do not want it. I have not heard the \nadministration or the Senators who are in opposition, indicate what \nprotections in this legislation they would not want to give to the \nAmerican people.\n  We were informed by the Republican leadership that because this bill \nhas been changed so many times, we need to hold further hearings to \nfind out what is in it. There have been no hearings since March of \n1999.\n  One of the leaders pointed to paragraph (C) in the legislation, where \nemployers can be held accountable. Then they talked about the rising \ncosts of 20 percent a year and talked further about employer liability.\n  As I understand, the changes that had been made over the weekend were \nbasically in response to some of the observations that were made about \nthe underlying legislation. One question was about whether you could be \nsued in Federal or State court. The opposition claims our bill allows \nthem to be sued in Federal and State courts at the same time. This was \nnever the intention. I understand there was an attempt to explicitly \nclarify that proceeding so there would not be two forums. I understand \nthat was one of the clarifications made. It was never intended to \npermit forum shopping and that was clarified.\n  I might mention the rest, since there were only four of them, and \nthen get the reaction of the Senator since he was very much involved in \nthis.\n  No. 2 was the question about the exhaustion of appeals before going \nto court. The opposition claims our bill made it too easy to go to \ncourt, arguing that patients can bypass the appeals process simply by \nalleging harm. Since it was not our intent to make it easy to bypass \nappeals, we resolved this matter by eliminating the word ``alleged.''\n  The third was about making it easier to sue doctors. The other side \nhas been claiming our bill makes doctors liable for plan \nadministration. This is a rather technical issue, being sued in State \ncourt and now in Federal court again. That wasn't the intent. We \nclarify that the positions are protected. We also included language to \nextend civil protections to hospitals and insurance agents. There was \nsome question about the application of the language. The change was \nspecifically included to clarify that, to demonstrate the protections \nfor those groups.\n  In the fourth change, regarding protecting the State cause of action, \nwe added clarifying language to protect existing State court \njurisdiction from inadvertent preemption under our bill. A rather \nextraneous example or two were given that might have created some \nconfusion. As I understand it, that was the fourth piece of clarifying \nlanguage.\n\n  Finally, the IRS enforcement language was dropped, including an \nadditional enforcement provision that we understand has a revenue \nimpact and a blue-slip problem. To avoid the blue-slip issue, we \ndropped the provision.\n  Those are the totality of the changes. Evidently they are being used \nto somehow represent that there were major kinds of alterations or \nchanges to the bill which are difficult to understand. Therefore, the \nother side refuses to permit us to begin the debate on the bill.\n  If the Senator would be good enough to indicate to me whether it is \nhis understanding that these were the areas in which adjustments were \nmade and whether the representations that were made, in terms of the \nclarifications? Was that his understanding as well?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator yield for me to reply to the question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. In response to the question, the areas that were changed \nwere all changes in the direction of the objections of our opponents. \nIn other words, they raised concerns and we made changes to clarify so \nthere would be no question but that we intended exactly what they \nintended.\n  For example, the first one the Senator mentions: exhaustion, which \nmeans you have to go through the appeals before you can take somebody \nto court, both sides intended that that be required because we want \ncases to be decided by the appeal without having to go to court, to \navoid unnecessary lawsuits. We made it clear in this clarification that \nthere is no question about that. We intend for that to be true. That \nwas the purpose of the clarification.\n  Second is the cases being brought in State and Federal court. The \npurpose for the change was to make it clear we want nobody to be sued \nin both State and Federal court; to clarify the language so there was \nno doubt in anybody's mind about which cases go to State court and \nwhich cases go to Federal court.\n  Third, they complain that under our bill some physicians, perhaps, \ncould be subject to lawsuits to which they otherwise would not be \nsubject. So we made a change to eliminate that possibility.\n  Our bill, as the Senator well knows, is intended to empower doctors, \nto empower nurses, to make the health care decisions that only they \nhave the medical training and experience to make, that they have the \nqualifications to make, not some bureaucrat sitting behind a desk at \nsome HMO somewhere. That is the purpose of this clarifying language.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me speak to this point. I am confused as to why \nthere is an attempt by the Republican leadership to misrepresent what \nis in the employer provisions of the bill on page 144. I think all of \nus who have been around here find language is misrepresented and \nsubsequently individuals disagree with the misrepresentation. It \nappears that is what is happening.\n  The Senator has stated my understanding. Then if we look at page 144, \nregarding the responsibility of the employer in the plans, it says:\n\n       Causes of action against employers. . . .\n\n  Then it says:\n\n       Subject to subparagraph (B), paragraph (1)(A) does not \n     authorize a cause of action against an employer or other plan \n     sponsor maintaining the plan (or against an employee of such \n     an employer or sponsor acting within the scope of \n     employment).\n\n  That is extremely clear. In the President's language, which he sent \nto the Congress, and I have here, the President lists his requirement \nin his bill of particulars, which says:\n\n       Only employers who retain the responsibility for and make \n     final medical decisions should be subject to the suit.\n\n  That is what President Bush said is the principle. It is my \nunderstanding that that exact point is stated in the legislation on \npage 145, line 8:\n\n       . . . to the extent there was direct participation by the \n     employer. . . .\n\n  That talks about when they would be open to the responsibility.\n  But as I understand it, and I welcome the comments of the Senator, \nthat completely conforms with what President Bush himself has \nestablished. Is that correct?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. The Senator is correct. The President specifically \nprovided he does not want employers to be sued unless they make medical \ndecisions. Our legislation does exactly that. The language completely \nconforms, in almost identical language, to the President's principle. \nWe do not want employers to be sued unless somehow they step in the \nshoes of the HMOs and make a medical decision. That is exactly what the \nPresident is suggesting. The Senator is correct, to the extent our \nopponents--who, by the way, are trying to prevent this bill from ever \nbeing considered at this point in this Chamber--to the extent our \nopponents suggest under our legislation lawsuits against employers are \nallowed, they need to read the President's principles because, in fact, \nour legislation is identical to the President's principle on this \nissue.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, if the Senator will allow me one final \ncomment, the Senator well knows, having fought on this issue for many \nyears and having led the fight, as Senator Daschle, our majority leader \npointed out in his earlier comments, the American people can get a \nlesson from what is happening at this moment. We made it clear we \nintended to bring bipartisan patient protection to the floor of the \nSenate, a bill supported by Republican\n\n[[Page S6410]]\n\nSenators in this Chamber and also in the House.\n  What has been the response by our opponents? Has the response been to \ndebate this issue in an open way before the American people and to make \ntheir case to support the HMOs' position on the floor of the Senate? \nNo. Their response is to try to prevent an issue that affects millions \nand millions of Americans every year from even being heard on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  I think it becomes clear who wants to provide real and meaningful \npatient protection and who wants to keep this issue from ever getting \nto the floor of the Senate so HMOs maintain their privileged status.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  In the press conference of the Republican leadership, it was \nrepresented that there were complicated changes and alterations to the \nbill. The Senator responded to questions raised as to what these \nchanges and clarifications are. This is a result of the White House \nasking the principals to work out some clarification in these areas and \nto accommodate these kinds of requests.\n  Those changes were made. Now they are being used as an excuse for \nfailing to bring this matter up.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes; briefly.\n  Mr. GREGG. I know that the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator \nfrom North Carolina said the employer is not subject to liability under \nthis bill. The Senator cited section 5 on page 144, subparagraph (A). \nThe Senator didn't cite subparagraph (B), which says, notwithstanding \nsubparagraph (A), the cause of action may arise against an employer, or \nother plan sponsor--it goes down the list--as directed participation in \nthe employer's plan, and the decisions of the plan under section 102.\n  So, very clearly, an employer is subject to liability under that \nsection, and that ``directed participation'' is an extremely ambiguous \nphrase, I believe. I would be happy to discuss that.\n  Then, if we go to page 141, where a new Federal cause of action \nagainst employers is created, subsection (ii) on that page says, \n``otherwise fails to exercise ordinary care in the performance of a \nduty under the terms and conditions of the plan with respect to a \nparticipant'' in the plan. That action creates a new cause of action, \nwhich is a new cause of action against the plan's sponsor, and, by the \nterms of ERISA, section 3 definition, plan sponsor is defined as--lo \nand behold--the employer.\n  I believe it is very clear under this bill that employers are subject \nto the right to be sued. They are subject to the right to be sued for \nwhat I expect are going to be multiple opportunities for a creative \nattorney. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has basically rated \nthis as a lawsuit against employers and has in fact rated the costs in \nthis bill, which is significant and will lead to employers giving up \ntheir insurance.\n  I would be interested in the Senator's definition and explanation of \nwhy, when the bill says in part (B) on page 144 that cause of action \nmay arise against an employer or other plan sponsor, the language means \nsomething other than cause of action arising against the employer or \nother plan sponsor.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to respond. I hope we can do this briefly \nbecause we are going to recess. I will let the Senator from North \nCarolina respond to that, if I may.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I respond to the Senator's question by \nsaying, first of all, I suggest that he read the principles because the \nlanguage of this legislation comes directly from the President's \nprinciples.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield, I am not asking the President.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Excuse me. Do I have the floor? Excuse me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we only have 2 or 3 more minutes. \nI wanted to give the opportunity for a response. I think the answer, as \nthe Senator pointed out, is read from President Bush's own words. Only \nemployers who retain responsibility for or make final medical decisions \nshould be subject to suit. It is that language and that principle that \nhas been included in the language.\n  If the Senator from New Hampshire thinks that is in some way \nambiguous, or doesn't achieve that objective, that is the objective \nthat we had. That is the language that was drafted in the Senate to \ncarry that purpose forward. But we are open.\n  Does he agree with that principle? I ask the Senator. Does the \nSenator agree with that fundamental principle or differ with the \nPresident on it?\n  Mr. GREGG. No. I actually agree with the principle. I think the \nPresident's point was that employers generally should not be subjected \nand opened up to massive liability. And this bill does that. That is \nwhy I asked the Senator to explain the section.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will have to reclaim the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator asked me a question. Doesn't he want me to \nrespond?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I asked specifically whether the Senator agreed with the \nPresident's principles. The Senator said yes, he did.\n  He went on to say that the language in the legislation opens up \nmassive opportunity for suing employers, which is different. He \nanswered my question. I am reclaiming my time since I only have about a \nminute and a half left.\n  I wish we had the opportunity to debate this because it is very clear \nwhat has been done with the drafting of this legislation. The \nemployers, outside of those who are actually going to be making medical \ndecisions affecting patients, are excluded.\n  I have been going to the conferences with those who are opposed to \nit. They say, oh, no, that is not what it does.\n  It is a favorite whipping provision in this language. They keep \nsaying that isn't what it does. That is what we intend to do. That is \nwhat we have done in this language. We will have more of an opportunity \nto debate that later.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I only have about 5 or 6 minutes to be able to make some \npresentation on this. I look forward to that time. I will be glad to \nyield. Could I ask that we defer the recess time from 12:30 until \n12:35?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nexpiration of the discussion of the Senator from Massachusetts I be \ngiven 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are about to recess.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am asking that the time for the recess be extended \nbeyond the Senator's period for 10 additional minutes and that I be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine.\n  Mr. President, so how much time remains? It is now 12:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has another 5 \nminutes by the previous unanimous consent agreement. Then the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire will have 10 minutes, and then we will recess until \n2:15.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine.\n  Mr. President, this whole debate should remain focused on what it is \nreally about. What this debate is really all about is that doctors, \nnurses and families are going to make decisions. And those decisions \nought to be carried out. They should not be overturned by bean counters \nand accountants working for HMOs thousands of miles away. These \naccountants do not have the training, do not know the patient, and do \nnot know the complete medical circumstances surrounding the patient's \ncase. That is what this legislation is really all about.\n  We have taken the kinds of protections which have been outlined now \nby the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from North Carolina and \nindicate what those protections are. There are 26 different protections \nwhich have been included. We have yet to hear from the other side, as \nwe have had these debates now for 2 or 3 years, regarding which \nprotections they do not agree with. Is it the emergency room? Is it the \nclinical trials, specialty care, or the OB/GYN protections? Is it the \ngag rules? We have not heard what particular guarantees and protections \nthat are there for the American families to which they object.\n  They talk a good deal about the cost of this legislation. They want \nto do the bidding, I guess, of the HMOs, and have them be the one \nindustry in this country not held accountable for actions\n\n[[Page S6411]]\n\nthey take that can harm, kill, or maim children and workers in our \ncountry.\n  What we are basically saying is, if HMOs make decisions which put \nindividuals at risk, then they ought to be held accountable. The HMOs \nshould be held accountable. If there is an employer making a similar \ndecision which is going to result in the same kind of pain and \naffliction to that individual, they ought to be held accountable. \nOtherwise, employers that just go out and make the contracts should not \nbe. If there is a question of clarification of language, we would work \nthat out.\n  Over the period of time, one of the attacks that has been made on \nthis legislation is its potential cost. I want to say that is an old \nred herring. I was here not long ago when we passed the Family and \nMedical Leave Act. We had the Chamber of Commerce stating the cost of \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act was going to be $27 billion a year on \nAmerican industry. It is not. It has been an enormous success, and \ncompanies have welcomed it. And there is going to be the opportunity to \nexpand it.\n  I was here when we debated the portability of health care for those \nindividuals with disabilities, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. We heard at \nthe time that it was going to increase premiums by billions and \nbillions of dollars. It has not. It is working, and there is no one \nhere to suggest that we should not have gone ahead on it.\n  I was here when we heard the question: Should we increase the minimum \nwage? There were those who said it was going to mean hundreds of \nthousands of people were going to lose their jobs, and that it was \ngoing to add inevitably to the problems of inflation. It has not.\n  We know the scare tactics that were being used in terms of the cost \nin the past, and they are the same kinds of scare tactics that are \nbeing used at the present time.\n\n  The CBO, as the Senator from North Carolina has pointed out, \nindicates that last year premiums went up 10 percent, and the top four \nor five HMOs had $10 billion in profits in our country. They estimate \nthat 20 percent of every premium dollar paid goes to advertising, \nadministrative expenses, and large salaries for these individuals. It \nwent up 10 percent last year. It went up 8 percent the year before.\n  As the CBO estimates, under the Breaux-Frist bill, it will go up 2.9 \npercent over 5 years; and under the McCain-Edwards bill, 4.2 percent--a \n1.3-percent difference. As the Senator from North Carolina pointed out, \nif you look at those figures, the difference is in the additional kinds \nof expanded opportunities for patients, such as for clinical trials. \nFor example, women need those clinical trials in relation to breast \ncancer. We need to make sure they are going to be able to have those \ntrials.\n  We have to have greater access to specialists. If a child has, as my \nchild had, an osteosarcoma--which only 1,200 children in this country \nhave--they need a pediatric oncologist. They shouldn't go to a general \npractitioner to make the recommendation for the kind of treatment that \nresulted in the saving of my son's life. We are talking about access to \nthose kinds of specialists. We see there is a difference between the \nbill we have before us and that which the opposition favors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's additional 5 minutes have \nexpired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I had not intended to speak right now, but \nI do think some of the things that have been said in this Chamber do \nneed to be responded to because it is very obvious there is a \nsignificant disagreement, and it is a disagreement which is core to \nthis issue.\n  First off, let's begin with the question of how this bill is coming \nforward. You have to remember, this bill has not had a hearing since \nMarch of 1999. We have not had any hearings on this particular bill. \nAnd this is one heck of a complicated bill. The bill on Wednesday was \nnot the bill we got on Thursday.\n  So when the other side says we are delaying, I think that is a little \nbit of a straw man debate primarily because, as a matter of \nresponsibility, we have to at least read the bill. And then we have to \nfigure out what is in it.\n  One of the big issues in relation to what is in it is what effect \nthis will have on employers. I think the language is unequivocal on \nthat point. The language in section (B), as I cited before, 144, says: \nA cause of action may arise against an employer. Sure they have the \nnice title, ``Exclusion of Employers,'' but they wipe out that language \nwith the language which says: Notwithstanding anything in subparagraph \n(A)--that is the one with the nice title on it, ``Exclusion of \nEmployers''--a cause of action may arise against an employer or other \nplan sponsor--and then it lists why.\n  One of the standards here is if the employer had direct \nparticipation. And ``direct participation'' has become a word of art \nthat is incredibly broad. ``Direct participation'' just means an \nemployer had to maybe wink at his employee, as he headed off to his \ndoctor's office, and say: Hope you get better.\n\n  As a practical matter, today direct participation essentially brings \nin every employer in this country that has a plan. That is why a lot of \nemployers are going to drop their plans. That is why no employer group \nsupports the McCain bill--none--because it is an attack on employers, \nas versus a legitimate effort to try to get at malfeasance, misfeasance \nnegligence in the areas of HMOs.\n  We all want to make sure that people who are poorly treated by their \nHMO have a right for recovery. We put together proposals which \naccomplish that. But let's not draw all the employers into the process \nand stick them with lawyers running around them in circles, suing them \nlike crazy, shooting arrows at them, trying to recover from them \nbecause then we will drive the employers out of the insurance market, \nand more people will be uninsured. That is why it is projected that \nthis bill will increase the number of uninsured by over 1.2 million \npeople.\n  I am a little surprised that some of the sponsors of this bill want \nto expand the number of uninsured in this country. I think some \nsupporters of this bill may want to because there is, I believe, a \nbelief that nationalization of the health care system is a good idea, \nand one way to energize support for nationalization is to have a lot of \nuninsured. But I am hopeful some of the other folks who look at this \nbill and are supportive will say: Hold it. That was not our intent. We \ndidn't want to drive employers out of the business of insuring and \ncause more people to be uninsured. We wanted to do just the opposite.\n  So this language is extremely broad, extremely pervasive, and will \nattack the employers of America--small employers, employers with 10 \nemployees, with 5 employees, with 25 employees, with 50 employees. \nThere is no exemption in this bill. Then there is other language in \nthis bill. This bill creates a whole new cause of action against \nemployers that has never been seen before, a whole new Federal cause of \naction. And it is a biggy. This is one where lawyers can really have a \ngood time because, under this bill, it makes the employers responsible \nfor the performance of the duties under the terms and conditions of the \nplan. This is a brand new concept under Federal law.\n  It defines the people responsible, as I said earlier, as plan \nsponsors. Plan sponsors, under ERISA, are defined as employers. It \nbrings in the employers. We went through the different obligations \nunder a plan that an insurance company has that offers that plan and \nwhich are enforceable, not today by the individual but by a variety of \ndifferent processes. We calculate that there are potentially 200 new \nopportunities for private causes of action against employers as a \nresult of this language. There are a lot of lawsuits because there are \na lot of lawyers who can take those 200 opportunities and multiply \nthem. That is one of those factors which has an infinity symbol beside \nit as to the number of potential lawsuits, that little circle you \nlearned in eighth grade when you took physics, a little infinity circle \nconnecting the lawyers to lawsuits as a result of this language.\n  I would rename this bill ``the lawyers who want to be a millionaire \nact'' because that is essentially what it is. This representation that \nemployers are not subject to liability is absolutely inaccurate. Under \nthe clear terms of the bill itself, it is absolutely inaccurate.\n  What is the practical effect of this bill? This issue is not about, \nas the Senator from Massachusetts outlined, a whole series of coverages \nthat people need. This is not about that. We give\n\n[[Page S6412]]\n\nthose coverages in our State. Most States have those coverages as a \nrequirement in their States. It is not about that. It is not about \nwhether or not a patient has access to a specialist, and it is not \nabout whether or not a woman has access to an OB/GYN. All of that is \navailable and should be available. Those are being thrown up as red \nherrings to try to develop support. That issue is not even on the table \nbecause there is hardly a State in the country that does not give those \ntypes of coverages and require those types of coverages of their HMOs.\n  It is not about whether a patient should have a timely right to \nappeals, both internal and external, because all the laws, all the \nproposals that have come forward have done that. It is not about that.\n  It is not about whether a patient should be compensated if they get \nharmed by their doctor or their HMO. All of the bills that have come \nforward, all the proposals that have come forward have had that as part \nof their language. All these bills share those same goals.\n  This is about a dramatic expansion in the opportunity to sue. That is \nwhat the bill is about, as it is brought forward; specifically, to sue \nemployers, with the practical effect being that more people will be \nuninsured in our country today because more employers will drop their \ninsurance. The number of new opportunities in this bill for lawyers to \ncreate havoc is significant.\n  You have the fact that you can basically forum shop between States \nand Federal law. You have States stepping into the area of ERISA. ERISA \nis an incredibly complex piece of legislation on which Federal courts \nhave spent a lot of time developing expertise. There has been over \n10,000 cases on ERISA decisions. Suddenly Federal and State courts are \ngoing to take on this issue. Not only are they going to get to take it \non, but they are going to get to take it on without any liability caps. \nEssentially, there are no liability caps against health plans. There \nmay be caps against doctors in some States, but take California; they \ndon't have caps against health plans.\n  There are no liability caps.\n  You are going to have punitive damages, economic damages without \ncaps. The implication of what that means is that you are going to have \nforum shopping from State to State, depending on which State makes the \nmost sense for a person, which structure makes the most sense for a \nlawyer to pursue. Then you are going to have them proceeding in that \nstructure. And you are going to have the employer brought in.\n\n  Plus this concept that you have to go through an appeals process \nbefore you get to bring a lawsuit is also totally subjugated in this \nbill. The way this bill is structured, all you have to do is show harm \nand you are out of the appeal process--or alleged harm. Originally it \nwas ``alleged'' harm. Basically, you get into court and claim you show \nharm and then everything else gets to the table. No more appeals \nprocess of any nature. The concept of trying to reduce the amount of \nlitigation by having a reasonable appeal process is totally undermined \nby this bill.\n  It should also be noted that the economic impact of this bill has \nbeen scored not by me, not by some political organization, but by CBO. \nThis bill costs 4.2 percent. That is not over 5 or 10 years, as was \nrepresented here earlier. That is an annual cost on top of the health \ncare costs which are inflating fairly rapidly right now. A 4.2 percent \nincrease translates into a very significant increase, as has been \nmentioned earlier, in the uninsured because employers will have to drop \ntheir insurance because they can't afford it. That should not be our \ngoal here.\n  What should our goal be?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has used his 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have no \nobjection to my friend using 2 extra minutes. Following that, I would \nlike to be recognized and then the Senator from North Carolina would be \nrecognized for 5 minutes and then we will go to our party conferences.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire now has 2 minutes, to be followed by a \nstatement from the Senator from Nevada, and then 5 minutes to the \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the goal here should be this: When you go \nto see a doctor and you go to your HMO, if that is who covers you, you \nshould expect to get good treatment. If you don't get good treatment, \nyou should have relief. And you should expect to have a certain amount \nof flexibility as to who you see and especially with some very common \nevents such as OB/GYN and areas such as that, where you should have the \ncapacity as the patient to make some choices: your primary care \nprovider, things such as that.\n  That is all accomplishable. In fact, the bills that have been brought \nforward from our side of the aisle--some of them in a bipartisan way, \nsuch as the Breaux-Frist-Jeffords bill, last year's, the Nickles \namendment, which did not have any Democratic support--have accomplished \nthat. In the process of accomplishing that, we should not fundamentally \nundermine the interests of employers to participate in health insurance \nfor their employees, which is what, unfortunately, the McCain bill \ndoes. And we should not do unnecessary and significant damage to States \nrights which is, unfortunately, what the McCain bill does. That is a \nwhole other discussion. There are a variety of other problems.\n  The goal can be accomplished, which is better health care and better \nprotection of our patients and people who use our health care system \nwithout this very egregious, very intrusive, very litigious piece of \nlaw being passed.\n  To reiterate, this is not a debate about whether patients should have \nrights.\n  This is not a debate about whether patients should be able to go the \nnearest emergency room without being penalized.\n  This is not a debate whether a patient should be able to access a \nspecialist with appropriate expertise and training; prescription drugs \nthat are medically necessary and appropriate; or comprehensive \ninformation about their health plan.\n  This is not a debate about whether a female patient should be able to \ndirectly access OB/GYN without prior authorization, nor is it a debate \nwhether the parents of a child should be able to designate a \npediatrician as their child's primary care provider.\n  This is not a debate about whether a pregnant, sick, or terminally \nill patient is able to continue receiving care from her physician \nthrough the entire course of treatment--even if the plan terminates her \nphysician from the network.\n  This is not a debate about whether physicians are able to tell their \npatients about all treatment options without being gagged by the health \nplan.\n  This is not a debate about whether there should be procedures to \nensure that health plans make timely decisions and patients have the \nright to both an internal appeal to the plan and an independent \nexternal review when a plan denies coverage. And this is not a debate \nabout whether the external review is independent from the plan and the \nreviewer makes a decision based on the best medical evidence and \nhighest standard of care.\n  This is not a debate about whether all Americans should enjoy these \ntypes of rights.\n  This is not a debate about whether patient rights should be \nenforceable or even whether a patient should be fairly compensated when \nharmed or killed by the decision of his or her health plan or HMO.\n  We agree on all these issues. Both sides share these goals. Democrats \nand Republicans.\n  The real debate is about how we can best achieve these common goals. \nIt's about putting patients first--ahead of special interests. It's \nabout accomplishing these goals without driving up health care costs, \ngiving employers more reasons to drop health coverage, adding millions \nmore Americans to join the ranks of the uninsured, or dismantling our \nprivate, employer-based health care system.\n  The bill we are about to debate--the Bipartisan Patient Protection \nAct sponsored by Senators McCain, Edwards, and Kennedy--fails on all \nthese counts.\n  I believe we can accomplish our common goals without inviting these \nunintended consequences. Unfortunately,\n\n[[Page S6413]]\n\nthere appears to be no interest from the majority in addressing these \nconcerns. Senator Daschle said recently that he sees no reason to \ncompromise or address these concerns. I think that is very unfortunate \nfor consumers and for patients.\n  I would like to highlight the very real problems in this bill, S. \n1052 which was just introduced on June 14.\n  The McCain bill creates two opportunities to take a bite at the \napple. First, it allows unlimited lawsuits against health plans and \nemployers under state law. Second, it creates an expansive new remedy \nwith very large damages under federal law.\n  The dual Federal-State scheme under the McCain bill will encourage \ndual claims and forum shopping. Plaintiff's lawyers will shop around \nfor the forum with the highest limits on damages. And there is nothing \nin the bill that would prohibit suits based on the same or a similar \nset of facts from being filed simultaneously or consecutively in both \nState and Federal court.\n  This dual Federal-State scheme will raise complicated and costly \njurisdictional questions and will ensure that plan benefits and \nadministration will vary from State to State. This will only serve to \nconfuse patients who are already faced with the task of navigating a \ncomplex health care system.\n  This scheme will also impose needless and excessive costs that will \ndiscourage employers from sponsoring health plans. It will ultimately \nincrease the ranks of the uninsured.\n  Federal courts have been routinely hearing cases involving \ncomplicated employee benefit cases. The McCain bill would essentially \nremove all coverage and claims decisions from Federal court and place \nthem under State jurisdiction, even though States have no experience \nwith ERISA and employer-sponsored benefits.\n  Federal courts have honed their expertise in resolving complicated \nemployee benefits issues since they were given exclusive jurisdiction \nover such cases in the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act of \n1974, ERISA. Approximately 10,000 ERISA cases are filed each year in \nFederal court.\n  In order to provide high quality and affordable benefits to \nemployees, employers that sponsor health plans across State lines must \nbe able to administer their benefits in a uniform, consistent and \nequitable manner. The McCain bill will produce multiple and conflicting \nState laws, regulations and court interpretations, making it difficult \nfor employers to administer their health plans.\n  Congress' rationale for giving Federal courts exclusive jurisdiction \nwith respect to remedies is as applicable today as it was in 1974. From \nERISA's legislative history: ``It is evident that the operations of \nemployee benefit plans are increasingly interstate. The uniformity of \ndecision which the Act is designed to foster will help administrators, \nfiduciaries and participants to predict the legality of proposed \nactions without the necessity of reference to varying state laws.''\n  Proponents of the McCain-Edwards bill would have you believe that \nthey have compromised by adding a $5 million cap on punitive damages \nfor the Federal cause of action. But this cap is merely illusory.\n  The bill has no caps on Federal or State economic or non-economic \ndamages.\n  Plus, there are no caps on damages specified for the numerous \nlawsuits that would fall under State jurisdiction. And there is no \nevidence to suggest that State law caps would be applied to these \nvarious causes of action. In fact, most State medical malpractice law \ndamage caps only apply to physicians and other health professionals--\nnot health plans. California is one such example.\n  Excessive damage awards only harm physicians and patients. According \nto a study by Tillinghast-Towers Perrin, health plan liability will \nincrease physician medical malpractice liability premiums by 8 to 20 \npercent because plaintiffs will target all possible defendants, \nincluding physicians. These costs will be passed on to patients in the \nform of higher premiums or reduced coverage.\n  Health plans will also pass on the increased costs of being exposed \nto large damage awards to employers who will in turn pass the costs on \nto employees or reduce or terminate coverage.\n  The McCain bill allows patients to go straight to court--for the \npurpose of collecting monetary damages--without exhausting \nadministrative remedies first.\n  The independent medical review process is the best, most efficient \nremedy for the majority of patients. It ensures that patients get the \nmedical care when they need it. In contrast, tort damages are only \navailable to patients after they are injured.\n  The ``go straight to court provision'' creates a perverse incentive \nfor patients, encouraged by their attorneys, to bypass the review \nprocess in order to seek the big damages awards in court.\n\n  Proponents of the exhaustion loophole argue that external review is \n``not enough.'' They would have you believe that an exhaustion \nrequirement somehow precludes the ability of an injured patient to seek \nrecourse in court. But this is not the case. The external review \nprocess is merely a required and beneficial step before going to court.\n  The high standards that the medical reviewer is required to follow \nwill help inform the court's decisions in determining whether the plan \ndecision was the right one. Just as a medical expert is not versed in \nthe specifics of the law, the court is not well versed in medicine and \nwill benefit from the finding of the independent, external review--as \nwill the patient.\n  The McCain bill allows the medical reviewer to consider but ``not be \nbound by'' a plan's definition of medical necessity which may be used \nto determine whether a plan covers a benefit. In effect, this allows \nthe medical reviewer to ignore contract definitions of medical \nnecessity and substitute their own definitions or opinions as a basis \nfor overturning a health plan's decision.\n  This provision would lead to routine reversals of health plan \ndecisions and generate increased litigation. Employers and health plans \nwould have no predictability in administering their plans or estimating \ntheir exposure to liability. Alternatively, this may cause plans to \nroutinely approve all coverage thereby driving up premiums \nastronomically and raising quality and safety concerns for the patient. \nEmployers may reconsider their commitment to offer and administer \nhealth benefits if the McCain bill becomes law.\n  Health plans and employers that honor their contractual obligations \ncould be on the losing end of a lawsuit when an external medical \nreviewer decides to disregard a term in the health plan contract. Even \nplans that adhere carefully to the terms of their contracts, no matter \nhow generous those terms are, could be held liable if the reviewer \ndecides to apply a different standard.\n  Contrary to continued assertions by its proponents, the McCain bill \ndoes not protect employers from open-ended liability. In fact, the bill \nspecifically authorizes certain types of lawsuits to be brought against \nemployers in Federal court for failing to perform a duty under the \nterms and conditions of the plan.\n  Because employers are required to carry out a broad range of \nadministrative duties under ERISA's statutory scheme, the McCain bill \nwill leave them wide open to new Federal personal injury suits. \nEmployers will be sued for all types of alleged errors such as issuing \nnotices required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct, HIPAA, and the COBRA, regardless of whether such errors result in \na denial of a covered benefit.\n  The McCain bill would impose potentially huge new compensatory and \npunitive damages remedies for violations of COBRA, HIPAA, and ERISA's \ndisclosure requirements. Moreover, under the statute's own \nrequirements, the employer is specifically required to carry out COBRA \nand disclosure requirements. The employer is almost always the \nadministrator. Thus, McCain-Kennedy imposes a huge new liability on \nemployers that employers cannot avoid; despite the fact that when \nCongress adopted COBRA and HIPAA with large bipartisan majorities no \ndiscussion was given to the need for punitive damages to enforce the \nnew requirements.\n  The ``direct participation'' provision in the McCain bill provides \nlittle comfort to employers who will still be\n\n[[Page S6414]]\n\ndragged into court on every case. Employers who do not ``directly \nparticipate'' in such decisions are not protected from being sued; they \nare only provided with a defense to raise in court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I disagree with what my friend from New \nHampshire has said about the content and the direction of the McCain-\nEdwards legislation. Why don't we decide if he is right or I am right. \nAnd how you do that is you come to the Senate and you debate the issue.\n  We are being prevented from doing that today. The Republicans have \nobjected to our going forward to consider this bill. So this will \nnecessitate our going through the procedure of filing a motion to \ninvoke cloture which we will vote on Thursday. I believe rather than \nwasting that time, we should be here debating the principles enunciated \nby the Senator from New Hampshire and what we have been saying on this \nside all day.\n  That seems to be the fair way to do it, rather than talking about all \nthe scary points of this bill from their perspective and the positive \npoints from our perspective. Let's debate the issues. This bill has \nbeen around for 5 years in one version or another. We believe that we \nhave refined this legislation. Because of the courageous actions of the \nSenator from Arizona and the brilliant input of the Senator from North \nCarolina, we now have a piece of legislation that is extremely good. It \nis better than the ones that have come before us before. It is so good \nthat on our side we are going to offer very few, if any, amendments \nbecause we believe this legislation is so good.\n  This legislation deals with accountability. We spent 8 weeks in this \nbody talking about education. What were we trying to establish? We \nwanted students and teachers and administrators to be accountable and \nto make sure we had good education in our public schools.\n  Accountability: That same argument should be and will be carried over \ninto this legislation dealing with the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I have a lot of other things to say and I will not say them now. I \nshowed to the Presiding Officer in the Senate that we have only a \npartial list of those organizations that support this legislation. \nThese are business groups, nurses groups, physician groups, starting \nwith the Abbott House, Inc.--Abbott House in Irvington, NY. That is No. \n1 on the list. At the end of this list we have the YWCA of northeast \nLouisiana. Of the 300-plus groups we have listed here, we have groups \nthat should know the difference between good and bad medical care. For \nexample, there is the Wisconsin Paralyzed Veterans of America. They \nbelieve what we want to do is right.\n  It is not often that you find legislation in the Senate that is \nsupported by hundreds and hundreds of groups. Every consumer group in \nAmerica supports our legislation. We have the physician organizations, \nspecialties and subspecialties, that support this legislation. We have \nthe American Medical Association that supports this legislation.\n  You know, for the first time that I can ever remember, we have the \ndoctors and the lawyers thinking this is good legislation. So I say to \nmy friend from New Hampshire, who is going to be the manager for the \nRepublicans on this legislation--I believe he should listen to what he \nsaid if he believes this--and I know he does--let's debate it, as my \ndad would say, ``like men,'' and now women because they are a vital \npart of the Senate. Let's debate this issue as grownups, not hiding \nbehind procedural matters. If they think our legislation is so bad, let \nthem prove it out here.\n  I am willing to take my chances on an up-or-down vote on the Senate \nfloor. That is how we should decide issues. We should not be hiding \nbehind some procedural prohibition that prevents us from moving this \nlegislation forward.\n  One last thing. The majority leader said today, right here at 11:30, \nthat this legislation, the Patients' Bill of Rights, is going to be \ncompleted before we leave for the recess--if we have a Fourth of July \nrecess. That is what he said. He is not playing games. He is majority \nleader of the Senate. He said today that if we don't finish this bill \nby next Thursday night--if we do, we are off Friday. We have the Fourth \nof July recess. If we don't finish this bill by next Thursday evening, \nwe are going to work Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and we are going to work \nMonday--every day except the Fourth of July. Then we will come back on \nthe fifth. We are going to be here until we finish this legislation. So \nall staff members here in Washington and people watching this on C-SPAN \nshould understand that we, the Senators, may not be home for our Fourth \nof July break. We may be here doing the people's work, trying to work \nour way through this legislation, through all the obstacles being \nthrown up procedurally by the money interests of this country--the HMOs \nwho think they own the medical care of this country. They don't. It is \nowned by the people--the patients, nurses, and doctors.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, the great thing about debate on the floor \nof the Senate--particularly extended debate--is that we get past the \nhigh-pitched rhetoric and actually get to the facts. I want to respond \nbriefly to some of the comments of my friend and colleague from New \nHampshire.\n  He argues that under our bill employers can be held responsible--\nciting a particular page of the legislation--if they make a comment to \nan employee going out the door on the way to their doctor saying, \n``hope you feel better''.\n  First of all, President Bush has issued a set of principles that are \nspecific to this issue. His principles say, ``Only employers who retain \nresponsibility for and make final medical decisions should be subject \nto suit.'' So the President himself, in his principles, has said \nemployers that are making medical decisions about individual cases are \nsubject to sue and should be subject to sue.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire cited language on page 141 of the \nbill referring to, ``otherwise, calls of action created by failing to \nexercise ordinary care in the performance of a duty.'' Two pages later \nin the bill, which unfortunately my colleague didn't talk about, there \nis language at the bottom of the page, subsection (A), that says: \n``This section does not authorize a cause of action against an \nemployer.''\n  What I suggest to my colleague is that he read the entirety of the \nsection to which he refers.\n  The language of what constitutes making a medical decision in a \nspecific case is very clear in our legislation. It includes none of the \ngeneral things that the Senator from New Hampshire talked about. What \nhas to happen under the specific language of our bill, and as set forth \nby the President of the United States, is that the employer has to \nactually override and make the decision as an HMO would in a particular \ncase. Otherwise, under the language of our bill, and under the \nPresident's principle, the employer is protected, period.\n  We want to protect employers. That is the whole purpose of this \nlanguage. It is why Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy and I have \nworked for months and months in crafting this language.\n  The second argument my colleague made is that there would be forum \nshopping between State and Federal court. The language is clear. If an \nHMO makes a medical decision, that case goes to State court. If the \nquestion is on the specific provisions of the plan the employee is \ncovered by, that case goes to Federal court, period. It is where the \ncases have always been. The reason the other cases--the medical \ndecision cases--go to State court is because when they make a medical \njudgment and overrule a doctor, we want them to be treated just as the \ndoctors and the health care providers.\n  Third, he argues that ERISA is a very complicated law that will be \ndifficult for State courts to apply. Well, the State courts won't be \napplying ERISA. What the State courts would be doing is applying their \nown State law because what our bill provides is that when a medical \njudgment is made by an HMO and some child is hurt as a result, and they \ntake their case to State court, that State's law applies, so that if \nthere are recovery limits--and there are, I think, 30-some-odd States \nin the country. And the argument was made that there are no caps in our \nlegislation; there will be an outrageous explosion of litigation.\n\n[[Page S6415]]\n\n  First of all, it ignores the fact that State law applies, and the \nvast majority of States have limits on recoveries.\n  Second, the evidence shows that in California and Texas--the two \nStates that use legislation similar to ours--virtually no cases have \never gone to court. The cases get resolved in the appeals process. It \nis the way our legislation is designed. Cases go to court only as a \nmatter of absolute last resort.\n  Finally, he suggests there will be forum shopping from State to \nState, where a patient will choose to go to another State to file a \ncase because somehow that is more beneficial to them. Well, \nunfortunately, that has nothing to do with the real world. Patients \nwill be required to file their case in the State where they live, which \nis exactly where you would expect them to file. It is where they got \ntheir care, where they were hurt by the HMO. That is where their case \nwould be filed.\n  So what we have done, ultimately, is set up a system whereby HMOs are \ntreated the same as everybody else, as all the rest of us. That is its \npurpose. We want to take away the privileged status that HMOs have \nenjoyed for so long, while protecting employers, giving patients \nsubstantive rights, access to specialists, access to emergency rooms, \naccess to clinical trials, and having those rights be enforceable. It \nis so important that these rights we create in this bill have teeth in \nthem, and the only way they have teeth in them is if the force of law \nis behind them and those rights are enforceable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6415-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while we are talking about patients and a \nPatients' Bill of Rights, I want to report to my colleagues on Senator \nBryan, who has been quite ill.\n  I talked with Senator Bryan last Friday. He was in St. Mary's \nHospital in Reno when I spoke to him. He had for a couple of days a bad \nsore throat, for lack of a better description. Friday morning, he was \nin Reno and his throat was really sore. He has a son in Reno who is a \ncardiologist. He went to the emergency room. He was admitted to the \nhospital.\n  They did a CT scan and found an abscess in his throat area. Friday \nand Saturday they administered antibiotics, hoping he would get better \nsoon. He got worse, and Sunday morning they operated. He has been on a \nventilator since then in intensive care.\n  I spoke with the nurses taking care of him--by the way, he was back \nhere last week with some junior high school students--and they said he \nwas doing just fine. She had told him I was calling, and he gave the \nthumbs up. They expect him to be off the ventilator today.\n  They do not know the cause of the infection. They are still working \non that. It is an unusual thing. I have had a couple people ask me \nabout Senator Bryan today. He is doing just fine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6415-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6415-S6440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    BIPARTISAN PATIENT PROTECTION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  Before I get into the substance of my remarks on the Patients' Bill \nof Rights, I wish to salute my colleagues, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, the Senator from North Carolina, and the Senator from \nArizona, for working so long and hard on a bipartisan compromise \nprovision, one that I am proud to support.\n  Mr. President, we hear a lot about this Patients' Bill of Rights, and \nthere are many discussions about legal issues, medical issues, et \ncetera, but what hits home with most of us is when we travel our States \nand we hear stories about what has happened under present law.\n  When there is a conflict, which constantly arises in these days of \nHMOs, between what a doctor believes is best for the patient and what \nthe insurer believes is best for the health plan, who makes the final \ncall? That is what this bill is all about. It is about decisionmaking, \nand not decisionmaking on a Saturday afternoon whether you go to the \nbeach or go to the ball park. It is about decisionmaking when all of us \nare at our most strained, when a loved one is in a health care problem \nor with a health care crisis. That is when the decisionmaking really \nmatters.\n  When a child becomes sick or a parent becomes ill, when a spouse \ndiscovers a lump on her breast, and a judgment call needs to be made \nabout care, who has the deciding vote? Is it your doctor or is it an \nactuary somewhere hundreds of miles away who has not had one jot of \nmedical training? That is what this boils down to.\n  Those six of us supporting the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill believe \nthe decision should be made by the doctor; the decision should be made \nby someone who is trained to make medical decisions, not a managed care \nbureaucrat whose primary interests--do not blame these individuals, but \ntheir primary interest, what they are instructed to do, is look at \ncost, not health. Health may be in the equation but cost comes first. \nThat is why that actuary is getting paid, whereas for the doctor who \nhas taken the Hippocratic oath, health care comes first.\n  We want to pass this Patients' Bill of Rights to restore the \npendulum. I am not against HMOs. They were brought in with a purpose. \nMedical costs were climbing out of control. Something had to be brought \nin to help. But the pendulum has clearly swung too far, away from the \ndecision based on health made by the doctor in the hospital, and the \nnurse, towards a decision made on cost, made by an actuary, an \ninsurance company, an HMO.\n  So we believe we must pass a Patients' Bill of Rights to provide real \nprotection for patients, one that allows for the doctor to decide; one \nthat allows the insurance company, the actuaries' decision to be \nchallenged on a health-related basis. We must end the practice of \nhealth plans putting the bottom line before the Hippocratic oath. We \nmust restore balance when every one of us is faced with the awful \nchoice of what medical decision to make for ourselves or for a loved \none.\n  As this debate gets underway, I hope to bring up the cases of some \nfamilies I come across as I travel the State of New York. These are not \nunique cases. These are not isolated cases. They happen, unfortunately, \nevery day.\n  Let me talk about Tracey Shea, from Long Island, in my State. Tracey \ncomplained to her doctor about chronic headaches. The tests discovered \na tumor in her brain. It was unclear what that tumor was and her \ndoctors ordered further tests. But the HMO refused to pay for them, \narguing that the tumor was not malignant and further tests were \nunnecessary. Four months later, Tracey died. She was 28. She was \nengaged to be married.\n  She is gone and her parents and her fiance ask every day: Why wasn't \nher doctor allowed to give Tracey what she needed? Even if it was 50-\n50, or 25-75, why didn't she get what she wanted?\n  For those who think McCain-Edwards-Kennedy is some kind of abstract \ndebate, the difference this bill, this proposal would have made to \nTracey Shea, under McCain-Edwards-Kennedy, is Tracey would have had a \nhearing and an answer in a few days. Under the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords \nproposal, Tracey may not have lived long enough to get an answer.\n  A case in Binghamton: Rene Muldoon-Murray's little boy Logan was born \nhydrocephalic, a condition that many of us have seen. It is when the \nspinal fluid builds up and puts pressure on the brain. It is terribly \npainful. The Muldoon-Murray's health plan contained no pediatric \nneurosurgeons, the very people who should have looked at little Logan. \nThe one adult neurosurgeon, one who did not have experience with \nchildren--the brain of a child is quite different than the brain of an \nadult--the one adult neurosurgeon available in the plan could only work \nunder supervision because his license was suspended.\n  Imagine, the only person you can go to when your child is in agony, \nthe only one the HMO will let you go to, is someone whose license was \nsuspended. That is the only one the HMO in Binghamton provided as 3-\nyear-old Logan was in pain, pain, pain.\n\n[[Page S6416]]\n\n  What did Miss Muldoon-Murray do? She was not a wealthy woman but she \nrefused treatment. She wasn't going to let her son be operated on by \nsomeone whose license was suspended. When a medical crisis required an \nemergency room, a lifesaving spinal surgery, the place they found was \nNew Jersey. It cost them $27,000. The HMO refused to pay the bill.\n  Again, the huge difference between the two pieces of legislation: \nUnder McCain-Edwards-Kennedy, Rene would have had the right to take \nlittle Logan to a pediatric neurosurgeon, even though her plan did not \ninclude one, and the plan would be required to cover the treatment just \nas if it had been administered by a plan doctor.\n\n  Under Frist-Breaux-Jeffords, the health plan would decide whether or \nnot to cover an out-of-plan specialist and Rene would have most likely \nended up in the same place, in an emergency room hundreds of miles \naway, stuck with a $27,000 bill.\n  Again, the difference between these two bills is not simply paper and \npencil. It is not some abstract idea, argued by lawyers. It is real. \nPeople would be alive, people would be not suffering if this bill had \nbeen in effect.\n  How about in Buffalo, at the other end of our State: Bailey Stanek. \nBailey suffers from apnea. This is a sometimes fatal condition in which \na little one stops breathing while sleeping. The HMO refused to pay for \na heart monitor which would warn Bailey's parents if his breathing \nceased. If you have a child with apnea, it is a heart monitor that can \nsave you. His life depended on it. Who would not do this for their \nlittle 8-week-old boy? The Staneks, again not wealthy people, now pay \n$400 a month out of pocket for a heart monitor.\n  These cases go on and on. If McCain-Edwards-Kennedy were around, the \nStaneks could appeal the decision. They could go to an independent, \nobjective review board--not someone sponsored by the HMO who is told by \nthe HMO: if you approve bills of more than a certain amount all told, \nyou are out. This would be an independent, objective review board. Then \nwe would know if little Bailey needed this heart monitor, which most \nphysicians think he would, and they would get a decision.\n  Under the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords plan, this would not have happened. \nWhy? Listen to this, for everyone concerned about this issue. Who \nchooses the review board under the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords plan? The HMO. \nAnd the board cannot make independent decisions about medical \nnecessity. So the choice is very clear.\n  These are just three cases in my State. Look at the case of little \nLogan Muldoon-Murray from Binghamton; the case of the late Tracey Shea, \nfrom Long Island; the case of little Bailey Stanek in Buffalo. In all \nthree cases, because there was not a fair review, because we do not \nhave protections so the doctors could make the decisions--not \nactuaries, not insurance companies--we have had untold suffering. \nMultiply that suffering, not just by the individual child or the young \nwoman in Tracey's case, who suffered, but their parents and brothers \nand sisters, their friends and the community.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if my friend will yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from New York probably remembers the hearing \nwe held about a year ago, when a constituent from New York came to the \nhearing. Her name was Mary Lewandowski. Mary is the mother of the late \nDonna Marie McIlwaine who died when she was only 22 years old. Mary \ncame to tell us the story about her daughter and her experience with \nthe HMO.\n  I will not soon forget Mary's testimony. Mary is not getting paid to \ncome to Washington but she desperately wants the Congress to pass this \npatient protection legislation. Mary told us that her daughter passed \naway on February 8, 1997. Donna had been to the doctor four times in 5 \ndays for an upper-respiratory infection. The doctors couldn't quite \nfigure out what was happening, but her symptoms kept worsening.\n  On the evening of February 8, she was in a tremendous amount of pain, \nher mother said. She called the hospital. The hospital said: No, you \ncan't bring your daughter to the hospital unless it is absolutely life \nor death, or unless you have a doctor's referral. She tried in vain to \nreach Donna's doctor, and an hour later her daughter, Donna, collapsed \ninto a coma and died.\n  After she died, as my colleague from New York will remember, her \nmother told us that she discovered that Donna had a blood clot the size \nof a football in her lung.\n  Donna's doctor later told her mother that a $750 lung scan would \nlikely have identified that blood clot and saved her daughter's life. \nBut the lung scan was not ordered because it could not be justified by \nthe HMO.\n  These are the kinds of problems that are raised related to the \ndevelopment of for-profit medicine. Too often the practice of managed \ncare medicine becomes an enterprise of looking at a patient in terms of \nprofit, rather than evaluating what doctors should provide in terms of \nneeded medical services to patients.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights, or Patient Protection Act, is a piece \nof legislation that says you ought not have to fight your illness or \nyour disease and have to fight the insurance company as well. You ought \nnot have to lose your life because someone said it wasn't worth $750 to \ndo a lung scan on a 22-year-old girl who had a blood clot the size of a \nfootball in her lung. That ought not happen to people.\n  My colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, and I held a hearing in Las \nVegas, NV, for one day. I will never forget that hearing. A mother \nnamed Susan gave riveting testimony. She stood and held up a picture of \nher son, Christopher Thomas for us to see. Christopher Thomas died on \nhis 16th birthday of leukemia. His parents' health plan denied him the \ninvestigational chemotherapy drug he needed. At the end of her \ntestimony Susan held up a large colored picture of her handsome 16-\nyear-old son. She was crying. She said Christopher Thomas had looked up \nat her from his bed as he lay dying of cancer, and said, ``Mom, I don't \nunderstand how they can do this to a kid.''\n  Do what? This young man never got the treatment he needed to help \nfight the cancer that he had. This young boy and his family were put in \na circumstance of having to fight cancer and fight the managed care \norganization at the same time. That was not fair.\n  That is what our patient protection legislation is about. This \nlegislation is about empowering patients who expect to get the health \ncare they are promised.\n  When I heard my colleague from New York speaking, I simply wanted to \ncome to the floor and say that we have had plenty of hearings. \nDiscussion has gone on for some while on the issue of a Patients' \nProtection Act, or Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I will never forget the testimony offered at the hearing during which \nMary, the mother from New York came and talked about her daughter \nDonna, and the hearing in Las Vegas when Susan came and talked about \nher son, Christopher Thomas Roe. I could stand here and cite examples \nfrom testimony after testimony of patients not getting the care they \nneeded. I could discuss endless tragic stories and untimely deaths we \nhave been told about. The sheer numbers of testimonies that reveal \nneedless suffering make me so angry because none of it should have had \nto happen. People should have gotten the health care they deserved. \nThey should have been able to get to an emergency room when they had an \nemergency, or been able to get the treatment they needed when they were \nsuffering from cancer and trying to fight it. Yet in case after case, \nwe discover that someone made a bad decision, and no one was held \naccountable for that decision. The patient wasn't given the medical \ntreatment they deserved.\n\n  Let me quickly say, if I might, to my colleague, that there are some \nwonderful organizations around this country--yes, managed care \norganizations, some insurance companies, and health care \norganizations--that do great work. God bless them every day. But there \nare some who look at patients as profit centers and decide against \nproviding treatment that a patient thinks they are going to get. \nSometimes it is too late when they discover the consequence of that. It \nwas too late for Donna and for Christopher.\n\n[[Page S6417]]\n\n  We are trying, with a piece of legislation, to say it ought not be \ntoo late for any more Americans at any other time to not get the \nmedical care they need. Let us pass this legislation, the Patients' \nProtection Act, so that people in this country can rely on getting the \ncare that they deserve.\n  When I heard the Senator from New York, Senator Schumer speak, I \nwanted to speak and to mention Donna because I know he knows her \nmother, Mary Lewandowski. I know that all of us have the same passion \nto want to do the right thing. We can do this. This will take some \ntime. There will be people coming to the floor saying they don't want \nto do it. They will have objections to our Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Mark Twain was once asked if he would be involved in a debate. He \nreplied: Yes; of course, as long as I can be on the opposing side.\n  They said: We never told you about the subject matter.\n  Mark Twain said: It doesn't matter. It doesn't take any preparation \nat all to take the opposing side and to argue it effectively.\n  We will have some people in Congress say we should not pass this \npatients' protection legislation. They are naysayers.\n  We know in our hearts that this is important legislation for the \nAmerican people. We must do this now.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota. \nAlong with the story I told about three New Yorkers, he added Mary \nLewandowski and her daughter, Donna.\n  I want to add something. Mary has been down here three or four times. \nEach time she comes into my office with her husband. They are not \nwealthy people. They are humble people. A trip from Rochester to \nWashington is not easy for them.\n  But the memory of Donna and what happened to her burns within them. \nThey come and sit by my desk. They try and I try to talk about when \nthis bill might come up and what is preventing it from coming up. I was \nhappy to let them know that since we took over the majority, Senator \nDaschle decided to make this our highest priority. In fact, I have \nasked them if they want to come down and watch a little bit of this \ndebate. It will never bring Donna back, but it will make them feel good \nthat future Donnas will not die in vain.\n  Imagine what they are thinking now--that there is an attempted \nfilibuster to prevent this bill from coming up. This is not legislative \ngamesmanship. It is not an exaggeration in this case to talk about life \nand death. Every one of us, as we traverse our States, hear these \nstories and share the embraces and the tears with the people who have \nbeen damaged more irreparably than any of us have. The only thing we \ncan do is bring our passion, our knowledge, our work, and our sweat, \nblood, and tears to this floor and move this bill.\n  I was glad to hear our leader say that if we have to, we will stay \nhere every day through the Fourth of July break or through the summer \nto get this bill finished. All of us have concerns and our families. We \nwant to be with them. We want to be back in our States. But what could \nbe more important than this?\n  We are so close to the precipice of passing a real bill--the kind of \nbill that has been put together by our colleagues from Massachusetts, \nArizona, and North Carolina. We are right on the edge. How dare we give \nup. How dare we let ourselves be diverted by extraneous issues and \npolitical games.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota as well as so many others. The \nSenator from North Carolina spent the last year working out this \ncompromise with the Senator from Massachusetts because this is so \nimportant.\n  There used to be a slogan in the 1970s. You don't need a weatherman \nto know which way the wind blows. Yes, you are right. We will hear a \nlot of arguments from the other side. But look at every group that is \nrepresented here--the Mary Lewandowskis, the Tracy Sheas, and all of \nthe others. They are on our side. They are for this bill.\n  It is very simple. The only people who seem to be against us are the \nvery people out there who have done these things, not by design but the \nway the system is set up--done these things that have left the gaping \nwounds in so many as they have needlessly lost people.\n\n  It is bad enough to lose somebody you love, but when you know you did \nnot have to lose them, and somebody made a decision somewhere based on \ndollars, the hole in your heart never goes away. We have examples such \nas Mary Lewandowski from Rochester, NY, who has come down here and \nsaid: Please, please, please.\n  I would like to say to Mary--and I think I speak on behalf of the six \nof us in this Chamber--we are not going to give up. We are going to \nmake this fight until we pass this bill, no matter what it takes.\n  With that, I thank my colleagues. I know my time has expired. And I \nthank my friend from Iowa for waiting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to make a brief statement. And I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Iowa be recognized for 15 \nminutes after my statement, and then, with the patience of my friends \nfrom North Carolina and Massachusetts, Senator Clinton was planning to \nbe here at 3 o'clock to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota, and everyone within the sound \nof my voice, we were able to give specific examples of situations that \ndeveloped in New York and Nevada, and other places, as a result of \nsomething very unusual that happened around here; and that is, Senator \nDorgan, as chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, held a series \nof hearings around the Nation. Why? That isn't the ordinary role of the \nDemocratic Policy Committee. But because we were in the minority, we \nwere unable to hold hearings in the committees that had jurisdiction \nover the Patients' Bill of Rights. So Senator Dorgan came up with the \nidea to hold these hearings around the country.\n  I am sure the hearings around the country went as well as the hearing \nin the State of Nevada. If that is the case, which I am certain it is, \nthe Senator from North Dakota deserves all kinds of accolades because \nif he did nothing other than the hearing in Nevada, it said reams about \nwhat is going on in this country regarding the delivery of health care.\n  So I will never, ever forget the hearing we held at the University of \nNevada at Las Vegas on the Patients' Bill of Rights. The men and women, \nthe boys and girls, the doctors and nurses who testified there told us \nwhy we need this bill.\n\n  So I say to my friend from North Dakota, thank you very much for \ncoming up with this unusual procedure so that the American people, and \nthe people of Nevada, know how the rendition of health care is not \ngoing properly--not all the good things, but you were able to put, in a \nvery direct perspective, what was going on in the country in regard to \nhealth care. So I personally appreciate very much you doing what you \ndid because, but for this, we were stymied from explaining to people \nwhat was going on around the country with health care.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I just want to add my thanks to my friend from North \nDakota. Again, just as was the hearing in Nevada, the hearing in New \nYork was moving, factual, and brought the case to real life as to why \nwe need this proposal. And the Senator did. He went around the country, \neverywhere, like Paul Revere, letting people know they didn't have to \njust curse the darkness; that they could actually get something done \nwith legislation that would really matter to people, knowing that this \nis not just a political game.\n  I add my voice to thank the Senator from North Dakota, as chair of \nthe Policy Committee, for the great work he has done.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me ask the Senator from Nevada to \nyield for a moment. Then I know the Senator from Iowa has a statement \nto make. Will the Senator from Nevada yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I did want to take the time to show the picture of the \nyoung 16-year-old man mentioned earlier,\n\n[[Page S6418]]\n\nnamed Christopher Roe. The Senator from Nevada and I both told his \nmother, Susan, that her testimony would make a difference. This is the \npicture Susan held up at our hearing in Las Vegas, NV. As she held up \nthis picture of her 16-year-old son, Susan described the difficulties \nobtaining treatment for Christopher through their managed care \norganization. Susan's family faced these difficulties in addition to \nthe fight Christopher was trying to win in his battle against cancer. \nIt was a battle this young boy lost, and it was a battle that had \nbecome an unfair fight because he had to fight cancer and he and his \nfamily had to fight the managed care organization at the same time.\n  This is the boy who died on his birthday. This is the boy who looked \nup from his bed and said to his mother: Mom, I don't understand how \nthey can do this to a kid--``this'' meaning, how could they not have \nallowed him to get all of the treatment that was necessary to give him \na shot at beating cancer? He died on his 16th birthday.\n  To his mother Susan, who also is a tireless fighter, and who believes \nalso that there must be change, we say your son's memory, I hope, will \ngive all of us in this Chamber the incentive and the initiative and the \npassion to do the right thing and to pass a Patients' Protection Act.\n  I mentioned yesterday that I, too, have lost a child. And I get so \nangry--so angry--sometimes when I hear these stories. I didn't lose a \nchild because of a decision by a managed care organization, but I lost \na child to a disease. And you never, ever get over it.\n  When I see mothers such as Susan, holding up a picture of her son, \nsaying, ``this death should not have happened, I should not have lost \nmy son, my son should have had a chance to live, my son should have \nbeen given the opportunity to fight this cancer that was invading his \nbody'', then I say we ought to have enough passion and we ought to have \nenough determination and grit to stay here until we pass a piece of \nlegislation that says no more Christopher Roes in this country will lie \nin bed dying of cancer having treatment withheld from them; it will \nnever happen again because we will make sure it does not.\n\n  Patients in this country have basic protections and rights, and they \nhave the right to the treatment they need at the time they need it. \nThey have the right to see specialists, and they have the right to know \nall their options for medical treatment, not just the cheapest. They \nhave the right to go to an emergency room when they have an emergency.\n  There are basic protections and rights that are in this legislation \nthat every American deserves to have. We are going to see that we get \nAmericans protected and their rights ensured by the time we finish the \ndebate on this important legislation.\n  I thank my colleague from Nevada. And again I say to Susan, and all \nof the other mothers and fathers who have testified at the hearings I \nhave held, your testimony was not in vain. We have put together a \nrecord that demonstrates the need to pass this legislation, and we \nintend to do just that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I first say a big thank you to Senator \nKennedy for his many years of leadership on this issue, and also thank \nSenator Edwards for his leadership and sponsorship of this bill, along \nwith Senator McCain.\n  This is not a new issue in this Chamber. Senator Kennedy led the \nbattle on this, starting about 5 years ago, if I am not mistaken. We \npassed it last year, as you know. The House passed a good bill, but the \nSenate passed a rather bad bill. We went to conference, and we could \nnot get anything out of conference. We used to meet periodically over \nhere in a room, in Senator Nickles' room, to try to hammer things out, \nbut it became clear that the more we met, the less that was going to \nget done. So now we have a chance, this year, to catch up on all that \nand to pass this meaningful legislation.\n  I believe we are on the verge of a big victory for the American \npeople. They have been waiting too long for this in the waiting rooms--\nabout 5 years--where mothers, fathers, and children have been forced to \nspend countless hours negotiating the massive bureaucracy of their \nmanaged care plans, desperately trying to get the health care services \nthey need and deserve.\n  Unfortunately, it is clear that the opponents of a Patients' Bill of \nRights are not giving up their fight. They may succeed in convincing a \nfew to delay it for a few more days, but they are not going to be \nsuccessful in stopping the Senate from passing the protections that \npatients should have had years ago.\n  Right now, as I understand, we have an objection from the Republican \nside to proceed to the bill, an objection from the Republican side to \nnot even take the bill up. That is unfortunate, but I think it \nindicates that we have to be resolute in our determination to answer \nthe call of our patients all over America.\n  We do not have to look too hard to see that there are too many people \nbeing denied appropriate care. We have all heard the horror stories of \nindividuals unable to see their doctor in a timely manner, of patients \nunable to access the specialists they need. We just heard a number of \nstories from the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from New \nYork. I am certain we will hear many more as we are here in this \nChamber during this debate.\n  These are all individuals who have been denied the treatment their \ndoctor has recommended or their health specialist has recommended \nbecause the HMO simply doesn't want to pay the bill.\n  I hope we will all remember, as we hear all these stories coming out, \nthat those are the ones we know about. That is just the tip of the \niceberg. Think about the many more Americans who have been denied the \ncare but in their desperation they went elsewhere. Maybe they paid for \nit out of their pocket; they moved on with their lives. The stories we \nhear are the tip of the iceberg. There are many more about which we \ndon't know. These are real stories and these are real people. These are \nreal hurts they have.\n  It is very simple: Your HMO either fulfills its promises to pay for \nmedically necessary services or it doesn't. We have heard enough to \nknow that in too many cases it doesn't. As I said, I didn't have to \nlook very far to find such situations in my own State of Iowa.\n  Let me relate the story of Eric from Cedar Falls who has had health \ninsurance through his employer. Eric is 28 years old with a wife and \ntwo children. He suffered cardiac arrest while helping out at a \nwrestling clinic. He was rushed to the hospital where he was \nfortunately resuscitated. But tragically, while in cardiac arrest, \nEric's brain was deprived of sufficient oxygen. He fell into a coma and \nwas placed on life support. The neurosurgeon on call recommended that \nEric's parents get him into rehabilitation.\n  It was then that the problems began. Although Eric's policy covered \nrehabilitation, his insurance company refused to cover his care at a \nfacility that specialized in patients with brain injury. Well, \nthankfully, Eric's parents were able to find another rehabilitation \nfacility in Iowa. Eric began to improve. His heart pump was removed, \nhis respirator was removed, and his lungs are now working fine. But \neven with this progress, Eric's family received a call from his \ninsurance company saying they would no longer cover the cost of his \nrehabilitation because he was not progressing fast enough.\n  Eric's mother wrote to me and said:\n\n       This is when we found out we had absolutely no recourse. \n     They can deny any treatment and even cause death, and they \n     are not responsible.\n\n  In the coming weeks in this Chamber, we have a critical choice before \nus. We can choose for Eric and his family. We can choose between real \nor illusionary protections. We can choose between ensuring health care \nfor millions of Americans or perpetuating the burgeoning profit margins \nof the managed care industry.\n  I have been working on this issue with my colleagues for over 5 \nyears. Last year I was a conferee trying to work out this bill with the \nHouse. It came to naught. We have debated this issue for years. We have \nnegotiated differences of opinion to find common ground. We have worked \nacross party lines to develop the best bill possible. I am delighted to \nsay that amendments I offered during the past debates, such as access \nto specialists and provider nondiscrimination, have been incorporated\n\n[[Page S6419]]\n\ninto the underlying bill. S. 1052 truly represents the best of all of \nour collective ideas and, most importantly, meets the needs of the \nAmerican people.\n  Our bill establishes a minimum level of patient protections by which \nmanaged care plans must abide. States can, and it is my hope that they \nwill, provide even greater protections, as necessary for individuals in \nHMOs in their States. As a starting point, we need to pass a strong and \nsubstantive Patient Protection Act.\n  S. 1052, our Patients' Bill of Rights Act, delivers on what Americans \nwant and what they need: Real protection against abuse; direct access \nto needed specialists, especially pediatrics specialists and OB/GYNs \nfor women; the right for patients to see a doctor not on their HMO \nlist, if the list does not include a provider qualified to treat their \nillness; access to the closest emergency room; the right for patients \nwith ongoing serious or chronic conditions such as cancer or arthritis \nor heart disease to see their medical specialist without asking for \npermission from their HMO or primary care doctor every time they need \nto see their specialist; the right for patients to continue to see \ntheir doctor through a course of treatment or a pregnancy, even if the \nHMO drops their doctor from its list or their employer changes HMOs.\n\n  This is so important. Right now, so many people in managed care plans \nare seeing a doctor for a course of treatment. It could be a difficult \npregnancy. The mother-to-be has every confidence in this specialist. \nThen her employer changes HMOs and this doctor is not on their approved \nlist, not on their list for HMOs. Many HMOs will just drop that.\n  What this bill says is: If you started on a course of treatment, you \ncan continue to see the doctor of your choice through that course of \ntreatment even if the HMO has changed or if they have dropped the \ndoctor from their list.\n  This bill has the right for patients to get the prescription drug \ntheir doctor says they need, not an inferior substitute that the HMO \nchooses because it is cheaper.\n\n\n                     Congratulating Senator Cleland\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate very much the senior Senator from Iowa \nyielding. The hour is almost over, and I do want to call attention to \nan important matter for me personally, for our caucus, and certainly \nfor the Senate.\n  Our colleague from Georgia, Senator Cleland, has never had the \nopportunity to preside before, in large measure because we have not \nbeen in the majority during the time he has been in the Senate. I want \nto call attention to the fact that Max Cleland, our colleague from \nGeorgia, has been the Presiding Officer for this last hour. I \ncongratulate him. I wish him well as he pursues his golden gavel of 100 \nhours of presiding. I compliment him on the way he has presided and \nthank him very much for his willingness to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair thanks the majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank our leader for pointing that out. I, too, \ncongratulate my friend and dear colleague from Georgia for being a good \nfriend of mine and for being a great Senator.\n  A patient should have the right to appeal an HMO's decision to deny \nor delay care to an independent entity and to receive a binding and \ntimely decision and, finally, the right to hold HMOs accountable when \ntheir decisions to deny or delay care lead to injury or death.\n  It was my friend from North Carolina, Senator Edwards, who said \nearlier that there are only two groups in the United States that can't \nbe sued--diplomats and HMOs. It is time to end the HMO diplomatic \nimmunity in this country and to allow them to be held accountable.\n\n  I know there is a lot of talk about the right to sue. Let's face it: \nMost of the situations will be resolved through the strong and binding \nappeals process that is in the bill. But the HMOs should not have \nspecial immunity when they harm patients. The reality is that unless \nHMOs are held accountable when they make inappropriate medical \ndecisions that harm a patient, there is no guarantee that they will \nchange their ways and stop putting profits before patients.\n  As this debate unfolds, I know that I and others will be coming to \nthe floor to point out the tremendous profit margins some of these \nmanaged care industries have. When you think about it, that is hundreds \nof billions of dollars a year being sucked out of medical care that \npeople need in this country and given to their shareholders or \nsometimes to a very small group who happen to own the HMO or the \nmanaged care system.\n  I don't mind HMOs making profits--that is fine--but they should not \nbe able to make these unconscionably high profits by disallowing \nappropriate care for patients. That is what I mean. The HMOs cannot \ncontinue to put profits ahead of patients.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I wonder if my colleague will yield for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield to my colleague and friend and a \ngreat leader on this issue.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, one of the reasons we are beginning this \nimportant discussion of an issue that will affect the lives of so many \nAmericans is that for years now you have helped lead the fight on HMO \nreform, on a real Patients' Bill of Rights and on patient protection. I \nhad the honor last year, during the Presidential campaign, of visiting \nin the Senator's State.\n  I say to my colleague, I heard over and over everywhere I went around \nthe State the passionate feelings people in your State have for the \nfight that you have waged on behalf of real people and families and \nchildren to try to protect them against HMO abuses.\n  I wonder if the Senator would mind sharing with us what the people in \nhis State have said to him in town hall meetings, visits on the street \ncorner about how they feel about a clerk sitting behind a desk \nsomewhere overruling experienced, well-trained doctors and nurses as to \nhealth care decisions that can literally affect the lives of their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. HARKIN. First, I thank my friend from North Carolina for his kind \nwords and for visiting my State. I invite him back soon and often. I \nthank the Senator from North Carolina for his great leadership on this \nissue, and I am delighted to be a soldier in his army to fight this \nbattle and make sure our patients get decent care.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nstatement of Senator Clinton--she will speak for 15 minutes when she \narrives--the Republicans be recognized for 1 hour following that time \nto make up for the time we have used.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the one thing I ask of my friends on the \nminority side today, Senator Zell Miller has asked to come over. When \nhe shows up, after a Republican speaker finishes his statement, perhaps \nSenator Miller can speak, and you would wind up getting your full hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was at a town hall meeting in Iowa, \nwhere I first heard this comment made by a gentleman who I think really \nbrought it all home. He said to me: I don't want my doctor doing my \ntaxes, and I don't want my accountant deciding my health care needs. To \nme, that sort of brought it all home and pointed out what we are trying \nto do: let the doctors and health care professionals make the \ndecisions, and not the accountants, on what kind of health care we \nneed.\n  As I said earlier, the stories we hear about the lack of medical care \nfrom people in HMOs in Iowa--again, this is the tip of the iceberg. We \nare going to hear a lot of stories. These are real people with real \ninjuries and real hurt. We have to keep in mind that these are just the \nones we know about. How many more that we don't know about are out \nthere?\n  I retold a story here about Eric, a 28-year-old man who was working \nand had a wife with two kids. He was helping out at a wrestling clinic \nand he had cardiac arrest. They rushed him in and he was resuscitated. \nHis brain had been denied sufficient oxygen, so he needed special \nrehabilitation. The neurosurgeon recommended to his family to\n\n[[Page S6420]]\n\nget him into rehabilitation. His insurance policy covered \nrehabilitation, but his insurance company refused to cover his care at \na rehabilitation facility that specialized in brain-injured \nrehabilitation. So his family took him to another place in Iowa. He \nbegan his rehabilitation.\n  The good news is that he had progressed very well. The heart pump was \nremoved, the respirator was removed, and his lungs are now working \nfine. But just at this point, the HMO calls his family and says they \nwill no longer cover the cost of his rehabilitation because he is not \nmaking enough progress fast enough. I would never have known about this \nexcept that his mother wrote me a letter and said: This is when we \nfound out we had absolutely no recourse. They can deny any treatment \nand even cause death and they are not responsible.\n\n  I hear stories such as this all over my State. That is why we need to \nmove ahead aggressively and why we have to keep in mind, when this \ndebate occurs and we hear all these amendments being proposed, that we \nare talking about real people, real consequences, and real hurt that is \nhappening to these families. The need is clear.\n  This bill is not about doctors, nurses, or politicians; it is about \npatients, about our friends and our families when they get sick and \nthey need to have the peace of mind that the health care they need and \ndeserve--and that they have already paid for--will be available in a \ntimely manner.\n  We have a chance to pass real and responsible legislation. The time \nis now. The American people have been in the waiting room for far too \nlong. It is time to pass a meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights. Let's \nnot delay any longer. We will have the debate. Let's have the \namendments that are pertinent. Let's get it done once and for all.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his strong \nleadership in this battle over a very long period of time. As the \nSenator was mentioning in the beginning of his remarks, this has been a \n5-year pilgrimage, where those who have fought for this legislation \nhave effectively been denied the opportunity to bring this measure up \non its own in the Senate. The Senator can remember last year when we \nhad actually a numerical majority in this body, bipartisan in nature, \nwho would have voted for this. But we were denied that opportunity. \nNow, as the first order of business under the leadership of Senator \nDaschle--I think it was the first comment he made after assuming \nleadership, that this was going to be a first priority following \ncompletion of the education bill.\n  I have a couple of questions because I, too, have had the good \nopportunity, as the Senator from North Carolina has, to travel to Iowa. \nMore importantly, I have had the good opportunity of working closely \nwith the Senator in the development of this legislation. The Senator \ncan agree with me that the protections we have in this bill are \nbasically pretty mainstream kinds of protections that I think families \ncould recognize right at the outset. I don't have the particular chart \nhere. We will have an opportunity to get into those as the debate \nproceeds.\n  We are talking about emergency room coverage and about specialty \ncare, and we are talking about clinical trials and OB/GYN; and we are \ntalking about prohibiting gagging doctors and talking about continuity \nof care and about point of service, so we can make sure we can get the \nbest treatment for families needing those kinds of protections. The \nlist goes on: prescription drugs, the right kinds of prescription \ndrugs, and then appeals, internal and external, and then accountability \nprovisions.\n  Doesn't the Senator, at times, wonder with me what are the particular \nprotections in there to which the opponents object? What are the \nprotections to which they most object? They say: We can't do this; we \noppose this; we won't let you bring this up.\n  These are basic kinds of protections which, as the Senator knows, are \neither protections that exist under Medicare or Medicaid or have been \nrecommended by the insurance commissioners who are not known to be \nDemocrats or necessarily Republicans--pretty bipartisan and nonpartisan \nin most States. The only provisions that we have taken in the Patients' \nBill of Rights--additional protections--were those that were \nunanimously recommended by a bipartisan commission that was set up \nunder President Clinton. They were unanimously recommended, without \ndissent effectively.\n  They recommended that the HMO association adopt them. We said, \nbecause they were so important, to protect them we would put them in as \na floor to make sure they are accepted. Does the Senator not wonder \nwith me what the principal objectives are?\n  Finally, let me ask, does the Senator not believe that every day we \nfail to pass this legislation people are being hurt?\n  I took the opportunity yesterday to mention briefly what the Kaiser \nFoundation has found and what the various studies show. They show that \nevery day we fail to take action, families, real people--parents, \nmothers, fathers, sons, daughters--their injuries are being expanded \nand their hurt and suffering is increased and enhanced because we are \nfailing to pass this legislation.\n  Doesn't the Senator agree that for all of these reasons, and others, \nthe importance of passing this legislation in a timely way, the \nimportance of passing it now, the importance of supporting our leader \nand saying let's finish before we consider other work, deserves the \nsupport of everyone in this body?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Massachusetts for postulating this \nquestion because it is really important. Before I answer it, I again \nthank the Senator for his 5 years of leadership. The Senator from \nMassachusetts was the leader on this issue when it started 5 years ago. \nHe was our leader last year, and he is our leader again this year \ntrying to bring to the American people commonsense decency.\n  As the Senator said, there is nothing in the bill that would not meet \nthe test of good old common sense.\n  Yes, I want to know if those on the other side who oppose this are \ngoing to offer an amendment that says, no; if a woman is seeing an OB/\nGYN, if she is having a difficult pregnancy--this may be a specialist \nin whatever the difficulty might be. But then the woman's employer \nchanges HMOs and drops the doctor. Right now they can refuse to pay \nthat specialist. She would have to go to someone else and start over.\n  Doesn't it make common sense that she should at least be able to see \nthat specialist through the end of her pregnancy, the birth, and have \nthat same specialist see her? That is common sense.\n  I question out loud, will someone on the other side offer an \namendment to disallow that? Fine, if they want to do that, if that is \ntheir opinion. I want to see how many people vote against something \nsuch as that. That is just common sense.\n  Or a person with a disability who has to see a specialist on a \ncontinuing basis, I cannot tell the Senator--he knows this as well as I \ndo; he has been very supportive.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, has the time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The time has expired.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, the time is to change at 3:15 p.m. We \nask that be done.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I will finish with 1 more minute.\n  As I was saying to my friend from Massachusetts, many people with \ndisabilities have to see a specialist, but so many times it is hard for \na person with a physical disability to get out, get the bus, get \nspecial transportation. Now they have to see the gatekeeper every time.\n  The HMO says: No, you have to come in and qualify for each and every \ntime you want to see that specialist. This bill does away with that.\n  Will someone offer an amendment that says to someone with a \ndisability: I do not care; you have to go through that gatekeeper time \nafter time to see the specialist you need to see.\n  I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts; the bipartisan \ncommission worked this out. These are commonsense approaches. You can \ntake this bill to any townhall meeting in Massachusetts, Iowa, or \nArkansas and lay it out for average Americans, and they will say: Yes, \nthis makes sense. This bill makes sense and that is why we have to do \nit.\n\n[[Page S6421]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have spoken with the manager of the \nbill, the Senator from New Hampshire. He made a very valuable \nsuggestion. I ask to revise the unanimous consent agreement that is \nbefore us. I ask unanimous consent that the Republicans have control of \nthe time speaking as in morning business until 4 o'clock, and \nthereafter, until direction of the majority leader, we will go on the \nhalf hour, from 4 to 4:30 p.m. will be Democrats, from 4:30 p.m. to 5 \np.m. will be Republicans until we decide we have had enough for the \nnight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I thank the assistant majority leader for \nhelping organize the speeches this afternoon. There are a lot of \nMembers who want to talk on this bill. That is reflective of the fact \nand one of the reasons why we cannot move immediately into the \namendment process. It is not that we on this side are not interested in \nmoving to the amendment process; we honestly are. There are many on our \nside champing at the bit to get into this bill and amend it and address \nfundamental issues.\n  We also on our side want to have the opportunity to bring forward \nsubstantive and thoughtful approaches on how to address this issue in \nan even more effective way than the bill before us that has been \ndrafted by Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy.\n  The point, however, is that we just got this bill. It was one bill on \nWednesday of last week. Then it was a different bill on Thursday. We \nhave had 2 working days. We are talking about the bill, but it is a \nmoving target for us. To get up to speed on it takes a little time, and \nthere are a lot of people who want to talk about that, a lot of people \nwho have had intimate knowledge with what has been going on with this \nissue for a long time but are not familiar with the specifics of the \nMcCain-Kennedy bill and, therefore, believe they need some time to be \nbrought up to speed before getting into the amendment process.\n  I note as an aside, and I think it is important to note, this is one \nof the most far-reaching and important pieces of legislation we will \naddress as a Senate this year, certainly on the authorizing level. We \njust completed another major piece of legislation, the education bill, \nwhich is extremely important legislation. We spent 2 weeks--actually \n2\\1/2\\ weeks--on the motion to proceed to the education bill. That was \nwhen the Republican Party held the majority in the Senate. At that \ntime, I did not hear Senators from the other side saying we were moving \ntoo slowly as we are now hearing today from Senators on the other side, \neven though we have not spent more than 6 hours on the issue of whether \nwe should proceed. It seems to me there are a few crocodile tears on \nthat issue.\n  There is a legitimate reason for not immediately moving to the bill, \nand that is we do not know what the bill is, and we do not know the \nspecifics of the bill. We should have a chance to read it before we \nproceed to it.\n  I use the very excellent example of the position of Members of the \nother side of the aisle when we were taking up the education bill when \nthey suggested we do 2 weeks. We are not going to suggest 2 weeks, but \nwe are going to suggest a reasonable amount of time to proceed on the \nissue of reviewing the bill before we address it.\n  This probably would not have been necessary if we had had hearings on \nthis bill. One must remember, there has not been a hearing on this bill \nthat is being brought before us even though it is extremely important \nlegislation. In fact, in the Senate, there have been no hearings on the \nissue of patients' rights in 2 years--since March of 1999.\n  We have taken up the language of the Patients' Bill of Rights a \ncouple of times, but we have not done any hearings in the committee \nthat has jurisdiction or responsibility in the last 2 years.\n  That is important because at those hearings, we could have gotten \nconstructive input. If we had had hearings on this bill, for example, \nwe would have seen a number of people from communities across this \ncountry coming forward--small business people, people who are running \nmom-and-pop businesses with 9, 10, 15, 20, 30 employees saying: Listen, \nthe hardest thing I have in my business is the cost of health \ninsurance. I want to insure my employees. I want health insurance for \nthem, but if the McCain bill passes, I will not be able to afford \nhealth insurance because I suddenly will not only be buying health \ninsurance, I will be buying lawsuits. Instead of the present law which \ninsulates the small employer especially from being sued for medical \nmalpractice or medical malfeasance or medical events that their \nemployees incur in the process of dealing with the health insurer with \nwhich the small business individual has contracted, instead of having \nthat insulation, that goes down, the wall goes down.\n  Under this bill, those employers, those small mom-and-pop employers \nespecially--all employers for that matter--will suddenly find \nthemselves being sued for medical issues.\n  A person who runs a restaurant with 30 employees is probably saying: \nI don't mind being sued if I put out a bad meal and somebody gets sick. \nThat is my responsibility. But if one of my employees to whom I have \ngiven health insurance, which I think is important to them, goes to the \nlocal doctor and the doctor doesn't treat them correctly or they get \nbad advice from their insurance company on the way they should have \nbeen treated or their options, why should I, as the owner of the little \nrestaurant, end up being drawn into that lawsuit? But I will be under \nthis law, under this proposal as it is structured.\n  I find it consistently ironic that the Senator from North Carolina, \nwho has his name on this bill, continues to say employers are not \nsubject to suits when the bill specifically says employers are subject \nto suits. It says it in two places that are very significant.\n  He suggested I read his bill. I did read his bill. I might suggest he \nalso take a look at his bill because it does not appear he has, if he \ncontinues to conclude employers are not subject to liability. No. 1, \nthe language is, as we mentioned earlier on page 144, very specific. \nGranted, the headlines for the language are ``exclusion of employers \nand other plan sponsors.'' But when it gets to part (B), it says, \n``notwithstanding [anything] in subparagraph (A), a cause of action may \narise against an employer or other plan sponsor. . . .''\n  That is the term, ``employer.'' I define ``employer'' as employer, \nnot insurance company. I think anybody else would, too. So right there, \nat the base of it, employers are sued under this bill, and for a \nsignificant amount of responsibility here, because the definition of \nwhat an employer is going to be sued for goes on to say, ``where the \nemployer participated--had direct participation by the employer or \nother sponsors in the decision of the plan.''\n  Direct participation has become an extremely broad term, as I \nmentioned earlier today. Basically, if the employer says, as you are \nheading off to the hospital--you are working for the restaurant; there \nare 30 people at the restaurant and you get burned in the kitchen and \nthe employer says, you have to get down to the hospital, let me make \nsure you get to this hospital versus that hospital, the employer is \nlibel. The employer is libel for how you are treated at that hospital \nunder this bill.\n  Then there is this new cause of action, which is a massive new \nexpansion of the ability of people to be sued, employers specifically, \nunder this bill. This new cause of action is created by subsection 302, \nsubsection (A)(ii), I think it is the right cite, on page 141 of \nSenator McCain's bill:\n\n       . . . otherwise fail to exercise ordinary care in the \n     performance of a duty under the terms or conditions of a plan \n     with respect to a participant or beneficiary.\n\n  Then, the agent or the plan sponsor is subject to be sued. Plan \nsponsors are, by definition of ERISA, employers. That is very clear, \nunequivocal in ERISA. So we are talking about the fact that there is \nnow a new Federal cause of action for what amounts to the failure of a \nplan, the insurer, to give information which traditionally had been \nmanaged through regulatory activity--the failure of that plan to do a \nwhole series of things.\n  I put up a list earlier of potentially 200 different places, between \nCOBRA, HIPAA, and ERISA, that you would have a cause of action that \ncould be\n\n[[Page S6422]]\n\nbrought on an activity of the insurer or people who are involved in the \nplan in a ministerial way as employers. They would now be subject to \nlawsuits in a Federal action. There would now be a Federal action \nagainst them on that in over 200 different places--not quite 200, \nsomewhere around 200 different places where employers could be sued.\n\n  I understand--I was not here but it was represented to me by people \nwho were here--that, once again, the Senator from North Carolina said \nthat is not true; that only counts if it is a medically reviewable \nevent. Then that brings in the employer.\n  I don't know. I think I can read language. The language is abundantly \nclear, and I don't think you can reach that conclusion because the \nlanguage is clear. The language the Senator quoted in support of that \nposition, which actually is a 180 degree exact opposite conclusion of \nwhat the Senator from North Carolina said, the point he was making, if \nit was correctly represented to me.\n  Under clause (2), again of 302, it says:\n\n       In General.--A cause of action is established under \n     paragraph (1)(A) only if the decision referred to in clause \n     (i) or the failure described in clause (ii) does not \n     [``not''] include a medically reviewable decision.\n\n  Just the opposite. It is not because there is a medically reviewable \ndecision that you get brought into this. It is because there was no \nmedically reviewable decision, which means all these ministerial \nevents, which have unlimited liability attached to them, can create the \nlawsuits against employers.\n  So employers are going to be hit with a plethora of new lawsuits from \nattorneys across this country. This is a whole new industry. We will \nhave to probably build another 20 or 30 law schools across this country \njust to take care of all the new lawyers who are going to join the \ntrade in order to make money suing people under this McCain-Kennedy \nbill. We are going to have to expand law schools radically, which may \nbe good for law schools but I am not sure it is good for our society as \na whole.\n  I want to go into a little more depth here, if I have a minute--I \nunderstand somebody else is coming to speak--on the specifics so I get \nit right, especially on this whole issue of the Federal tort claim, \nthis new Federal action. This is a huge event which should not be \nunderestimated. It is technical but it is huge and the implications are \nradical. We are going to get a chart put up just to make it a little \neasier for people to understand.\n  Basically what this bill does is it creates two new types of lawsuits \nin Federal court. Under the first type of action, participants can sue \nover a failure to exercise ordinary care in making nonmedically \nreviewable claims determinations. The second Federal cause of action \nbroadly allows suits for failure to perform a duty under the terms and \nconditions of the plan. Remedies available under the two new claims, \nthese two new ERISA claims, include unlimited economic and noneconomic \ndamages and up to $5 million in what this new euphemism is, ``civil \npenalties,'' otherwise known as punitive damages. I guess that was too \npunitive a word to put into this bill so they used the words ``civil \npenalties.''\n  They have created these claims. They have taken the tops off the \nliability and basically said, OK, go find an employer and shoot him \ndead with unlimited economic damages, unlimited noneconomic damages, \nand $5 million in punitive damages.\n  The second new ERISA claim, the terms and conditions in the one I \njust talked about, is extremely broad, covering virtually any \nadministrative action that does not involve a claim for benefits, \nincluding the S. 1052 McCain bill new patient protection requirements \nunder COBRA and HIPAA.\n  The McCain bill establishes a complicated scheme which attempts to \nlimit Federal and State suits against employers provided the employer \ndoes not directly participate in the decision in question. It is a very \ncomplicated scheme, but what is the effect of it? The effect of this \ndirect participation at this time will mean that employer protections \nare essentially meaningless for suits alleging a failure under the \nterms and conditions of the plan.\n  Further, the McCain-Kennedy bill continues to allow unfettered class \naction suits--including suits against employers--where no limits on \ndamages would apply under the current law provisions of ERISA or other \nFederal statutes, including the RICO statute.\n  So you have, first, a whole new set of Federal claims created against \nemployers, unlimited economic damages, unlimited noneconomic damages \nand $5 million of punitive damages, which essentially have a figleaf \nentry level that any good lawyer is going to be able to punch through \ncalled directed participation. Then you have the continuation of class \naction suits giving lawyers another forum with things such as the RICO \nstatute.\n  Because employers inherently carry out their duties under the ERISA's \nstatutory scheme, the McCain-Kennedy bill will leave employers wide \nopen to new Federal personal injury suits. Employers will be sued based \non alleged errors in:\n  Offering continuation coverage and providing notices under COBRA;\n  Providing certification of prior credible coverage under HIPAA's \nportability rules;\n  Distributing summary plan descriptions; describing the plan's claim \nprocedures under the plan; and describing the plan's medical necessity \nor experimental care benefit exclusions.\n  Here are some of the others:\n  Also, providing notices of material reduction in group health plan \nbenefits as required by ERISA.\n  These are all areas where they can be sued.\n  Also, responding to requests for additional group health plan \ndocuments under ERISA; and, finally, group health plan reports under \nthe Department of Labor.\n  In all of these areas they can be sued. The list goes on and on. \nEmployers cannot be sued on this today. All of this is new. This is a \nbrand new litigation area.\n  As I said, we will need to add many new law schools in order to \nabsorb all the new lawyers we will need in order to bring all of these \nlawsuits.\n  The McCain-Kennedy bill proposes up to $5 million for punitive \ndamages for COBRA, HIPAA reporting, and disclosure violations despite \nthe fact that all of these requirements have their own specific ERISA \nenforcement provisions.\n  In other words, under present law, there are already enforcement \nprovisions for this activity and the ones I just listed. But they don't \nrun to the employer to benefit the patient. The patient doesn't have an \nindividual cause of action in this area. Rather, these are strong \nadministrative procedures which keep the employer from violating the \npurposes of ERISA. But now we have punitive damages up to $5 million, \nunlimited economic damages, and unlimited noneconomic damages.\n  Some of the things that occur today in order to enforce these laws \nbut which do not involve private cause of action as created under the \nbill are as follows:\n  There is a $100 per day excise tax penalty under Code section \n4980B(b) violations of the COBRA requirements--tax penalties are up to \n$500,000 for employers and $2 million for insurers. There is an \nadditional $100 per day civil penalty under ERISA section 502(c) for \nfailing to satisfy the COBRA notice requirements. Plan participants may \nsue employers and insurers--for benefits and injunctive relief under \nERISA section 502.\n  There is a $100 per day excise tax penalty under Code section \n4980D(b) and a $100 per day penalty under section 2722(b)(2) of the \nPublic Health Service Act for violations of the HIPAA preexisting \nconditions limitations provisions. In addition, plan participants may \nsue for benefits and injunctive relief under ERISA section 502.\n  Willful violations of ERISA's reporting and disclosure rules, \nincluding the requirements relating to the provision of SPD and \ndocuments upon request, are subject to criminal fines and imprisonment \nunder ERISA section 501.\n  Failure to provide documents upon request is subject to civil \npenalties under ERISA section 502(c).\n  So you already have a very extensive administrative and legal \nliability situation for employers and insurers that do not meet the \nconditions of COBRA, HIPAA, and ERISA. But what you are now layering on \ntop of that is a brand new concept where you have a private right of \naction, where individuals can go out and allege these violations as\n\n[[Page S6423]]\n\npart of the injury they claim they received and have a whole new cause \nof action against the employer.\n  What small-time employer--what employer, period--is going to want to \nkeep a health plan if they have that level of liability facing them?\n  McCain-Kennedy would impose potentially huge new compensatory and \npunitive damages remedies for violations of COBRA, HIPAA, and ERISA's \ndisclosure requirements. Moreover, under the statute's own \nrequirements, the employer is specifically required to carry out COBRA \nand disclosure requirements--the employer is almost always the \nadministrator. Thus, McCain-Kennedy imposes a huge new liability on \nemployers that employers cannot avoid; despite the fact that when \nCongress adopted COBRA and HIPAA with large bipartisan majorities no \ndiscussion was given to the need for punitive damages to enforce the \nnew requirements.\n  Practically what you have here is a decision by the drafters of this \nbill to say we are not really so much interested in delivering better \nhealth care and in giving patients better health care; we are really \ninterested in creating a massive new opportunity for lawsuits.\n  In doing that, I think they are accomplishing one of the goals--which \nI believe is a subliminal goal and maybe a more formal goal in truism--\nwhich is to create more people who are not ensured because that can be \nthe only conclusion from their lawsuit structure. The only thing that \ncan come from all of these lawsuits, from all of these new causes of \naction, and from all of the new pressures it will put on employers is \nthat fewer employers will insure their employees, especially small \nemployers.\n  Inevitably, there will be more uninsured. Why would anybody be for \nmore uninsured? If you are around here and you want to pass a national \nhealth care plan, the biggest argument you have in your favor is that \nthere are too many uninsured in our country, that the only way to \nhandle the uninsured is to nationalize the system and put everybody \ninto a national plan so everybody is covered.\n  We heard that argument interminably in 1993 when there were only 23 \nmillion uninsured. After 8 years of the Clinton administration, there \nare now something like 42 million uninsured. We have increased the \nnumber of uninsured people by 19 million over this approximately 8-year \nperiod when we were supposed to be improving our health care delivery \nsystem. And the call for a national plan will grow and grow as the \nnumber of uninsured grow.\n  If you pass this proposal, because of the costs it will create on \nemployers and because of the increased cost in the insurance premiums, \nwhich the Congressional Budget Office scored at 4.2 for every 1 percent \nof increased cost, CBO estimates that 300,000 people will drop \ninsurance. So 1.2 million people are going to drop their health care \ninsurance.\n  Couple with that this huge, newly built, unintended consequence--\nintended consequence; it is not unintended at all--which will be that \nemployers, and especially small employers, will simply say, I am not \ngoing to run the risk of being put out of business by these lawsuits \nwhich bring me personally into the fray.\n  Then you have the result that more and more people will become \nuninsured. Thus, more and more pressure is created in the marketplace \nof politics for a nationalized plan.\n  You have to remember, if you are a small businessperson and you are \nemploying 20, 30, or 50, or even 100 people, and you are confronted \nwith one of these law lawsuits--which you suddenly find you are \nconfronted with because the Federal law has the ability of making you \npersonally liable because you happen to be the employer or the health \nplan sponsor--what is your alternative? What are your alternatives as a \nsmall businessperson? You have to go out and hire an attorney. How much \nis that going to cost you? It will cost literally tens of thousands of \ndollars probably to defend yourself in court or you have to settle the \nsuit. Even though you don't believe you owe anything, you have to \nsettle the suit rather than pay the attorneys or you decide to pay the \nperson who brought the suit. That is going to cost you a lot of money.\n  Either way, as a small employer, if you are running a mom-and-pop \nrestaurant, it will probably wipe out your profit because you suddenly \nfind that you are subject to lawsuits to which you were never subject \nbefore simply because you gave health insurance to your employees. It \nis absolutely the wrong result. We have heard a lot from the other side \nof the aisle about individuals who had serious problems with HMOs. We \nare all sympathetic to those individuals. Photographs that have been \nbrought to this Chamber--and brought to this Chamber last time--by \nMembers from different States are very moving photographs. But you have \nto remember, that is not the issue here because the proposal put \nforward by Senator Nickles last time, the proposal put forward by \nSenators Frist, Breaux, and Jeffords, and the proposal from Senators \nKennedy and McCain, all take care of those individuals' concerns. Those \nare straw men. None of those folks, I suspect--or the vast majority of \nthem; I suspect none of them--would have the problems they had with \ntheir HMO if any one of those three bills passed because all those \nbills had a very aggressive procedure for redress for the person who \nbelieves they are not getting fair treatment from their HMO--very \naggressive.\n\n  All of those bills had very extensive proposals for coverage of \ndifferent types of services which people believe they have a right to, \nand should be able to get, and should not have to have their HMO \ntelling them what it is they should have and what it is they should not \nhave--whether it is their OB/GYN or specialists or a primary care \nprovider. All of them have that language or rely on State law which has \nthat language and which is equal to the language in the bill that is \nbeing proposed.\n  So those issues, as compelling as they are, truly are not relevant to \nthe debate in this Chamber because under anything that passes this \nChamber, you have a 100-percent vote to take care of those issues.\n  The question before this Chamber is whether or not we are going to \ndrive up the costs of health care by creating new liability for \nemployers, forcing employers to drop health care, and whether or not we \nare going to usurp the authority of States to set out their ideas as to \nhow to address this issue, where many States have already done an \nextraordinarily good job and really do not need a Federal law in order \nto protect their citizenry because the protections have already \noccurred.\n  There are a lot of other issues in here, too--lesser issues. But \nthose are the two big ones. That is what this debate is about. It is \nnot about the folks who have not been treated well because those folks \nare going to be treated well under whatever bill passes. And it is not \nabout people not being able to go to their health care provider and get \nthe type of specialists or the type of treatment they want in a context \nwhich everyone would describe as reasonable because that is in every \none of these bills.\n  It is about the cost of health care, the liability of employers, and \nthe usurpation of States rights with States having the opportunity to \nlegislate in the area of insurance which for years is something that \nhas been a tradition in this country.\n  So as we go down the road--and hopefully we will get a final form of \na bill to debate from--I believe that is the proper framing of this \ndebate. I look forward to it.\n  I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank our dear ranking member for \nyielding to me.\n  I wanted to come over today in the 15 minutes we have left to talk \nabout this version of the Patients' Bill of Rights. Lest this stack of \nlegislation on my desk fall over and kill me, let me make the point \nthat it seeks to make. This stack on my desk demonstrates our big \nproblem in trying to bring up one of the most important bills we are \ngoing to consider in this Congress; a bill that, by the definition used \nby its principal authors, will cause net pay of American workers to \ndecline by $55 billion over the next 10 years. Senator Kennedy talks \nabout the bill costing a Big Mac. It really is 25 billion Big Macs. It \nis a lot of hamburgers and a lot of dollars.\n\n[[Page S6424]]\n\n  Looking toward the debate on one of the most important bills that we \nwill consider, after having spent several weeks trying to analyze and \nunderstand the old version of the bill, S. 872, we now have a new \nversion, S. 1052, and we understand that there is yet another version \nwhich is coming.\n  Why is this important? It is important because if we are going to \ndebate an issue that will have a profound effect on every working \nAmerican and every user of health care--which is everybody alive--it is \nvitally important that we know what the proposal is that we are going \nto debate. A perfect example of why that is important is the Clinton \nhealth care debate that we had in 1993 and in 1994. We kept hearing a \ndebate from the White House about their bill, and what it did; but in \nreality, as that debate was in the process of beginning, we had one, \ntwo, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, then nine different versions \nof the bill.\n  Why was it changing so much? It was changing so much because it was \nindefensible. The problem is--at least the problem I had--is that every \ntime I studied a new version, by the time we got to the floor of the \nSenate to debate it, the version had changed dramatically. It was not \nan insurmountable problem because each and every one of these versions \nwanted the government to take over and run the health care system. When \nthe American people knew what they were trying to do, they were not for \nit.\n  But I think we can expedite this debate if we simply know what is \nbeing proposed. So I would like to propose to our colleagues a solution \nto our problem; and that is, if there is about to be a new version, and \nif the authors of the bill would give us their final version, then I \nbelieve that we could, with a couple of days' study, be in a position \nto debate the bill. And we could get on with it.\n  Why is this issue so important? You are going to hear a lot of debate \nabout what this could mean to health care in America, what it could \nmean to the availability of health insurance. Why is that so important? \nFirst of all, it is important because I think people need to realize \nthat when we debated the Clinton health care bill in 1993 and in 1994, \nthe argument that was made throughout that debate was: Don't worry \nabout the right to have choices. Don't worry about a point-of-service \noption. Don't worry about the right to sue. Worry about access to \nhealth care because the figure that was used in that debate was the \nlatest number we had, as a good number, which was that 33 million \npeople did not have health insurance. Today, 42.6 million people do not \nhave health insurance.\n  What was the solution to that problem that Senator Kennedy proposed \nin presenting the Clinton health care bill? The solution was to have \nthe Government, through health care purchasing collectives--which would \nbe these giant HMOs run by the government that everybody would be \nforced to be a member of--that the government was going to set \nstandards for health care, and they were going to give these 33 million \npeople access to health insurance.\n  The price we were going to pay was that you did not have any choice \nabout joining this government-run HMO. You are going to hear Senator \nKennedy and others talk about forcing these private HMOs to have a \npoint-of-service option. But he is not going to point out that in the \noriginal Clinton bill, the point-of-service option was that if the \nhealth care purchasing collective in your area did not approve a \ntreatment, and the doctor provided that treatment, he was fined \n$10,000. And if you paid him separately for the treatment, he was sent \nto prison for 5 years.\n  You are going to hear a lot of debate about the right to sue HMOs, \nbut you are not going to hear that 7 years ago, Senator Kennedy, on \nbehalf of Bill Clinton, proposed a bill that severely limited the right \nof anybody to sue a doctor or any health care provider or any faceless \nbureaucrat running a health care purchasing collective.\n  The argument 7 years ago was, forget about freedom. Instead, worry \nabout the fact that 33 million people don't have health insurance and \ngive up your freedom and let the government run the system, and we will \nsolve that problem. That was the argument 7 years ago.\n  When people understood it meant that when your mama got sick she was \ngoing to talk to a bureaucrat instead of a doctor, the American people \nkilled that proposal. But notice the 180 that has occurred in those 7 \nyears. Today 42.6 million people do not have health insurance, almost \n40 percent more than in 1989. But now we have a proposal before us that \nsimply assumes that every employer absorbs part of the cost of \nincreased health care that will come from the bill before us, however, \nwe know that the increased costs will guarantee at a minimum that 1.2 \nmillion people will lose their health insurance.\n  Why, if we were willing to let the government take over the health \ncare system 7 years ago because people didn't have health insurance, do \nwe now, in the name of giving them the very rights we would have taken \naway from everybody 7 years ago, make it so that 1.2 million people, at \na minimum, don't have health insurance who have it today?\n  I will explain the answer. I am deeply worried about people losing \nhealth insurance and I want to preserve private medicine in America. \nBut if 7 years ago you wanted the government to take over the health \ncare system, then if you destroy the health care system we have today, \nif more people lose their health insurance 2 or 3 years from now, you \ncan come back and say: let's allow the government take it over to solve \na problem which, in fact, you have created with a bill like the bill \nbefore us that vastly expands lawsuits and expands cost.\n  Now, why is this such a big deal? Why is there so much passion about \nthis? Let me explain why. This simple chart explains why. This simple \nchart tells us how unique America is in all the world, and how \ndifferent we are than any other developed country in the world. We have \nall heard of the G-7 nations. Those are the seven richest countries in \nthe world.\n  What I have done in this simple chart is to take the G-7 nations and \nask a simple question: What percent of the population in the seven most \ndeveloped countries in the world get their health care through the \ngovernment and what percentage get it through private choice, private \nhealth insurance and decisions that they actually control that relate \nto their family and their children? If this chart does not scare you, \nthen I think there is something wrong.\n  What does this chart show? It shows that of the seven most developed \nand richest countries in the world, the United States is profoundly \ndifferent in health care. Sixty-seven percent of Americans buy health \ncare as a private purchaser through private health insurance and \nthrough individual choice; 33 percent of Americans get their health \ncare through a government program.\n  When you look at the next freest country in terms of private \ndecision-making regarding health care in the developed world, next to \nAmerica, which has 67 percent of its people buying health care through \ntheir choice, through private health insurance, and individual \ndecision-making, the next freest country is Germany, where 92 percent \nof health care is purchased through government programs and government \ndecision-making.\n\n  As we go into this debate, why am I so concerned about driving up \nhealth care costs and forcing people to give up their private health \ninsurance and forcing companies to cancel insurance? I can tell you why \nI am concerned. I don't want, 10 years from now, the United States to \nbe up to 92 percent of its health care run by government or 99 percent \nof its health care run by government or 100 percent of its health care \nrun by government. If you want America to be at the top of this list, \nthen you don't care if the bill before us produces a situation where \ncompanies cancel health insurance because you have the answer already. \nThe answer is government.\n  This is a big issue. This is one I believe deserves thoughtful \ndeliberation.\n  Finally, I will pick three issues. I will use the old bill because \nthat is the one I know. I have checked out the new bill and, with one \nexception, there is not a change. There has been one word dropped. I \nwill explain why it is so important that we have a copy of the final \nbill so we know what is in it. Let me take three issues that will make \nmy point.\n\n[[Page S6425]]\n\n  The first issue is the one that there was a lot of talk about on the \nweekend talk shows. In fact, one of our Democrat colleagues was asked \nabout suing employers. He responded: under our bill, you can't sue \nemployers. Sure enough, if you open their bill up to page 144, right in \nbold headlines, it says that you can't sue employers. In fact, in a \nsuper-bold headline it says: Exclusion of employers and other plan \nsponsors. And then a subhead line called paragraph (A), it says: Causes \nof action against employers and plan sponsors precluded. Gosh, it sure \nlooks like it precludes suing employers.\n  Then it says: Subject to subparagraph (B), paragraph (A) does not \nauthorize a cause of action against an employer. But guess what. When \nyou get down to paragraph (B), it says: Certain causes of actions \npermitted. Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a cause of action may \narise against an employer or other plan sponsor or against an employee \nof such an employer or sponsor acting within the scope of employment.\n  Why are we so concerned about getting to see the final bill before we \ndebate it? Because the bill is full of these bait-and-switch \nprovisions. Here in one paragraph it says you can't sue an employer, \nand then in another paragraph it says you can.\n  Let me give two more examples. One is, can you force an insurance \ncompany to pay for a benefit that is specifically excluded in the \npolicy? Let's say the policy says that the plan does not provide \ncoverage for heart and lung transplants and, as a result, the plan is \ncheaper. And so my small little company I work for buys the plan, and I \nknow in advance it does not cover that. So the question is, are you \nbound by the contract? If you look at the bill on page 35, it sure \nlooks like you are. In fact it says no coverage for excluded benefits. \nAnd then it has a paragraph that tells you if they are specifically \nexcluded, they are excluded. Until you turn over to the next page and \nit says: Except to the extent that the application or interpretation of \nthe exclusion or limitation involves a determination under paragraph 2.\n  Then you turn back two pages and you see that anything that is \nmedically reviewable or has to do with necessity or appropriateness can \nbe mandated, even if the contract specifically excludes it. In other \nwords, another bait and switch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time controlled \nby the minority has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me say, we will have plenty of time to debate this and \nI will continue my examples later. However, the point I wanted to make \nnow was that we need to see the final version of the bill so we can \nprepare to debate it.\n  Maybe if we can take some of these inconsistencies out, we could be \ncloser to having an agreement than we think we are. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I only caught the tail end of the \nremarks by the Senator from Texas. But I will just point out that this \nbill, which we are hoping to consider today, has been in the works for \nyears. It has gone through a number of drafts; it has been voted on in \nprevious incarnations. It is not a new issue. It is ready for the full \ndebate and disposition in the Senate. It is not like a budget bill that \nis presented without any debate and without any adequate preparation, \nas we experienced a few months ago. This is an issue that is more than \nripe for the consideration of this body.\n  I thank Senator Daschle for making the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy \nPatients' Bill of Rights the first bill he has brought to the floor as \nour Senate majority leader.\n  I really rise today on behalf of the countless New Yorkers, and \nreally millions of Americans across our country, who have been waiting \nfor this day for a very long time. I heard some remarks by the Senator \nfrom Texas about the efforts that were made, I guess, 6, 7 years ago \nnow, to try to provide health care coverage to every single American. I \nwas deeply involved in those efforts, and although we were not \nsuccessful, the goal was one that I think we should still keep at the \nforefront of our minds and hearts because when we began our work in \n1993, there were approximately 33 million Americans without insurance; \ntoday we are up to 42 million. This is after the so-called managed \ncare/HMO revolution occurred, where people have been finding it harder \nto afford coverage, afford the deductibles, afford the copayments, with \nthe result that we have more people uninsured today than when many of \nus tried to address this problem some years ago.\n  There are many urgent health care issues before us as a nation such \nas sky high prescription drugs for our seniors, too many without \nadequate coverage, and once they have Medicare they can't afford the \nadditional coverage that is required in order to give them the kind of \nhealth care they should have. There are gaps in our health safety net, \na shortage of nurses in our hospitals and nursing homes, and the very \ndifficult conditions under which so many of our nurses now labor. And, \nof course, there is the growing crisis of the uninsured. So we have our \nwork cut out for us in order to deliver on the promise of quality, \naffordable, accessible health care for all Americans.\n  That is why I am urging we proceed without further delay or \nobfuscation and pass a Patients' Bill of Rights--the bipartisan \nPatients' Bill of Rights that Senators McCain, Edwards, and Kennedy \nhave worked so hard to present, which has bipartisan support in the \nHouse.\n  We have to finish this job. We have been laboring over it since 1996, \nin earnest with the efforts within both Houses of Congress since 1997. \nWe have now been waiting and waiting for the Congress to act. Now is \nthe time.\n  I believe we should act not because it has been on the agenda for a \nlong time, although it has, and not because it is one of those issues \nto which finally the stars seemed aligned and with the Democratic \nmajority now in charge of the Senate we can actually get it to the \nfloor but because of the patients and their families who are out there \nwaiting and literally praying for us to act.\n  Each of the patients I have met and heard from, and each of the \nfamilies whom all of us have heard from, tell a story that describes an \nurgent situation needing timely and responsive care. That is why this \nbill is so important.\n\n  It is about getting the care you need when you need it. It is about \ngetting care in a timely manner from doctors you trust and choose. It \nis about having doctors and nurses in charge of your health care, not \naccountants and bookkeepers.\n  My colleague, Tom Harkin from Iowa, had a memorable phrase today at \nthe press conference. He said, ``The American people don't want their \ndoctors doing their taxes and they don't want their accountants \nproviding their health care.''\n  Each of us should be able to look to our doctors, our nurses, our \nhealth care professionals for the care that we trust and need. This is \nabout access to an emergency room when we need it.\n  I recall being in Ithaca, NY, about 2 years ago and meeting a young \nwoman who came to see me with a stack of medical records, literally a \nfoot high, just desperate. She had been in a very dangerous, nearly \nfatal accident on one of those winding roads that go through that \nbeautiful part of New York. Some of you may have traveled through \nIthaca or may have gone to Cornell. You know what beautiful country it \nis, but it has also a lot of winding roads. She was in a devastating \naccident, lying unconscious on the side of the road. Luckily, someone \ncame upon her and called for aid and they were able to medivac her out \nwith a helicopter, save her life, and she was in hospital care and \nrehab for nearly a year. She gets out and what does she find? She gets \na bill from her HMO for the helicopter medivac emergency service \nbecause--get this--she didn't call for permission first. She is \nunconscious on the side of the road and they want to charge her $10,000 \nbecause she didn't call for permission.\n  So this is about getting the emergency care you need when you need \nit. It is about seeing a specialist when you need it, when your doctor \nsays: I have gone as far as I can go; you need to go see a specialist. \nIt is about women being able to designate their OB/GYN as their \nspecialist, and about mothers and fathers being able to designate their \npediatrician as their child's general practitioner as well. It is about \nall\n\n[[Page S6426]]\n\nof these and more--the kinds of issues that are not just written \nsomewhere in a headline but are lived with day in and day out, which \nare talked about around the kitchen table, around the water cooler--the \nlife-and-death issues that really make a vital difference to families \nall over New York and America--families such as that of Susan Nealy, \nfrom the Bronx, whose husband had a serious heart condition but whose \nreferral to a cardiologist was delayed a month. The day before the \nappointment was finally scheduled, Mr. Nealy died of a massive heart \nattack, leaving behind his widow and two young children, ages 5 and 3.\n  It is like the family of the 15-year-old boy from New York who \ndeveloped complications from heart disease, but his health plan refused \nto allow him to see an out-of-network specialist familiar with the case \nand instead sent the teenager to a network provider who did not see him \nfor 4 months, and then the boy's lungs were filling with blood, and 2 \ndays later he collapsed in the street and died.\n  These are just two of the stories I could pick from my innumerable \nconversations and letters that I have received. There are so many more \nwe could tell.\n  For every one of these stories, there are untold stories of families \nwhose struggles for the care they needed were denied or delayed. \nAccording to patient reports, health plans delay needed care for 35,000 \npatients every day. In fact, delayed care and payment is a business \npractice that health plans have perfected.\n  I have heard from many doctors who tell me that each day a health \nplan withholds payments represents literally thousands of dollars in \ninterest that a health plan could earn. The practice of delay is so \nwidespread that there is a term for it. It is called ``living off the \nfloat.'' Unfortunately, not everyone who is subject to it actually ends \nup living.\n  Look, I don't blame the accountants and the bookkeepers. They are \ntrying to maximize their shareholders' return, their profits. That is \nthe business they are in. But this cannot go on. There have to be rules \nthat say you must, regardless of your being in business and regardless \nof having to make quarterly returns, put patients, doctors, and nurses \nfirst.\n  The physicians and nurses I speak with are so frustrated about this. \nThey are caught between the sharp conflict, between business practices \nthat I personally think are unscrupulous, but nevertheless they are \nengaged in, and the principles of the oaths that they take to do no \nharm, to get the health care to the patient when the patient needs it \nwhen it can do some good. Life-or-death situations rarely wait for \nprior authorization.\n\n  Last summer, I met Dr. Thomas Lee, a neurosurgeon at the Northern \nWestchester Hospital Center, just up the road from where we live in \nChappaqua. Dr. Lee was called to the emergency room one day about a \nyear ago because a patient--not his patient; it was someone he had \nnever seen before--a young woman in her early thirties collapsed at \nwork. She was brought to the emergency room.\n  Dr. Lee did his neurosurgical analysis, did the tests that were \nnecessary, and discovered this young woman had a very serious tumor \nthat was pressing on vital parts of her brain and needed to be operated \non.\n  They found her husband, thankfully, and they called the HMO that \ninsured the family and asked for permission to perform the surgery \nright then. Dr. Lee said it was, if not a matter of life and death, a \nmatter of paralysis and normal life, and they were denied. They were \ntold that because Dr. Lee was not one of their network physicians, \nbecause the Northern Westchester Hospital Center was not the hospital \ncenter they preferred to use, he could not do the surgery.\n  For 3 hours, Dr. Lee, his nurse, and the hospital staff were engaged \nin an argument with the HMO instead of performing the lifesaving \nsurgery. It breaks one's heart to think about this neurosurgeon who \ncould be saving lives getting on the phone trying to get permission to \ndo what he is trained to do.\n  Finally, he was so fed up, he said: Look, this young woman's life is \nat stake. I will perform the surgery free of charge so long as you will \ncover the hospitalization. With that deal struck, the HMO let him \nproceed.\n  I am very proud Dr. Lee is practicing medicine in my neck of the \nwoods, but I do not expect doctors and neurosurgeons to perform \nlifesaving heroic surgery for free. That is not the way the system is \nsupposed to work. These are people who go to school for decades to do \nthis work, and they deserve the respect and compensation we should be \nputting into our health care system, not to satisfy HMOs but to pay for \nthe services of trained physicians and health care professionals.\n  For the past 5 years patient advocates have worked on this bill, and \nwe have seen every delaying tactic one can imagine. I had a front seat \nto this when I was down at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. We \nwere working very hard to get this bill through the Congress. Every \nexcuse one can come up with was thrown in the way. It became so \nfrustrating to all of us who knew that lives were at stake, care was \nbeing denied and delayed; that passage of needed protections was being \nderailed.\n  We come to this day. Luckily for us, we are here not only because it \nis the right thing to do but because States and courts have realized \nthey just cannot wait any longer. They have seen firsthand what is \ngoing on in our country.\n  New York passed a State managed care protection bill in 1996; they \neven passed a law in 1998 to strengthen the protections--all before the \nCongress chose to act. Many more States have passed such protections, \nincluding Texas, specifically aimed to permit injured patients to hold \ntheir health plans accountable for their injuries.\n  President Clinton signed an Executive order giving 85 million \nAmericans with federally sponsored health care, such as Medicare and \nMedicaid, protections similar to what we are trying to give to all \nAmericans through a 1998 act.\n  Even Federal courts, notably in the case of Andrews-Clarke v. \nTravelers Insurance, have urged the Congress to act. In that case, \nJudge William Young states:\n\n       Although the alleged conduct of Travelers and Greenspring \n     in this case is extraordinarily troubling, even more \n     disturbing to the Court is the failure of Congress to amend a \n     statute . . . that has come conspicuously awry from its \n     original intent.\n\n  Yet because of our failure to enact such a statute, at least 43 \npercent of all Americans with employer-sponsored private coverage are \nstill left out in the cold. These Americans cannot afford to wait any \nlonger. Forty percent of Americans know that passing a law today is \neven more urgent than it was 2 years ago, and a majority of them \nthought it was urgent then.\n  Let's work in a bipartisan way. This bill is bipartisan. Senator \nMcCain, Senator Edwards, and Senator Kennedy have all worked to get to \nthis point. They have all made compromises. Their bill is the only bill \nbefore the Senate that applies to all 190 million Americans with \nprivate health coverage. It is the only bill before the Senate that has \nall the protections of Medicare and Medicaid. It is the only bill that \nhas the support of over 500 consumer and provider advocates.\n  Anybody who knows anything about some of these provider groups, such \nas the American Medical Association, knows that Congress is not their \npreferred venue. They are not keen on having the Congress tell them to \ndo or not do anything, but doctors are so frustrated that even the \nAmerican Medical Association has come time and again asking that this \nbill be passed.\n  It is the only bill that guarantees coverage for the routine costs of \nFDA-approved clinical trials which are so important to patients with \ncancer and so important particularly to children with cancer.\n  This is the only bill that guarantees an internal and external review \nas soon as it is medically necessary.\n  In sum, this is the only bill before the Senate that protects \npatients, not HMOs.\n  Just as delaying tactics by managed care organizations have injured \nand even killed millions of Americans over time, delaying tactics by \nthe opponents of this bill have taken their toll.\n  I want my colleagues to look at this patient survey that is behind \nme. Each day, 35,000 patients have a specialty referral delayed or \ndenied; 18,000 every day are forced to change medications as a result \nof their health plan's determinations--not their doctors but their \nhealth plans.\n\n[[Page S6427]]\n\n  When I say ``health plans,'' I mean somebody sitting in an office, \nusually hundreds of miles from where the patient or doctor is, second-\nguessing the doctor, saying; I am sorry, your doctor may have 30, 40 \nyears of practice and experience, but I am going to sit in this office \nwithout ever having seen you and decide that I can second-guess what \nkind of prescription medication you should have.\n  Forty-one thousand patients a day experience a worsening of their \ncondition because of actions by their HMOs.\n  One can go through this list and see what patients are saying. Then \none can look at another list that comes from surveys of doctors, those \nwho are on the front lines. They are saying they believe their patients \nare confronting serious declines in their health from plan abuse. This \nis the kind of information that concerns me because when I go to the \ndoctor, I expect my doctor to take care of me. He or she has sworn an \noath, they have been well trained, and I have checked them out. I feel \nlike I am putting myself in someone's hands whom I can trust, and \ndoctors are saying they are not being permitted to practice medicine. \nThey are being told they have to subject their decisions to people they \nhave never met nor seen.\n  It is because of the desire of HMOs to slow down payment, to deny \npayment, to keep that float I talked about going, basically to use the \nmoney they should be paying to doctors and hospitals for taking care of \nus for their own purposes, for their own profits, for their bottom \nlines.\n  In my office I keep a picture of a young, beautiful woman named Donna \nMunnings. This is Donna. This is a young woman who reminds me every \nsingle day when I look up at her picture in my office of what can \nhappen when the system does not respond until it is too late. Donna's \nmother Mary is a school bus driver from Scottsville, NY. She has been \nlobbying and advocating for this bill for years. Her daughter Donna \ndied February 8, 1997, after having visited her primary care physician \nrepeatedly, only to be told that she had an upper respiratory infection \nand suffered from panic attacks and that no diagnostic tests were \nnecessary. Had the doctors performed a $750 lung scan in time, they \nwould have seen not an upper respiratory infection but a football-sized \nblood clot in her lung.\n\n  Her mother Mary said:\n\n       In my subsequent research I found that HMOs can and do \n     penalize doctors for ordering tests which HMOs feel are \n     unnecessary. But all for the sake of money [all for the sake \n     of a $750 test] we lost a vital, beautiful young lady who had \n     only begun her life.\n\n  We are going to hear a lot of debate. In fact, we are debating \nwhether we can even proceed with this bill: Yet more delaying tactics, \nyet more efforts to obstruct the kind of care that every one of us \nneeds. I can guarantee the people out in that lobby and the people in \nthe offices they represent, they would not stand for not getting the \ncare their child needs. If they had a daughter who was suffering day \nafter day after day, and the doctors could not tell her what was wrong \nand they kept sending her home, I can guarantee that those executives \nand those lobbyists would get some other source of care for their \ndaughter.\n  But Mary is a school bus driver. She didn't know where else to turn. \nHaving insurance was a pretty big deal. They didn't know what else to \ndo, other than just keep going back, as Donna's condition got worse and \nworse and worse.\n  Patients buy health insurance in order to feel assured that when they \nseek care under the benefits for which they have paid, that care will \nbe available and it will be available in time to be effective. Yet we \nknow that that does not happen. In one State, the State of New York, \naccording to Department of Insurance statistics, of the nearly 18,000 \nHMO decisions challenged on appeal, over 10,000 were reversed. This \nmeans that when patients can test their HMO's decision to deny needed \ncare, over half the time the patients are right.\n  Yet, through a loophole in Federal law, there are too many consumers \nin New York--over 2.25 million--who still are not protected against \nthese incorrect and dangerous decisions. They have no recourse. There \nis nothing they can do because we have not given them a Patients' Bill \nof Rights. They need a Federal law to give them the parity and \nprotection their neighbors and coworkers have.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I believe the Senator from New York was at a briefing \nthis morning where we discussed the experience in the State of Texas. \nIn 1997, a certain Governor of Texas, who has now moved to Washington, \nhad a Patients' Bill of Rights established in Texas. Maybe the Senator \nfrom New York can help me with these numbers, but I believe in the 4-\nyear period of time that the State Patients' Bill of Rights has been in \neffect in Texas, there have been 1,300 appeals of decisions by \ninsurance companies and only 17 lawsuits filed in 4 years.\n  So the argument that giving the people the right to go to court will \nmean a flood of cases brought in court has been disproven in the home \nState of the President. Does the Senator from New York recall that?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Indeed, the Senator from New York does recall that. I \nappreciate the Senator from Illinois raising that because that, of \ncourse, is one of the objections the opponents are trying to throw up, \nthat this bill will open the floodgates for lawsuits. In Texas that has \nnot happened. It has not happened anywhere in the country where these \nprotections have been afforded under State law.\n\n  People are not rushing to the courthouse. They want the care that \nthey need. They don't want a lawyer; they want a doctor; and they want \nthe doctor to take care of them according to the doctor's best \njudgment. That is what doctors are telling us. They are not being \npermitted to do that.\n  I appreciate my friend from Illinois raising that point because, as \nthis debate proceeds, you are going to hear a lot of arguments about \nwhy we just cannot do this. You know, we just cannot take care of Donna \nand her mother Mary and all the other Donnas and Marys in our country. \nThere will be all sorts of red herrings and all kinds of arguments made \nthat just do not hold water. There is no basis in fact for them, but \nthey sound good. Maybe they will scare some people. But we are tired of \nbeing scared and intimidated. This is no longer just a political issue, \nthis goes to the very heart of who we are as Americans.\n  Are we going to take care of each other? Are we going to let doctors \nand nurses practice their professions? Or are we going to turn our \nlives over to HMO accountants and bookkeepers and the like?\n  I am hoping we will not only proceed to this bill, which deserves a \nfull hearing, deserves a full debate, and deserves a unanimous vote in \nthis Chamber. I hope when we pass this, we will be sending a very clear \nmessage to all the mothers and fathers and family members that this \nwill never happen again. This beautiful young woman whose life was cut \nshort tragically would still be with us today if that HMO had just \nsaid: maybe we should let you go ahead and have that test.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues. This has been 5 years \nin the making. Let's end the politics of delay and move forward with \nthe motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  (Disturbance in the visitors' gallery.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The galleries will cease making a display. Any \nexpressions of approval or disapproval are not permitted in the Senate \ngallery. The Sergeant at Arms will enforce it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I propounded a unanimous consent request \nsome time ago that the Senator from New York was to be recognized until \n4:15, the Senator from New Jersey from 4:15 to 4:30. There is no one \nhere on the other side. The Senator will proceed until Republicans show \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, this debate is symbolic in many ways. \nIt holds the prospect of ending a five-year effort to pass meaningful \nHMO reform.\n  A Patients' Bill of Rights that recognizes, that while the move to \nHMO based health care may have started with the best of intentions, the \nresults have been less than spectacular.\n  Beyond the prospect of finally enacting HMO reform, this debate marks \nthe\n\n[[Page S6428]]\n\nbeginning of the tenure of Tom Daschle as majority leader. It is a \ntestament to the priority that he and our caucus have given to this \nissue, that it is the first legislation we have brought to the floor. \nFor too long this debate has been one-sided and bottled-up by \npartisanship.\n  I was hopeful that Majority Leader Daschle's earlier commitment to a \nfull and fair debate on amendments would begin this debate on a \npositive note. However, I am disappointed that my colleagues on the \nother side have objected to the motion to proceed and that it \npotentially will be days before we can begin the debate on amendments.\n  The Senate HELP Committee has done a study and found that each day of \ndelay on this issue has very real consequences. Every day 41,000 \npatients experience a worsening of their condition, 35,000 patients \nhave needed care delayed, 10,000 patients are denied a diagnostic test \nor treatment, and 7,000 patients are denied a referral to specialist.\n  As important as the education debate over the past month has been, no \nissue will touch more families than what we do on HMO reform.\n  Today, more than 90 percent of working Americans receive insurance \nfrom their employer. Most do not have a choice about the type of \ncoverage. This means that many working families are stuck with an HMO \ndespite any concerns they may have with the quality of care they \nreceive. There are over 160 million Americans with HMO insurance.\n  Mr. President, 33 percent of the residents of my state--2.3 million--\nare in an HMO. A vast majority of these Americans are in favor of and \nare demanding fundamental change in the way HMOs provide care.\n  A poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation conducted just 60 days ago \nfound that 85 percent of Americans want comprehensive HMO reform. These \nAmericans believe, as I do, that doctors, not HMO accountants should be \nin control of medical decisions.\n  The reality is that HMOs are a product of the runaway health care \ninflation of the 1970's and 1980's that drove the ranks of the \nuninsured.\n  It was hoped that by providing a pre-determined list of doctors and \nmedical coverage, the costs of medical care could be contained and \ncoverage provided to more people. But after three decades of cutting \ncosts and services to keep costs low, it is clear that HMOs have failed \nto strike the necessary balance.\n  Today, we are faced with a situation where medical decisionmaking is \ndisproportionately in the hands of insurance company bureaucrats. That \nis why, from patients to doctors, there is unanimity in making some \ncommon sense reforms.\n  While Washington has been paralyzed by partisan gridlock, state \nlegislatures have been debating and acting on this issue for years.\n  For example, my state of New Jersey became a national health care \nreform leader with the passage of the Health Care Quality Act in 1997.\n  The law now prohibits gag clauses, provides an independent health \ncare appeals program and requires that insurers provide clear \ninformation on covered services and limitations. These reforms, long \nsought by Democrats and consumers, were passed by a Republican \nlegislature and signed by a Republican governor.\n  But no matter how many individual states act, the reality is that an \noverwhelming number of Americans won't be protected because their state \nlaws are exempt under ERISA.\n  Mr. President, 83 percent--124 million--of Americans who get their \nhealth care from their employer are not covered by state laws, and 50 \npercent of people enrolled in an HMO in New Jersey are exempt from \nState protections.\n  Originally designed to protect employees from losing pension benefits \ndue to fraud, the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 has provided \nHMOs with immunity from state regulations for their negligent behavior. \nSo despite the progress in states like New Jersey, complaints about the \nquality of care by HMOs continue to rise.\n  A survey by Rutgers University and the state Department of Health \nfound overall that one in four New Jerseyans enrolled in an HMO was \ndissatisfied with their health plan. Last October a state report card \nfound that patients in NJ were less satisfied with their HMO care than \nthe previous year.\n  The bipartisan legislation being brought to the floor this week, is \nsupported by more than 500 doctor and patient rights groups, and will \nfinally extend patient protections to all Americans in an HMO.\n  This promises to be a long debate and while I look forward to dealing \nwith many of the important details, I want to outline the fundamental \nprinciples we must address.\n  Under current practices, many HMOs force a patient with a chronic \ncondition like heart disease to be treated by only the family doctor. \nThe Kennedy-Edwards bill will guarantee access to a cardiologist or \nother needed specialist, even one outside his or her network.\n  Currently, if your sick or suffer an injury while traveling or on \nvacation you must get prior approval from your HMO before going to the \nemergency room. Our plan will ensure that a patient could go to the \nnearest emergency room without having to first get permission from the \nHMO.\n  Under current HMO policies, many women must obtain a referral from \ntheir primary care doctor before seeing an OB/GYN. This bill will \nguarantee access to an OB/GYN without a referral.\n  HMOs often force a child with a chronic, life threatening condition \nto seek approval from a primary care doctor before seeing a specialist. \nThe Kennedy-Edwards plan would ensure a child with cancer, for example, \nwould have the right to see a pediatric oncologist whenever the care is \nneeded.\n  Today, many HMOs restrict physicians from discussing all treatment \noptions with their patients and cut reimbursement rates for doctors who \nadvocate with the HMO on behalf of their patients. This bill will \nprohibit HMOs from financially penalizing doctors who provide the best \nquality care for their patients.\n  HMOs typically have the last word when they decide to deny a needed \ntest, procedure or treatment. We will guarantee medical decisions by \nHMO bureaucrats will be subject to a swift internal review and a fair \nexternal review process.\n  And when reckless medical decisions made by HMOs injure or kill, they \nare shielded from any responsibility. Now we will finally ensure that \nall Americans will have the right to hold HMOs accountable in court.\n  These protections will provide a new sense of health care security \nbut undoubtedly over the next weeks we will hear arguments that the \nprice for these protections will be higher cost and increases in the \nuninsured. But the CBO report on this legislation states that it would \nincrease premiums by only 4.2 percent over 10 years, this will mean a \nlittle over $1 per month for the average employee.\n  There will be arguments that this is unnecessary because HMO's have \nresponded to criticisms and already provide these protections. If this \nwere truly the case, then costs should not rise at all.\n  They will also argue that with every one percent increase in \npremiums, approximately 300,000 Americans lose their health insurance \ncoverage. But in 2000, when overall health insurance premiums increased \n10 percent, the number of uninsured actually dropped.\n  Mr. President, we will debate many issues in this Congress but none \nwith more impact on more people than this.\n  I want to thank our new majority leader, Senator Daschle, for \nbringing this to the floor so quickly and I look forward to its debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time controlled \nby the majority has expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to address the issue of a Patients' \nBill of Rights. As a physician, and as one who has participated very \ndirectly in this debate over the past several years, I am one who \nwelcomes the opportunity to have discussion on this important issue \nover the coming hours and days and over, I assume, the next couple of \nweeks.\n  We do have a unique opportunity, I believe, to pass a strong bill of \nrights for patients, an enforceable bill of rights for patients, under \nthe leadership of President George Bush as he\n\n[[Page S6429]]\n\noutlined in his principles last February.\n  As the American people listen to us discuss this legislation this \nafternoon, tonight, and over the coming days, I hope they will \nunderstand broadly that we, as a body, whether it is Democrat or \nRepublican, will come together in this session and pass a bill that I \nam very hopeful will be signed by the President of the United States. I \nam confident that he will sign it if it is consistent with the \nprinciples that he outlined.\n  The bill that is going to be brought to the floor, the McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy bill, is a starting place. We can't end there because, \nyes, it has the patients' protections and appeals process, external and \ninternal, but at the same time it opens floodgates to a new, massive, \nrepetitive wave of frivolous lawsuits which very quickly translate down \ninto increased costs and increased charges.\n  Much of that money that is taken out of the health care system goes \ninto the pockets of trial lawyers. Increased costs translate very \ndirectly down to loss of insurance, as we talked about the uninsured \nthat are increasing 900,000 to 1 million every year.\n  We absolutely must, as we address gag clauses, access to specialists, \nadmission to emergency rooms, and clinical trials, and as we look at \npatient protection, bring some sort of balance to the system to make \nsure that if there is harm or injury--after exhaustion of internal and \nexternal appeals processes--that compensation to that patient is full, \nif there has been injury or if there has been damage. But we can't \nallow exorbitant, out-of-control lawsuits because they drain money out \nof the system itself. It drives premiums up and punishes the working \npoor. They are the ones right now who are having a hard time struggling \nto even buy that insurance, even when it is in part covered by their \nemployer. That is why when we drive these premiums up--whether it is 1, \n2, 3 or 4 percent for every 1 percent--the increased cost drives those \npremiums up, and about 300,000 people lose their health insurance.\n  When we get into the business of mandating patient protection, those \nrights cost money. Somebody has to pay that money in some way. It is \nthe people. It is distributed throughout the premiums. When those \npremiums go up, some people can't afford to buy them anymore, and they \nforego that insurance.\n  That is the sort of balance that we need to at least be aware of as \nwe are on this floor debating.\n  I look forward very much to participating in that debate as we go \nforward on having this strong, enforcement patient bill of rights, \nwhich has strong access to emergency room, access to clinical trials, \naccess to specialists, and elimination of gag rules. If there is any \nsort of concern about whether or not benefit is given when there is \nharm or injury--with strong internal and external appeals with an \nindependent physician making that final decision, and then, yes, at the \nend of the day, if there has been harm or injury--the external review \nsystem of the physician says the plan made a mistake, sue the HMO, but \ndo not sue the employer. Sue the HMO and not the employer.\n  I see my colleague from Wyoming is with us today. I am going to yield \nmy time and look forward to participating either later tonight or \ntomorrow in this debate.\n  Just as an aside, I enjoyed very much working with the Senator from \nWyoming over the last several years as we have addressed this issue. \nEverybody has been so entrenched. At the same time, we have been \nstudying this issue and working hard. He is one of our colleagues who \nhas invested a tremendous amount of time putting together a Patients' \nBill of Rights that really meets the balance of getting health care to \npeople when they need it rather than focusing on these frivolous \nlawsuits which might potentially hurt the patient.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nTennessee for his comments. I thank him for the tremendous job he has \ndone. He is the only doctor in the Senate. He has done a tremendous job \nof educating us in all of the areas of a Patients' Bill of Rights and \nmedical care and has saved quite a few people along the way. We really \nappreciate that. I particularly thank him for the education he has \ngiven me.\n  Mr. President. I rise today to join all of my colleagues in calling \nfor a Patients' Bill of Rights. The President has clearly stated his \ndesire to sign a bill into law, but has also been very clear on what he \nwon't sign. I support his goal of protecting Americans that have been \nmistreated by their HMO, and I also support his goal of only enacting a \nbill that will preserve access to insurance for those that already have \nit, and increase access for those Americans that are uninsured. The \nlegislative and political history on this matter stretches back a ways. \nIn fact, in three of the four-and-a-half years I have been in the \nSenate, we have passed a Patients' Bill of Rights. I hope to keep that \nstreak going this year, only I hope what we pass finally gets signed \ninto law to the benefit, not the detriment, of consumers.\n  While there is a lot of consensus between all parties on the need for \na number of patient protections, a strong internal and external appeals \nprocess, a right to hold health plans accountable in certain instances, \nand an assurance that all Americans be afforded such protections, there \nremains some disagreement on key issues.\n  First, the appeals process should be meaningful and required because \nit gets people the right care, right away.\n  Second, limitless lawsuits help lawyers, not patients.\n  Third, turning state regulation of health care on its head is a \nlosing prospect for consumers whose needs have historically been better \nserved by their own state insurance commissioner. While I would like to \nspend my time today making a general statement about the need for a \nPatients' Bill of Rights, I plan to revisit in detail the issues I just \nmentioned as the debate moves ahead.\n  During both the Floor debate and earlier in the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee consideration of the Patients' Bill of \nRights, I asserted strong positions on several key components of the \nmanaged care reform debate. I wish, once again, to reiterate my support \nfor adoption of a bill that protects consumers, improves the system of \nhealth care delivery and shrinks the rolls of the uninsured. I will do \neverything I can to prevent increasing the number of uninsured.\n  I believe that as we consider a bill as important as the Patients' \nBill of Rights, we must never lose sight of our shared goal of having a \nstrong bill. The politics should be left at the door in our effort to \nemerge with the best policy for patients. That was the commitment the \nprincipals in the conference made to the public more than a year ago.\n\n  I really cannot go further without commenting on that conference. I \nhave been told by my more senior colleagues that Members have never \nlogged as many hours in trying to thoroughly understand and work a bill \nas we did last year. The effort was not in vain. We learned a \ntremendous amount about the value of enacting a good Patients' Bill of \nRights. We also learned that preserving access to quality health care \nis the most important patient protection we can provide to consumers.\n  Together, Senators Gregg, Frist, Gramm, Jeffords, and Hutchinson, \nChairman Nickles, and I demonstrated every day our commitment to doing \nthe right thing for patients. I offer a special thanks to Senator \nNickles for being a patient gentleman as he led us through this \nnegotiation process.\n  I do think, as that process went on, some saw the possibility that we \nwould complete it. Most of us thought it would be completed. Some \nthought it was better as an issue than a solution and jumped out of the \nprocesses and started bringing votes back here in this Chamber. We \ncould have had this done last year.\n  All of the bills we have ever considered, including the bill before \nus today, have offered a series of patient protections to consumers--\ndirect access to OB/GYN and pediatric providers, a ban on gag clauses, \na prudent layperson standard for emergency services, a point-of-service \noption, continuity of care, and access to specialists--that would \nprovide all consumers many of\n\n[[Page S6430]]\n\nthe same protections already being offered to State-regulated health \nplan participants.\n  This is a bill for managed care. There are already State protections \nfor State-regulated health plan participants.\n  Additionally, health plans would be required to disclose extensive \ncomparative information about coverage of services and treatment \noptions, networks of participating physicians and other providers, and \nany cost-sharing responsibilities of the consumer.\n  All of these new protections are crowned by the establishment of a \nnew, binding, independent external appeals process, the linchpin of any \nsuccessful consumer protection effort.\n  While I still do not believe that suing health plans is the biggest \nconcern of consumers, holding health plans accountable for making \nmedical decisions is a key component of a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  For the record, I believe the biggest concern of patients is getting \nthe best health care they can get, right when they need it most, not \nthe ability to sue. Most people I know value their health over all \nelse. Money does not buy happiness, but good health can make a nice \ndownpayment.\n  Our success will absolutely be measured by whether we get patients \nthe medical treatment they need right away. Everyone agrees that the \nessential mechanism is an independent, external appeals process. The \nlast thing we should do is establish a system that would require \npatients to earn their care through a lawsuit. It is for this very \nreason that the bill I will support securely places the responsibility \nfor medical decisions in the hands of independent medical reviewers \nwhose standard of review is based on the best available medical \nevidence and consensus conclusions reached by medical experts. These \ndecisions would be binding on health plans.\n  One of the specific concerns that will be directly addressed by the \nindependent review process is that of the ``medical necessity or \nappropriateness'' of the care requested by the patient and their \nphysician. Consumers and health care providers have repeatedly \nrequested that there be a prohibition on health plans manipulating the \ndefinition of ``medical necessity'' to deny patient care. I think all \nof the bills have attempted to address this concern. I do have \nconcerns, however, about how the bill before us goes beyond addressing \nthis concern and obviates the health care contract altogether, \neliminates the contract altogether. Imagine trying to price the \ncontract if you do not know what the contract contains. That provision \nwill have to be fixed in the final bill.\n\n  The issue of ensuring that patients receive medically necessary and \nappropriate care they have been promised in their contract has been \naddressed by a number of States already through the appeals processes \nthey have established. Many employers and health plans already \nvoluntarily refer disputed claims to an independent medical review. But \nwhen it comes to formal Federal action pertaining to the employer plans \nregulated solely by the Department of Labor, we are just now examining \nhow to proceed. In other words, it works at the State level; it has not \nworked at the Federal level. Now we are considering a Federal solution.\n  Since its inception in 1974, this is the first major reform effort of \nERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as it pertains to \nthe regulation of group health plans. The focus of the mission--\nregardless of politics--should be to protect patients. Protecting \npatients means not only improving the quality of care but expanding \naccess to care and allowing consumers and purchasers the flexibility to \nacquire the care that best fits their needs.\n  This leads me to another concern I have with the bill before us. It \nrequires States to forsake laws they have already passed dealing with \npatient protections included in the bill if they are not the same as \nthe new Federal standards. The technical language in the bill reads \n``substantially equivalent,'' ``does not prevent the application of,'' \nand under the process of certifying these facts with the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, the State will have to prove that their laws \nare ``substantially equivalent and effective patient protections.''\n  The proponents of this language say it will not undo any existing \nState laws that are essentially comparable. But that is not what their \nbill requires. Instead, when I see the requirement of ``substantially \nequivalent,'' I read that if there is any difference, then they are \nobviously not equivalent and do not meet the test. What does \n``substantial'' mean? And how does it modify ``equivalent'' at the end \nof the day? These questions are not being answered.\n  Is it that the proponents aren't overly concerned with the \nimplementation of the law versus being able to say that their bill \nmeets the political test of covering all Americans, regardless of \nexisting meaningful protections that State legislatures have enacted? \nIf the laws just have to be comparable, then why don't we use that \nphrase?\n  I am very leery of one-size-fits-all legislation. Every State has \ndifferences, geographical differences, differences in the mix of \npeople, differences in distance, differences in climate, and, more \nparticularly, differences that affect medical care.\n  In Wyoming we have few doctors, we have few people, and we have lots \nof miles. We do not have competing hospitals anywhere in the State. And \nwe have a need for doctors--I love this--we have a need for doctors, \nincluding veterinarians, in every single county.\n\n  I will get into this issue in more detail as the debate proceeds. I \ndo believe we can strike a compromise on the matter of scope, but I \ncannot state strongly enough my objection to wrenching from States \ntheir authority to regulate on these matters.\n  The only hard proof we have right now is that States are, by and \nlarge, good regulators, while the Federal Government has done a lousy \njob regulating on behalf of its health care consumers. The General \nAccounting Office has been reporting that to us since we passed the \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA, in 1996. \nAnd that is the consumer enforcement protection mechanism around which \nthe bill is written.\n  I know I am on the verge of sounding like a broken record, but I \nwould like to sketch out the effect of the bill's scope, as it is \ncurrently drafted. It is done best with a story about Wyoming. Wyoming, \nas I mentioned, has its own unique set of health care needs and \nconcerns. Every State does. For example, despite our elevation, we do \nnot need the mandate regarding skin cancer that Florida has on the \nbooks.\n  My favorite illustration of just how crazy a nationalized system of \nhealth care mandates would be comes from my own time in the Wyoming \nLegislature. It is about a mandate for which I voted and still support \ntoday. You see, unlike in Massachusetts or California, in Wyoming we \nhave few health care providers, and their numbers virtually dry up as \nyou head out of town. We can see every single town by driving outside \nof it. They do not run together anywhere.\n  So we passed an ``any willing provider'' law that requires health \nplans to contract with any provider in Wyoming that is willing to do \nso. While that idea may sound strange to my ears in any other context, \nit was the right thing to do for Wyoming. I know it is not the right \nthing to do for Massachusetts or California. I wouldn't dream of asking \nthem to shoulder that kind of a mandate for our sake, when we can \nsimply responsibly apply it within our borders.\n\n  What is even more alarming to me is that Wyoming has opted not to \nenact health care laws that specifically relate to HMOs because there \nare no HMOs in the State, with one exception, which is very small and \nis operated by a group of doctors who live in town. They are not a \nnameless, faceless insurance company. Yet under the proposal the \nDemocrats insist is best for everybody, the State of Wyoming would have \nto enact and actively enforce at least 15 new laws to regulate a style \nof health insurance that doesn't exist in the State.\n  What Wyoming does currently require is that plans provide information \nto patients about coverage, copays, and so on, much as we would in this \nbill; a ban on gag clauses between doctors and patients; and an \ninternal appeals process to dispute denied claims. I am hopeful the \nState will soon enact an external appeals process, too.\n  This is a list of patient protections that a person in any kind of \nhealth\n\n[[Page S6431]]\n\nplan needs, which is why the State has acted. But requiring Wyoming to \nenact a series of additional laws that don't have any bearing on \nconsumers in our State is an unbelievable waste of a citizen \nlegislature's time and resources.\n  Let me explain a citizen legislature. In Wyoming, they meet for 20 \ndays one year and 40 days the next year. They do no special sessions. \nIf you are only employed as a legislator--and I use that term loosely \non being employed because they hardly get paid anything--for 20 days \none year and 40 days the next year, you have to have a bona fide job. \nYou have to have real work in the real world. And they do. So they meet \nfor 20 days one year--and incidentally, the 20 days is the year that \nthey do the budget work, and they make it balance every time--20 days \none year and 40 days the next. You have to live the rest of the year \nunder the laws that you passed, which gives you a different perspective \non laws than perhaps in States where the legislature meets for longer \nperiods of time and definitely a different perspective than we have in \nthis body. That is a citizen legislature.\n  Speaking of limited resources, I would be remiss if I didn't touch \nonce more on our most important charge in the debate; that is, to \npreserve Americans' access to health insurance. If we make it too \ndifficult for employers to voluntarily provide health care to their \nemployees, then it should come as no surprise to any of us that they \nwill simply stop volunteering to do so. Insurance for most businesses \nis a volunteer effort. I won't support a bill that denies people access \nto health care. If my colleagues don't believe me now, they can bet \ntheir constituents will come calling when they lose their insurance or \nhave it priced forever beyond their reach.\n  Sometimes changes we make in the Senate drive up the cost, as the \nSenator from Tennessee was explaining earlier. For every 1 percent that \ncosts go up, 300,000 people in this country lose their insurance.\n  I will make a promise to my own constituents right now that I will \nwork hard to enact a Patients' Bill of Rights. I will fight any measure \nthat threatens their access to health care. I will reserve further \nremarks until we delve into the process of considering the different \nprovisions of the bill.\n  I, again, extend the hand of compromise and the offer to all of my \ncolleagues that we rally around our common position on many of the \npatient protections and forge ahead on the rest of the bill towards an \nend that has an eye on what is best for the patients. This bill is \nabout them. If someone else is benefiting from a provision, then I \nwould suggest that our drafting is not quite done. There are some of \nthose provisions.\n  I look forward to my continued role in the process. I thank the Chair \nand reserve the remainder of any time we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I see no others on the side of the minority \nso I will proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Las Vegas has two daily newspapers. One is \nthe Las Vegas Daily Journal; The other is the Las Vegas Sun. I was very \nimpressed with the editorial in the Las Vegas Sun newspaper yesterday. \nThe newspaper is a relatively new newspaper by American standards. It \nis 40, 50 years old. It was started by an entrepreneur by the name of \nHank Greenspun who was a real pioneer in Las Vegas. He developed a \nnewspaper that was feisty. It was a newspaper that took on Senator \nMcCarthy before it was fashionable to do so. He took on the gaming \ninterests when it was a very small newspaper and won an antitrust suit \nagainst them for their failing to advertise and they, in fact, \nboycotted his newspaper.\n  So I give this background to indicate it is a great newspaper. It \nwas. It still is.\n  The editorial they wrote yesterday can be paraphrased but not very \nwell. It is a short editorial. I will read the editorial into the \nRecord. It is entitled ``Patient rights get some life.''\n  The subtitles say:\n\n       The Senate is expected to take up this week a patient's \n     bill of rights.\n\n  They have under that:\n\n       Our take: It is unfortunate that so far President Bush \n     opposes the Democratic plan, which also is favored by some \n     Republicans, that finally would make HMOs accountable.\n\n  The editorial begins as follows:\n\n           [From the Las Vegas Daily Journal, June 18, 2001]\n\n       President Bush's campaign pledge to be ``a uniter, not a \n     divider'' has been a bust in the early going of this \n     administration. The White House's embracing of \n     extraordinarily conservative views, which are far removed \n     from the mainstream, have given the president some real \n     problems in living up to his conciliatory vow, especially on \n     environmental issues. Now Bush will soon face another test of \n     his ability to bring warring sides together on another \n     divisive matter: a patient's bill of rights.\n       The Senate, which recently came under Democratic control, \n     plans this week to take up a patient's bill of rights, which \n     for years has been stymied by Senate Republican leaders. It's \n     not just Democrats supporting the plan, notable Republicans \n     such as John McCain also back the bill. It also is important \n     that last week Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., signed on to a \n     similar Democratic measure in the House. Norwood for years \n     had championed a patient's bill of rights, but he had held \n     off his support this year in deference to the White House, \n     which said it wanted to work out a compromise. But even \n     Norwood's loyalty wore thin, finally causing him to break \n     company with Bush on this issue. The president, who has \n     threatened to veto a patient's bill of rights that allows \n     lawsuits in state courts against HMOs, just wouldn't budget \n     on this key provision.\n       The patient's bill of rights isn't that complicated: It's \n     all about accountability. Currently, health insurance \n     companies are the only businesses in the nation that are \n     immune to lawsuits if they harm someone. No one else gets \n     such special treatment. In light of how HMOs have wrongly \n     denied care to patients in the past, this is an industry that \n     needs some accountability. While the lawsuit provision is \n     essential if a patient's bill of rights is to carry any \n     weight, few patients would ever want to pursue this option. \n     What they want is immediate care. The Democratic plan tries \n     to ward off people from heading to court, requiring patients \n     to first go to an independent review panel before seeking \n     relief through the courts.\n       If there is a glimmer of hope it is that Bush has softened \n     some of his earlier hard-line positions on the environment \n     after hearing quite a bit of criticism. In the same vein, the \n     president should listen to reason and endorse a patient's \n     bill of rights that requires HMOs to finally be held \n     accountable for their actions.\n\n  Mr. President, that is an editorial from a Las Vegas newspaper. It is \nsimple. It is direct. It is to the point. It is what this debate is all \nabout. If, as I have heard today, the minority thinks the bill has some \nthings that they don't like, don't understand, wish weren't there, \nlet's debate this bill. Let's not hide behind some procedural gimmick \nthat prevents us from bringing this matter to the fore for the American \npeople.\n  The people of Minnesota, the State the Presiding Officer represents, \nthe people of New Jersey, the junior Senator from New Jersey being on \nthe floor, the people of the State of Nevada and the rest of the \ncountry need this legislation. This is about patient protection. It is \nabout having a doctor take care of a patient, something we used to take \nfor granted--that if a doctor thought a patient needed something, the \ndoctor ordered it for the patient. They can't do that anymore. That is \ntoo bad.\n  Patient care has been hindered, harmed, and damaged. What we want to \ndo with the Patients' Bill of Rights is reestablish the ability of a \ndoctor and a nurse to take care of my daughter, my sons, my wife, my \nchildren, my neighbors. Anyone who needs a doctor's care should be able \nto have the doctor's care. I don't want a doctor doing my taxes. I also \ndon't want an accountant doing my medical care. That is what we have in \nAmerica, in many instances, and it is wrong. This legislation that we \nare trying to bring up--and we will get to it; it is just a question of \nwhen--is supported by many organizations. I will soon read into the \nRecord the entities that support this legislation. Virtually every \nhealth care entity in America, every consumer group, every doctor \ngroup, including the American Medical Association and, surprisingly, \nbecause I have never known them to agree on anything, the AMA and the \nAmerican Trial Lawyers agree this legislation is necessary.\n\n  Who opposes it? The people providing the care, the managed care \nentities do not support this legislation. They are the ones paying for \nthe millions of dollars worth of ads on television trying to confuse \nand frighten the American people--just as they did with the health care \nplan in 1993. They spent\n\n[[Page S6432]]\n\n$100 million or more in advertising to frighten and confuse the \nAmerican people. I have to hand it to them; they did a great job. They \ndid frighten the American people. We are not going to let them do that.\n  We are going to complete this legislation. We are going to complete \nthis legislation very soon. What is very soon? By next Thursday, a week \nfrom this Thursday, and then if we finish it by that date, we are going \nto do our Fourth of July recess. If we do not complete our legislation \nby a week from Thursday, we are going to work here, according to the \nmajority leader, Tom Daschle, until we finish it. We are going to work \nFriday, Saturday, and we are going to work Sunday; the only day we are \ngoing to take off is July 4.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is overdue. It is important, and we \nare going to pass this legislation before we go back to be in parades \nfor the Fourth of July.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have heard utterances in this Chamber \ntoday about the Patients' Bill of Rights by Senator John McCain that we \nhave a lot of groups that support this legislation. I don't have a \ntotal because it is growing every day.

I have completed the groups beginning with the \nletter A. I will come back later and start with the B's and go through \nthe hundreds of groups that support this legislation. The overwhelming \nnumber of American people support this legislation, as referenced by \nthose organizations that begin with the letter A.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reid). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today, particularly \nwith the Presiding Officer who is in the Chair, to support a motion to \nproceed to S. 1052, the Bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I commend Senators McCain, Edwards, and Kennedy for the tremendous \neffort they put in to develop a strong, enforceable, and bipartisan \nbill with the support of over 500 consumer provider and health care \ngroups, as the Presiding Officer just demonstrated to us with the A's.\n  More importantly, I commend the American people because the American \npeople know what makes common sense with regard to the need to provide \neveryone quality health care that puts the relationship between the \ndoctor, the nurse, and the patient first.\n  Over the last 30 years, managed care organizations have come to \ndominate our health care system. These organizations both pay for and \nmake decisions about medical care, often preempting the fundamental \nrelationship in the health care equation between doctor and patient.\n  However, unlike doctors, nurses, or almost anybody in our society, \nHMOs, managed care institutions, are not held accountable for their \nmedical decisions and treatment decisions.\n  We just spent 8 weeks in the Senate talking about education and \naccountability. We need to talk about accountability within the context \nof the patient-doctor relationship, and that is what this debate will \nbe all about if we can ever get to the bill.\n  Unfortunately, in the case of some HMOs, they have sometimes skimped \non care that undermines the health of our patients, the health of the \nAmerican people for the preemption and benefit of the bottom line, and, \nin fact, it is all about protecting the bottom line.\n\n  That is why this legislation is absolutely critical. The McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy bill will ensure at long last that managed care \ncompanies are held accountable for their actions. Just as in all of \nindustry--every doctor and, frankly, every individual in America--\neveryone is held accountable.\n  We cannot afford to wait any longer before passing legislation to \ncurb insurance company, managed care abuses. According to physician \nreports, every single day we delay passage of\n\n[[Page S6433]]\n\nthis legislation, 14,000 doctors see patients whose health has \nseriously declined because an insurance plan refused to provide \ncoverage for a prescription drug; 10,000 physicians see patients whose \nhealth has seriously declined because an insurance plan did not approve \na diagnostic test or procedure; 7,000 physicians see patients whose \nhealth has seriously declined because an insurance plan did not approve \na referral to a medical specialist; 6,000 physicians see patients whose \nhealth has seriously declined because an insurance plan did not approve \nan overnight hospital stay. Think about that. That is 35,000 folks a \nday who are left with diminished and substandard care because we do not \nhave the right relationship between doctors and patients in place with \nthe interference of bureaucrats at insurance companies and HMOs.\n  This legislation has all the key components that Americans have \ndemanded to respond to these problems. It contains strong, \ncomprehensive patient protections.\n  It creates a uniform floor of protections for all Americans with \nprivate health insurance, regardless of whether something has been done \nin the States.\n  It provides a right to a speedy and genuinely independent external \nreview process when care is denied. It is not guaranteeing a lawsuit, \nit is guaranteeing a speedy independent external review.\n  Finally, it provides consumers with the ability to hold managed care \nplans accountable when plan decisions to withhold or limit care result \nin injury or death, harm and pain to the patient.\n  I wish to speak briefly about a few of the most important provisions \nin this bill, but this is all about common sense.\n  First, this bill protects all Americans in all health plans. If we \nare serious about providing consumers with protections, we must be \nserious about covering all Americans. The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill \ndoes just that. No person is left without rights because they live in a \nState with weaker protections.\n  Second, the legislation ensures a swift, internal review process is \nfollowed and a fair and independent external appeals process if it is \nnecessary. This will guarantee that health care providers, not health \nplans, will control basic medical decisions. It does not guarantee a \nlawsuit; it provides a process for a legitimate review of a patient's \nclaims.\n  Third, the legislation guarantees access to necessary care. Patients \nshould not have to fight their health plan at the same time they are \nfighting an illness. That is why the legislation guarantees access to \nnecessary specialists, even if it means going out of a plan's provider \nnetwork. It seems pretty simple we ought to get to the right doctor for \nthe disease that is diagnosed.\n  Chronically ill patients will receive the speciality care they need \nwith this bill.\n  Patients will have access to an emergency room, any emergency room, \nwhen and where they need it.\n  Women will have easy access to OB/GYN services without unnecessary \nbarriers.\n  Children will have direct access to pediatricians and, most \nimportantly, pediatric specialists.\n  Patients can participate in potentially lifesaving clinical trials. \nThis is a critical protection for patients with Alzheimer's, cancers, \nor other diseases for which there are no sure cures.\n  Fourth, the legislation protects the crucial provider-patient \nrelationship--doctor-patient, nurse-patient.\n  It contains antigag rule protections ensuring health plans cannot \nprevent doctors and nurses from discussing all treatment options with \ntheir patients. It sounds like common sense, and it limits improper \nincentive arrangements by the insurance industry.\n  Finally, this legislation makes sure that the rights we seek to \nguarantee are enforceable. Yes, this legislation allows individuals \nharmed by an HMO to sue their HMO. This is a critical provision \nbecause, let's face it, a right without a remedy is no right at all.\n  Again, that fundamental accountability issue we have been talking \nabout, whether it is with regard to education, we also ought to be \ntalking about it with health care.\n  No matter what health care treatment protections are passed into law, \nunless patients can enforce their rights, the HMO is free to ignore \nthose requests. Health insurers must understand that unless they \ndeliver high-quality health care that protects the rights of patients, \nthey can and will be held accountable.\n  I wish to address for a moment the argument that this legislation \nwill lead to more uninsured Americans.\n  There is perhaps no issue about which I am more passionate than the \nuninsured, about 44 million in America. I believe health care is a \nbasic right, and neither the Government nor the private sector is doing \nenough to secure that right for everyone. I hope one day we will have \nthat debate. But let me be clear; if I believed this bill would \nincrease the number of uninsured--I believe a number of Senators \nbelieve the same--we would not support this.\n  Let me also point out the hundreds of health care and consumer groups \nthat support this legislation are also the very groups that are working \nthe hardest to expand coverage for the uninsured. They also would not \nsupport this legislation if they believed it would result in more \nuninsured. That issue is nothing but a diversion, a red herring, a \nscare tactic, because the CBO itself has said this legislation would \nonly increase premiums by 4.2 percent over a 10-year period.\n  This legislation will not result in higher numbers of uninsured. It \nwill result in better quality for patients. I heard Senator Kennedy \ntoday saying, whether it was about family medical leave or minimum wage \nor a whole series of things, people are just trying to scare folks into \nbelieving that taking action that is going to help the people of \nAmerica is somehow going to result in very negative results that ought \nto keep us from doing this and moving forward. It is just a bad \nargument. They are scare tactics at their worst.\n  In sum, I believe health decisions should be made based on what is \nbest for the patient. We need to assure the American people that the \npractice of medicine is in the hands of the doctors. We trust them with \nour lives. We should trust them to decide what care we need. I urge my \ncolleagues to agree to take up the bipartisan McCain-Edwards-Kennedy \nPatients' Bill of Rights. I see one of the authors now. I congratulate \nhim and the other sponsors for moving an important part of what needs \nto be done to make America's health care more secure for everyone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, let me first thank my colleague from New \nJersey for his passionate support for this important piece of \nlegislation, the Patients' Bill of Rights. I want to talk about several \nsubjects briefly, if I may.\n  First, some people have argued, in the press, the media, and on the \nfloor of the Senate during this debate today, that the only difference \nbetween the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights, the \nPatients Protection Act, and the bill that has been proposed by Senator \nFrist and others, is on the issue of accountability, taking HMOs to \ncourt.\n  There are multiple differences between these bills. There are \ndifferences in how you determine whether a State can opt out of the \nprotections covered by the Patient Protection Act, i.e., how much \ncoverage there is, how many people are covered by the bill.\n  There are differences in access to specialists outside the plan. Our \nbill specifically provides you can have access to a specialist. If a \nchild needs to see a pediatric oncologist, a child with cancer, the \nchild has a right to do that. Under their bill, the HMO is in charge of \nthat decision. Under our bill, there is a true independent review by \nthe independent review panel. If a claim has been denied by an HMO, \nthat question has been appealed within the HMO, and then if that was \nunsatisfactory, the next appeal is to an independent review panel. Our \nbill specifically provides that panel must in fact be independent. The \nHMO can't have anything to do with choosing them. Neither can the \npatient or the physician involved in the care.\n  Unfortunately, the Frist bill does not provide the HMO cannot have \ncontrol over that panel, which means the HMO essentially can have \ncontrol. It is like picking their own judge and jury in a case \ninvolving somebody's health, health care that could affect the family.\n\n[[Page S6434]]\n\n  The bottom line is, from start to finish, whether it is coverage, \naccess to specialists, access to a true independent review, if, as a \nmatter of last resort a case has to go to court, having that resolved \nquickly and efficiently or having it dragged out over years and years \nand years in a Federal court--on every single issue of difference, \nthere is a simple thing. Our bill protects patients. Our bill is on the \nside of families and doctors. Their bill is slanted to the HMOs.\n  So it is not an accident that the American Medical Association and \nover 300 health care groups--virtually every health care group in \nAmerica--support our bill. It is not an accident that the majority of \nthe Senate supports our bill. It is not an accident that the majority \nof the House of Representatives supports our bill. All these \norganizations that deal with these issues every day--I am not talking \nabout Members of the Senate, I am talking about doctors who practice \nmedicine every day, who deal with problems with HMOs, I am talking \nabout patients groups who hear these horror stories regularly about \nHMOs, who have analyzed this legislation, looked at it word by word by \nword from start to finish and have come to a simple conclusion: Our \nbill is a true patient protection act. Their bill is an HMO protection \nact. Our bill protects patients, doctors and families. Their bill, \ninstead of being a Patients' Bill of Rights, is a patient's bill of \nsuggestions because the rights contained therein are not enforceable.\n  To the extent there is an argument made during the course of this \ndebate that there are no differences, there are differences. There are \nimportant differences. From the beginning to the end of this bill, \nthere are important differences. The best evidence of those differences \nis the fact that the American Medical Association and doctors and \nhealth care providers and nurses groups all over America support our \nbill. They know what the problems are. They want to be able, along with \nfamilies, to make health care decisions. They want these decisions made \nby health care providers and families and not by some bureaucrat or \nclerk with no training and experience, sitting behind a desk somewhere, \nwho has never seen the patient. That is the difference between these \ntwo pieces of legislation.\n\n  As to the issue of accountability, that means what happens if you \nhave gone through the internal appeal at the HMO. The HMO denies care \nto a family. You go to the HMO and you attempt to appeal that. They \ndeny it again. Then you go to a truly external independent appeal, \nunder our bill, and that is not successful. As a matter of last resort, \nif, after all of that, the patient has been injured, the patient can go \nto court.\n  The whole purpose of that is to treat HMOs as every other health care \nprovider, as every small business, as every large business in America, \nas every individual who is listening to this debate. All the rest of us \nare responsible for what we do. We are held accountable, and we are \nresponsible. The HMOs are virtually the only entity in America that can \ndeny care to a child and the family can do nothing about it. They \ncannot question it; they cannot challenge it; they cannot appeal it; \nand they cannot take the HMO to court because the HMOs are privileged \ncitizens in this country.\n  I have to ask, if you were to send out a questionnaire to the \nAmerican people and say: Here are 10 groups of Americans--physicians, \ndoctors, patients--and on that list were HMOs, and you said, on this \nlist, whom would you want to protect from any accountability, from ever \nbeing able to be taken to court, to be treated as privileged citizens, \nI suggest the likelihood that the HMOs would end up at the top of that \nlist is almost nonexistent.\n  What we have is an anachronism. We have a law that was passed in \n1974, before the advent of managed care, before HMOs were making health \ncare decisions. Then after the passage of this law, with the passage of \nthese protections that gave managed care companies privileged status, \nthey started making health care decisions.\n  We have a situation that needs to be corrected. All this is about is \ntreating HMOs as every other entity and individual in America. We want \nthem to be like all the rest of us. It is just that simple. They are \nnot entitled to be treated better than the rest of us. But, surprise, \nsurprise; they don't like it. They are being dragged, kicking and \nscreaming every step of the way, and they are spending millions and \nmillions of dollars on television ads, on public relations campaigns to \ndefeat our bill. Why? They like being privileged. They like being \ntreated like nobody else in America is treated. They like the fact that \nthey can decide something and nobody can do anything about it. Why \nwouldn't they like it? Why wouldn't they want to keep things exactly as \nthey are?\n  That is what this debate is about. Ultimately, we are going to have \nto decide on the floor of the Senate and at the end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue, hopefully, if we can get this bill through the Senate and the \nHouse, whether we are on the side of the big HMOs or whether we are on \nthe side of patients and doctors.\n  Earlier today I made reference to a story of a man in North Carolina \nnamed Steven Grissom. He was a young man who developed leukemia. He \nbecame sicker and sicker. He got to the point where his specialist at \nDuke University Medical Center had to put him on 24-hour-a-day oxygen.\n  This is Steve Grissom, the man I referred to earlier.\n  His wife's employer HMO covered Steve Grissom. Unfortunately, his \nwife's employer changed HMOs. Some clerk sitting behind a desk \nsomewhere who had never seen Steven and had never met him and with no \nmedical expertise said: We are not paying for this. We don't think he \nneeds it. They literally cut off his oxygen.\n  What was Steve Grissom going to do? He was like every family, every \nchild, and every patient in America with an HMO that makes a decision. \nHe couldn't do anything about it. He couldn't challenge it. He couldn't \nappeal it. He couldn't take them to court. He was absolutely helpless.\n  That is what this legislation is about. It is about giving Steve \nGrissom--when the HMO says we are not giving you your oxygen that your \nspecialist says you need--the ability to do something about it. It is \nabout allowing him to go to an appeal, and most importantly to a truly \nindependent review panel of doctors who, in every single case such as \nSteve's, will reverse the decision.\n  When his heart specialist at Duke University Medical Center says you \nneed this oxygen 24 hours a day, and you put that question to a panel \nof three doctors, what do you think the result is going to be? They are \ngoing to order that the HMO pay for the oxygen that Steve needs.\n  That is what this debate is about.\n  There are real differences between our bill and the Frist bill.\n  For example, when Steve's care was denied, we go to a panel that the \nHMO can have no control over; that a truly independent patient can't \nhave anything to do with; that Steve couldn't have any connection with; \nand that the HMO can't have any connection with. It is objective and \nfair.\n  Unfortunately, under the Frist bill the HMO could choose the people \non the review panel. There is absolutely nothing to prohibit that. \nSteve will be making his case to a judge and jury picked by the HMO.\n  That is an important difference between our bill and this bill.\n  The bottom line is that what we are about is trying to empower \npatients and empower doctors to make health care decisions; have people \nwho are trained and experienced to make those decisions and the people \nwho are impacted by them. That is what this legislation is about.\n  To the extent that people suggest this is going to result, No. 1, in \nemployers being sued, we will debate this issue going forward. But it \nis very clear in our legislation that we protect employers. It is \nequally clear that we abide completely by the President's principle on \nthis issue. The President said only employers who retain responsibility \nfor and make final medical decisions should be subject to suit.\n  That is exactly what our bill does. Our bill does exactly what the \nPresident's principle provides. On this issue of employers being \nprotected from lawsuits, we are in complete agreement with the White \nHouse.\n  As to the cost issue, the difference in cost between our bill and \nSenator Frist's bill--the bill that the White\n\n[[Page S6435]]\n\nHouse has endorsed--is 37 cents per employee per month. This is what \nthey contend is going to result in a massive loss of insurance \ncoverage, 37 cents a month. The difference between the bills on taking \nthe HMO to court--the accountability provision--is 12 cents a month. \nBetween 12 and 37 cents a month is not going to cause people not to be \ninsured.\n\n  More importantly, we will give people a better price. We give them \nreal quality health care. The reason that it is 37 cents a month more \nfor employees is because they get better care. They get better access \nto clinical trials, better access to specialists, and better access to \nemergency rooms. When the HMO does something wrong, they can get that \ndecision reversed by the independent review panel.\n  That is what this debate is about.\n  We have a decision to make over the course of the next few weeks. I \nhope for the sake of the Steve Grissoms all over this country--many of \nwhose stories have been told today and will continue to be told on \nbehalf of these families--that we will do what is necessary to make \nsure that HMOs and insurance companies in this country are treated just \nas everybody else, and that families and doctors can make health care \ndecisions that affect their lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the issue of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. I love the title. It is a great title. I hope \nwe can pass a positive and good Patients' Bill of Rights--one that \nreally provides patient protections but doesn't increase costs and \ndoesn't scare employers away.\n  Unfortunately, I don't think that is the case with the bill we are \nconsidering today, S. 1052.\n  I haven't quite figured it out. Last week, we were on the McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy bill, S. 871. That was last Wednesday. I was reviewing \nit and trying to become more familiar with the sections and what that \nbill meant to employers, to people providing health care, to Federal \nemployees, and so on. Now we are considering a different bill, S. 1052. \nIt is important for us to know as Senators because we are going to be \nvoting on the legislation. This is one of a few bills. Every once in a \nwhile we consider legislation that will have a significant impact on \neverybody's lives. We did that when we passed the tax cut package \nrecently. That will change everybody's taxes. People are going to see \ntax refunds coming in the mail in the next couple of months. I think \nthat is very positive. People are going to see their rates reduced \neffective July 1. I think that is positive. That is a positive impact \nbill. This is a bill that will have a significant impact on everybody \nwho has health care.\n  A lot of people have health insurance. Then some people have health \ncare. There is a difference. A lot of people are uninsured.\n  When we wrestle with the problem of health care, we need to address \nthe number of people who are uninsured, and we need to reduce that \nnumber. By all means, we shouldn't pass any legislation that is going \nto increase the number of uninsured.\n  Everybody realizes when we have 42,500,000 uninsured people, that is \ntoo many. I think Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and \nliberals, agree with that. We ought to be working to reduce the number \nof uninsured as much as we possibly can. We probably will never get it \ndown to zero, but we ought to make some improvement. But for crying out \nloud, let's not pass legislation that will increase the number of \nuninsured.\n  Unfortunately, I believe that is what would happen if we passed this \nso-called McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill.\n  I believe if we pass this bill in its present form, we are going to \nincrease the number of uninsured, probably in the millions. I wish that \nwere not the case. I hope by the time we finish the debate and \namendment procedure in this Senate Chamber that will not be the case. I \nvery much hope President Bush can join with us and sign a bill and we \ncan be shaking hands. I have mentioned this to Senator Kennedy--we have \nbeen adversaries on this issue for a couple years now--I hope we can be \nshaking hands and saying we have done a good job; we have protected \npatients, and we did it in a way that did not really increase costs \nvery much, and maybe we did some things that would increase the number \nof insured in the process, so that we did not do any damage.\n  We should do no harm. Congress would be much better off not to pass \nany bill than to pass a bill that greatly increased the cost to people \nbuying health care and/or increasing the number of uninsured.\n  Let's say we want to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. Great. But \nlet's do no harm. Let's not increase costs dramatically. Let's not \nincrease the number of uninsured, especially if we are talking about \nmillions. And that is what we are talking about in the bill before us \ntoday. I wish that were not the case.\n  Let's go through the bill. And I think we will have some time. We \nneed some time since we have not had any hearings on this bill. This \nbill has never been through a Senate markup.\n  In the last Congress, we did mark up the Norwood-Dingell bill. We did \nnot pass Norwood-Dingell in the Senate. We passed a substitute bill on \nwhich many of us worked. I thought it was a positive piece of \nlegislation. I thought it had a lot of good things. It would have \naddressed the problem our friend, the Senator from North Carolina, just \naddressed.\n  He said an individual, Steve Grissom, was denied health care. That \nwas unfortunate. The bill we passed last year had internal-external \nappeals. That external appeal would have been quick. That person would \nhave had health care and would not have had to go to court and would \nnot have had to choose between State court and Federal court, seen \ntrial attorneys--would not have had to do any of that. They would have \nhad health care. They would have had an appeals process, and that \nappeals process would have been binding.\n  Somebody said: We need accountability. We need enforceability.\n  We had it binding where, if the plan did not comply with the external \nappeal, they would be fined $10,000 a day.\n  So I think in that case--and that is a terrible case, where maybe \nsomebody, unfortunately, was denied care--they would have gotten the \ncare; and they would have gotten it quickly; and they would not have \ngone to court. They would not have received the care in the courtroom \nbut would have received it by doctors. I agree. Let's solve that \nproblem.\n  We were very close to an agreement on internal-external appeals to \nresolve 99 percent of these cases. That is not the case with the bill \nwe have before us. In the bill we have before us, I would say, for the \n128 million private-sector Americans who are in private health care, \nwho receive their health care from their employer, look out, because \nthere is legislation coming, with a very good name, that makes the \nemployer liable in almost all cases, not just the HMOs, and it makes \nthem liable to the extent that a lot of employers are going to be \nscared to offer their employees health care. Some may opt out.\n  In addition, it will increase costs so significantly that a whole lot \nof people are going to say: Wait a minute, these costs are so high, I \ncan't afford it. My employees didn't appreciate how much money we were \nspending on health care. So I asked them, instead of me spending $5,000 \nor $6,000 a year per family on health care--up to $7,000 now--would you \nprefer the money and you can buy health care on your own? A lot of \nemployees will say: Yes, count me; I would like to have that money. \nMaybe they will buy health care on their own, and maybe they won't.\n  Unfortunately, a lot of employees would not, so the number of \nuninsured would rise, and I believe rise dramatically. So employers \nwould be scared from the cost standpoint, and they would also be \nfrightened because there would be unlimited liability.\n  There has been some misrepresentation by some, saying: This bill has \ncaps on liability. It does not have any caps on noneconomic damages. \nThere are all kinds of damages. And this bill has new causes of action \nfor Federal lawsuits. It has new causes of action for State lawsuits. \nIt allows people to be able to\n\n[[Page S6436]]\n\njury shop: Let's find a good jury in a good county. With one good jury, \nyou can become a billionaire nowadays. Wow. A lot of employees would \nsay: Thank you very much, but I can't afford that exposure; I can't \nafford that liability, the fact that one jury case, for something I had \nnothing to do with whatsoever, could put me into bankruptcy. So they \nmight say: We are just going to opt out. We don't have to provide this \nbenefit.\n  Some people would like to mandate that employers provide health care, \nbut that is not going to pass, and they know that is not going to pass.\n  So the net effect is, a lot of employers will say: I don't have to \nprovide this benefit. I want to, but I can't afford the exposure.\n  I just met somebody today who owns a restaurant. Actually, today, I \nmet with two people who own a restaurant each. I heard people say: Hey, \nyou are going to choose between the HMOs and the people. I met with two \npeople today who each owns and operates a restaurant. One owns a small \nrestaurant in Maryland. They said, if this bill passes, because of the \nliability provisions, they probably won't provide health care for their \nemployees. They just started providing health care for their employees. \nRestaurants are the type of business where not everybody provides \nhealth care for their employees.\n  All the major automobile manufacturers provide health care for their \nemployees. They will probably continue to do so because of collective \nbargaining agreements. Interestingly, there is a little section that \nexempts collective bargaining agreements. Whoops. I thought we were \nproviding all these protections for everybody. But there is a \nprotection for organized labor here that kind of exempts the organized \nlabor contracts for the duration of their contracts. So they might be \nexempt for years.\n  We will get into some of the loopholes left in this provision. But \nthis small restaurant owner said: I don't think I can afford the \nliability. I am afraid of doing that. And this person--female--operates \nher own business, which is family operated, I believe second \ngeneration, and they have had the business for 30-some-odd years, I \nbelieve. It is not all that large. About half her employees now have \nhealth care. She said today, she does not think she can continue \nproviding health care if this bill passes.\n\n  I met with a restaurant owner who has a larger restaurant not too far \nfrom here in Northern Virginia. This person started providing health \ncare for their employees and said: No way, not with this liability. You \nwould make it impossible.\n  Wait a minute; employers are exempt. I heard that today. Oh, \nemployers are exempt? Yes, there is a section in this bill exempting \nemployers, on page 144: ``Causes of Action Against Employers and Plan \nSponsors Precluded.'' Great. That will make Don Nickles happy, and \nothers happy. That sounds pretty good. That is paragraph (A).\n  Paragraph (B): ``Certain Causes of Action Permitted. Notwithstanding \nsubparagraph (A), a cause of action may arise against an employer or \nother plan sponsor. . . .''\n  Look out, employers. You had better read paragraph (B). You are \nliable. Oh, there are a few little exemptions. If they do this, this, \nand this, they will not be liable. But it does not cover everybody. I \npromise you, as an employer, if they complete their fiduciary \nresponsibilities, they are liable. And when employers find out they are \nliable, they are going to be scared of this bill and the results of \nthis bill, and a lot of them will quit providing health care for their \nemployees. In other words, if we take legislative action, maybe with \nvery good intentions, there may be very adverse results.\n  They did that in the State of California on energy. They passed a \nbill that had a great title calling it a deregulation bill, but it had \nall kinds of regulations, and it had a lot of adverse results. This \nbill, I am afraid, if we passed it today, and it became law, would have \na lot of adverse results.\n  President Bush has said he would veto this bill. And he is right in \ndoing so. And we have the votes to sustain that veto.\n  Some people said: Why not pass this bill as it is, let the President \nveto it, you sustain his veto, and, hey, you have covered the subject? \nI do not think that is responsible legislating. Maybe it would be the \neasy way out. That way, we can just raise a few objections, vote no, \nand let him veto the bill. I do not think that is responsible.\n  I think we need to review this bill. I think every Senator should \nknow what is in this bill. I will tell you, from the public comments I \nhave heard, in some cases the sponsors of this bill may not know what \nis in this legislation.\n  So we need to consider what is in this bill. We need to talk about \nit. We need to see if we can improve it. Hopefully, we can improve it \nto the degree that we will have bipartisan support for a solution with \nperhaps 80 sponsors of the bill and have overwhelming support. I would \nlove to see that happen. I will work to see that happen. I have \ninvested a lot of time on this issue. I want to pass a good bill. This \nbill does not meet that definition.\n  I heard a couple people say this bill is consistent with the \nprinciples the President outlined. That is factually inaccurate. That \nis a gross misinterpretation of the President's principles. They were \nnot written that fuzzily. I will outline in another speech what are the \nPresident's principles and where this bill falls fatally short--not \nshort in a gray area but fatally short.\n  I am just concerned that maybe some people are a little loose in \ntheir statements, saying this is consistent with what the President \nwants, and so on, this is consistent with the Texas plan, and so on. I \ndo not think that is factually correct. So I wanted to mention that.\n  I want to do a good bill. This does not fit the pattern.\n  What about a couple of other things? Should the Federal Government \ntake over what the States are doing in the regulation of health care? \nSome people obviously think we should. As a matter of fact, I look at \nthe scope sections of the bill, and I am almost amused. We are going to \nhave a preemption: State flexibility. It says, on page 122, ``[nothing \nshall] be construed to supersede any provision of State law which \nestablishes, implements, or continues in effect any standard or \nrequirement solely relating to health [insurers]. . . .''\n  Boy, that sounds good. I like that section. I don't know if there is \na bait-and-switch section in here or what, but that sounds so good. \nThat sounds like something I would put in there. But it doesn't stop \nthere. It goes on.\n  Then it says, on the next couple pages: If the State law provides for \nat least substantially equivalent and effective patient protections to \nthe patient protection requirements which the law relates. In other \nwords, we are not going to mess with the States unless the States, of \ncourse, have to provide at least substantially equivalent and effective \npatient protections as this bill does.\n  Well, what does substantially equivalent and effective mean? It \nmeans, States, you need to do exactly what we tell you to do. We are \ngoing to preempt everything you have. If you have an ER provision, it \nhas to match our ER provision, our emergency room provision. If you \nhave access to OB/GYN, you have to match our access provision to OB/\nGYN. And there is a lot of difference.\n  If you have clinical trials in your State, you have to match these \nclinical trials, which are enormously expensive clinical trials, which \nare covered by anything that NIH would offer or anything by FDA or \nanything by DOD or anything by the VA. There are a lot of clinical \ntrials. You have to pay for them. It may be the State of New Jersey did \npay for them or did not.\n  Under this bill, there is not one State in the Union that meets the \nclinical trial provisions of this bill. Why? Because they are very \nexpensive provisions; because they are unknown provisions; because no \none knows how much they would cost. And so the States have been kind of \ncautious on putting in clinical trial provisions. They have done it \nrather cautiously. The State of Delaware is considering clinical trials \ntoday, legislation on a patients' bill of rights. They have a clinical \ntrial provision, and it is not nearly as expensive as the one that is \nmandated in this bill.\n  The essence of this bill is, State, we don't care what you have \nnegotiated. We don't care how many hearings you had. We don't care if \nthe legislature worked on this for months and negotiated it with the \nGovernors and the\n\n[[Page S6437]]\n\nproviders in your State. We don't care because we know what is best. \nOne size fits all. I guess two or three Senators decided they know what \nis best. They know better than every single State insurance commission. \nThey know better than every State legislature. They know better than \nevery Governor, every person who is in the buying business. We are \ngoing to mandate that these have to be in your contract, in your \ncoverage.\n  I accidently said the word ``contract.'' Most of this is done by \ncontract. There is a provision in here that says you don't have to \nabide by the contract. That is a heck of a deal. So when people try to \nhave a contract, here is what we will cover, here is what we don't \ncover, so you can have some kind of limitation on cost.\n  There is a little provision in the bill that says the reviewer shall \nconsider but ``not be bound by the definition used by the plan or \nissuer of medically necessary and appropriate.'' Not be bound--in other \nwords, they can provide anything they want to provide. It doesn't make \nany difference what is in the contract. That is in this little bill.\n  How do you get a cost estimate of how much this bill is going to \ncost? Because no one knows. The contracts aren't binding. Wow. There \nare a lot of things in here.\n  Then I have heard people say: We are going to make sure the States \nhave provisions that are substantially equivalent and as effective. Who \nis going to determine if something is as effective? We are going to \nhave the Federal Government. HCFA is going to review the State \nstandards. HCFA will determine whether or not you are substantially \nequivalent and as effective. The only way you are going to get there \nwith any certainty is to have identical language. And then who is going \nto know whether or not it is as effective? That is as subjective as it \ncould possibly be.\n\n  You have a standard that is higher than HCFA. You have a standard \nhigher than anybody has ever imposed. It says: Here is everything we \nmandate. If you want Federal, nationally dictated health care, it is in \nthis bill. Wow. I didn't know we were taking over for the State. I \ndidn't know we had the people to do it.\n  Guess what. We don't. There is no way in the world the Federal \nGovernment has the resources in HCFA, the Health Care Finance \nAdministration--which now has a new name which I can't remember and \nwon't for the time being--there is no way in the world they could do \nthis. Every State has insurance commissioners or regulators that are in \ncharge of making sure the insurance companies in their State are \nadequately financed, meet their fiduciary responsibilities, that they \nmeet their insurance responsibilities, that they uphold what they say \nthey are going to do in the contracts, every State. I would imagine in \nNew Jersey, it is hundreds of people--hundreds. I am sure it is in the \nhundreds. My State of Oklahoma is in the hundreds.\n  HCFA, the Health Care Finance Administration, couldn't enforce that. \nThere is no way in the world. There is a list of patient protections \nthat every State has done. In my State, it is 40 some; in most States \nit is 30, 40, 50 different State protections. We are going to say: We \ndon't care what you have done. Those aren't good enough. We are going \nto basically say these protections are preeminent. These will supersede \nwhat your State has done. You must do as we tell you to do. If you \ndon't, the Federal Government will take over enforceability of those \nprovisions.\n  Then you will have the awkward situation of having the Federal \nGovernment enforce some provisions in your health care contract but not \nall the provisions. That is really going to make a lot of sense. Then \nthere is going to be this little period of time where the State has \nbeen enforcing these State regulations. Now we have a new Federal \nregulation, and it is supposed to be prevailing. But the State \nregulation, we are used to enforcing it. Which one do we abide by? They \nare not familiar with the Federal enforceability. No one has ever \nenforced this one before. So should the State enforce the Federal \nregulation? They can't do it. The HCFA person hasn't signed off. \nTherefore, HCFA is going to take over, and they don't have anybody to \nenforce it.\n  Now what you have is language saying you have these protections, but \nyou don't have anybody to enforce it because HCFA can't do it. They \nabsolutely can't do it.\n  Somebody should ask the Secretary of Health and Human Services, do \nyou have the capability to regulate State insurance to enforce these \nprovisions that the McCain-Kennedy-Edwards bill would do? The answer is \nno. No, they couldn't do it. So we are going to have a long list of \nprotections that we supposedly are telling everybody they have: look \nwhat we have done for you, but there is no enforceability because the \nFederal Government doesn't have the wherewithal to do it.\n\n  And we shouldn't do it. That is not our responsibility. Yet we are \ngoing to have that kind of takeover. I think that would be a serious \nmistake as well.\n  Then what about this comment: Under this bill, we insure all \nAmericans. Wow, sounds really good. We are really going to provide \nprotections for all Americans.\n  First, I should ask: Are we disabusing Federal employees? Are we \ndisabusing our families, Senators' families who are under the Federal \nemployees health care plans? Do they have such a crummy deal that we \nneed to change their plans? The truth is, we don't change Federal \nemployees. We change State employees. I hope everybody knows that we \nare going to go out and tell every Governor, every State insurance \ncommissioner: we are going to change your public employees' health care \nplans. We are going to mandate you do all these things. We exempted \nFederal employees. Whoops.\n  You mean we are going to mandate all State employees, all teacher \nplans. We are going to mandate that all of those have to have what we \nhave decided big government knows best. Yet for Federal employees, \nwhoops, we exempted them. Organized labor, if they have a contract, we \nexempted them. Medicare, for we exempted them. Medicaid, low-income \nindividuals, whoops, these don't apply to Medicaid. They don't apply to \nMedicare. They don't apply to Federal employees. They don't apply to \nunion members, until their contract is renewed, maybe 5 years or so \nbefore that happens, if they have a long-term contract.\n  There are a lot of little gaps. If this is so good for the private \nsector, why don't we put it on the public sector? Why don't we put it \non the Senate? A Senator or their family members, can they sue the \nGovernment? If they are aggrieved, can you sue the Government? The \nanswer is no. You still can't. Even if this bill passes, you can't sue \nthe Government. Everybody else can sue their employer. You can't sue \nyours.\n  I wonder if cost has anything to do with it. There are some things \nthat just don't fit. It is fine for us to do this on all private sector \nplans, act as if that will only cost 37 cents a day. Maybe they said a \nweek. The cost of health care right now for a family is about $7,000. \nAt 4.2 percent of $7,000, figuring this up, you are talking about $300 \na year. Some people say: That is just cents; that is a dollar a week or \nsomething. It is not a dollar a week. It is $300 a year. Maybe that is \nabout a dollar a day. That is about the equivalent of the tax cut that \na lot of Americans are going to receive this year. We are just going to \ntake it away. So we give a tax cut with one hand and we take it away \nwith higher health care costs in the next by this bill? We can sure do \nthat.\n  Somebody said: I broke even for the year. What if you are one of the \n1 or 2 million people who lost your health care because your employer \ndropped it? You came out on the real bad end of the deal.\n  This didn't cost you a dollar a day. This didn't cost you a Big Mac. \nThis cost you your health care--probably to a person who needs health \ncare the most. A lot of people who are in that low-income bracket, \nmaybe working for a small restaurant in Montana, or someplace, and \nmaybe their employer just started to provide health care, or wants to \nprovide it, and they could not do it because they could not afford it, \nor because they are afraid of the liability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6438]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. My point is, let's be very careful not to do damage to \nthe system, not to do damage to a quality health care system that is \nfar from perfect. Let's do some things to make sure that we increase \nthe number of people who have insurance. Let's not do anything that \nwould increase the number of uninsured. That is doing a very serious \nharm. If anybody says, hey, this bill has so much momentum, so let's \npass it regardless of what it costs or what the consequences are, I beg \nto differ. It is worth spending a little bit of time to try to be at \nleast responsible in this area. Let's not do damage. Let's not \nsupersede the States. Let's not act as if the Federal Government knows \nbest: Sorry States, we are going to take over the regulation of your \nhealth care system because we know better.\n  Every person here who works in this system for very long knows that \nwe do not know better. We do a crummy job. HCFA does a crummy job in \nadministering Medicare. They are way behind even in enforcement and \ncompliance with the Health Insurance Portability Act. Some States still \naren't in compliance. HCFA is supposed to take over regulation of that \nact. If they haven't done that, how in the world can they do it for \nprivate care? They could not do it.\n  Let's pass a positive bill. I stand ready to work with my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to do that. I am willing to spend a lot of \ntime to work out a real bipartisan bill, one that has support by a \nmajority of the Members on both sides. To say that this is a bipartisan \nbill when you have 3 Republicans sponsoring it and 40-some odd \nvigorously opposed to it is stretching it. That is not bipartisan. \nLet's have a bipartisan bill where you have a majority of both \nDemocrats and Republicans supporting the bill. That is real bipartisan \nbill. Let's get a bill that President Bush will sign and become law, \nnot just have campaign rhetoric. Let's make something happen that we \ncan say we have passed a positive bill. I hope we can do so. It remains \nto be seen.\n  There is going to have to be some willingness to compromise. Some \npeople say we have compromised enough. This bill is not a compromise. \nThis bill is to the left of the Norwood-Dingell bill that we had last \nyear. It is more expensive than that bill. The liability provisions are \nmore intrusive and expensive than the bill Congressmen Norwood and \nDingell and Senator Kennedy were pushing last year. It is not a \ncompromise. It is a move in the wrong direction.\n  Let's move toward the center. I have shown a willingness--maybe more \nthan I should have--to compromise and try to come up with a positive \nbill. Let's work together as both Democrats and Republicans to come up \nwith a bill that we can all be proud of, that President Bush can sign, \nand one that can become law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I see my friend from Nevada on the \nfloor. I wanted to make a few comments at the end of our first day of \ndiscussion.\n  Madam President, I just hope those who are watching this debate have \nsome understanding about the history of this legislation and what it \nreally is all about. This legislation was first introduced 5 years ago. \nSo that is why we hear on the Senate floor that our colleagues are glad \nto consider the legislation. We should be eager to consider this \nlegislation because every day that we let go by there are more than \n50,000 people who are experiencing increased suffering and injury.\n  There are 35,000 people today who didn't get the specialist they need \nin order to help them mend and get better. There are 12,000 patients \nwho, tonight, will be taking prescription drugs that were not what the \ndoctor ordered, but what the HMO is giving them.\n  There are countless illustrations where the HMOs' decisions are being \nmade by bureaucrats and bean counters in cities many miles away from \nthe highly trained professional medical personnel who are trying to \nprovide care. These health care professionals are making decisions that \nare being countered by accountants and bean counters who aim to enhance \nthe bottom line of the HMOs.\n  The real issue, when it is all said and done, is whether we are going \nto put into law some rather minimum standards that are already \neffective in Medicare and Medicaid. These fundamental standards have \nbeen recommended by the insurance commissioners, and unanimously by a \nbipartisan panel.\n  I have listened carefully to a number of the statements that have \nbeen made out here recently. I did not detect any statements directly \nbefore the Senate that are critical of the proposal that has been \nadvanced here. Yet there has been an objection made. I haven't heard \nthem say: let us not have that protection for the people, or let's not \ngive them the emergency care protection, let's not give them the \nspecialty protection, let's not give them the clinical trials in there. \nDid anybody hear that during the course of the afternoon? I did not \nhear that.\n  That is what this is about. That is what this is about. As we all \nknow, people try to make the best case they can in opposition. And at \nthe end of this first day, I find I am very much encouraged by the \nrange of speakers who have spoken in favor of this legislation. I think \nthere is increasing understanding by the American people, as in the \ndebate here in the Senate, about the importance of this legislation.\n  We know the HMOs are spending millions of dollars on distortion and \nmisrepresentation. They ought to be spending that on patients' care, \nbut they are not. We welcome the opportunity to get to the bill before \nus and then have a full debate on these matters. There are some who \nwonder whether this is a bipartisan bill. I was listening to my friend \nand colleague from Oklahoma say he really wonders whether this is a \nbipartisan bill. Well, Congressman Norwood, Congressman Ganske, and 63 \nRepublican Members of the House of Representatives certainly believe \nthat it is a bipartisan bill. We are certainly proud of the Republicans \nwho have supported this measure in the Senate. I think that gives us \nhope.\n  I see the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I want to ask the Senator a question when he has a minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. At the end of this discussion today, we ought to realize \nthat virtually every single medical organization--the American Medical \nAssociation, children's health, women's health, disability \norganizations, senior health organizations, and patient organizations--\nis supporting this bipartisan proposal. There are but a handful of \norganizations that support our opponents' proposal, and virtually all \nof these organizations have also endorsed our bill. I put that out as a \nchallenge. I hope those who are opposed to this bipartisan proposal are \ngoing to at least give us the credit for the very breadth of support \nthat comes to this proposal. This comes from people who have studied \nthis issue, worked this issue, and whose livelihood is affected by this \nissue in terms of the type of care they can provide for families all \nacross this country.\n  So, Madam President, I look forward to the debate.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I have been interested in the debate from the other side. \nIsn't it interesting that they are so concerned about the uninsured now \nwith the Patients' Bill of Rights? As the Senator from Massachusetts \nwill recall, we tried to do something about the uninsured, and no one \nwas too interested then.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. In fact, it has gone up since then.\n  I also ask the Senator if he recognizes that one of the things they \nare saying is HCFA is understaffed and would not be able to handle the \nnew duties given to them by this legislation. Who has been cutting back \ntheir budget all these years, strangling these organizations so they \ncannot render appropriate care to the constituency they are delegated \nto serve?\n  Has the Senator heard them complaining about understaffing?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The answer is yes, not only have I heard it, but I \nremember debating with my good friend from Oklahoma on the increase for \nHCFA, which was recommended by the General Accounting Office--that \nthere would be an $11 million increase for HCFA to administer. He \nopposed that. He fought it tooth and nail. So they did not get the \nadditional support. And\n\n[[Page S6439]]\n\nthen they complain when they are inadequately staffed to do the job.\n  Thankfully, $2 million came out of the committee, even though we were \nunable to get anything on the floor. I said this to my friend, Senator \nNickles, so I do not mind mentioning it here in his absence because--he \nis here now. He remembers his battle against giving additional funding \nto HCFA to implement the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, and he took great \nrelish in that opposition. The Senator from Nevada has pointed that \nout.\n  I agree HCFA is a challenge because we have given them a great deal \nof additional responsibility in recent times. We have given them the \nCHIP program which is working in the States. They are doing a good job. \nThey have Kassebaum-Kennedy, which is the portability legislation to \nhelp those who are disabled move around through jobs and not be \ndiscriminated against.\n  I am reminded by my staff that the latest GAO report shows HCFA is \ndoing a good job, and virtually every State is effectively \nadministering the Mothers and Infants Protection Act and the Women's \nCancer Act, which have been additional responsibilities for HCFA. They \nare doing a good job with that as well.\n  I know it is easy to have whipping boys around here. HCFA is out \nthere. We all can probably find instances in our own States where we \nwish they had made other decisions. That certainly should not be used \nas an excuse in opposition to this legislation.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Did I understand my friend and colleague to say the \nState of Massachusetts now complies with the Health Insurance \nPortability Act?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Not completely. What the State of Massachusetts complies \nwith is the CHIP program. Massachusetts is the No. 1 State in the Union \nwith the lowest number of uninsured children. We have done an \noutstanding job with that. We still have work to do in other areas, \nsuch as HIPAA. Rather than take the spirit of the legislation that \nSenator Kassebaum believed to be the case--I had serious doubts about \nit--which was that there would not be a significant increase in \npremiums--we find a number of States, with the support of the insurance \nindustry, have raised rates so high as to undermine the effectiveness \nof the program.\n  Mr. NICKLES. So the State of Massachusetts still does not comply with \nthe Health Insurance Portability Act we passed several years ago?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Parts of it they do; not all of it, I say to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I was just wondering.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine. I am not going to get into whether the \nRepublican Governors in my State were in opposition to enforcing it. \nThat is not relevant here tonight.\n\n  The point is, Mr. President, this legislation we have before us \ntonight protects children, women, and families. It is about doctors, \nnurses, and families making decisions that will not be overridden by \nbureaucrats and HMOs. That is what this legislation is about.\n  We welcome the chance finally, finally, finally, to have it before \nthe Senate. We look forward to the amendments to begin.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold for a minute? While the Senator \nis here, I want to ask him another question. We talked about the \nuninsured, and we heard the other side talk about the shortage of \nstaff. We have heard now a new one that has been going on all afternoon \non the other side about States rights--how are the Governors going to \nput up with this terrible bill?\n  I say to my friend from Massachusetts, isn't it interesting that no \nmatter what happens, there are always excuses that we cannot pass a \nPatients' Bill of Rights? This has been going on for 5 years. We now \nhave a bipartisan piece of legislation. I acknowledge the first \nlegislation that came out was partisan, just the Democrats authored it, \neven though some Republicans supported it. Now we have bipartisan \nlegislation. Senators McCain, Kennedy, and Edwards have written this \nlegislation. They are the chief sponsors of it. But now it is still not \ngood enough.\n  Have we not heard in the 5 years we have already spent on this \nlegislation about States rights? I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, \ndo you not think we resolve these States rights problems with this \nlegislation?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is exactly correct. Under the proposal \nbefore us, if there is substantial compliance, then the State \nprovisions will rule the responsibility and liability provisions. That \nis why I was so interested in what the Senator from Oklahoma said about \nnot being able to decide this in Washington, DC, because it is one size \ndoes not fit all; we have all learned that.\n  That is not, of course, what this legislation does. It lets the \nStates make the judgments about liability.\n  I am very interested in the fact there are a number of Senators on \nthe other side who do not want to permit their States to make the \njudgments with regard to liability issues. That is where the liability \nand negligence issues have been decided for over 200 years. The States \nhave the knowledge about these issues, and transferring responsibility \ninto the Federal system does not make a lot of sense. There are long \ndelays, more distance, and it is more costly to the patients.\n  We will have a full opportunity to debate those issues. I look \nforward to that debate.\n  The Senator is quite correct, we have in this legislation, in the \nliability provisions, shown very special deference, as has been stated \nduring the course of the day. Effectively 90 percent of these cases \nwill be tried in State courts. Only 10 percent will actually be tried \nin Federal courts, and those will be limited to contract cases.\n  The Senator is quite correct that we are relying upon the State \nsystem of justice, and that is the way it ought to be in this case. \nSenator McCain, Senator Edwards, and others involved in the development \nof that proposal found a good solution to it.\n  Mr. REID. Our majority leader is in the Chamber now, and I want to \nmake a brief statement and see if the Senator will agree with me.\n  We heard this harangue that this is legislation that deals with \nlawyers. The fact is, as to the two States where there is a Patients' \nBill of Rights, in 1 State there has been no litigation whatsoever; in \nthe State of Texas, where the President is from, in 4 years there have \nbeen 17 lawsuits filed. That is about four a year. That does not sound \noutrageous to me. Does it to the Senator from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct, and I will end with this note. \nWe can speculate and theorize, but under these circumstances we ought \nto look at the record. We have 50 million Americans who have \nprotections like what we are trying to provide for 170 million \nadditional Americans in the liability provisions. Those who have \nprotections are State and local employees and individuals who purchase \ninsurance. They have the right to sue. There is absolutely no evidence \nthat there has been a proliferation of lawsuits. There has not been any \nkind of abuse of the system, although those who are opposed to our \nlegislation have alleged that.\n  Secondly, there is absolutely no evidence that the costs for these \nvarious policies are in any way more costly than those without the \nliability provisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, as I indicated earlier today, Senator \nLott and I and others have been discussing the manner under which we \nmight be able to proceed to the bill. Earlier today, the unanimous \nconsent request to proceed to the bill was not agreed to. We have been \ndiscussing the matter throughout the day. I think I am now prepared to \npropound a unanimous consent agreement that reflects an understanding \nabout the way we might proceed later this week.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 9:30 on Thursday, June 21, the Senate \nvote on a motion to proceed to S. 1052, the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nand that the time between the completion of that vote and 12 noon be \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees for debate \nonly, and that at 12 noon the Republican manager or his designee be \nrecognized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, it is my intention, then, to stay on \nthe\n\n[[Page S6440]]\n\nmotion to proceed until the 9:30 time that we have now just agreed to \non Thursday. Should there be any interest in accelerating that, we \nwould certainly entertain it. However, at least now we know we will \nhave a vote at 9:30, and that our Republican colleagues will be \nrecognized to offer their first amendment at noon on Thursday.\n  I appreciate very much the willingness of Senator Nickles and \ncertainly the Republican leader and others who have been discussing \nthis matter with me for the last couple of hours.\n  Mr. REID. Could I ask the majority leader a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. In that we will start this debate this coming Thursday, is \nit still the intention of the leader to finish this bill before we take \nthe Fourth of July recess.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. There are two matters I think it is imperative we \nfinish. This is the first of the two, I answer my colleague, the \nassistant Democratic leader; and the other is the supplemental. I think \n2 good weeks of debate on this issue is certainly warranted.\n  We have had a debate on this matter in previous Congresses. I think \nwe should be prepared to work late into the night Thursday night. We \nwill be here on Friday. We will be in session on Friday, with \namendments and votes. We will stay on the bill throughout next week. As \nI say, we will hopefully set at least a desirable time for final \nconsideration Thursday of next week. Should we need Friday, we can \ncertainly accommodate that particular schedule, and if we need to go \nlonger into the weekend to do it, my intention is to stay here until we \ncomplete our work.\n  So, yes, I emphasize, as I have the last couple of days, that the \nSenate will complete this work, and hopefully the supplemental prior to \nthe time we leave for the July recess.\n  Mr. REID. We will work this Friday with votes, no votes on Monday, \nbut we will work on Monday.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I heard the leader say we would be working on the \nlegislation, considering amendments on Friday. Did the leader clarify \nwhether or not there will be votes on Friday?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. There will probably be votes on Friday but no votes on \nMonday.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thought I understood the majority leader to say we \nwould hold votes ordered on Friday to Tuesday.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I misspoke, I apologize. I intended to say, if I \ndidn't say, we would have votes and amendments offered on Friday but \nthat there wouldn't be any votes on Monday, but there would be \namendments considered and hopefully we can make some arrangement to \nconsider these votes as early on Tuesday morning as possible.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Does the leader have any indication how late we will \nvote on Friday?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We certainly wouldn't have any votes scheduled after \naround 1 o'clock on Friday.\n  Mr. NICKLES. To further clarify, I heard the intention that you would \nlike to have this completed by the Fourth of July, but correct me if I \nam wrong. We spent a little over 2 weeks on the education bill just on \nthe motion to proceed. I believe on the education bill in total we \nspent 6 or 7 weeks, and the education bill is a very important bill. \nLikewise, this is a very important bill. And this bill, like the \neducation bill, in my opinion, needs to be amply reviewed.\n  I don't know the period of time, but at least it is this Senator's \nintention we thoroughly consider what is in the language and how it can \nbe improved. Some Members want to have significant changes so the bill \ncan be signed. I am not sure if that can be done or completed in the \ntime anticipated or hoped for. I appreciate the dilemma the majority \nleader is in and his desire to conclude it a week from Thursday or \nFriday, but I am not sure that is obtainable. We will see where we are \nnext week.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I agree. I don't know whether it is attainable or not. \nBut I do know this: We will continue to have votes into the recess \nperiod to accommodate the completion of this bill.\n  My concern is, very frankly, we will come back after the Fourth of \nJuly recess--and I have talked to Senator Lott about this--with the \nrealization we have 13 appropriations bills to do and a recognition \nthat we have a very short period of time within which to do them. I \nknow the administration wants to finish these appropriations bills and \nSenator Lott has indicated he, too, is concerned about the degree to \nwhich we will be able to adequately address all of the many \ncomplexities of these bills as they are presented to the Senate.\n  I want to leave as much time as possible during that July block for \nthe appropriations process to work its will, and it is for that reason, \nin particular, that I want to complete our work on this bill so we can \naccommodate that schedule.\n  Again, I appreciate the desire of the Senator from Oklahoma to vet \nthis and to debate it. I hope we can find a way to resolve it prior to \nthe time we reach the end of next week.\n  There will, therefore, be no votes today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6440-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PRESIDENT BUSH RECOGNIZES LT. COL. BILL HOLMBERG AS AN AMERICAN HERO\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to call my colleagues' attention \nto a specific passage in President Bush's commencement address at the \nU.S. Naval Academy last month that was particularly meaningful to me. \nIn that reference, the President paid tribute to the heroism of a \nlongtime friend of mine, retired Marine Corps Lt. Colonel William C. \nHolmberg, class of '51.\n  I would like to quote from the President's speech:\n\n       But there are many others from the Class of '51 whose \n     stories are lesser known, such as retired Lieutenant Colonel \n     William C. Holmberg. One year and a handful of days after \n     graduation, Second Lieutenant Holmberg found himself on the \n     Korean peninsula, faced with a daunting task: to infiltrate \n     his platoon deep behind enemy lines in an area swarming with \n     patrol; to rout a tenacious enemy; to seize and hold their \n     position. And that's what he did. And that's what his platoon \n     did.\n       Along the way, they came under heavy fire and engaged in \n     fierce hand-to-hand combat. Despite severe wounds, Lieutenant \n     Holmberg refused to be evacuated, and continued to deliver \n     orders and direct the offensive until the mission was \n     accomplished.\n       And that's why he wears the Navy Cross. And today, his \n     deeds, and the deeds of other heros from that class, echo \n     down through the ages to you. You can't dictate the values \n     that make you a hero. You can't buy them, but you can foster \n     them.\n\n  I commend the President for his recognition of this very special \nAmerican. I have known Bill Holmberg ever since I came to Washington as \na freshman Congressman more than 20 years ago. I know Bill not as a war \nhero, but as an indefatigable champion of the environment and as a \nvisionary who understood the potential of renewable fuels for improving \nair quality and reducing our dependence on imported oil long before \nthey were accepted as a viable alternative to fossil fuels.\n  Bill is a true American hero who stands as a model for us all. His \nselfless commitment to making the world a better place to live has been \ndemonstrated not only on distant battlefields, but also by his daily \npursuit of a more secure, environmentally sustainable and just society.\n  I join with President Bush in saluting Lt. Colonel William C. \nHolmberg, a sustainable American hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6440-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6440-S6441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE EXECUTION OF JUAN RAUL GARZA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Federal \nGovernment's execution today of Juan Raul Garza.\n  This is a sad day for our Federal criminal justice system. The \nprinciple of equal justice under law was dealt a severe blow. The \nAmerican people's reason for confidence in our Federal criminal justice \nsystem was diminished. And the credibility and integrity of the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice was depreciated.\n  President Bush and Attorney General Ashcroft failed to heed the calls \nfor\n\n[[Page S6441]]\n\nfairness. Instead, the Government put Juan Garza to death.\n  Now, no one questions that Juan Garza is guilty of three drug-related \nmurders. And no one questions that the Government should have punished \nhim severely for those crimes.\n  But serious geographic and racial disparities exist in the Federal \nGovernment's system of deciding who lives and who dies. The government \nhas failed to address those disparities. And President Bush and \nAttorney General Ashcroft failed to recognize the fundamental \nunfairness of proceeding with executions when the Government has not \nyet answered those questions. No, the government put Juan Garza to \ndeath.\n  Today, most of those who wait on the Federal Government's death row \ncome from just three States: Texas, Missouri, and Virginia. And 89 \npercent of those who wait on the Federal Government's death row are \npeople of color. But President Bush and Attorney General Ashcroft \nfailed to recognize the fundamental unfairness of executing Juan Garza, \na Hispanic man from Texas, before the Government had answered why those \ndisparities exist.\n  On December 7, President Clinton stayed the execution of Juan Garza \n``to allow the Justice Department time to gather and properly analyze \nmore information about racial and geographic disparities in the federal \ndeath penalty system.'' That day, President Clinton said, ``I have . . \n. concluded that the examination of possible racial and regional bias \nshould be completed before the United States goes forward with an \nexecution in a case that may implicate the very questions raised by the \nJustice Department's continuing study. In this area there is no room \nfor error.''\n  But today, the thorough study that President Clinton and Attorney \nGeneral Reno ordered is nowhere near completion. Even so, the \nGovernment put Juan Garza to death.\n  It now appears that, until recently, this administration's Justice \nDepartment had no plans to proceed with this thorough study. We now see \nthat, on June 6, the Justice Department released a report that \ncontained no new analysis but nonetheless reached the conclusions that \nthey wanted to reach.\n  Yes, after I called for a hearing and demanded that the thorough \nstudy resume, the Justice Department did agree to renew its thorough \nexamination of racial and geographic disparities in the Federal death \npenalty system. But even so, the Government put Juan Garza to death.\n  Experts at that hearing of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the \nConstitution testified that the facts did not support the conclusions \nthat the Justice Department reached in its June 6 report. Experts \ntestified that more information is needed before the Justice Department \ncould credibly conclude that racial bias is absent from the Federal \ndeath penalty system. But even so, the Government put Juan Garza to \ndeath.\n  The Justice Department now acknowledges that it has not conducted a \ncomplete review and that more study is needed. Before the Department \ncompletes that thorough review, and before it finishes that study, the \nFederal Government should not execute one more person.\n  I once again call on the President to implement a moratorium on \nexecutions by the Federal Government. I call for it in the name of the \ncredibility and integrity of the Department. I call for it in the name \nof justice. And I call for it in the name of equal justice under law.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Federal \nexecution that was carried out earlier today.\n  I believe that the Justice Department did what was right today when \nit carried out the death penalty against drug kingpin and murderer Juan \nRaul Garza.\n  Steadfast death penalty opponents have tried to use Mr. Garza's case \nto justify a moratorium on the death penalty. It is puzzling why they \nwould because his case in no way supports their arguments about \ninnocence and racial disparity in the administration of the death \npenalty.\n  First, Mr. Garza was clearly guilty. He was convicted of murdering \nthree people, one of who he shot in the back of the head, and he was \ntied to five other killings. Even his lawyers are not claiming \ninnocence.\n  Second, there was no evidence that his race had anything to do with \nhim receiving the death penalty. The judge and the main prosecutor in \nhis case were Hispanic, as were all of his victims except one. The \nmajority of the jurors had hispanic surnames, and all the jurors \ncertified that race was not involved in their decision.\n  Moreover, there were six death-eligible cases in this district, the \nSouthern District of Texas, all involving Hispanic defendants. Yet, Mr. \nGarza's was the only case for which the local U.S. Attorney recommended \nthe death penalty, and the only one for which it was sought.\n  Mr. Garza was convicted under a law that Congress passed in 1988, \nwhich reinstated the death penalty and directed it at ruthless drug \nkingpins like Mr. Garza who commit murder as part of their drug \ntrafficking. By following through with the death penalty in appropriate \ncases such as this, the Attorney General is simply enforcing the laws \nhe has a duty to uphold.\n  Mr. Garza was treated fairly and had full access to the extensive \nprotections of the criminal justice system. This execution is not a \ncase study in injustice. It is a case study in how the system works \nproperly.\n  I agree that continued study of the death penalty is worthwhile, but \nstudies should not be used as an excuse to place a moratorium on the \ndeath penalty while opponents endlessly search for flaws in the system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6441-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6441-S6442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE TALIBAN IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the critical situation \nconcerning the Taliban in Afghanistan. The seriousness of the Taliban's \ngross injustices is alarming. This movement continues to make \noutrageous demands on religious minorities, women, and the relief \nworkers trying to alleviate the suffering of the Afghan people. With \nimpunity, the Taliban has largely ignored international condemnation, \nbecoming increasingly fanatical and strict.\n  I am cosponsoring a bill with Senators Brownback and Boxer which \ncondemns the Taliban for its harsh demands on Muslims, Hindus, women, \nand religious minorities. The legislation strongly urges the Taliban to \nreopen United Nations offices and hospitals so that the people of \nAfghanistan may receive necessary relief. I encourage my colleagues to \nconsider cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Hindus and all other religious minorities have been ordered to \ndistinguish themselves from Muslims by wearing yellow badges. This \ndecree is reminiscent of the Nazis forcing the Jews to wear the yellow \nstar of David. It is shocking that the Taliban would order this kind of \nreligious branding. Furthermore, Muslims and non-Muslims are prohibited \nfrom living together, and religious minorities are not permitted to \nconstruct new places of worship. The fanatic Taliban religious police \ninvoke terror on city streets, sometimes whipping those who are not \nattending mosques at designated times. This kind of religious \nintolerance is abominable and should not be allowed.\n  The Taliban's iron grip on Afghanistan not only affects religious \npractices, it is further devastating the suffering Afghan people by \nobstructing relief efforts by the United Nations and other humanitarian \norganizations. The United Nations World Food Program believes it may be \nforced to close around 130 bakeries in Afghanistan's capital city if \nthe Taliban will not allow women to help address the needs of the \nhungry. Without the aid of both men and women, program leaders cannot \nmaintain the bread distribution program. Also in the capital, a 40-bed \nsurgical hospital was forced to close its doors. Sixteen international \nstaff members escaped to Pakistan because there were genuine concerns \nabout their safety. This is not the first time foreign staff have had \nto flee. Several U.N. workers have even been arrested, a gross \nviolation of a previous agreement between the Taliban and the U.N. that \nrelief workers would be protected. The Taliban is compromising both the \nsafety of international relief workers and the well-being of the Afghan \npeople with their harsh and unreasonable policies.\n  The injustice meted out by the Taliban is sobering and demands \ncontinued attention. That is why I am cosponsoring S. Con. Res. 42 with \nSenators Brownback and Boxer, and it is\n\n[[Page S6442]]\n\nmy fervent wish that the suffering endured by all the Afghan people and \ninternational workers be quickly relieved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6442-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION OF VIEQUES BOMBING RUNS\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, last week, the administration made \nheadlines when it said it would stop the bombing in Vieques.\n  But is that really true? Let's look at the fine print.\n  First, the administration did not commit to stopping the bombing \nimmediately and permanently, as so many of us have called for. In fact, \nthe bombing runs continue this week.\n  Second, the administration said it would stop the bombing by May 1, \n2003. But is that really something new? Let's look at the date by which \nthe bombing would stop under the current agreement and existing law, \nwhich provides for an end to the bombing if the people vote for it. The \ncurrent agreement and existing law call for an end to the bombing by \nMay 1, 2003--the very same date.\n  In other words, the administration is saying nothing more than what \ncurrent law mandates if the people of Vieques vote to stop the bombing.\n  If that is all the administration announced--that the bombing would \nstop by the same date provided for under current law--then this flurry \nof attention would be little more than an overblown story about this \nPresident's desire to abide by the letter and spirit of the agreement \nentered into between the Federal Government and the representatives of \nthe people of Vieques and Puerto Rico.\n  But that is not all the administration announced. It also announced \nthat it wanted to stop the November referendum. The devil is in the \ndetails, they say. Well, this is one powerful devil of an idea that has \nnot received the scrutiny it deserves.\n  For what the administration is really attempting to do is to \nundermine the intent of the law and subvert the will of the people of \nVieques.\n  The administration says that a referendum is unnecessary, because it \nalready plans to end the bombing by 2003. I say a referendum is more \nimportant than ever, because without an electoral mandate to require an \nend to the bombing, any administration expression of intent is nothing \nmore than that: an expression of intent. Not a legal requirement. And \n``intentions'' can change at a moment's notice.\n  I wholeheartedly support all efforts to find a viable alternative \nsite to train our naval forces. We need such training, to protect our \nnational interest and to protect our troops. And we must work hard to \nfind places and ways to provide such a vital element of our defense.\n  As I have said before, the people of Puerto Rico are great patriots; \nits sons and daughters volunteer for our Nation's armed forces at one \nof the highest rates in our country.\n  Thousands of Puerto Ricans have lost their lives in service of their \ncountry during all the wars of the 20th century. We need the good \ntraining to protect all our troops, many of whom are Puerto Rican.\n  So this is not a matter in which the people of Vieques or Puerto Rico \nshould be pitted against the interests of national security. We are all \nAmericans. We are all on the same team and we want the same thing: the \nbest trained armed forces in the world.\n  And so, I agree with President Bush when he says the ``Navy will find \nanother place to practice.'' I agree with Secretary Powell when he \nsays, ``Let's find alternative ways of making sure that our troops are \nready . . . using technology, using simulators and also finding a place \nto conduct live fire.''\n  But here's the bottom line: Under current law, if the people of \nVieques vote in November to end the bombing by May 1, 2003, the bombing \nmust end by that date. Pure and simple. However, under the \nadministration's plan, there will be no referendum. And therefore, \nthere will be no mandate and no requirement to end the bombing by 2003. \nOnly a policy to do so. And that policy could be altered by the \nPresident anytime between now and 2003.\n  In fact, Secretary Rumsfeld has already said that the Navy might stay \non Vieques for another, and I quote, ``two, three, four years'' until \nit can arrange ``the training that's needed in other ways.'' Defense \nDepartment officials were also quick to point out that while the \nPresident said that the Navy would find another place to practice \nwithin ``a reasonable period of time'' he never defined ``reasonable.''\n  Secretary England said he wanted to ``have us control our destiny,'' \nmeaning the Navy, as opposed to allowing what he called ``this level of \nemotion'' distract ``our attention from the real issue.''\n  In other words, the will of the people of Vieques is an ``emotion'' \nthat must be put aside, and the people of Vieques should not control \ntheir destiny--the Navy should.\n  I believe that is the wrong way to deal with this very important \nissue. I believe we should work toward a solution to this problem \nwithout circumventing the law of the land, without abrogating an \nagreement, without obviating the will of the American citizens of \nVieques.\n  I will stand up against any effort to shut down the referendum in \nVieques. Let the votes be cast. Let them be counted. And let the voice \nof the people be heard and respected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6442-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 355, a bill \nrequiring the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration \nof the contributions to our nation of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Commemorative Coin Act of 2001, S. \n355, was introduced by Senator Mary Landrieu on February 15.\n  As we approach the 40th anniversary of Dr. king's ``I have a dream'' \nspeech, we remember that Dr. King was a man larger than life who had an \nextraordinary impact not only on the civil rights movement, but also on \nthe history of America. He was living proof that non-violence can \nchange the world.\n  In the last session of Congress, this measure was introduced in both \nthe House and Senate, but no action was taken on the floor. My \nconstituents, however, concerned themselves with the issues and the \nBorough Council of Fair Lawn, NJ, passed Resolution 315-2000 urging \nthat the measure be adopted and the commemorative coins be authorized \nfor the year 2003.\n  David L.

In an article appearing in COINage magazine, a monthly trade \npublication, in the July 2001 issue, Mr. Ganz argues that ``the \naccomplishments of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. transcend the work of \npresidents and academicians and cut across cultural lines.

Mr. President, if there is one thing that the Senate \ncan agree on wholeheartedly, it is that we, as a Nation, need to invest \nin our children's educational future. There is no other issue that hits \ncloser to home for America's families.\n  But, even as we recognize the importance of education, we must \nrealize that close to home is where education works best in America, \nand simply spending more and more Federal dollars on more and more \nFederal ``one size fits all'' education directives will not, by itself, \nmake our education system perform better.\n  S. 1, the Better Education for Students and Teachers Act, that the \nSenate passed last Thursday contains several provisions that I favor.\n  The bill contains a modest pilot ``Straight A's'' provision that will \nhelp us build on the Education Flexibility Partnership Act that I \nworked to help pass in the 106th Congress to allow States to \nconsolidate Federal education programs to meet State and local needs.\n  It also contains an amendment that I sponsored, that will provide \nloan forgiveness to Head Start teachers in effort to encourage teachers \nto go into early childhood education.\n  Further, S. 1 expands local flexibility and control by block-granting \nfunds, consolidating some programs, and includes another amendment that \nI sponsored to allow local districts to spend Title II funds, if they \ndesire, on pupil services personnel.\n  However, taken as a whole, S. 1 is fiscally irresponsible and \nviolates my deeply held principles of federalism.\n  Over the course of my 35 years of public service to the people of \nOhio, I have developed a passion for the issue of federalism--that is, \nassigning the appropriate role of the Federal Government in relation to \nState and local government.\n  Our forefathers outlined this relationship in the 10th Amendment:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are \n     reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\n\n  Education is one such responsibility, and it has only been in the \nlast 35 years that the Federal government has had much of a role to \nplay in education policy, albeit a small one.\n  As my colleagues know, the Federal Government currently provides \napproximately 7 percent of all money spent on education in America, \nwhile 93 percent of the money is provided at the state and local level.\n  In my view, S. 1 not only violates that principle of federalism and \nthe proper role of the Federal Government in education, it violates a \nprinciple long-held in this country; and that is, local control of our \nschools. I am concerned that this bill will put us on a fast-track \ntowards thoroughly federalizing education.\n  As it has been said before on the floor of the Senate, one size does \nnot fit all when it comes to education. Different districts have \ndifferent requirements, with the needs of rural areas differing from \nthe needs of our cities. And that has been the guiding force in \nAmerican education for over 200 years.\n  But some of my colleagues think the Congress is the national school \nboard. Well, we are not the national school board here in this \nCongress!\n  With the expansion of education programs that the Federal Government \nwould undertake in this bill, I have a genuine concern that in ten or \nfifteen years, Washington will be dictating what is happening in every \nschoolhouse across the nation.\n  Indeed, in spite of the limited expenditure of Federal funds for \neducation, this bill stipulates that every school district in America \nwill test their students from grades 3 through 8.\n  This testing will occur regardless of how well students are \nperforming in their particular school districts, and despite the fact \nthat most of our states have mechanisms already in place that test \nstudents' educational performances.\n  For instance, just last week in my state of Ohio, Governor Taft \nsigned into law a bill to revamp the State's testing program.\n  Governors, legislators, school boards, parents and most of all, \nteachers, all understand how onerous additional federally mandated \ntesting provisions truly are.\n  I can assure you that there are many teachers in Ohio who are going \nto be saying, ``here we go again.''\n  In addition, there are other provisions in this legislation that \nusurp the authority of states and local school districts in their \nability to make decisions that will affect their students.\n  For example, S. 1 lays out specific steps that states and school \ndistricts must take to address failing schools.\n  Also under S. 1, the Federal Government would be able to tell States \nthat its teachers in low-income schools must meet certain Federal \nqualification and certification requirements.\n  Further, the Federal Government would be able to continue to tell \nschool districts how to spend funds in a number of areas including: \nreading; teacher development; technology; and programs for students \nwith limited English language skills, instead of providing States and \nlocal school districts with full flexibility to spend funds on their \nown identified priorities.\n  Besides violating a long-held principle regarding State and local \ncontrol over schools, the bill's fatal flaw is that it increases \nauthorized and appropriated spending for education by more than 62 \npercent over last year's budget, and it demolishes the budget \nresolution that Congress recently passed.\n  According to the Senate Budget Committee, ESEA spending totaled $17.6 \nbillion in fiscal year 2001. That same year, we spent over $6.3 billion \non special education. That's a total of $23.9 billion of Federal funds \nfor kindergarten through grade 12. It also represents a 21 percent \nincrease over fiscal year 2000.\n  S. 1 as reported authorized $27.7 billion for ESEA alone for fiscal \nyear 2002. Since the beginning of the debate on the floor of the Senate \nuntil its passage on June 14th, a period of some 7 weeks, the Senate \nadded an additional $11.1 billion in education spending for fiscal year \n2002.\n  That's a total of $38.8 billion and, as I said earlier, a 62 percent \nincrease in just one year!\n  Over the life of the bill, these amendments add $211 billion to ESEA \nfor a total of $416 billion. That is an increase of 101 percent over \nseven years.\n  When you consider that the House and Senate agreed to a budget \nresolution that included a modest increase in Federal spending over \nlast year's budget of approximately 5 percent, it's obvious that if we \nare to fund ESEA with a 62 percent increase, many legitimate functions \nthat are the true responsibility of the federal government will not be \nmet. Otherwise, we will not be able to live within the parameters of \nthe FY 2002 budget resolution.\n  I am concerned that a number of my colleagues may have voted for many \nof the amendments to S. 1, as well as the final version of the bill--\neven with its expensive price tag--believing that the Appropriations \nCommittee will not fully-fund each and every authorized program.\n  In my view, we should only vote to authorize what we are actually \nwilling to appropriate.\n  That's because, I am very sure that there will be tremendous pressure \non the appropriators to fully-fund the programs included in this bill. \nAnd, at 62 percent over last year's level, the programs in S. 1 just \ncost too much money for this Congress to spend.\n  In fact, I am concerned that the level of spending in this bill will \nput us back on the path towards a repeat of last year's ``budget \nbusting'' appropriations cycle; a cycle that saw the Congress spend \n14.3 percent more in non-defense discretionary spending than the year \nbefore.\n  That is why over the last few weeks, I have been working with my \nfriend from Kentucky, Senator Bunning, to get the signatures of our \nSenate colleagues on a letter to President Bush to show him that we are \nwilling to support him in his efforts to instill fiscal discipline in \nthe appropriations process.\n  In addition, our letter is meant to put Congress on notice that \nexcessive spending will not be tolerated.\n  Although President Bush has indicated that he will not hesitate to \nuse his veto pen on spending bills, Senator Bunning and I felt he \nneeded a ``Backbone 34''--a contingent of at least 34\n\n[[Page S6444]]\n\nSenators who would agree to uphold the President's veto on bloated \nspending bills, should it be necessary.\n  I am pleased to say that Senator Bunning and I collected the \nsignatures of 35 Senators who have agreed to ``vote against any \ncongressional effort to override [vetoes] to enforce fiscal \ndiscipline.''\n  What these 35 signatures do is send an important message to all of \nour colleagues regarding the need for the Senate to stay within the \nbudget resolution guidelines.\n  Simply put, the President will have the support he needs in Congress \nto sustain his veto of spending bills that are not fiscally \nresponsible.\n  As far as I am concerned, the ``easy'' vote would have been to vote \nin favor of S. 1. However, I was not elected to the Senate to take the \neasy votes and hide from my responsibilities to the taxpayers of Ohio \nand this nation.\n  It is high-time for us to stand-up and show that we have the courage \nto be fiscally responsible, to prioritize our spending on the basis of \nthose responsibilities that are truly Federal in nature, and to make \nthe tough choices.\n  If Congress won't do it, I hope the President will, because the \nAmerican people deserve to know that their government is serving in \ntheir best interest.\n  In my view, the funding expectations that are established in S. 1 are \njust too unrealistic, and if the President does not insist on a final \nbill that is more fiscally responsible, I do not doubt that my friends \nacross the aisle will demand that he fund ESEA to the fully authorized \nlevel in his next budget.\n  That's why I urge President Bush to insist that the Members of the \nconference committee to S. 1 eliminate the enormous excess in spending \nthat this bill contains before it is sent back to each of the \nrespective Houses of Congress for a final vote.\n  By so doing, it will show the citizens of this nation that their \nPresident truly is not only the Education President, but that he cares \nabout putting an end to Congress' spendthrift ways as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6444-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I am enormously proud to \nreflect upon West Virginia's years of accomplishment and good works on \nthis, its 138th anniversary as a State. Among West Virginia's greatest \nachievements are its outstanding citizens who have had an influence, \nnot only on their home State, but also on the Nation as a whole. West \nVirginia is home of some of the country's greatest educators, authors, \nand scientists. Like all great Americans, these luminaries worked for \nthe advancement of others. Like all great West Virginians, they pursued \ntheir goals while remembering their roots.\n  I am reminded of Anna Jarvis, a teacher who longed to heal the rift \nbetween brothers during the Civil War. Miss Jarvis strove to provide a \ncommon bond between all Americans, northern and southern, that could \nserve as a stepping-stone toward a more lasting peace. To this end, she \nfounded ``Mother's Friendship Day,'' now known as Mother's Day, which \nhonors the sacrifices of all mothers. Indeed, Anna achieved her goal; \nand, she created a tradition that endures today.\n  Another West Virginian, author Pearl S. Buck, sought much the same \ngoal. Ms. Buck's revolutionary novel, ``The Good Earth'', highlighted \nthe plight of poor women and children in early-20 century China. In \naddition, Pearl worked tirelessly to advance the civil rights movement, \nas well as the women's rights movement. Her efforts brought increased \nunderstanding and tolerance for the underprivileged. Pearl S. Buck was \ninspired by the tolerance and charity of her fellow West Virginians and \ninstilled these ideals in a new generation of Americans.\n  Like Anna and Pearl, Reverend Leon Sullivan recognized his ability to \nchange the lives of others through example. A Baptist minister, \neducator, and civil rights activist, Leon also served on the board of \ndirectors of the General Motors Corporation. There, he promoted the \nidea of corporate responsibility abroad. His desire for racial \negalitarianism worldwide forged the path for the Sullivan principles; \nthese beliefs were instrumental in the abolition of apartheid in South \nAfrica. Though he recently passed away, Reverend Sullivan leaves a \nlasting legacy of fairness and equality both at home and abroad.\n  Finally, I think of Homer Hickam, an aerospace engineer who, in spite \nof his humble background, attended college and achieved great \nprofessional success. Today, Homer attributes his accomplishments to \nthe early influence of an outstanding teacher. His story demonstrates \nthat educators inspire students and open doors. Most importantly, it \nreminds us of why we should collectively invest in education.\n  Today, I commend all of West Virginia's heroes, those that are well \nknown and those who remain anonymous. I hope all Americans are inspired \nby the generosity, integrity, and devotion displayed by the people of \nthis great State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6444-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TIM BEAULAC\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Tim Beaulac of Gorham, NH, for being named as the Pharmacist \nof the Year for the Northeast Region, which includes Maine, New \nHampshire and a portion of Vermont.\n  He achieved the award with the assistance of other members of the \npharmacy staff at the Gorham WalMart Store including: assistant \npharmacist, Kellie Lapointe, department manager, Sandy Trottier, and \npharmacy technicians Mona Garneau and Karen Taylor.\n  Tim is a graduate of the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and began \nhis career at Berlin City Drug as a pharmacist for ten years. He also \nwas employed at the former City Drugs in Gorham for several years.\n  Tim and his wife, Marylou, have one daughter, Holly, who is a sixth \ngrader at Gorham Middle School.\n  I commend Tim on this exemplary achievement and recognition in the \npharmaceutical industry. He has served the citizens of Gorham with \ndedication and care for many years. The people of Gorham and our entire \nstate have benefitted from his contributions. It is truly an honor and \na privilege to represent him in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6444-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6444-S6445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL WILLIAM J. GRAHAM\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to pay special tribute to an outstanding soldier who has \ndedicated his life to the service of our Nation. Colonel William J. \nGraham will take off his uniform for the last time this month as he \nretires from the U.S. Army following 21 years of active duty \ncommissioned service.\n  Colonel Graham began his military career with an appointment to the \nU.S. Military Academy at West Point. He completed the rigorous course \nof study at the academy and graduated with a Bachelor of Science \ndegree, having focused his studies in the areas of general engineering \nand national security. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1980.\n  During Colonel Graham's career as an Army aviator, he was selected to\n\n[[Page S6445]]\n\ncommand at every level from platoon through brigade. He reorganized, \nbuilt, and fine-tuned several record-setting organizations, and enjoyed \nmaking things happen. His leadership, management, problem-solving and \nteam-building skills have been proven during combat, peacekeeping \noperations, and peacetime, and he is a proven expert in crisis \nmanagement, organizational planning, and training.\n  Colonel Graham's aviation units were among the most frequently \ndeployed to challenging international security environments. During his \ncareer he served in and deployed to many of the world's ``hotspots,'' \nincluding Korea, Germany, Bosnia, Macedonia, Hungary, Croatia, Panama, \nHonduras, and Grenada. Colonel's Graham's career culminated with duty \nas the Deputy Legislative Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff where he served as liaison between the Nation's most senior \nmilitary officer and the U.S. Senate.\n  Colonel Graham's retirement represents a loss to both the Joint \nForces and the U.S. Army. Throughout a career of distinguished service, \nhe has made innumerable long-term and positive contributions to both \nthe military and our Nation. As Colonel Graham transitions to tackle \nnew challenges in the business community, we will certainly miss him \nand wish continued success for both him and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6445-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE GROWING ALLIANCE BETWEEN RUSSIA AND CHINA\n\n Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Dr. Constantine Menges has a \ndistinguished career in the field of national security. He has written \na timely piece on the growing alliance between Russia and China. I hope \nmy colleagues will read this article and heed his expert advice. I ask \nthat the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 14, 2001]\n\n              China-Russia: Preventing a Military Alliance\n\n                        (By Constantine Menges)\n\n       An important item on the agenda of President Bush as he \n     meets President Putin of Russia should be the new 30-year \n     treaty of cooperation which the leaders of Russia and China \n     are scheduled to sign in July 2001.\n       This treaty will formalize the ever-increasing Chinese-\n     Russian strategic coordination of recent years, which is \n     intended to counter the United States around the globe.\n       Why would the leadership of China and Russia believe they \n     need to join for this purpose? At their summit meeting in \n     July 2000, Mr. Putin endorsed China's view as expressed in \n     their joint statement that the U.S. ``is seeking unilateral \n     military and security advantages'' in the world. Mr. Putin \n     also criticized the ``economic and power domination of the \n     United States'' and agreed with China on the need to \n     establish a still undefined ``new political and economic \n     order.''\n       The new China-Russia treaty will not only mean a \n     significantly increased political-strategic challenge to the \n     U.S., it will also pose additional military risks. These are \n     illustrated by Russia's sale of advanced weapons systems to \n     China which it is aiming at U.S. forces and by the February \n     2001 Russian military exercises that included mock nuclear \n     attacks against U.S. military units viewed as opposing a \n     Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\n       The relationship between Russia and China went from \n     alliance in the 1950s to deep hostility from 1960 to 1985 \n     followed by gradual normalization during the Gorbachev years. \n     After 1991, Boris Yeltsin continued negotiations to demarcate \n     the disputed border but kept a political distance because \n     China remained communist and had publicly welcomed the 1991 \n     coup attempt by Soviet communist hard-liners and also opposed \n     Mr. Yeltsin's democratic aspirations.\n       Mr. Yeltsin and the first President Bush had three summit \n     meetings in 1992 and 1993, and Russia declared its intention \n     to move toward a ``strategic partnership and in the future, \n     toward alliance'' with the U.S. The mutually positive and \n     hopeful initial relationship with the new, post-Soviet \n     Russia, also included a signed agreement on reductions in \n     offensive nuclear weapons and a joint decision on modifying \n     ``existing agreements'' (including the ABM treaty) to permit \n     global missile defense which both Presidents Yeltsin and Bush \n     acknowledged were needed. Unfortunately the Clinton \n     administration did not pursue the opportunity for Russian-\n     U.S. agreement on missile defense.\n       In April 1996, Mr. Yeltsin decided to agree with China on a \n     ``strategic partnership'' and increased Russian weapons \n     sales. Through a series of regular summit meetings, China \n     moved the ``partnership'' with Russia toward strategic \n     alignment marked by an ever-larger component of shared anti-\n     U.S. political objectives (e.g. support for Iraq, opposition \n     to missile defense) along with increased Russian military \n     sales and military cooperation. This was ignored by the \n     previous administration.\n       As a result, for the first time in 40 years the U.S. faces \n     coordinated international actions by China and Russia. This \n     could have six principal negative implications starting, \n     first, with the fact that Russia has accepted and repeats \n     most of communist China's views about the U.S., for example \n     that the U.S. seeks to dominate the world.\n       Second, the Chinese view of the coming July 2001 treaty \n     emphasizes that, when one of the parties to the treaty \n     ``experiences military aggression,'' the other signatory \n     state should when requested ``provide political, economic, \n     and military support and launch joint attacks against the \n     invading forces.''\n       As the American public has learned from the April 2001 \n     reconnaissance aircraft event, China defines not only Taiwan \n     but also most of the international South China Sea and all \n     its islands as its sovereign territory. If the United States \n     should threaten or take any type of counteraction (political, \n     economic or military) against China to uphold the rights of \n     US aircraft or ships in that international air and sea space \n     or to help allies or other countries defend themselves \n     against coercion by China, which has territorial disputes \n     with 11 neighboring countries including Japan and India, \n     China could define this as ``blackmail'' and a violation of \n     its ``sovereignty''. It would then hope to draw Russia in \n     militarily, if only as a potential counter-threat as \n     suggested by the February 2001 Russian military exercise.\n       A third negative consequence is ever-increasing Russian \n     military sales and other support for the buildup of Chinese \n     advanced weapons systems specifically targeted at U.S. air, \n     sea and electronic military capabilities and vulnerabilities \n     in the Pacific. For example the Russian anti-ship missiles \n     that accompany the two Russian destroyers already delivered \n     (and the four more to come) skim the ocean at twice the speed \n     of sound, can carry nuclear warheads and were designed to \n     sink U.S. aircraft carriers. In the 1990s, Russia sold China \n     about $9 billion to $20 billion in advanced weapons systems \n     aimed at U.S. forces (jet fighters, submarines, destroyers, \n     anti-air/missile systems) with another $20 billion to $40 \n     billion in weapons and high-technology sales planned through \n     2004. The income from these sales also helps Russia further \n     modernize its strategic nuclear forces that currently have \n     4,000 warheads on about 1,000 ICBMs.\n       A fourth negative result is that Russia and China are \n     working together and in parallel to oppose any U.S. decision \n     to deploy national or Asian regional missile defenses; they \n     are seeking to persuade U.S. allies to oppose this and refuse \n     cooperation. At the same time Russia has sold China one of \n     its most advanced weapons (S-300), originally designed to \n     shoot down the Pershing medium range missile as well as \n     aircraft and cruise missiles, along with a similar medium-\n     range system (Tor-M1) in such quantity that China is now in \n     effect already deploying its own missile/air defense system \n     on the coast.\n       Fifth, Russia and China have been providing weapons of mass \n     destruction components, technology and expertise to a number \n     of dictatorships such as North Korea, Iraq, Iran and Libya \n     which are hostile to the United States and its allies. Russia \n     and China have also established military supply links with \n     Cuba and the pro-Castro Chavez regime in Venezuela. The risk \n     of conflict increases as all these dangerous regimes become \n     militarily stronger and also believe they are backed by both \n     China and Russia.\n       The sixth negative result is that the ever-closer \n     relationship with China strengthens the authoritarian \n     tendencies with Russia, thereby increasing the risk it will \n     become more aggressive internationally. While the Chinese \n     government develops relations with the Putin government and \n     military, the Chinese Communist Party has revived direct \n     relations with the Communist Party in Russia.\n       At their June 16, 2001, meeting in Slovenia, it is urgent \n     that President Bush seek to persuade President Putin that \n     Russia should assure the U.S. and the world that there is no \n     open or secret military component to the July 2001 China-\n     Russia treaty. Mr. Bush should remind Mr. Putin that the U.S. \n     has no territorial or other claims of any kind on Russia. In \n     contrast, communist China has on numerous occasions during \n     the 1950s and through 1992 formally demanded that Russia \n     ``return'' virtually all of the Russian Far East that China \n     alleges was stolen by an ``illegal'' 1860 treaty. Russia is \n     arming a potentially very dangerous country, perhaps making \n     the same mistake Josef Stalin did in selling weapons to arm \n     Germany which then attacked the Soviet Union in 1941.\n       Unless Russia excludes such a military component in the new \n     treaty, Mr. Bush should indicate that the U.S. will view this \n     as a China-Russia military alliance and a potentially grave \n     threat to be met by the significant reductions in U.S. \n     economic support for Russia directly, through debt \n     restructuring, international institutions and trade access. \n     Further the U.S. would see the need to immediately accelerate \n     movement toward missile defense.\n       The U.S. and its allies need to give the China-Russia \n     strategic alignment effective attention. With skill and \n     foresight it is still possible to turn back the momentum by \n     hard-liners in both Russia and China toward more \n     confrontation while adopting realistic U.S. policies that \n     maintain deterrence and peaceful relations.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6446-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6446]]\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6446-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6446-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6446-S6447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-2478.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Colorado relative to federal \n     regulation governing mining on public lands; to the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution 01-1015\n\n       Whereas, The regulations at 43 C.F.R. Part 3809 (3809 \n     regulations) governing the management of mining operations \n     for hardrock minerals on federal lands that were published by \n     the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) on November 21, 2000, 65 \n     Federal Register 69998, and which became effective January \n     20, 2001, will have substantial adverse impacts on the mining \n     industry in Colorado and throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas, The BLM has forecast that the implementation of \n     the regulations will result in the loss of up to 6,000 jobs, \n     costing American workers almost $400 million in personal \n     income, and the agency also projects that mine production \n     from public lands under the regulations could also decline by \n     as much as 30% or $484 million; and\n       Whereas, The regulations would also impose massive \n     additional obligations on state regulators charged with the \n     responsibility of regulating mining on public lands through \n     cooperative agreements with the BLM; and\n       Whereas, Congress commissioned the National Research \n     Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct \n     a comprehensive analysis of mining regulations; and\n       Whereas, Congress prohibited the BLM from promulgating \n     final 3809 regulations, except for revisions that are ``not \n     inconsistent with'' the recommendations contained within the \n     NRC report, Hardrock Mining on Federal Lands, published in \n     1999; and\n       Whereas, The NRC report concluded that the existing array \n     of federal and state laws regulating mining is ``generally \n     effective'' in protecting the environment, and that \n     ``improvements in the implementation of existing regulations \n     present the greatest opportunity for improving environmental \n     protections''; and\n       Whereas, Notwithstanding the unequivocal findings of the \n     NRC report, the BLM published amendments to the 3809 \n     regulations that go far beyond the seven ``regulatory gaps'' \n     identified in the report; and\n       Whereas, The BLM inserted several additional provisions \n     that ignored the findings of the NRC report, including a \n     ``mine veto'' provision that was never subject to public \n     review and comment, as required by the federal'' \n     Administrative Procedures Act'' and the United States \n     Constitution; and\n       Whereas, The BLM further ignored the advice and \n     recommendations of the Western Governors Association, which \n     specifically advised the BLM to adhere to the findings of the \n     NRC report; and\n       Whereas, The State of Nevada and two industry organizations \n     have filed suit asking that the regulations which became \n     effective on the last day of the former presidential \n     administration be set aside; and\n       Whereas, The litigation calls into substantial question the \n     validity of the 3809 regulations; and\n       Whereas, The BLM has conducted a preliminary review of the \n     regulations, has concerns about ``substantial policy and \n     legal issues'' raised in these lawsuits, and wants to resolve \n     such concerns before implementing a new regulatory program; \n     and\n       Whereas, The BLM published a proposal on March 23, 2001, 66 \n     Federal Register 16162, to suspend all or some parts of the \n     regulations that took effect on January 20, 2001, pending a \n     complete review of the issues; and\n       Whereas, If such regulations were suspended, mining \n     activities would be subject to the state and federal laws and \n     regulations that the NRC found to be effective in protecting \n     the environment and that were in place prior to the adoption \n     of the current scheme; and\n       Whereas, The BLM's and the new presidential \n     administration's actions once again demonstrate the \n     willingness to provide a balance between important goals of \n     environmental protection and responsible development of our \n     nation's mineral resources; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-third \n     General Assembly of the State of Colorado;\n       That the Colorado House of Representatives hereby expresses \n     its support for the action of the Department of the Interior \n     and the Bureau of Land Management in reviewing and proposing \n     to suspend the 3809 regulations that took effect on January \n     20, 2001.\n       That the Colorado House of Representatives urges the Bureau \n     of Land Management to promulgate new 3809 regulations that \n     adhere to the specific recommendations of the report of the \n     National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences \n     entitled Hardrock Mining on Federal Lands, as the United \n     States Congress has mandated.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to increasing funding for \n     agricultural conservation programs; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 134\n\n       Whereas, since the adoption of the 1985 Farm Bill and \n     subsequent iterations of federal farm legislation in 1990 and \n     1996, U.S. agriculture policy has included major voluntary \n     conservation incentive programs such as the Conservation \n     Reserve Program (CRP) and Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP); and\n       Whereas, the most popular of the federal agricultural \n     conservation programs in Louisiana have been the WRP with 368 \n     approved easements on 137,632 acres, the Environmental \n     Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) with 4,803 approved \n     contracts on 494,006 acres, the Wildlife Habitat Incentives \n     Program (WHIP) with 168 contracts on 12,900 acres, and the \n     Forestry Incentives Program (FIP) with all available funds \n     having been allocated; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana has the most easement acres enrolled in \n     the WRP of all participating states, 407 pending applications \n     on over 102,000 acres, and a potential WRP enrollment demand \n     of up to 474,000 acres; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is second only to Texas in the number of \n     EQIP contracts with an estimated potential demand of three to \n     four times the allocation currently available and only one \n     out of every four applications for assistance able to be \n     funded; and\n       Whereas, the demand for participation in WHIP and FIP also \n     exceeds available funds; and\n       Whereas, CRP, which benefits Louisiana primarily through \n     improving upstream water quality and providing nesting \n     habitats for waterfowl and other migratory birds, and these \n     other agricultural programs have profound beneficial impacts \n     on wildlife habitat and water quality in our state, including \n     ameliorating the nutrient loading of rivers and streams that \n     contribute to the annual occurrence of hypoxia in the Gulf of \n     Mexico, while aiding rural communities and benefitting \n     farmers; and\n       Whereas, agricultural conservation incentive programs are \n     an efficient and effective use of tax dollars to restore \n     habitats and prevent the degradation of soil, water, and \n     habitat over a long term and, with WRP and CRP, \n     overproduction of crops and direct subsidy payments are \n     reduced; and\n       Whereas, the Lower Mississippi Valley Initiative (LMVI), a \n     multi-state partnership to address agriculturally based \n     environment stewardship consisting of producers, \n     universities, natural resource agencies, and conservation \n     organizations in Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, \n     Kentucky, and Tennessee formed to inform the process of \n     developing the conservation provisions of the next farm bill, \n     has recognized the importance to the environment, the farming \n     community, and the future of agriculture of strategically \n     enlarging and enhancing farm bill conservation programs; and\n       Whereas, although agricultural conservation programs \n     authorized by the 1996 farm bill have reached their acreage \n     and funding caps, additional funding has not been included in \n     the proposed FY 2002 budget; and\n       Whereas, legislation has been introduced in Congress to \n     expand agricultural conservation programs to meet the needs \n     of farmers and the environment until the next farm bill is \n     enacted. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     urge and request the president of the United States and \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to expand and \n     fund federal agricultural conservation programs, including \n     the Conservation Reserve, Wetlands Reserve, Environmental \n     Quality Incentives, Wildlife Habitat Improvement, and \n     Forestry Incentives Programs. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     Secretary of the United States Senate, the clerk of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and to each member of \n     the Louisiana delegation to the Congress of the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6448-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself and Mr. Dayton):\n       S. 1058.

Mr. President, the debate over energy use in America \nhas gripped our national attention for well over a year. A week doesn't \ngo by that you don't pick up a newspaper or magazine and read at least \none story about our Nation's domestic or foreign energy crisis. One \nissue in the energy debate that has caught my attention and that of \nfarmers in my State is renewable fuels.\n  The technology to convert agricultural crops into combustible fuel, \nsuitable for use in modern diesel and gasoline engines, has existed for \nmore than 100 years. I believe this process continues to hold great \npotential for America. The production and use of biofuels offers our \nNation a safe, renewable source of energy for travel and transport, not \nto mention the long-term economic benefits for farmers and consumers.\n  That is why I rise today to introduce the Biodiesel Renewable Fuels \nAct. I am pleased that Senator Dayton has joined with me as my lead \ncosponsor. This bill encourages the use of biodiesel by establishing a \ntax credit for manufacturers who produce a blend of conventional diesel \nand soybean or oilseed additives. By reducing the diesel fuel excise \ntax, suppliers will receive a 3-cent-per-gallon credit for using a \ndiesel blend that contains at least 2 percent biodiesel. This tax \ncredit is very similar to the existing tax incentive for ethanol, a \nbiofuel made from corn-based products. I believe a tax incentive for \nsoy-based biodiesel will increase domestic production and capture the \nagricultural, environmental and economical benefits associated with \nusing this renewable source of energy.\n  Most Americans don't realize that farm communities sit atop a vast \nand virtually untapped source of renewable fuels in the form of \nagriculture crops. Farmers in Arkansas are interested in developing new \nmarkets for soybean and oilseed products. In Arkansas for example, \nfarmers grew 94 million bushels, or 2.5 million metric tons, of \nsoybeans last year. Nationally, farmers produced 2.6 billion bushels of \nsoybeans in 1999-2000, equal to 72 million metric tons. The oil derived \nfrom soybeans and other oilseed crops can be refined into a diesel \nadditive or diesel alternative. According to a USDA study released in \n1996, an annual market for biodiesel of 100 million gallons in the \nUnited States would raise the price of soybeans by up to seven cents \nper bushel. Given the recent U.S. soybean crop, that kind of annual \nmarket would result in more than $168 million directly related to the \nuse of soy-based biodiesel.\n  Producing biodiesel domestically also means that more money stays in \nthe U.S. Instead of purchasing more foreign petroleum, manufacturers \ncan reduce their dependence on overseas oil by adding biodiesel blends \nfor use in existing diesel engines. If domestic companies are \nencouraged to develop the infrastructure necessary to produce more \nbiodiesel, the economic effect will be more U.S. jobs, lower prices for \nthe consumer and larger markets for farmers.\n  Developing markets for agricultural commodities and reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil is good, but there are environmental benefits \nas well. It is well documented that the burning of biofuels in \ncombustion engines reduces the emissions of harmful greenhouse gases \nand particulate matter. In fact, biodiesel passes some of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's most stringent emissions and health \nstandards for fuel additives and fuel alternatives. This becomes \nimportant when you consider the EPA's recent announcement that \nCalifornia should continue to use ethanol as a fuel oxygenate to \nimprove air quality. As more cities and States are faced with having to \nimprove the quality of their air, I believe biofuels are a sensible \nalternative to existing oxygenates which are not as friendly to the \nenvironment or human health.\n  If using biodiesel improves air quality, reduces our dependence on \nforeign oil and provides a value-added market for soybean and oilseed \ncrops, then we should support legislation to further development of \nthis renewable source of fuel. My bill is good for farmers, it's good \nfor consumers and it's good for\n\n[[Page S6451]]\n\nthe environment. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Biodiesel \nRenewable Fuels Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1058\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Such transfers shall be made on \n     the basis of estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury \n     and adjustments shall be made to subsequent transfers to \n     reflect any errors in the estimates.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my \ndistinguished colleague Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas, legislation \nthat will increase the use of biodiesel fuel throughout our country.\n  Biodiesel is a natural additive to diesel fuel, much as ethanol is to \nregular gasoline. It is also a fuel in its own right. Biodiesel is made \nfrom soybeans and other vegetable oils. Its use as a 2-percent blend \nwith diesel fuel, and in some instances as high as a 20-percent blend, \nwill increase the demand for these commodities, boost their market \nprice, and reduce the toxic carbon emissions from trucks and other \nvehicles across this Nation, all at no additional cost to American \ntaxpayers.\n  Our legislation would provide a 3-cent-per-gallon credit to diesel \nfuel suppliers using 2-percent biodiesel and up to a 20-cent-per-gallon \ncredit for blends containing 20-percent biodiesel.\n  As soybean prices rise then due to the increased usage, Federal \nspending on the U.S. Department of Agriculture Marketing Assistance \nLoan Program will be reduced accordingly, resulting in substantial \nsavings for the American taxpayers.\n  A credit such as this would otherwise reduce the revenues that would \nbe going into the highway trust fund. Given the deterioration of many \nof our Nation's highways, that would be unwise. Thus, this legislation \nprovides for the Commodity Credit Corporation to reimburse the highway \ntrust fund for its forgone revenues.\n  Our current energy crisis is also an opportunity for our country. I \ncurrently have a van driving around the State of Minnesota that uses \n85-percent ethanol fuel with no difficulties whatsoever. These \nagricultural fuels are not just possible tomorrow, they are practical \ntoday. We just need to help them become financially competitive, until \nthese industries can reach the volume of production necessary to \ncompete with the giant oil industry.\n  In conclusion, this legislation is an important step in several right \ndirections--toward less foreign oil dependency, toward higher \nagricultural commodity prices for American farmers, toward lower \ntaxpayer costs for our struggling farm economy, and toward a cleaner \nair quality for us all. I respectfully urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH:\n  S. 1059. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat certain postsecondary educational benefits provided by an employer \nto children of employees shall be excludable from gross income as a \nscholarship; to the Committee on Finance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH:\n  S. 1060. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat certain postsecondary educational benefits provided by an employer \nto children of employees shall be excludable from gross income as part \nof an educational assistance program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation today \nthat will help thousands of American workers with the financial burden \nassociated with sending a daughter or son to college. In this climate \nof labor shortages, U.S. companies are looking for innovative ways to \nmaintain and attract a dedicated and qualified workforce. Some \ncompanies have creatively turned to providing college scholarships for \ntheir employees' children. My legislation would allow employees to \ndeduct these scholarships from their gross income. Under current law, \nan employee generally is not taxed on post-secondary education \nassistance provided by an employer for the benefit of the employee. My \nbill would extend this treatment to employer-provided education \nassistance for the employees' children, up to $2,000 per child.\n  As many of my colleagues know, employer-provided education assistance \nis considered an integral tool in keeping America's workforce well \ntrained and equipped to deal with the changing face of the New Economy. \nCurrent law not only allows companies to keep an up-to-date labor pool, \nbut also allows many workers to move from low-wage, entry level \npositions up the economic ladder of success. Extending tax-free \ntreatment to the children of employees not only will help working \nfamilies, but will contribute to our Nation's competitiveness in an \nincreasingly dynamic global economy.\n  My legislation is very simple. It allows employees whose companies \nprovide educational scholarships for employees' children to exclude up \nto $2000 from gross income per child. An employee may not exclude more \nthan $5,250 from gross income for employer education assistance. This \nis the limit established under Section 127(a)(2) of the Internal \nRevenue Code for employer education assistance. In essence, there would \nbe ``family cap.'' Workers could deduct a $2,000 scholarship for their \nchild and could also exclude up to $3,250 of educational benefits for \nthemselves, however, the combined amounts could not exceed $5,250.\n  In today's economy, American companies are no longer looking purely \nfor a high-school diploma, but require that their workers have some \nsort of post-secondary education or training. Many working families \nstruggle in providing this basic start which will help their children \nget well-paying jobs.\n  This piece of legislation is also a modest proposal. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has scored this provision at $231 million over 10 \nyears. I look forward to working to make sure that this provision is \nfully offset in a responsible manner. I hope my colleagues will join me \nto help ease the burden of American families with the soaring costs of \nhigher education.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1061. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire \nFern Lake and the surrounding watershed in the States of Kentucky and \nTennessee for addition to Cumberland Gap National Historic Park, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last month the Bush Administration \nunveiled a new national energy strategy that strikes an important \nbalance between the twin priorities of production and conservation. \nToday I am proud to introduce legislation with Congressman Hal Rogers \nthat takes a step toward fulfilling the conservation side of that \nenergy equation in my home state of Kentucky.\n  Our bill, the Fern Lake Conservation and Recreation Act of 2001, will \nauthorize the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park to purchase Fern \nLake, a natural landmark on the Kentucky-Tennessee border that has \nserved as the municipal water supply for Middlesboro, KY since the lake \nwas constructed in 1893. This bill will protect the lake as a clean and \nsafe source of rural water for Kentuckians, enhance the scenic and \nrecreational value of Cumberland Gap National Historical Park, and \nincrease tourism opportunities in the three states that border the \nPark--Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia.\n  For those who may be less familiar with this part of the country, \nFern Lake is a beautiful and pristine body of water set against the \nbackdrop of the Appalachian Mountains. The 150-acre lake presently sits \nadjacent to the Park and is part of the viewshed from Pinnacle \nOverlook, which is one of the Park's most popular attractions. It is \nsaid that the glassy surface of Fern Lake is so clear that you can see \nfish swimming 10 feet below the surface. Perhaps that is one of the \nreasons why Middlesboro Mayor Ben Hickman describes his town's water \nsupply as one of the best in the United States.\n  With a lake of such natural beauty and exceptional water quality, it \nis no wonder that the citizens and community leaders want to protect \nit. Although Fern Lake has been privately owned for most of its \nexistence, it has been for sale since July 2000, and there is concern \nin Middlesboro that a new owner may not share the same interests \nregarding the lake as those embraced by the community. That is why a \ngrowing chorus of community leaders and citizens have called for the \nCumberland Gap National Historical Park to purchase Fern Lake. This \nsolution would guarantee management of this\n\n[[Page S6453]]\n\nwonderful resource consistent with the needs of the community.\n  This legislation is needed because currently the Park is prohibited \nby law from expanding its boundaries by purchasing new land with \nappropriated funds. Our bill, therefore, authorizes the Park to use \nappropriated funds, if necessary, to purchase Fern Lake (and up to \n4,500 acres of the surrounding watershed) and to manage the lake for \npublic recreational uses. This bill also requires the Park to maintain \nFern Lake as a source of clean drinking water, authorizes the Park to \nsell water to the city of Middlesboro, and permits the proceeds of the \nwater sales to be spent by the Secretary of the Interior without \nfurther appropriation. And because the scenic and recreational values \nof Fern Lake will benefit the tourism industry in all three adjacent \nstates--Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia--the legislation directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to consult with appropriate officials in \nthese states to determine the best way to manage the municipal water \nsupply and to promote the increased tourism opportunities associated \nwith Park ownership of Fern Lake.\n  This bill is a small but important example of the type of targeted \nconservation measures that are essential to making a national energy \npolicy work for all Americans. This is not the conservation of \nenvironmental extremism that seeks to divide communities, vilify \nopponents, or present unworkable approaches in the name of political \nopportunism. Rather, this is conservation that builds upon community \nconsensus. It is common sense conservation that seeks environmental \nsolutions that will enhance rather than disturb local industries such \nas tourism, which have been so vital to economically depressed areas \nsuch as southeastern Kentucky. And finally, this is conservation that \nis careful to consider, and where necessary, to protect, the property \nrights of affected landowners. This bill requires that the Park acquire \nland from willing sellers only, and the National Park Service has \nassured us that it has no authority to place land-use restrictions on \nprivate land until the land is actually acquired by the Park.\n  Targeted and consensus-driven conservation measures such as this one \nare not always easy to craft, but they are always worth the effort. \nThis bill is proof that environmental protection and economic \ndevelopment need not be at odds, and that there are a number of \nresponsible and practical conservation opportunities that can bring \ncommunities together rather than tear them apart. Indeed, if this \nsimple formula for finding consensus conservation opportunities--broad \ncommunity support, local employment, and private property protections--\nwas replicated in all 50 States, we could make actual and noticeable \nstrides as a nation toward protecting and promoting our natural \ntreasures.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1061\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to promote \norgan donation and facilitate interstate linkage and 24-hour access to \nState donor registries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this year the waiting list for organ \ntransplants among Americans stands at more than 75,000. I rise to urge \nall Senators, and all Americans to become organ donors. I rise to \nintroduce legislation to make it easier for individuals to donate and \nmake it simpler to identify the decedents's donation wishes. I am \npleased that Senators Collins, Biden, Clinton, Feingold, Feinstein, \nJohnson, and Inouye join me in this effort.\n  Access to organ transplantation remains limited by the shortage of \ndonated organs. Each day, an average of\n\n[[Page S6454]]\n\n17 people on the waiting list will die. And the waiting list is \ngrowing. In fact, since 1990 the number of men, women and children \nawaiting life-saving transplants has grown by at least 10 percent easy \nyear. We need to move expeditiously to reduce these deaths due to the \nscarcity of willing organ donors. Every 14 minutes we do not act, \nanother name is added to the national transplant waiting list.\n  Over the last several years, I have worked with many of my colleagues \non a variety of initiatives to increase organ donation. In 1996, I \nauthored legislation to include an organ donation card with every \nFederal income tax refund mailed. More than 70 million donor cards were \nmailed, the largest distribution in history. In 1997, I authored a \nprovision in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriation bill that authorized a study of hospital best practices \nfor increasing organ donation. More recently, I launched a campaign \nknown as ``Give Thanks, Give Life'' with the National Football League \nand a large coalition of advocacy organizations to promote family \ndiscussions over Thanksgiving of family members' desire to become organ \ndonors.\n  But we need to do more. Major barriers to donation still exist. A \nrecent analysis by the Lewin Group, Inc., found low rates of family \nconsent to donation. In addition, there are many missed opportunities \nin the process of identifying and referring all potential donors to \nprocurement organizations so that families may be approached. A 1996 \nstudy of potential organ donors in hospitals found that in nearly a \nthird of all cases, potential donors were not identified or no request \nwas made to the family.\n  Today I am introducing a comprehensive proposal to address these \nobstacles, including a number of new initiatives. The DONATE Act: 1. \nEstablishes a national organ and tissue donor registry resource center \nat the Department of Health and Human Services; 2. Authorizes grants to \nStates to support the development, enhancement, expansion and \nevaluation of statewide organ and tissue donor registries; 3. Funds \nadditional research to learn more about effective strategies that \nincrease donation rates; 4. Provides financial assistance to donors for \ntravel and subsistence expenses incurred toward making living donations \nof their organs; 5. Expands Federal efforts to educate the public about \norgan donation and improve outreach activities; 6. Provides grants to \nhospitals and organ procurement organizations to fund organ \ncoordinators; and 7. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to strike a \nbronze medal to commemorate organ donors and their families.\n  Organ and tissue donor registries have the potential to greatly \nimprove donation rates. Registries provide medical and/or procurement \npersonnel easy access to the donation wishes of brain-dead patients. By \nindicating the potential donors wishes to the family, a registry \ndocumentation can aid in securing next of kin consent. Despite the fact \nthat 85 percent of Americans support organ donation for transplants, \nstudies indicate that only about 50 percent of families consent to \ndonation. Well-designed databases can improve coordination between \nhospitals, physicians, organ procurement organizations and families. \nRegistries can also assist in evaluating education and outreach efforts \nby providing information about registrant demographics and audience-\nspecific effectiveness of awareness campaigns. Yet currently only about \na dozen States operate mature, centralized organ and tissue donor \nregistries.\n\n  I am proud that the State of Illinois was one of the first and is \ncurrently the largest such system. In Illinois, individuals can \nindicate their willingness to donate by signing their drivers license. \nDrivers' license applicants are also asked if they wish to have their \nname listed on the confidential statewide registry. In addition to \nsigning up at a driver services facility, persons can join the registry \nby calling an eight hundred number or electronically via the web. More \nthan 3 million Illinoisans have already joined and 100,000 more sign up \neach month. Today, participation in the Illinois Donor Registry is 39 \npercent statewide, an increase of 77 percent since 1993. In addition, \nabout one fifth of all facilities are reporting participation rates at \nor above 50 percent. Most importantly, organ donation has risen 40 \npercent since 1993 and the Regional Organ Bank of Illinois has led the \nnation in the number of organs recovered for transplantation since \n1994.\n  But unfortunately Illinois is the exception and not the rule. Most \nStates do not have programs and gaps in knowledge exist. In fact, no \none kept track of which States operate organ donor registries until \nrecently. We have little information about what works best when \ndeveloping registries. Guidance for States about the basic components \nof effective systems such as the core functions and content, legal and \nethical standards, privacy protections and data exchange protocols, is \nscarce.\n  And in addition to the fact that most States do not operate \nregistries, among those who do, currently no mechanism exists to share \ninformation between these registries. So if a Illinoisan dies in \nWisconsin, law enforcement or hospital officials in Wisconsin have no \neasy way of knowing of the victims intent to donate. To be effective, \nregistries need to be accessible to the proper authorities around the \nclock without regard for State boundaries. To be effective, registries \nalso need to function as an advance directive, ensuring that the donors \nwishes are honored.\n  The DONATE Act both funds State registry development and creates the \ntechnical expertise States need to do so. The bill establishes a \nNational Organ and Tissue Donation Resource Center, informed by a task \nforce of national experts, to develop registry guidelines for States \nbased on best practices. The Center would maintain a donor registry \nclearinghouse, including a web site, to collect, synthesize, and \ndistribute information about what works. The proposal also requires \nthat a mechanism be established to link State registries and to provide \naround-the-clock access to information. To help ensure that registry \ndevelopment is based on evidence of effectiveness and best practices, \nand to help us understand better how to utilize the registry tool to \nincrease donations, the DONATE Act asks an advisory task force to \nexamine state registries and make recommendations to Congress about the \nstates of such systems and ways to develop linkages between state \nregistries.\n  Public education is equally as important as developing better \ntechnical tools and programs to increase donation if we are to do a \nbetter job of matching the number of donors to people in need of a \ntransplant. The DONATE Act launches a national effort to raise public \nawareness about the importance of organ donation and funds research to \nfind better ways to improve donation rates. The bill authorizes State \ngrants for innovative organ donor awareness and outreach initiatives \nand programs aimed at increasing donation.\n\n  A number of additional innovative initiatives are included in this \nbill. The DONATE Act would directly assist living donors, providing \nfinancial assistance to offset travel, subsistence and other expenses \nincurred toward making living donations of their organs. Similar \nprovisions recently cleared the House of Representatives by more than \n400 votes. The DONATE Act includes the House passed bill, with a number \nof improvements. For example, the Act does not restrict such assistance \nto artificial residency requirements and it does not limit assistance \nonly to those who donate organs to low income recipients.\n  The DONATE Act also provides grants to hospitals and organ \nprocurement organizations to fund staff positions for organ \ncoordinators. These in-house organ coordinators would be responsible \nfor coordinating organ donation and recovery at a hospital or a group \nof hospitals. Research has shown that these types of initiatives can \nhave dramatic results. A four-year retrospective study of a large \npublic hospital in Houston that implemented a coordinator program \nresulted in a 64 percent increase in the consent rate along with a 94 \npercent increase in the number of organ donors.\n  Finally, the DONATE Act incorporates a valuable initiative developed \nby Senator Bill Frist to present donors or the family of a donor with a \nCongressional medal recognizing their gift of life. The bronze medal is \njust\n\n[[Page S6455]]\n\none small, meaningful way we can acknowledge the important act of \ndonating to save another person's life.\n  A great deal of input from experts, and from my colleagues as well, \ncontributed to this legislation. All of these important provisions come \nwith the strong support and input of many groups whose mission it is to \nhelp save lives by increasing organ donation, including the American \nLiver Foundation, the American Society of Transplantation and the \nAmerican Society of Transplant Surgeons. I strongly believe that this \ntype of concrete investment and commitment from the Federal government \nis overdue and will make a real difference. And in this case a real \ndifference is someone's life.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to wipe out the \nwaiting list for transplants. I urge you all to cosponsor the DONATE \nAct and move expeditiously to pass this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Warner, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Cleland, Mr. \n        Ensign, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1064. A bill to amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to provide certain relief from \nliability for small businesses; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to introduce the \nSmall Business Liability Protection Act of 2001. This bill will provide \na lifeline for the thousands of small business owners threatened by \nlawsuits and litigation under the broken Superfund liability system. \nJoining me in introducing this legislation are Senators Reid, Smith, \nKerry, Warner, Chafee, Cleland, Landrieu, Ensign, and Wyden.\n  The bill is simple. All this bill does is protect those who \ncontributed very small amounts of waste, or waste no different than \ncommon household garbage, to a Superfund site. The bill will also speed \nup the process for handling those little fish with a limited ability to \npay towards a Superfund site's cleanup.\n  The exact same version of this bill passed the House unanimously in \nMay and I am proud to have similar bipartisan support for this Senate \nversion. We have members from both the Environment Committee and the \nSmall Business Committee supporting this bill at introduction and I \nencourage all my colleagues to join our effort.\n  My bill will not let polluters off the hook. This common-sense \nproposal will make the Superfund program a little more reasonable and \nworkable. With this legislation, we can begin to provide some relief to \nsmall business owners who are held hostage by potential Superfund \nliability.\n  For years now, members from both sides of the aisle have said that \nthe Superfund program is broken, it doesn't work, it must be reformed. \nUnfortunately we haven't gotten past the rhetoric to fix the problem. \nInstead of making changes that will produce results that are better for \nthe taxpayers, better for the environment, and more efficient for \neveryone involved--government agencies, Federal bureaucrats, and \nCongress have protected this troubled and inefficient program from \nmeaning reform.\n  As Washington has played politics with the Superfund program, \ninnocent Main Street small business owners across the nation, the \nengine of our economy, continue to be unfairly pulled into Superfund's \nlegal quagmire. We now have the opportunity to put all of that behind \nus and move forward with bipartisan, common-sense reform.\n  Let's put a human face on this: recently, just across the Missouri \nborder--in Quincy, Illinois--160 small business owners were asked to \npay the EPA more than $3 million for garbage legally hauled to a dump \nmore than 20 years ago. The situation in Quincy is just one example of \nthe very real, ongoing Superfund legal threat to small business owners \nacross the nation.\n  We all know that Superfund was created to clean up the Nation's most-\nhazardous waste sites. Superfund was not created to have small business \nowners sued for simply throwing out their trash! These small business \nowners are faced with so many challenges already, that the thousands of \ndollars in penalties and lawsuits leave them with no choice but to \nmortgage their businesses, their employees and their future to pay for \nthe bills of a broken government program.\n  How many times will we tell ourselves that this unacceptable \nsituation must be fixed before we act? Small business owners literally \ncannot afford to wait around while we delay action on the common-sense \nfixes required to protect them and our environment.\n  Is this legislation everything I would like to see. No. But this bill \ndoes move us in the direction we need to go to ensure cleanup, \nfairness, and progress in reforming the Superfund program.\n  In recognition of our small businesses around the country, I \nintroduce this bill and look forward to ensuring speedy adoption of \nthis long overdue legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6455-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6455-S6456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 113--CONGRATULATIONS TO THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS ON \n THEIR SECOND CONSECUTIVE NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, last Friday, as millions of Americans and \nbasketball fans around the world watched on television and listened on \nthe radio, the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers to \nbecome the 2001 National Basketball Association champions.\n  This is the second consecutive year that the Lakers have won the NBA \nchampionship.\n  No team has ever enjoyed a post-season quite like the Lakers. They \nclinched the championship in five games, finishing the playoffs with a \nrecord of 15-1--the best ever. They were also the first team to go \nthrough the playoffs without losing a single game on the road.\n  Throughout the playoffs and championship series, one player in \nparticular came to symbolize the Lakers' march to victory: The Big \nMan--Shaquille O'Neal. Because of his sterling play and leadership, \nShaquille O'Neal was named Most Valuable Player for the series. O'Neal, \nof course, benefitted from a sterling supporting cast that included \nKobe Bryant, Rick Fox, Derek Fisher, Robert Horry and others.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, this year's championship was truly a team \neffort.\n  While the lion's share of the credit for their remarkable victory \ngoes to the players themselves, I also want to acknowledge the \noutstanding coaching staff led by head coach Phil Jackson. This is \nCoach Jackson's eighth NBA title and his second with the Lakers.\n  I think it is safe to say that these Los Angeles Lakers are a \nbasketball dynasty-in-the-making, and I am delighted to introduce this \nresolution acknowledging their efforts and congratulating the Lakers \nand their fans in California and around the world.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Los \nAngeles Lakers for winning the National\n\n[[Page S6456]]\n\nBasketball Association championship for a second year in a row.\n  The Lakers overcame internal conflict and numerous injuries to go on \nto a remarkable season.\n  They put together a remarkable string of victories at the end of the \nseason to bring home another World Championship to the City of Los \nAngeles, winning 23 out of 24 of their final games and going 15 and 1 \nin the playoffs--the best playoff record ever.\n  This Lakers team demonstrated what it truly means to be a champion \nand represents the best of what the city of Los Angeles has to offer.\n  Led by the inspired play of Shaquille O'Neal and the coaching of Phil \nJackson, the Lakers swept through the opening three rounds of the \nplayoffs--easily defeating the talented Portland Trailblazers, \nSacramento Kings, and San Antonio Spurs.\n  In the final round, the Lakers faced a gritty Philadelphia 76ers team \nled by the incomparable Allen Iverson. Iverson and the Sixers showed \ntremendous determination and heart, handing an overtime defeat to the \nLakers in the first game of the series.\n  But as the series moved on, the Lakers outmatched the Sixers and \nproved, once again, that they were the best team in professional \nbasketball.\n  This was truly a team effort: Shaquille O'Neal, the series Most \nValuable Player, dominated the Sixers on both ends of the floor, \naveraging 33 points per game, 15.8 rebounds, 4.8 assists, and 3.4 \nblocks in the final series.\n  With his unselfish play, Kobe Bryant provided the spark for the \noffense--in game four, for instance, he scored 19 points, had 10 \nassists, and had 9 rebounds.\n  Derek Fisher, Rick Fox, Robert Horry and Brian Shaw made significant \ncontributions to the championship--each cooly made three point shots at \ncritical points in the series.\n  Horace Grant and Ron Harper provided the veteran experience that \nhelped the Lakers push back the 4th quarter surges of the Sixers.\n  And finally, Tyronn Lue, deserves honorable mention for his dogged \ndefense against Allen Iverson, especially in Game 1. Without his play, \nthe Lakers would have been unable to contain the speedy Sixer guard.\n  Once again let me congratulate the Los Angeles Lakers for their \nvictory.

The \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and [        ] \n     registers pesticides for that use. EPA continues to examine \n     registered pesticides to determine that use of the pesticides \n     in accordance with instructions printed on the label does not \n     pose unreasonable risks to human health and the environment. \n     Nevertheless, EPA cannot guarantee that registered pesticides \n     do not pose risks, and unnecessary exposure to pesticides \n     should be avoided. Based in part on recommendations of a 1993 \n     study by the National Academy of Sciences that reviewed \n     registered pesticides and their potential to cause \n     unreasonable adverse effects on human health, particularly on \n     the health of pregnant women, infants, and children, Congress \n     enacted the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. That law \n     requires EPA to reevaluate all registered pesticides and new \n     pesticides to measure their safety, taking into account the \n     unique exposures and sensitivity that pregnant women, \n     infants, and children may have to pesticides.

Res. 42\n\n       Whereas the Taleban militia took power in Afghanistan in \n     1996, and now rules over 90 percent of the country;\n       Whereas, under Taleban rule, most political, civil, and \n     human rights are denied to the Afghan people;\n       Whereas women, minorities, and children suffer \n     disproportionately under Taleban rule;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Department of State \n     Country Report on Human Rights Practices, violence against \n     women and girls in Afghanistan occurs frequently, including \n     beatings, rapes, forced marriages, disappearances, \n     kidnapings, and killings;\n       Whereas Taleban edicts isolate Muslim and non-Muslim \n     minorities, and will require the thousands of Hindus living \n     in Taleban-ruled Afghanistan to wear identity labels on their \n     clothing, singling out these minorities for discrimination \n     and harsh treatment;\n       Whereas Taleban forces have targeted ethnic Shiite Hazaras, \n     many of whom have been massacred, while those who have \n     survived, are denied relief and discriminated against for \n     their religious beliefs;\n       Whereas non-Muslim religious symbols are banned, and \n     earlier this year Taleban forces obliterated 2 ancient \n     statues of Buddha, claiming they were idolatrous symbols;\n       Whereas Afghanistan is currently suffering from its worst \n     drought in 3 decades, affecting almost one-half of \n     Afghanistan's 21,000,000 population, with the impact severely \n     exacerbated by the ongoing civil war and Taleban policies \n     denying relief to needy areas;\n       Whereas the Taleban has systematically interfered with \n     United Nations relief programs and workers, recently closing \n     a new hospital and arresting local workers, closing United \n     Nations World Food Program bakeries providing much needed \n     food, and closing offices of the United Nations Special \n     Mission to Afghanistan in 4 Afghan cities;\n       Whereas, as a result of those policies, there are more than \n     25,000,000 persons who are internally displaced within \n     Afghanistan, and this year, contrary to past practice, the \n     Taleban rejected a United Nations call for a cease-fire in \n     order to bring assistance to the internally displaced;\n       Whereas, as a result of Taleban policies, there are now \n     more than 2,200,000 Afghan refugees in Pakistan, and 500,000 \n     more refugees are expected to flee in the coming months \n     unless some form of relief is forthcoming;\n       Whereas Pakistan has closed its borders to Afghanistan, and \n     has announced that Pakistani and United Nations officials \n     will begin screening refugees in June with a view toward \n     forcibly repatriating all those who are found to be staying \n     illegally in Pakistan;\n       Whereas the Taleban leadership continues to give safe haven \n     to terrorists, including Osama bin Laden, and is known to \n     host and provide training ground to other terrorist \n     organizations; and\n       Whereas the people of Afghanistan are the greatest victims \n     of the Taleban, and in recognition of that fact, the United \n     States has provided $124,000,000 in relief to the people of \n     Afghanistan this year: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) condemns the harsh and discriminatory policies of the \n     Taleban toward Muslims, Hindus, women, and all other \n     minorities, and the attendant destruction of religious icons;\n\n[[Page S6461]]\n\n       (2) urges the Taleban to immediately reopen United Nations \n     offices and hospitals and allow the provision of relief to \n     all the people of Afghanistan;\n       (3) commends President George W. Bush and his \n     administration for their recognition of these urgent issues \n     and encourages President Bush to continue to respond to those \n     issues;\n       (4) recognizes the burdens placed on the Government of \n     Pakistan by Afghan refugees, and calls on that Government to \n     facilitate the provision of relief to these refugees and to \n     abandon any plans for forced repatriation; and\n       (5) calls on the international community to increase \n     assistance to the Afghan people and consider granting asylum \n     to at-risk Afghan refugees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/19/senate-section/article/S6461-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NATIONAL 4-H PROGRAM CENTENNIAL INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. REID.
