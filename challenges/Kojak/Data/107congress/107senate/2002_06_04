Mr. President, We as Senators have so many opportunities to \nmeet people--but I have to say I had such a warm feeling today when I \nwas able to meet four of the code talkers, the wind talkers, the Navajo \nwho were so instrumental in our victorious efforts in World War II.\n  These old men, I told the lead actor of this movie a number of years \nago, were just like him: Young, powerful, physically strong men, who \nfought in World War II.\n  In talking to two of these Navajos this morning--two of these \nheroes--I asked them where they went during World War II. And they both \nstarted with Guadalcanal, and went through the various islands, \nincluding Guam. One of them said: At Tarawa, my buddies were killed \nright in front of me. With tears in his eyes he said this.\n  We have to remember the sacrifices of the people who died in World \nWar II, the people who fought in World War II.\n  These brave Indians deserve all the accolades they are going to get \nwith this movie. I have spoken to those who have seen the movie, and it \nis a spellbinding movie. The reason it is so good is it is based on \nfacts, based on truth and reality.\n  But the reason we should never forget the sacrifices of the soldiers, \nsailors, and airmen of World War II is that our freedoms today are \nbased upon the\n\n[[Page S4932]]\n\nsacrifices they made. And students should always be reminded of that in \nthe history books of this country.\n  Mr. President, 1,000 World War II veterans are dying every day. The \naverage age of a World War II veteran now is 80 years. I, and all \nSenators, have returned from our respective States. We all attended \nMemorial Day services. I did that a week ago yesterday. Frankly, I have \nbeen attending these services for many years. The crowds are smaller \nthan they used to be because the World War II heroes are passing away, \nthey are leaving the scene.\n  So I want the Record spread with the fact that it was a real honor \nfor me to meet these brave men today and to meet some of the actors who \nare in this movie.\n  Again, I want the Record to reflect what sacrifices these men made. I \nam glad that finally their story is going to be made public to the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4932-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TERRORISM INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate, as has been announced, is \nconsidering the emergency supplemental bill. Of course, anyone with \namendments should come to the floor. We have so much work to be done \nthis legislative year. We need to complete action on many important \nmatters. One issue we must seek to work on quickly, expeditiously, is \ngetting a bill out of this body to address the growing problem of a \nlack of insurance coverage due to the threat of terrorist attacks.\n  Moody's Investors Service, which is a world famous organization, \nrecently placed the ratings of 14 commercial mortgage-backed \ntransactions on watch for possible downgrade due to concerns about \nterrorism insurance coverage.\n  Moody's states that either the lack of or insufficiency of, or near-\nterm expiration of terrorism insurance coverage is the cause for these \nreviews for downgrade.\n  In each case, terrorism insurance coverage has expired or will expire \nby the end of the third quarter of 2002.\n  A Moody's spokesman stated:\n\n       We believe that ignoring the risks would be inappropriate \n     given the events of Sept. 11 and continued government \n     warnings of the likelihood of future terrorist attacks. While \n     the probability of a major downgrade or default because of a \n     terrorist attack remains fairly remote, the overall risk in \n     these transactions has clearly increased.\n\n  Moody's stated that it will take into account any Federal backstop \nfor terrorism insurance put into effect by Congress.\n  The majority--Senator Daschle--has been trying since December 2001 to \nreach agreement on bringing up legislation to deal with this growing \nproblem. Unfortunately, every time we try, we have been blocked from \nbringing this up by the minority. Senators Dodd, Sarbanes, and Schumer \nhave put together a solid proposal that addresses this problem.\n  The desire to move this quickly necessitates a unanimous consent \nagreement on the number of amendments that would be in order to this \nlegislation. We have repeatedly modified our proposal to accommodate \namendments that individual Senators seek to offer to the Dodd proposal.\n  Over the recess, I have heard that Senators Gramm of Texas and \nMcConnell have put together a new proposal on terrorism insurance.\n  While I believe we should have addressed this issue a long time ago--\nthey have every right to propose something new. I hope that whether it \nis controversial or not, it will help in moving this matter forward. \nUnder our proposed consent request, they would be able to offer this \nproposal as an amendment. We have suggested that each side have four \namendments, originally two; they said they wanted more, we doubled \nthat.\n  The issue is too important to be caught up in political agendas at \nthis stage. There are some who seek to impose greater restrictions on \ninsurance companies. There are others who seek to use this legislation \nas the way to have tort reform as part of the bill's consideration. I \nencourage everyone to come to the middle and not let perfection become \nthe enemy of the good.\n  It is important we do something. I encourage the White House to \nengage on this issue and assist us in moving this important \nlegislation. As the famous football coach, George Allen, said: The \nfuture is now.\n  The future is now. Moody's recent expected down-gradings are \ndisturbing. All over America, whether it is New York, Chicago, Las \nVegas, Dallas, or any of the big cities in Florida, there are \nsignificant building projects that, if not on hold, will be on hold \npending resolution of this issue.\n  This is not about tort reform. It is about maintaining the stability \nof our economic infrastructure. I hope we can, with this legislation, \nperhaps move forward to have something to deal with terrorism \ninsurance. If not, I hope there is a way we can move forward soon, this \nweek, to have this matter brought before the body with reasonable time \nagreements on the amendments, which would be appropriate; but if not, \nthen let's just move forward on the legislation with no time agreements \non any amendments.\n  The Republican manager is here. I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4932-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4932-S4933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002--Continued\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, yesterday I made a statement on the floor \nconcerning the contents of the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  The bill is a good bill. It was reported out of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee by a vote of 29 to 0. That unanimous vote \ncould not have been possible without the cooperation, the support, and \nthe leadership of the distinguished Senator from Alaska, the ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Ted Stevens.\n  As I indicated yesterday, the Appropriations Committee held extensive \nhearings on the President's supplemental request and on the needs for \nhomeland defense. The able Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, and I \njoined in issuing the request for witnesses for these hearings.\n  Every witness that came before the committee had been agreed upon \njointly by the Senator from Alaska and myself. We heard from terrorism \nexperts about the continuing threat to our Nation. We heard from \nGovernors. We heard from mayors. We heard from the first responders: \nOur police, fire, and medical personnel. They all testified to a \ncontinuing need for resources to expand our capacity to prevent, \ndetect, and respond to terrorist attacks.\n  We took testimony from seven Cabinet members and the head of the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency. Our former colleagues in this \nbody, Sam Nunn and Warren Rudman, testified to the very real threat \nthat this Nation faces. Those hearings were important, productive, and \nthey brought forth exceedingly valuable information to the members of \nthe committee. That information is reflected in the makeup of this \nappropriations bill.\n  The principal components of this supplemental bill are $14 billion \nfor the Department of Defense; $1.9 billion for international \nemergencies; $8.3 billion for homeland defense, including $4.4 billion \nfor the newly established Transportation Security Administration; $5.5 \nbillion for New York in response to the events of September 11; $1 \nbillion for the Pell grant shortfall; and $417 million for VA medical \ncare.\n  Mr. President, Senator Stevens and I will join, hopefully, in \nopposing amendments that require offsets. Senator Stevens is in the \nChamber. He will speak for himself and I look forward to his remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor this \nmorning to join our distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee in recommending the committee substitute to H.R. 4775.\n  This bill reflects the priorities requested by the President which \nwere to fight the war on terrorism, protect our\n\n[[Page S4933]]\n\nNation from future attack, and support the recovery of New York.\n  The bill provides slightly more money than requested by the House \nbill, as our committee utilized the time available to conduct a series \nof hearings that addressed many challenges in our homeland defense \nefforts, and that is one of the reasons for the differences between the \nSenate bill and the House bill.\n  In addition, hearings that begin today by the Intelligence Committees \nmay generate additional requirements for moneys in this bill to ensure \nthe effective cooperation by our intelligence and law enforcement \nagencies in our homeland defense.\n  Most importantly, the bill provides funds vital to sustain military \noperations in the war against terrorism.\n  Our bill meets the commitment made by the President and the Congress \nto the victims of the September 11 attacks.\n  This bill enables the Transportation Safety Agency and the Coast \nGuard to perform and expand their mission to ensure the safety of \nAmerican travelers and trade.\n  I endorse the increases provided in this bill for the Transportation \nSecurity Agency, the Coast Guard, FBI, INS, FEMA, and several other \ncategories.\n  While these amounts exceed the level requested by the President, we \nbelieve the funds are needed by those who undertake these difficult and \ndangerous jobs. These are people who deserve our support.\n  In addition, the bill responds to the serious needs overseas as we \ntry to support the President's efforts in the war on terrorism and to \nwork for peace in the Middle East.\n  The $250 million for the Middle East peace effort matches the House-\nreported level and sends a very important signal to our ally, Israel.\n  The $100 million included in this bill for the fight against AIDS in \nAfrica is very deserving. We are informed that some Members may \nadvocate an even higher level for this item.\n  Finally, I personally appreciate that the full $16 million sought by \nthe President for Indonesia is included in this bill. Senator Inouye \nand I have recently returned from a trip to Indonesia, and we know \nfirsthand the needs of that country.\n  For all of these reasons, as I have stated, I recommend the Senate \nadvance this bill to a conference with the House as rapidly as \npossible. There are several issues I hope the Senate, in the conference \nwith the House, will see fit to modify in the bill.\n  We have in the bill section 2002 that mandates that all nondefense \nemergencies must be so designated by the President at the same time. I \ndon't believe that provision is necessary, but I am not going to oppose \nit.\n  Section 1102 of the bill makes the Director of the Office of Homeland \nSecurity subject to Senate confirmation. I have joined Senator Byrd in \nseeking Governor Ridge's testimony before our committee. I further \nbelieve that position would be strengthened by a structure and a \ndirector with authorities defined in the law, as this amendment would \nprovide.\n  Hopefully, an acceptable agreement can be reached over time between \nthe Congress and the President on the issue of that office.\n  In the defense chapter, I regret that the authorities sought by the \nSecretary to respond to unforeseen requirements in working with our \nallies were not included, but the provision in the House bill, section \n312, will be in conference and will be debated there quite heavily, I \nam sure.\n  The bill doesn't include the $100 million sought by the Army and \nincluded in the House bill for a new initiative to destroy our \nstockpile of chemical weapons. This is another matter that we will have \nto address in conference. It is just a matter of how we can find the \nmoney to do all of these things at the same time.\n  I welcome the Senate proceeding to act on this bill today. It is my \nhope that we will reach an agreement on all first-degree amendments \nbeing filed today. There is no reason the Senate should not complete \nits work on this bill as rapidly as possible and be able to go to \nconference this week.\n  As soon as we complete this measure, we can turn to the fiscal year \n2003 bills, and I remind colleagues that we have 13 separate bills to \nenact before the end of September. I hope Senators will assist us as \nmembers of this committee and reserve amendments that are more \nappropriately addressed in the fiscal year 2003 appropriations bills \nand not raise them on this supplemental.\n  As of today, we have only 117 days remaining in this fiscal year. \nThere are very few days to take the initiatives that would be required \nto complete the 13 bills, and there are very few initiatives that can \nbe realistically accomplished in that time, other than proceeding with \nour 13 bills.\n  Mr. President, I commend the chairman for bringing this bill to the \nfloor. I thank him for his cooperation and kindness to me and to our \nstaff in the consideration of this measure. It is a bipartisan measure. \nI am pleased to be in the Chamber with Senator Byrd to urge the Senate \nto complete action on it as rapidly as possible. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have heard for weeks, if not months, \nhow important this legislation is. This is an emergency bill, an \nemergency supplemental. It deals with terrorism. The title of the bill \nis the supplemental appropriations act for further recovery from and \nresponse to terrorist attacks on the United States.\n  In spite of its emergency nature, nothing is happening. There are no \namendments being offered. We are doing absolutely nothing on the floor. \nI have spoken to the majority leader and I will confer with the two \nmanagers of the bill. At 3 this afternoon, or thereabouts, when the \nparty conferences end, there should be Senators present, whether from \nthe majority or the minority. We are going to move to third reading. If \nsomeone does not want us to move to third reading, they will have to \nobject.\n  This is an emergency bill, the supplemental appropriations act for \nfurther recovery from and response to terrorist attacks on the United \nStates. If someone doesn't like something in this bill, try to get rid \nof it. I heard speeches the day we recessed that Members didn't like \ncertain provisions in the House bill. Well, move to get rid of them. \nLet's not sit around in the Senate doing nothing.\n  I hope the White House will call those Senators with whom they have a \nline of communication and tell them what they don't like about the \nbill. The President has indicated how important this bill is. Let's \nmove it. We are ready to move it. This afternoon we are going to move \nto third reading. If Members do not want to go to third reading, come \nand object.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MILLER. I also ask unanimous consent that I may speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, let me read a few recent comments from \nthe media, always a jaded and cynical bunch, but in this case let's \nhope their pessimism is wrong. Our senior citizens certainly pray that \nit is.\n  From the National Journal, May 25:\n\n       It is becoming increasingly unlikely that Congress this \n     year will approve compromise legislation providing \n     prescription drug benefits for Medicare recipients.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal, June 3:\n\n       President Bush and Congress are unlikely to agree this year \n     on a promised Medicare benefit for prescription drugs.\n\n  World Market's Research Centre, May 20:\n\n\n[[Page S4934]]\n\n\n       Neither party wants the other to be seen by the electorate \n     to have found the solution.

There are dozens of articles \nlike this, but I think you get the idea. Hardly anyone thinks we are \ngoing to do anything serious about prescription drug costs and \nprescription drug coverage. Let us pray they are wrong--that they are \nnot right. But if the past is prologue, that is exactly the partisan \nblame game that smells up this place sometimes.\n\n  I am interested in doing something now. I want results, not a \ncampaign issue. Time is running out, and I hate to tell you but some \npeople want it to run out. That is their game. They want to shuffle and \nslouch and go through the motions while the clock does run out. That is \nwhy I think I am going to bring a calendar in here, and just like we \ncount the shopping days left until Christmas, I am going to count the \ndays left until the August recess.\n  It would look just like this: 39 days left. I don't think we are \ngoing to do anything today--another day shot.\n  Madam President, I know some may call that undignified. I hope they \ndo. I would like to get the meaning of dignity into this debate, into \nthis discussion. I will tell you what is undignified--an old woman with \ntrembling hands, trying to cut a pill in half so her medicine will last \na little longer. I will tell you about losing dignity--an old man proud \nand self-sufficient all his life, admitting in whispered tones to his \npharmacist: I didn't know it was going to cost that much and I sure \ndon't want my check to bounce. I'll come back later.\n  I will tell you what undignified is--a couple who have lived together \nfor 55 years, using coffee grounds from the day before to stretch it \nfurther because mama has to have her medicine.\n  So I don't want anybody talking to me about the loss of dignity, not \nin this debate.\n  By the way, there is a difference between what is undignified and \nwhat is obscene. What is obscene is making an 18.5-percent profit \nmargin--more than four times that of all other industries--and raking \nin that kind of profit on the backs of our seniors.\n  I will tell you what is obscene--the giant pharmaceutical companies \nspending three times more on advertising than they do on research. \nTheir ads are everywhere. How many times do we have to watch that woman \nwho has--got to go, got to go, got to go?\n  What is obscene is having 650 lobbyists to make sure we keep \nshuffling and slouching--650 lobbyists. That is more than one for every \nMember of Congress.\n  There are towns in Georgia that do not have that big a population. I \nlive in one.\n  I will tell you what is obscene--these lobbyists each make an average \nof over $12,000 a month. That is three times more than what an average \nschoolteacher or a registered nurse makes. We talk about predatory \nlending, predatory lenders--what about predatory businesses that \nprotect their bottom lines at the expense of millions of people who \ncannot afford drugs they have to have?\n  I know we have been told we are going to take this up sometime--\nsometime this summer, sometime after hate crimes, sometime after this \nbill, sometime after another bill, sometime later. There is an old \ncountry saying. Probably nobody in this body has ever heard it, except \nmaybe the senior Senator from West Virginia and the two Senators from \nSouth Carolina, somebody like us who has been around chickens in the \nyard and knows about setting hens. There is an old saying that goes \nlike this: I hear you clucking but I can't find your nest.\n  It means I hear you talking, but I don't see any action.\n  I will tell you this, I don't want to be associated with any \npolitical party that cannot comprehend the urgency of this stark need \nof our seniors; that is unwilling to take some risks and that is \nunwilling to compromise to get some results. If we fail to get some \nresults on this issue, we should be so ashamed that all incumbents \ngoing into November--Democrats and Republicans alike--should have to go \naround with a paper sack over their heads like sports fans sometimes do \nwhen they are embarrassed by their team's performance.\n\n  We have to do something and we have to do something soon, Madam \nPresident, and I know you share those desires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4934-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4934-S4938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3557\n\n             (Purpose: To strike section 1004 of the bill)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, Senator Stevens and I have an amendment to \nstrike section 1004 of the bill. This section serves to cap the amount \nof loan guarantees that would be available to the Nation's airlines for \nthe duration of the current fiscal year. The section also caps the \ntotal amount of loan guarantees available through the life of the \nprogram. These loan guarantees were first authorized in Public Law 107-\n42, the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, which \nwas enacted to bail out the airlines just 11 days after the tragedies \nof September 11. The committee included the provision capping the \nvolume of available loan guarantees for the sole reason of reducing the \noverall cost of the bill as determined by the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  The CBO estimates that section 1004 of the bill serves to lower the \ntotal cost of the bill in fiscal year 2002 by $393 million. A similar \nprovision was included in the House version of the supplemental. There \nhas been a lot of concern voiced by various Senators, to me and to \nSenator Stevens and especially Senator Hollings, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Commerce.\n\n  And the concern has been that the effect of this provision would \nespecially be heavy on US Airways and other airlines. But that \nparticular airline is hopeful it might receive a Federal loan guarantee \nin the current fiscal year. There may be reason to question whether any \nsizable new loan guarantees will be executed by the stabilization board \nwithin the current fiscal year, but it is not the desire or intent of \nthe committee to work a hardship on US Airways or any other airline. US \nAirways is the principal air carrier serving my own State.\n  Madam President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask that it be \nread.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3557:\n       Strike section 1004 of the bill.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, that should read: the amendment as \nproposed by Mr. Byrd, on behalf of himself and Mr. Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Record will so reflect.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Byrd for himself and for me. I ask that it be \nadopted. I understand the Senator from Arizona would like a rollcall \nvote. I have no objection to that. We join him in that request.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 3557.\n\n[[Page S4935]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nfor the vote be set by the majority leader in consultation with the \nRepublican leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from West Virginia. I thank him and Senator \nStevens for moving forward quickly with the amendment to alleviate any \nquestion in the minds of the airline industry, but in particular, as \nSenator Byrd alluded, US Airways and US Airways employees. Over the \nlast week, having been in my State of Pennsylvania, I have heard \neverywhere I go, traveling through the airports, the grave concern that \nemployees of US Airways have with respect to this loan fund and the \navailability of the loan fund resources to help this company get \nthrough what is a very treacherous time in the company's history, \ntreacherous in terms of trying to negotiate a very difficult \nenvironment for the airline industry generally but a much more \ncomplicated one for US Airways as a result of probably being more \nimpacted by the events of 9/11 than any other airline in the country.\n  I can tell you, after the events, they had no intention of ever \nhaving to access this fund. They were hoping they would survive on $1 \nbillion in cash, and they have burned through most of that as a result \nof the losses they have suffered over the past 7 or 8 months. Now under \nnew leadership, they have a new vision for restructuring this company \nto try to make a go of it as a more efficient carrier.\n  They will need, I have been told, these resources, these loans, and \ntheir application will probably be forthcoming within the next weeks or \nmonths. So this original provision in this bill which would have made \nthis money unavailable until October 1 would have been certain death \nfor this company. They have simply run out of money and no bank would \nhave lent them the money. They are in the process now of negotiating \nwith their employees. I can tell you, I have heard from employees--the \nfolks on the lines, pilots, folks at the reservation desks, and the \nflight attendants--that the negotiations are vigorous, but there is a \nnew spirit in the airline, and I am very excited about it. We have over \n25,000 employees of US Airways in Pennsylvania. It is a big deal in \nPennsylvania.\n\n  This amendment allows the program to continue. It will not remove \nmoney from the program. What it does not do is guarantee that US Air \nwill get the loan guarantees. What it does is say that the program is \nstill going to be here, and US Airways would be able to apply. But \nthere is still the question of whether there will be sufficient \nreorganization of the airline so they can then go to the board and get \nthis kind of loan.\n  In the Senate, we have included the first step. I hope that provision \nwill not be in the conference report. I know Senators Byrd and Stevens \nwill work hard to make sure that occurs. I thank them for this \namendment. I certainly fully support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate the statement of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. We in Nevada, in Arizona, and in the Western United \nStates have experience with this loan fund. We had an airline that had \nbeen going since the late 1950s. Because of what happened on September \n11--they had a large line of credit that was available. When September \n11 hit, it was gone. They could not recoup in time to stay in business \nhad it not been for this loan program.\n  I believe America West is the only airline that has received the \nactual approval of a loan. It has been lifesaving to the airline. The \nairline is now thriving and doing well, and they established direct \nflights from Washington National to Phoenix and Las Vegas. They are \ndoing very well.\n  I appreciate the statement of the Senator from Pennsylvania, and I am \nespecially grateful to the managers of this bill for making this the \nfirst amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent the vote on the pending amendment occur at \n2:15 p.m. today and that no amendments to the language proposed to be \nstricken be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I find myself in support of the Byrd \namendment. The reason I wanted a recorded vote is because we need to \nsend a strong signal to the other body, when this bill goes to \nconference, that we cannot destroy the Aviation Loan Guarantee Program, \nwhich would have been the effect of this legislation.\n  The question, of course, is why would the appropriators again take it \nupon themselves to make a fundamental policy change, which was recently \nauthorized by a 98-to-0 vote in this body? The arrogance of the \nAppropriations Committee almost overwhelms me. This legislation was \nabout to be emasculated--the Aviation Loan Guarantee Program--without a \nhearing before the Appropriations Committee that I know of, without any \ndiscussion on the floor of this body; it was going to be destroyed.\n  The reason, obviously, we know--I will state the obvious--the Byrd \namendment is now going to pass is because of the incredible outcry all \nover the country from employees, management, and from those who \nunderstand the absolute criticality of the aviation industry in this \nNation.\n  So I hope this amendment is passed by 100 to 0. But how they could \ntake it upon themselves to fundamentally alter and micromanage the \nAviation Loan Guarantee Program passed just 8 months ago, of course, \nwithout any consultation with the committee of jurisdiction over this \nprogram and which was responsible for the bill we passed just a few \nmonths ago creating the Aviation Loan Guarantee Program.\n  Madam President, let me explain this program. The overarching purpose \nbehind the Air Transportation Safety and Stabilization Act was to \naddress the financial condition of the airline industry. The tragic \nevents that occurred on September 11, 2001, had far-reaching effects on \nthe airline industry. Commercial air carriers were used as weapons of \nmass destruction with devastating results. The resulting Federal-\nGovernment-ordered shutdown of the air transportation system resulted \nin a total loss of revenue for the airline industry for several days. \nThis loss of revenue, through no fault of the airlines, mandated an \nappropriate shutdown of the airline industry and the resulting slowdown \nin air travel and issues regarding potential liability all lead to \nplacing the airline industry in an extremely precarious financial \nsituation.\n  As a result, Congress acted quickly--through the authorizing \ncommittee, I might add--to stabilize the airline industry by setting \nforth assistance on three fronts. It offered a cash infusion to \nreimburse the airlines for losses ensuing from the Government shutdown \nof the airways. It offered loan guarantees to allow those carriers that \nlost the ability to obtain financing due to a more conservative lending \nmarket after the terrorist attacks to obtain Government-guaranteed \nloans. It offered a limitation on liability to address the problem \nfaced by several airlines that were unable to obtain financing due to \ntheir perceived potential liability.\n  The action taken by Congress was to ensure that all airlines--I \nemphasize ``all airlines''--were given an equal opportunity to return \nto their financial positions prior to September 11, 2001. In the \ninterest of full disclosure, some of the airlines, prior to September \n11, 2001, were not in good shape. We all recognize that. But Congress \nbelieved it needed to act in an equitable manner to try to prevent the \nhuman catastrophe from becoming a severe economic one that could alter \nthe Nation's transportation system, at a minimum.\n\n  It was never our purpose, and still is not, to provide a taxpayer-\nfunded bailout for airlines that were doomed to fail even before the \nevents of September 11. However, it was also not our\n\n[[Page S4936]]\n\nintention for the Federal Government to become the architect of a new \naviation economy, effectively picking winners and losers and, in doing \nso, contributing to the further consolidation of the airline industry.\n  Yet here we were with the appropriators attempting to circumvent the \nwork of the authorizing committee and fundamentally altering the act's \nloan guarantee program because, after all, they know best.\n  Under section 1004 of the supplemental measure, the Aviation Loan \nGuarantee Program would be limited to $429 million for this fiscal \nyear. Interestingly, the only loan guarantee approved this year was for \n$429 million. In other words, no further loan guarantees can be issued \nthis year, according to the appropriators' directive. There apparently \nis some report language that is intended to allow the board to continue \nto review and approve applications, but it would not be able to issue \nFederal credit instruments. We are told by the financial markets and \nthe airlines this language may not deal with the appropriate issue. If \nthe loan guarantees cannot actually be issued, then the financial \nmarkets may not be willing to extend credit.\n  The bill then reduces the loan program from $10 billion to $4 \nbillion--a whopping 60-percent reduction by a stroke of the \nappropriators' pen. You might say $4 billion is a lot of money, and it \nis a lot of money; but my understanding is that there is grave concern \nin the industry that if the number of carriers that are expected to \napply do so, a $4 billion level would not be sufficient and, in turn, \nthere would be significant consequences throughout the airline \nindustry.\n  Let me be very clear. I do not support any particular airline's \napplication under this program. It is the stabilization board's \ndiscretion to determine if a particular airline is eligible. But there \nare numerous applications currently pending, and if their applications \nare approved, they will need the loan guarantees this year.\n  Let me note that the competition in the aviation industry has always \nbeen precarious. Since deregulation, national and regional competitive \nlow-cost carriers have sprung up and are considered the driving force \nbehind the benefits of airline deregulation. While some have failed, \nthe entry of low fare competition has been shown to reduce fares and \nenhance service for the flying public. Any attempt by the Federal \nGovernment to predetermine which airline should survive and which \nshould not would upset this precarious balance and could result in \ndetrimental results for the traveling public.\n  Effectively halting this program for the year and cutting it by 60 \npercent is fundamentally wrong and would have had devastating \nconsequences. We would be changing the rules midstream and impacting \nfundamental business decisions that companies made based on the \nexisting rules. Let me say that this was avoidable. Any amount of due \ndiligence or communication with the authorizing committee, or the \nstabilization board, would have alerted the appropriators that their \nactions could significantly alter the playing field in the airline \nindustry.\n  I believe in the free market perhaps even more so than others, but \nthe events of September 11 were not foreseeable. We made a commitment \nto the airline industry that we would address their needs collectively, \nnot piecemeal. Yet here we are, 8 months later, pulling the rug out \nfrom under them, and the financial markets are reacting and pulling \nback.\n  This provision, I am sure, will be taken out with a vote that will \ntake place this afternoon. But if airlines had gone under and Members \nlost service or, more importantly, low-cost competition, I do not think \nwe could complain about the lost jobs in the economy or high airline \nfares because any Members supporting this provision would only have \nthemselves to blame.\n  I want to speak about the bill for the fiscal year 2002. Before the \nMemorial Day recess, I stated my strong opposition to moving to \nconsideration of this supplemental appropriations bill without first \nproviding sufficient time for a thorough review of its provisions to \nensure that we are acting in a responsible manner.\n  The bill before us today contains $31 billion in Federal spending. \nThat is about $1.6 billion more than the House bill and $4.1 billion \nover the President's budget request. There is at least $3.1 billion in \nnew spending above the President's request that is not paid for and \nwill only add to our mounting deficits.\n  The Government is already running a deficit of $66.5 billion for the \nfirst 7 months of the budget year, a reversal from the $165 billion \nsurplus recorded for the same period a year ago. It does not take an \neconomist to conclude that at the rate we are increasing spending, we \nwill not only post a sizable deficit for the entire fiscal year but in \nthe years to follow. The budget shortfall could total $100 billion or \nmore, perhaps even approaching $150 billion.\n  The bulk of this bill does contain provisions that have been \ndesignated as emergencies in response to the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, and I fully support them, but the story does not end \nthere.\n  Can anyone say with a straight face that everything in this bill, \nwhich is officially titled ``The 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act \nfor Further Recovery From and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the \nUnited States,'' is directly related to this bill's stated purpose? For \nexample, this bill provides $2 million in emergency funding for the \nplanning and design of an alcohol collection storage facility for the \nSmithsonian; $10 million in emergency assistance for the State of Texas \nto provide assistance to agricultural producers with farming or \nranching operations along the Rio Grande for economic losses; $6.5 \nmillion in emergency assistance for flood control of the Mississippi \nRiver and tributaries: Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, \nMississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee.\n  Regretfully, nonemergency porkbarrel spending continues unabated. For \nexample, this bill contains $2.5 million provided in one of last year's \nappropriations bills dedicated for a cooperative agreement with the \nNational Defense Center of Excellence for Research in Ocean Services to \nconduct coral mapping--coral mapping--in the waters of the Hawaiian \nIslands and the surrounding exclusive economic zone; $10 million for \nflood recovery efforts due to flooding in southern West Virginia, \neastern Kentucky, and southwestern Virginia; of the $100 million for \nwatershed and flood prevention operations, $73 million is for recovery \nactivities related to disasters occurring during fiscal year 2002, up \nto and including flooding in Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Virginia, \nand West Virginia; and $50 million for building and facilities \nconstruction of the National Animal Disease Laboratory at Ames, IA. Let \nme repeat that one: $50 million for building and facilities \nconstruction of the National Animal Disease Laboratory naturally \ndesignated at Ames, IA.\n\n  The surpluses we relied on last year have largely disappeared due to \nthe recession, the war on terrorism, and the tax cuts enacted last \nyear.\n  It is unfortunate that in a time of war, my colleagues cannot curb \ntheir appetite for nonemergency, wasteful spending. At this moment, the \nnational interest must prevail over State or local parochial concerns, \nbut as the farm bill attests, this message has not gotten through to \nCongress.\n  Let there be no doubt that this will be a long war. Therefore, we \nshould not frivolously spend today as if there is no tomorrow. When \ntomorrow comes, we must have the fiscal resources to fight this war to \nvictory.\n  As a member of an authorizing committee, I have several concerns \nabout this bill. One is the Aviation Loan Guarantee Program, which I \nhave previously discussed.\n  The bill takes $100 million out of the airport and airway trust fund \nto reimburse airports for costs associated with new security \nrequirements imposed on or after September 11. There was no statutory \nauthorization to use the trust fund for such purposes, and this funding \nwas not requested by the President.\n  Again, without authorization, we will shift $100 million out of the \nairport and airway trust fund to reimburse airports for costs \nassociated with new security requirements imposed on or after September \n11.\n  The reason there is no statutory authorization for this is that the \nairports are planning to use this money and have already probably \ndesignated a lot of it for airport improvements.\n\n[[Page S4937]]\n\n  The bill also provides $15 million to rehabilitate and extend the \nservice life of the FAA's inventory of certain long-range radars. \nAlthough the Appropriations Committee asserts this appropriation is in \nresponse to a Department of Defense request, this funding has not been \nrequested by the President and should not be included in this bill.\n  Continued funding for these radars, which were scheduled to be \ndecommissioned this year, is a significant policy change. It should be \nexamined by the agency of jurisdiction and the FAA before funding is \nallocated.\n  In the aftermath of September 11, Congress made a commitment to the \nairline industry that we would address their needs collectively, not \npiecemeal, as I described.\n  This bill includes several other items that are more appropriately \nwithin the Senate Commerce Committee's jurisdiction. However, the \nrelationship between funding these items and fighting the war on \nterrorism is also questionable.\n  Under the Fisheries Finance Program account, this bill provides $5 \nmillion for individual quota fishing loans and $19 million for \ntraditional loans under the Direct Loan Program authorized by the \nMerchant Marine Act of 1926. These authorizations were not even \nconsidered by the Commerce Committee. With some limited exceptions, \nindividual quota programs are not allowed under current law. Therefore, \nthis funding will only help fisheries where a quota program already \nexists, such as a halibut fishery in Alaska.\n  If someone can explain to me how fishing loans have anything to do \nwith responding to the terrorist attacks on our Nation, as this bill \nsuggests, please do so. I eagerly await the explanation.\n  In fact, there is a moratorium on any new quota program being put in \nplace before October 1. So there is not even a need for this \nauthorizing provision. While this was included in the President's \nrequest, further investigation has shown that this provision is not \nneeded.\n  This bill also amends the Oceans Act of 2000 to extend the deadline \nof the ocean commission's report by an additional 11 months. The Oceans \nAct was drafted by the Commerce Committee, and any amendments to it \nshould have originated there. But, again, the committee was not even \nconsulted.\n  Furthermore, this bill gives $55 million to Amtrak for ``emergency \nexpenses.'' Of that amount, $23 million is earmarked for fleet \noverhauls and repairs, $20 million is earmarked for repairs of railcars \ndamaged in a series of recent accidents, and $12 million is earmarked \nto cover security costs incurred by Amtrak since September 11. None of \nthis funding was requested by the administration.\n  Moreover, while the Senate Commerce Committee approved S. 1550, the \nRail Security Act of 2001, that measure has yet to be considered by the \nfull Senate. That bill is intended to address Amtrak security and \nemergency tunnel life safety needs.\n  While funding for legitimate safety and security expenditures is \nappropriate, funding for fleet overhauls and repairs is not emergency \nfunding. In fact, most of this funding, $43 million of the $55 million, \nis included in Amtrak's grant request for the next fiscal year, so the \nfunding is obviously not an emergency that should be addressed as part \nof this bill.\n  Overhauls of passenger equipment are a standard part of Amtrak's \nmaintenance program. In fact, in Amtrak's grant request to Congress for \nfiscal year 2003, Amtrak describes overhauls as ``a basic level of \nmaintenance to its fleet to ensure that repairs are made for normal \nwear and tear on nonsafety critical fleet components.'' Amtrak \nrequested these funds for next year. Funds needed in a future year are \nnot an emergency and should not be in this bill.\n  Of the amount for damaged passenger equipment repairs which would \ncover 51 cars and 5 locomotives, most of the equipment damage was \nincurred years ago. In one case, it occurred over 10 years ago. How can \na train or wreck more than 10 years ago constitute an emergency repair \nneed? In fact, over half the money requested for emergency repairs is \nfor equipment wrecked before 2001.\n  The most egregious fact about this Amtrak funding is that to pay for \na portion of it, the appropriators are rescinding $25 million from the \nState Department's budget for international peacekeeping activities. \nGet this: We are now taking $25 million from international \npeacekeeping, at a time when there are enormous problems and challenges \nthroughout the world, to devote that money to routine repairs for \nAmtrak cars. Remarkable.\n  These funds would otherwise be released with congressional passage of \nthe State Department reauthorization bill to support worldwide \npeacekeeping activities. I find it impossible to understand how the \nappropriators can consider nonemergency funding for Amtrak to be a \nhigher priority than funds for international peacekeeping already \nappropriated in fiscal year 2001.\n  The bill provides $200 million to the Secretary of Transportation to \nmake grants to improve security at our Nation's seaports. This funding \nwould be in addition to the $93.3 million that was already provided in \nthe Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act 2002 that was enacted \nlast fall.\n  While the Senate has passed S. 1214, the Port and Maritime Security \nAct, to authorize $80 million annually for port security grants, that \nlegislation has not yet been enacted.\n  This bill provides $27.9 million for the deployment of Operation \nSafety Commerce, an unauthorized program that is intended to address \nsecurity vulnerabilities associated with intermodal containers. I \nstrongly support increased security at our Nation's seaports. This \nprogram is duplicative of other efforts currently underway at the \nDepartment of Transportation and U.S. Customs.\n  The bill also directs pilot projects to be carried out involving, \nquote, the three largest container load centers in the United States, \nwhich are assumed by the appropriators to be the port centers of \nSeattle-Tacoma, New York-New Jersey, and Los Angeles-Long Beach. This \ndirective fails to give any consideration to which ports are most \nvulnerable or pose a risk to national security.\n  The bill provides $20 million for intercity bus security. While \nlegislation has been approved by the Commerce Committee to authorize \nfunding for intercity bus security, it has not been considered by the \nfull Senate. This bill ensures that funding distributed under the \nhighway trust fund for the upcoming fiscal year will be increased by at \nleast $4.4 billion over the President's request for fiscal year 2003. I \nthink we knew this funding would be provided even though the \nPresident's budget request actually fulfilled the requirements that so \nmany Members voted for when the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury was passed in 1998. But why does this provision need to be \nincluded in this supplemental?\n\n  A sample of other items under the Commerce Committee's jurisdiction \nthat significantly exceed the President's request include the \nfollowing: $85 million for emergency expenses resulting from the new \nhomeland security activities and increased security standards at the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST. Of that funding, \nthe bill directs $40 million for a cyber-security initiative. The \nPresident requested $4 million for NIST; $281.7 million over the \nPresident's request for the Coast Guard's acquisition, construction and \nimprovements account, but the appropriators have only provided a meager \nexplanation of this allocation which after review could not total \n$281.7 million; $300 million over the President's request for \ntransportation security administration; $745 million for emergency \nexpenses for FEMA in response to the September 11 attack. The President \nrequested $327 million, less than half the amount provided.\n  A snapshot of items not requested by the President for the fiscal \nyear 2002 supplemental includes the following: $450 million for \nelection reform grants; $23.4 million to address critical mapping and \ncharting backlog requirements with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA; and $3 million to enhance the National Water \nLevel Observation Network. Even though it falls within the jurisdiction \nof the Commerce Committee, the Commerce Committee was not consulted and \nthe provision's relation to emergency homeland security needs is \nsuspect; $16 million for economic assistance to New England fishermen \nand fishing communities in response to unforeseen circumstances \nresulting from\n\n[[Page S4938]]\n\na Federal court order which restricts the number of days fishermen can \nfish; $10 million for NOAA for such things as backup capability of \nsatellite services and a supercomputer backup.\n  The bill changes the Advanced Technology Program which currently \nimposes a ceiling of $60.7 million on the amount of new grants that can \nbe awarded by the end of the fiscal year to establishing a floor of \n$60.7 million that can be awarded in any new grants by the end of the \nfiscal year; $1.725 million for the International Trade Administration. \nITA has already received a substantial increase in funding during the \nlast few appropriations cycles.\n  The appropriators' practice of legislating on items within the \njurisdiction of the Commerce Committee knows no bounds. This bill would \nprohibit the use of funds to implement, enforce, or otherwise abide by \nthe memorandum of understanding between the Federal Trade Commission \nand the Department of Justice that was signed March 5, 2002.\n  Again, the test whether we are acting responsibly is simple. Just \nread the title of the bill. This bill is the ``Further Recovery From \nand Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States.'' Any item that \nis not for this purpose should not be in this bill.\n  Using the guise of responding to the terrorist acts of September 11 \nto spend Federal funds on items that obviously have nothing to do with \nfighting terrorism is war profiteering, pure and simple. Such actions \ndo not help the war effort but only do a disservice to the honorable \nmen and women who are on the front line fighting this war.\n  Again, I am very pleased that one of our first actions is to remove \none of the most egregious aspects of this bill, and that is the basic \nemasculation of the Aviation Loan and Stabilization Program. Why it was \never in the bill, of course, escapes my understanding. Perhaps it was \ngoing to be one of those deals that would be done, as is so often on \nthese appropriations bills, in such a way that no one would notice, \nwhich is the general way that porkbarrel spending ends up enacted into \nlaw. So I am pleased we are going to act on it and, of course, we need \nto have a recorded vote on it to ensure that the will of the Senate is \nclearly expressed as this bill would go to conference with the other \nbody.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, at the outset, let me say I agree with \nmy distinguished colleague from Arizona about striking section 1004. \nThe purpose for my seeking recognition has been to address that \nsubject.\n  The Congress acted promptly, after September 11, to provide for $10 \nbillion in loan guarantees because the airlines were hit in a very \ndrastic manner. Obviously, after the attack on the World Trade Towers, \nthe striking of the Pentagon, and the plane which went down in Somerset \nCounty, PA, my home State, air traffic stopped instantly. In fact, for \nseveral days you could not fly at all. The FAA grounded all the planes.\n  With the closing of Reagan National Airport, a major airport in the \nUnited States, US Airways, which is hubbed in my State, Pennsylvania, \nwas very heavily impacted. It was very difficult. So Congress acted to \nprovide for $10 billion in loan guarantees.\n  When this provision was put in section 1004, which limited the \nguarantees to $4 billion and not more than $429 million from being \nspent in fiscal year 2002, it sent shudders through the airline \nindustry, including US Airways in Pennsylvania.\n  US Airways is a great national and international carrier, very \nimportant for the United States generally, but of particular importance \nto Pennsylvania where there are some 17,000 US Airways employees, with \nhubs in Pittsburgh and in Philadelphia. When US Airways was having \nproblems immediately after September 11, Mr. Stephen Wolf, Chairman of \nUS Airways, called me and others in the Pennsylvania delegation to \nsecure our help, which we provided. US Airways had not planned to make \nan immediate request for a loan but decided to defer until this summer \nwhen they are moving to reorganize the company.\n  Yesterday, while I was traveling in Pennsylvania, I received a call \nthat US Airways had asked me to introduce the amendment to strike \nsection 1004. I immediately agreed to take the lead. Later in the day, \nI heard that the amendment would be authored by Senator Hollings, the \nchairman of the Commerce Committee, and Senator McCain, ranking member, \nwith the Aviation Subcommittee chairs joining to give it the impact of \nthe full Commerce Committee which has authorization and jurisdiction. I \nam pleased to note this morning that Senator Byrd, chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, and Senator Stevens, the ranking member, have \nundertaken the amendment, which shows how the issue has escalated in a \nvery brief period of time.\n  For a while it was very onerous and very worrisome. Last week, during \nthe recess, I traveled the State. I was in Pittsburgh, where 11,000 of \nthe 17,000 Pennsylvania employees work. There was great consternation \nas to what would happen to US Airways. When I was in Erie, there was a \nsimilar concern. There was a similar concern in Altoona, a concern in \nAllentown, a concern in Wilkes-Barre, and a concern in Scranton.\n  That is good news indeed, and not just to US Airways, but also other \ncarriers, with the expectation that United may be applying for a \nsubstantial loan guarantee of $2 billion, and US Airways at $1 billion. \nHad this loan guarantee not been available, it would have been at a \nparticularly bad time to US Airways, which is trying to restructure the \nentire airline. There has been a very difficult situation regarding \ncashflow this year.\n  I am very pleased to see this amendment has been offered by the \nchairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. That has \nbeen done with their awareness of the tremendous impact it would have \non the Nation when we had legislation to provide $10 billion in loan \nguarantees, that it should stand, and there had been reliance by the \nairline industry on those loan guarantees being available. So this \namendment will obviously solve that problem.\n  We still have to go to conference with the House, which, as I \nunderstand it, prohibits loan guarantees until fiscal year 2003, but \nwould not reduce the overall amount of the loan guarantees available.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, in the absence of any other Senator in \nthe Chamber, if no one is seeking recognition to talk about the bill, I \nask unanimous consent I may proceed for up to 10 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have sought recognition to talk \nbriefly about a United States-Syria dialogue, which was held two weeks \nago at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice \nUniversity in Houston, Texas. I attended the conference, characterized \nas a dialogue. It was directed at trying to find some way of improving \nUnited States-Syria relations. Quite naturally, the conversation \nfocused on terrorism.\n  I have had the opportunity to visit Syria on many occasions since the \nmid-1980s and have always believed that Syria was a key to a \ncomprehensive settlement in the Middle East. During the course of those \nvisits, I came to know President Hafez al-Assad. I saw, with almost \nyearly visits from the late 1980s until I attended President Assad's \nfuneral in June 2000, a subtle but decisive shift in Syrian thinking so \nthat Syria did attend the Madrid Conference in 1991. Syria was engaged \nin very extensive discussions with Israel at a time when Prime Minister \nRabin was in office. Those negotiations were conducted in a somewhat \ncurious way, through President Bill Clinton. Syrians would not talk \ndirectly to the Israelis. The Israelis made efforts to talk directly to \nthe Syrians. However, whatever format those negotiations took, they \ncame very close to an agreement, with Israel committing to a return of\n\n[[Page S4939]]\n\nthe Golan Heights. Security arrangements had not been quite worked out \nand the precise boundary form had not been laid, but they were very \nclose.\n  Regrettably, with the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin and with \nother leadership in Israel, there was a time when the relationship was \nvery difficult. In 1996, the Syrians had some maneuvers on their border \nnear Israel at a time when Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel \nwould hold Syria accountable for what was happening with Hezbollah in \nsouthern Lebanon. At any rate, the peace talks disintegrated.\n  When I had a chance to visit the new President, Bashar al-Assad, in \nMarch 2002, I suggested to him while the time might be not exactly \nright now, with the problems with Israel and the Palestinian Authority, \nthose negotiations ought to be resumed at an early date. I reported \nthat conversation to President George W. Bush and made the suggestion \nthat President Bush might be determinative and influential, as \nPresident Clinton had been. While no commitment was made, that is \nsomething that would be considered by the Bush Administration when the \ntime was right.\n  Edward Djerejian had been Ambassador to Syria, and when he visited \nPresident Bashar al-Assad early this year, he had a discussion with \nPresident al-Assad about having this United States-Syrian dialogue, and \nthe James A. Baker III Institute hosted it. Former Ambassador Djerejian \nis the executive director there. Their plan is to have another Syrian-\nUnited States dialogue in the fall. I made the suggestion to the \nSyrians in attendance, former Secretary of State James Baker, who \nattended, and also former Ambassador Djerejian, that a good time to \nschedule another dialogue would be right after the elections this \nNovember, perhaps the Thursday following the Tuesday election. That is \nabout the only time Members of Congress are somewhat uncommitted. I \nreceived a comment that they might be willing to consider that. So, in \naddition to the Presiding Officer, any of my colleagues who may be \nlistening on C-SPAN, may reserve the Thursday after the elections to \njoin a congressional delegation to travel to Syria and participate in \nthese important discussions.\n\n  Regrettably, Damascus has not been a hot spot on congressional \ntravel. However, I think that visits there could be very useful.\n  At the conference two weeks ago, the focus was in trying to define \nterrorism. It seems to me pretty clear that when civilians are \ntargeted, that constitutes terrorism and that is unacceptable. There is \na disagreement on that subject, a disagreement which I had with the \nIranian Ambassador to the United Nations, who visited Washington. I \nhosted a small dinner for him several months ago as part of an effort \nto have a visit by Parliamentarians from the House and Senate with the \nIranian Parliamentarians, a suggestion which goes on again, off again. \nIt is a little difficult right now with President Khatami responding in \nsomewhat of an unfriendly tone to some of what the administration has \nhad to say about Iran being part of the ``axis of evil.''\n  At any rate, the Iranian Ambassador to the UN emphasized the point \nthat he thought Hezbollah had a right to undertake military activities \nagainst the Israelis because of what he terms ``the occupation.'' It is \na discussion which needs a lot of work. I think ultimately there can be \na definition of terrorism to include attacks on civilians.\n  However, the issue of having a dialogue is one which is very \nimportant. The three-day session in Houston was closed to the press, \nbut I think it is within the bounds to comment that terrorism was the \nfocus of attention. It is always salutary when people get together and \ntalk. It is my hope that we can have some influence on Syrian \nactivities, having Hamas and Hezbollah and other organizations, which \nwe consider terrorist organizations and on the terrorist list, to have \nthem ultimately ousted.\n  There has been a recognition by the State Department about Syria's \nhelp on al-Qaida. There has been a recognition that Syrian assistance \nhas, in fact, saved American lives. Much, much more needs to be done, \nbut the dialogue at the James Baker Institute is a good start. If we \ncould get a significant congressional delegation to go to Damascus in \nthe fall, I think it would help that very important effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND.

Madam President, when the shocking events of September 11 \nhit us, we all realized that major changes had occurred. The \ndevastation and the death that was visited by the terrorists were truly \nshocking. But there was collateral damage as well in many areas. We are \nseeing small businesses that have been put out of business. We have \nworked hard to try to help them.\n  But, obviously, one of the most severely affected areas of our \neconomy--really, the lifeline of our Nation's transportation system--\nthe airline industry, was severely hurt by this action. Not only did we \nshut down flights for a period of days, which cost the airlines \nliterally billions of dollars, their insurance rates skyrocketed and \nput them at risk. And when you put the airline industry at risk, you \nput all of us at risk because ours is a very mobile country that \ndepends upon a healthy, competitive airline industry.\n  I came to the floor on September 13 to urge my colleagues to take \nimmediate action. Well, people in both Houses shared that view, and we \ndid act. We adopted critical legislation to ensure that our airlines \ncould continue to operate even as their insurance rates skyrocketed. \nThis was a successful approach.\n  Then we embarked on another approach. We said we would set up a $10 \nbillion loan guarantee program to provide assistance to airlines that \nwere doing well, that were ``taking off,'' so to speak, but whose cash \nshortfall was exacerbated by the shutdown and the slow return of \nairline passengers. That $10 billion loan guarantee program sounded \nlike a good idea.\n  We should support this amendment that tries to preserve the full \ncommitment we made to our airlines and to the traveling American \npublic.\n  Now, we have a problem, specifically with the ATSB--that fine group \nof Federal servants--that decide what airlines get the money. So far, I \nthink there have been seven applications; and they have only granted \none. Even if all the applications were granted, I understand that $10 \nbillion would be more than enough to cover them.\n  I have had a real problem because we have a fine, growing airline, a \nnew airline in Kansas City, called Vanguard Airlines. So far, the ATSB \nhas formally denied three loan applications submitted by Vanguard. \nActually, they have only approved one. That was for America West. We \nare very glad that our colleagues who fly on America West and the \npeople served by America West will be helped.\n  The intent of this program was to help airlines such as America West \nand, I believe, such as Vanguard. When you look at the facts, Vanguard \nactually stacks up better than America West when you consider the \nnecessary criteria. The airline was growing rapidly and consistently \nprior to September 11. The airline is trying to get back on its feet, \nhas recently made new hires, is getting back on a growth track. It is \nincreasing routes and hiring people. They wanted a private loan package \nthat would allow them to purchase more aircraft, more Boeing MD-90s.\n  When I talked with one of the officials at ATSB, they said: Well, we \ndon't have any collateral. If you don't have collateral, and you are \ngoing to use the loan to buy an airplane, guess from where the \ncollateral is going to come? They are even bringing in equity funding \nthat would come in with the loan if it were granted. If we fail to do \nthat, the potential ripple effect will not only be on the airline \nindustry but\n\n[[Page S4940]]\n\non the entire Kansas City metropolitan area where Vanguard has become a \nmajor employer in the area.\n\n  I am reminded of a very old and very troubling definition. A friend \nof mine once said: A banker is a guy who loans you an umbrella and \ntakes it back when it rains. If this loan fund were to be made \navailable solely on the criteria by which a bank would issue a loan, we \nwould not need it. If these airlines are healthy enough to go out and \nget loans--and many of them are--then they do not need the loan \nguarantee package.\n  We set up criteria which should be observed, but somehow those \ncriteria have resulted in denying everybody except America West a loan.\n  I hope we adopt this amendment by the distinguished chairman and \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee to knock out the \nrescission because we want to make sure airlines that are healthy, that \nhave a good record, that have the potential to grow, are not killed in \ntheir infancy because of the cashflow problems, the insurance problems, \nand the short-term lack of confidence in airline travel that came about \nas a result of September 11.\n  I say to our friends who serve on the ATSB, we appropriated this \nmoney, we made available these loan guarantees for one simple purpose; \nand that is, to loan the money to airlines that could otherwise not \nstay in business and that would not meet bankable loan standards.\n  This is extremely important to the airline industry. It is important \nto my constituents in Kansas City. I hope we will support the \namendment, and I strongly hope that one of these days they will figure \nout how to provide money to airlines that may not have bankable loan \ncapabilities but which have the growth and which have the potential to \nget back on their feet after the tragedy of September 11.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to speak in favor of the \namendment. I had the same amendment already drafted. I am the ranking \nmember of the Aviation Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee. I was \nalarmed when I heard what had happened with regard to the fund that we \nset aside to stabilize the aviation industry. So I thank Senator Byrd \nand Senator Stevens for making this accommodation, for offering this \namendment. And I certainly want to be made a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, our aviation industry lost thousands \nof jobs right after September 11, but it could have been hundreds of \nthousands if we had not come in and stabilized that industry. Because \nof repercussions in other parts of the tourism industry--in the hotel \nindustry, the rental car industry--so many other parts of our economy \nthat are dependent on tourism would also have fallen. So we did the \nright thing.\n  It is essential that Congress keep its commitment. The deadline is \nJune 28. And there can be applications. US Airways is said to be \nlooking at perhaps making an application. America West already has a \nloan. There may be other airlines. They need to know that when Congress \npasses a law, they have the right to believe that law is going to be \ncarried out and deadlines will be met.\n  If we revoked that deadline and said, if you have not come in now, we \nare going to take the money away, I think it would be a tragedy. So I \nthink this is definitely the right approach.\n  It is also essential that the traveling public and the banking \ncommunity know that the airline industry is going to be secured. Today, \nmost airports are reporting about 90 percent of the traffic they had at \nthis time last year. That is phenomenal after what happened on \nSeptember 11: the cataclysmic event and the impact on our economy. That \nwe are back to 90 percent I believe is the result of the airlines, the \nairports, the people of our country supporting our economy, and also \nCongress stabilizing the airlines, and then, secondly, coming in with \nthe aviation security that assured the traveling public that everything \nwas going to be done to secure these airlines. We are well on the way \nto securing airports and airlines. We have a way to go; there is no \ndoubt about that. Those two factors have stabilized the industry.\n\n  We are not out of the woods. June 28 is 3 weeks away. We need to \nallow that time for companies already in the process of making their \napplications. It is a pretty arduous process. We are not just \nguaranteeing loans that don't have any substantiation or any reason to \nbelieve that they would be able to be repaid, but we are guaranteeing \nloans, as we said we would, for a company that meets the very stringent \ncriteria.\n  I hope this amendment passes overwhelmingly. I believe it will. I \ncertainly appreciate that we have gone forward to put this amendment in \nplace. I thank Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens for immediately acting \nwhen it became known that this was actually going to cut off companies \nthat were in the process that could then go into bankruptcy and cause a \nrippling effect throughout the economy.\n  We want to support US Air and any other airlines that might want to \ncome in that meet the criteria. We want to try to keep our aviation \nindustry stable as we go into vacation time, the summer months, so that \nhopefully by September 11, 2002, we will have a good report for the \npeople of America that our economy has been stabilized and that the \naviation and tourism industry are a part of that. This amendment will \nbe one more step in that direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 5 minutes on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment. The \namendment, introduced by Senators Byrd and Stevens, is a logical one \nrelating to the aviation loan guarantee language in the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill. As my colleagues might recollect, \nlast year we voted unanimously to extend an immediate cash infusion and \nloan guarantees to airlines struggling as a result of the September 11, \n2001 attacks and the resulting closure of the nationwide aviation \nnetwork. I wish to associate myself with the remarks of Senator \nHutchison of Texas and Senator Bond of Missouri in their views and \nstatements on the history.\n  Access to these funds is necessary for many airlines to continue \noperation and vital to the future of our nationwide aviation network.\n  My colleagues might recollect that all of our airports were shut down \nfor several days, but one in particular, Reagan National Airport, \nstayed closed for an extended period of time. Even today, commercial \naviation is still getting up to full capacity and general aviation is \nstill shut down. I hope that soon will change with some reasonable \nregulations for private or general aviation.\n  With the phased reopening over many months of Reagan National \nAirport, there was one airline, US Airways, which was particularly \nadversely affected. US Airways intends to work through all of the \nrequirements they have with labor and management and put forward an \napplication for the loan guarantee program in an effort to avoid \nbankruptcy.\n  The proposed language, in limiting the total funds available and \neliminating any more loans for 2002, would be truly detrimental to the \nsurvival of this airline and very possibly other major carriers. The \nlanguage in the bill, in this present form, represents a broken \npromise.\n  There was a time frame for which airlines, if they wanted to avail \nthemselves of this assistance, would be able to make that effort. It is \nnot easy to go through the whole loan guarantee process. To change the \ndeadline at this point would clearly be a breach of trust and very \nunwise. When we passed the stabilization bill, the airlines were given \nuntil June 28, 2002 to apply for these loans. The funds were to be \navailable through the end of the year.\n  I applaud the work of my colleagues in addressing this proposed \ninjustice and appreciate the amendment offered by the chairman, Senator \nByrd, and Senator Stevens. I urge all Senators to vote for the \namendment.\n  The amendment will not only correct an error, but will also provide \nthe opportunity for our nation's air carriers,\n\n[[Page S4941]]\n\nas they try to address the aviation security quandary in a much better \nway than is currently being done, to protect the jobs of tens of \nthousands of hard-working Americans. We are also trying to keep \ncompetition in aviation and trying to get Americans and America's \nairways flying again.\n  I thank my colleagues and urge their support for this very important \namendment for jobs, for the commercial aviation industry, and for the \ntraveling public. This amendment also puts the Senate on record as \nkeeping our word to this very important part of our economy.\n  Thank you and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Byrd-Stevens \namendment that would protect the funding for the airline financial \nsupport program established by the Air Transportation Safety and System \nStabilization Act of 2001.\n  Congress and the President moved swiftly after September 11, 2001 \nterrorist attacks to provide the airline industry with critical \nfinancial support to avoid a crisis in our national transportation \nnetwork and in our economy.\n  The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act signed \ninto law on September 22, 2001 was designed to give airlines access to \nup to $15 billion in assistance. It included $5 billion for direct aid \nto pay for industry losses associated with the results of the World \nTrade Center and Pentagon attacks. It also included $10 billion for \nloan guarantees.\n  The Fiscal Year 2002 supplemental appropriations bill which we are \ndebating this week would have reduced the size of the loan guarantee \nprovision to $4 billion. The Byrd-Stevens amendment before the Senate \nfor consideration this afternoon would strike the provision in the \nsupplemental and restore the program to the full $10 billion level.\n  I voted for the legislation that established this important financial \nassistance program in order to ensure the financial viability of the \nairline industry--which generates 3 percent of the gross domestic a \nproduct, almost $273 billion. There is no question as to the \nsignificance of airline service not only to our quality of life, but \nalso our national economy. In my home state of Maine, over 56,000 jobs, \n$1.29 billion in payroll, and $3.73 billion in sales are tied to the \navailability of scheduled commercial air service.\n  In the wake of the attacks of September 11, thousands of airline \nemployees lost their jobs and remain laid-off. Most major airlines \ncontinue to operate more limited schedules than before September 11. \nUnited Airlines and American Airlines both announced layoffs of 20,000 \npersonnel and schedule reductions of about 20 percent.\n  The airlines have begun to re-hire some employees and restore \nservice, but we are still not where we were prior to September 11. \nApproximately 750 to 1,000 aircraft that were in operation before the \nterrorist attacks are out of service to this day.\n  According to the Air Transport Association, the airlines suffered \nlosses of about $1.4 billion during the aviation system lockdown that \nfollowed the tragic events of September 11. And they have continued to \nlose money. Before September 11, the airline industry was expected to \nlose $1 to $2 billion in 2001. In the aftermath of September 11, the \nlosses exceeded $7 billion, and could have been even worse if not for \nthe financial assistance package passed by Congress and signed by the \nPresident.\n  US Airways, the only commercial carrier to serve all six of Maine's \ncommercial airports, warns that without the loan guarantees, it may be \nforced into bankruptcy. US Airways is a major carrier providing service \nalong the Northeast corridor, and with some hub operations based at \nRonald Reagan Washington National Airport, suffered significantly as a \nresult of increased security requirements and reduced service levels to \nWashington.\n  I think the numbers speak for themselves. I believe it is critical \nthat we restore this funding, and I urge my colleagues to join in a \nstrong show of support of this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to thank our distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, and Senator \nStevens for this amendment, which is so very important to tens of \nthousands of airline industry employees across the country.\n  This amendment will restore the integrity of the loan guarantee fund \nwe established in the Air Transportation and System Stabilization Act \nof 2001, and ensure that airlines suffering from the continued effects \nof September 11 will be able to remain strong and competitive.\n  I greatly appreciate the efforts of Senator Byrd and Stevens to put \nthe U.S. Senate on record with this issue as the fiscal year 2002 \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill moves to conference with the \nHouse of Representatives. Their leadership is so very important, \nbecause the House bill has a provision that would cripple the loan \nguarantee fund, a provision that may well bankrupt more than one major \nU.S. air carrier.\n  I also want to recognize the thousands of airline industry workers \nwho made their voices heard on this issue over the Memorial Day recess. \nThese workers united in a most impressive way to lobby on behalf of \ntheir companies. I found their commitment inspiring, and I want to \ncongratulate them on this great victory they have won on the Senate \nfloor today.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I support the Byrd-Stevens amendment, \nwhich will preserve the loan guarantee program that we established last \nyear.\n  We acted swiftly and in a bipartisan fashion to respond to the \nSeptember 11 attacks.\n  We authorized the use of force, we appropriated funds to start \nrebuilding, we bolstered security efforts, and we took important action \nto assist the aviation industry.\n  As part of our initiative to promote the ongoing stability of the \naviation industry, we created the Air Transportation Stabilization \nBoard, ATSB, to ensure that airlines would continue to have access to \ncapital.\n  Now, after the ATSB has approved just one airline's application, the \nbill before us is seeking to impose new limits on this extremely \nimportant program.\n  I think this is unwise, and I am supporting this amendment to strike \nthese new limits from the bill.\n  When we enacted the airline stabilization bill last year we \nessentially made a promise of assistance to struggling airlines.\n  Limiting this program now would be unfair to airlines that are \ncounting on it to help them in their efforts to regain sound financial \nfooting.\n  One airline that is particularly in need of assistance is Kansas \nCity-based Vanguard Airlines.\n  As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I understand how \nimportant low-fare competitors are in our aviation system.\n  As a low-fare airline operating out of Kansas City, Vanguard \ncontributes substantially to keeping airfares competitive in Kansas \nCity and throughout the Midwest.\n  Not only did September 11 have a devastating financial impact on \nVanguard, but it severely limited the company's ability to obtain \nprivate financing as well.\n  Vanguard's approximately 1,000 employees have been fighting \ndiligently to improve the company's financial standing.\n  But securing additional capital is absolutely essential to the \ncompany's long-term health.\n  I have been extremely frustrated and disappointed by the ATSB's \nreluctance to approve Vanguard's application.\n  I am committed to ensuring that the loan guarantee program is \nmaintained in its current form.\n  Moreover, I plan to continue working with Vanguard as it re-submits \nits application in an effort to achieve a positive outcome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4941-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4941-S4955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that motion \non the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent all first-degree \namendments on H.R. 4775 be filed by today at 5 p.m. except a managers' \namendment, an amendment by Senator Byrd, and an amendment by Senator \nStevens, or their designee; and any second-degree amendments be \nrelevant to the first degree to which offered, or deal with offsets for \nthe first degree; that upon disposition of all amendments the bill be \nread the third time, the Senate vote on passage of the bill, and upon \npassage, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with \nthe House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, without \nintervening action or debate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I will be objecting for \nseveral reasons. One is that just today we received from the \nadministration a statement of administration policy. I will read from \nit: If the supplemental appropriations bill were presented to the \nPresident in its current form, the senior advisers would recommend that \nhe veto the bill.\n  In this message, there are a number of specific items that the \nPresident mentions in his message. We will--at least I and the Senator \nfrom Texas and others will--try to come forward with a package of \namendments that comports with the President's statements. There are a \nnumber of specifics in there, many of which we already discovered, some \nwe haven't.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator be able to have that letter from the \nadministration made a part of the Record?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the President's statement of \nadministration policy dated 4 June 2002 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 2002.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n S. 2551--Making Supplemental Appropriations for Further Recovery From \n    and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States, FY 2002\n\n       This Statement of Administration Policy provides the \n     Administration's views on the FY 2002 Emergency Supplemental \n     Bill as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n       While the Senate Committee bill funds the Defense request \n     at the President's level, it exceeds the President's request \n     for other programs by more than $4 billion and funds numerous \n     lower priority non-emergency programs as ``emergency'' needs. \n     The Administration strongly opposes this bill and also would \n     strongly oppose any amendment to further increase spending \n     above the President's request. For instance, the recently \n     enacted Farm Bill provides an historically high level of \n     agriculture spending that can accommodate funding for \n     emergencies, economic assistance, rural development, and \n     other purposes. The Administration supported the Farm Bill to \n     ensure farmers have the resources they need. The Farm Bill \n     breaks the bad fiscal habit of needing to pass emergency \n     agricultural spending bills including drought assistance and \n     other supplemental payments that make it difficult for \n     Congress to live within its budget leading to uncertainty for \n     farmers, ranchers and their creditors. The Administration \n     strongly opposes any new agriculture spending.\n       In addition, the bill severely constrains the President's \n     ability to fund emergency homeland requirements by compelling \n     him to release non-emergency money provided in the bill. If \n     the supplemental appropriations bill were presented to the \n     President in its current form, his senior advisers would \n     recommend that he veto the bill.\n     Overall Funding Level\n       The proposals for emergency funding included in the \n     President's request were crafted to provide critical \n     resources to support the war on terrorism, secure the \n     homeland, and help dislocated workers as the Nation continues \n     to recover and rebuild following the September 11, 2001, \n     terrorist attacks. It is important to note that Congress has \n     already provided $40 billion since September 11th and only \n     half of those funds have been spent. The President's FY 2002 \n     emergency supplemental request was targeted at this year's \n     immediate emergency needs and funding in addition to this \n     request is not warranted at this time.\n       The Senate bill includes scores of unneeded items that \n     total billions of dollars--all classified as an \n     ``emergency.'' The bill adds unrequested funds for numerous \n     programs and projects throughout nearly all of the Federal \n     agencies. While some of these items relate to homeland \n     security, many do not, including: $11 million to the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for economic \n     assistance to New England fishermen and fishing \n     communities; $26.8 million for the U.S. Geological Survey \n     for urban mapping activities; $2 million for the \n     Smithsonian to begin design of an alcohol storage facility \n     for specimens away from the Mall (President's FY 2003 \n     Budget already includes funding for this project in FY \n     2003); and, a directive for the Department of Energy to \n     construct duplicate waste treatment plants in Ohio and \n     Kentucky that will cost at least $100 million more than \n     necessary. In addition, without regard to the quality of \n     the awards, the bill requires $26 million more new \n     Advanced Technology Program awards than the Administration \n     recommends for 2002. These awards are not related to \n     homeland security needs, may not meet the Federal \n     Government's standard of peer review, and over their \n     duration are likely to cost the government over $75 \n     million.\n       While the Administration is pleased that the Senate \n     Committee provided $1 billion of the $1.3 billion needed to \n     finance the Pell grant shortfall, the Administration objects \n     to the provision that designates these funds as an \n     ``emergency.'' The Administration urges the Senate to follow \n     the House's lead and offset this funding. The Administration \n     will continue to work with Congress to identify offsets \n     necessary to finance this and any other non-emergency \n     activities that have not been fully paid for in the bill.\n       The Administration believes the funding requested for \n     assistance to Colombia is crucial to support the struggle \n     against drugs and terrorism in that country. The reductions \n     in funding and the restrictions on the requested expansion of \n     counternarcotics authorities in Colombia will impede the \n     Administration's prospects of defeating these twin threats.\n     Homeland Security Needs\n       While the Senate Committee bill fully funds the President's \n     request for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), \n     the Senate version of the bill provides $2.6 billion more \n     than the Administration requested for homeland security-\n     related funding. This funding could not possibly be obligated \n     in the remaining months of this fiscal year, and therefore is \n     not an emergency.\n       The Senate bill provides $175 million in new, unrequested \n     funding for the Agriculture Department for research, \n     inspection, and monitoring activities related to \n     bioterrorism. Significant resources have already been \n     provided through the Emergency Response Fund (ERF) as well as \n     in the FY 2003 President's Budget request. For example, \n     funding provided for the construction and renovation of an \n     Ames, Iowa facility is redundant because a total of $90 \n     million has been provided for FY 2002 as part of the ERF and \n     regular appropriations, so that additional funding is not \n     needed in FY 2002 and FY 2003.\n\n[[Page S4943]]\n\n       The Senate Committee also added $100 million for nuclear \n     non-proliferation activities for the National Nuclear \n     Security Agency (NNSA). It is not possible for NNSA to use \n     these funds in the remaining four months of the current \n     fiscal year. The Senate bill also provides $315 million in \n     unrequested funds for Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (CDC) buildings and facilities, including $278 \n     million for accelerated planning, design, and construction of \n     new facilities, of which $28 million is designated as \n     bioterrorism-related. CDC will not be able to obligate this \n     additional funding in FY 2002 since they may not even be \n     able to obligate all of the $250 million they already \n     received in FY 2002 for buildings and facilities. To date, \n     CDC has obligated approximately $18 million (7 percent) of \n     its FY 2002 funding. In addition, the appropriate analyses \n     have not yet been completed for many of these activities \n     making it unlikely that these funds would be spent until \n     well into FY 2003.\n       The bill also includes $85 million for the Justice \n     Department's COPS program to create a new grant program to \n     finance communications equipment for local first responder \n     agencies. Communications equipment is a major focus of the \n     $3.5 billion first responder initiative the President has \n     proposed for FEMA in his FY 2003 budget. The creation of a \n     new grant program for these purposes in the Department of \n     Justice runs counter to the Administration's proposal to \n     consolidate First Responder programs in FEMA, and in any \n     event is duplicative of efforts currently underway in the \n     Office of Justice Programs and FEMA.\n       The Administration also objects to the proposed creation of \n     a Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General for Counter-\n     terrorism. While well-intentioned, the creation of this \n     position would hinder, rather than enhance, the \n     Administration's counter-terrorism efforts by creating \n     another unnecessary layer of bureacracy. In addition, this \n     program would complicate recently announced restructuring \n     plans by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to enhance \n     counterterrorism efforts.\n     Restrictions on Presidential Authorities\n       The Senate version of the bill also unduly restricts the \n     President's prerogatives in numerous areas. First, it \n     requires the President to designate ``all or none'' of the \n     non-defense funding contained in the bill as an emergency. \n     The Budget Enforcement Act provides that the President retain \n     control over the release of emergency funds added by the \n     Congress to ensure that the funds respond to critical \n     emergency needs. By contravening this long-established budget \n     enforcement mechanism, the Senate would require the President \n     to waste taxpayers' dollars on low-priority, non-emergency \n     items in order to access vital high-priority homeland \n     security and recovery funding.\n       The Senate version of the bill also requires payment of $34 \n     million to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) by July \n     10, 2002. On May 26, 2002, a three-member team returned from \n     a two-week investigation of UNFPA activities in China, \n     designed to provide information relevant to the determination \n     whether UNFPA is in compliance with the Kemp-Kasten law \n     barring support for any program involving coercion. The team \n     is in the process of completing a report outlining their \n     findings. Thus the Senate version would remove the \n     flexibility provided to the President under P.L. 107-115, the \n     FY 2002 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, to weigh the \n     report's findings in his consideration of funding levels. As \n     has been U.S. policy and law since 1985, no support should be \n     provided to UNFPA if that organization's programs in China \n     support coercion.\n       In addition, the bill requires that the Director of \n     Homeland Security be confirmed by the Senate, and makes the \n     provision of $5 million in homeland security funding for the \n     White House contingent upon that confirmation. The \n     Administration recognizes Congress' need to \n     receive information on homeland security, and the \n     Administration to take all steps possible to ensure that \n     this is the case while protecting the confidentiality of \n     Presidential counsel. The President has said that the \n     initial structure for organizing and overseeing homeland \n     security may evolve over time and the National Strategy \n     Review now underway may recommend an arrangement different \n     from the current one. The Administration does not want to \n     prejudge the outcome of the review process and strongly \n     urges the Senate to drop this objectionable provision.\n       The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for \n     the $420 million in military assistance to Pakistan and \n     Jordan. However, we urge the Senate to provide these funds to \n     the Defense Department, as requested, to allow the Defense \n     Department to compensate coalition partners for costs \n     incurred directly related to support of U.S. military \n     operations in the way on terror. The Administration does not \n     believe the State Department should be held accountable for \n     managing or disbursing funds directly related to military \n     operations.\n     Assistance to Dislocated Workers\n       The Administration appreciates that the Committee provided \n     $400 million of the President's $750 million request to help \n     dislocated workers return to work. However, the \n     Administration is concerned that the Committee provided \n     insufficient funds for National Emergency Grants (NEGs); \n     provided an unrequested $80 million for State Dislocated \n     Worker formula grants; and did not provide adequate funds for \n     community economic adjustment and a targeted, high-growth job \n     training demonstration. The Administration looks forward to \n     working with the Senate to ensure that adequate assistance is \n     available to displaced workers, through National Emergency \n     Grants, and distressed communities to address higher \n     unemployment levels resulting from the recession.\n     New York\n       The Administration appreciates the Senate support for the \n     request for additional disaster relief efforts for New York \n     in response to the September 11th terrorist attacks. However, \n     we are concerned about language that expands FEMA's Mortgage \n     and Rental Assistance program and proposes to redirect $90 \n     million from FEMA to the Centers for Disease Control. The \n     Administration believes that the program expansion is \n     unnecessary because FEMA has sufficient authority to address \n     the needs of homeowners and renters and that the President's \n     full $2.75 billion request for FEMA is needed.\n     Funding for Global HIV/AIDS\n       The Administration appreciates the intent of the Senate in \n     recognizing this very important issue. The United States is \n     committed to providing a total of $500 million to the Global \n     Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) \n     and we look forward to continuing to work with the Congress \n     on this issue.\n       The Administration is committed to working with the \n     Congress to enact an emergency supplemental appropriations \n     bill as expeditiously as possible. The Administration looks \n     forward to working with the Senate to address its concerns.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am always intrigued by a managers' \namendment. Some of the greatest damage done around here is a \n``managers' amendment.''\n  The rest of the Members around here are supposed to file our \namendments but not managers' amendments. I will not agree to any \nunanimous consent agreement at any time unless a managers' amendment is \nfiled at the same time as everyone else's amendment. The worst damage, \nthe worst pork-barreling, the egregious stuff done around here is in \nmanagers' amendments.\n  The Senator from Texas and I spent several hours late at night last \nyear going through stacks of ``managers' amendments'' that amounted to \nbillions of dollars in porkbarrel spending.\n  I obviously disagree with that, as well.\n  Managers' amendments should be filed at the same time that all other \namendments should be filed.\n  Finally, I don't know how the amendment process is going to go, but \nwe are going to go after this porkbarrel spending and we are going to \ngo after it and after it and after it because there is going to be \nplenty of votes and we may want additional amendments presented in \ndifferent packages before we agree to any unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, I will be brief. We have \nseveral problems. We just got back into town and we have a complicated \npiece of legislation before the Senate. We want an opportunity to go \nthrough it.\n  Second, we have the problem that not only is the bill over the \nPresident's bill by some $3.8 billion, but there is $10 billion the \nPresident asked for that is not given in the bill. There is $14 billion \nhe did not ask for that is provided, and with something this \ncomplicated I think to ask Members to limit our ability to offer \namendments in 2 hours and 15 minutes on the first day we get back is \nunreasonable.\n  On that basis, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate and understand the objections \nof my two friends, but this is the time they should make some \nsuggestions. The President and the administration have been pushing \nthis legislation now for many weeks. We understand the importance of \nit. The two managers of the bill understand the importance of it. We \nwant to move this bill along.\n  I was happy to hear the Senator from Arizona citing the problems he \nhas with the bill and amendments will be offered. That is appropriate. \nThat is what we want. If someone has a problem with this legislation, \nthat is what they should do--offer amendments, a motion to strike, \nwhatever is appropriate, rather than as we did this morning, when this \nbody was basically in a quorum call, doing not much of anything. This \nis important legislation.\n  I repeat, the title of this legislation is ``Supplemental \nAppropriations Act for Further Recovery From the Response to Terrorist \nAttacks in the\n\n[[Page S4944]]\n\nUnited States.'' That is the name of the bill. That is why the two \nmanagers, two of the most senior Members, the most senior Members and \none of the most senior Members, Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens, have \nworked so hard to move it forward.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wonder why there should be an exception made for a \nmanagers' amendment and an amendment by Senator Byrd and an amendment \nby Senator Stevens. Shouldn't all Members be treated the same in this \nscenario? Why couldn't it be amended to say that all first-degree \namendments be filed by whatever date we agreed to, rather than adding a \nmanagers' amendment at any time, when we know the havoc that can wreak, \nin an amendment by Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens; why not add \nSenator Gramm, Senator McCain and the other 96 Senators, as well?\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Please.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would like to answer that.\n  Mr. President, the request for Senator Byrd and myself is because of \nabsent Members who have an interest in this legislation. We had asked \nfor an amendment to protect those absent Members, particularly with \nregard to the budget.\n  From my point of view, I would be happy to have an agreement that all \namendments must be filed by 5 p.m. without regard to anything else, and \nwe would proceed. We would be happy with that.\n  As far as the managers' amendment is concerned, those primarily are \ntechnical amendments that are brought to us as the day goes along. \nSometimes people disagree with them and laugh about them, but it is \nvery important that people bring them forward, and I remind the Senate \nthey are adopted by unanimous consent.\n  Any one Senator could have objected in the past or now to such a \nprocess. I am happy to leave that out. We can get the votes on the \nmanagers' amendment any time we want. We don't need unanimous consent \nto get a managers' package adopted.\n  I would be happy to have an agreement that everything has to be filed \nby 5 o'clock. I ask the majority whip to change the request so that all \namendments must be filed by 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Including the managers' amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Including the managers' amendment\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this shows the wisdom of the two managers of \nthis legislation. I don't have nearly the experience the two managers \nhave, but I have had some experience. There are always things that go \nwrong with legislation, most of which are technical in nature, and that \nis why you need a managers' amendment.\n\n  These two experts on Senate procedure have asked that I propound a \nunanimous consent request, just as I have done, except eliminate the \nfact that there would be any other amendments in order.\n  The two managers have more knowledge than I do, but I know the former \nchairman of the Budget Committee, the ranking member in the \nsubcommittee of appropriations with whom I work, Senator Domenici, is \nnot here today. They have a very important primary election in New \nMexico. He is not here. I was happy to offer this request, keeping in \nmind that we would be protecting Senator Domenici, who is a person who \nhas some knowledge of things that happen around here. But if the two \nmanagers are willing to go forward, I would be happy to do that.\n  So I propound this unanimous consent request again, indicating--in \nfact, I will just read it.\n  I ask unanimous consent all first-degree amendments to H.R. 4775 be \nfiled by 5 p.m., Tuesday, June 4; that any second-degree amendments be \nrelevant to the first degree to which offered or deal with offsets on \nthe first degree; and that upon disposition of all amendments, the bill \nbe read the third time and the Senate vote upon passage of the bill; \nthat upon passage, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, \nand that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate, without further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  Mr. REID. I wonder, while the Senator from Texas is on the floor, \nwould the Senator agree, on behalf of the minority, to having a time \ntonight, say, 5 o'clock, 5:30, for a finite list of amendments? The two \nmanagers would be given, by their respective cloakrooms, a finite list \nof amendments. This has worked well in the past as we proceed to \ngetting a finite list of amendments.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry to interrupt. If we could get a finite list of \namendments, then we could proceed to getting a cutoff of amendments at \nsome subsequent time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have high regard for the Senator. I \nunderstand he is trying to do his job.\n  We just had a luncheon with the OMB Director, representing the \nPresident. We were given, at the luncheon, and Senator McCain put it in \nthe Record so it will be immediately available to everybody--I am sure \neverybody will get a copy of it--an outline of why the President \nopposes the bill, why he will veto it if it is adopted.\n  This bill is 115 pages long. Just looking through it, there are \nprovisions of which I was unaware. We need time to sit down and read \nit.\n  On that basis, we are not going to agree to limit amendments on this \nbill this day. What we will do tomorrow, I think, depends on where we \nare when people have had the time to look at it.\n  For the people who are on the committee who studied these issues, \nobviously they are up on them; they know them. Most Members are not \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee. So in reading through here, I \nsee we have $2.5 million to train journalists in Egypt. That may be a \nvery good idea. I don't know.\n  Or that, of the funds appropriated in this paragraph, not less than \n$3.5 million shall be made available to programs and activities which \nsupport the development of the independent media in Pakistan.\n  I would have to say, I may be exhibiting my ignorance, but I don't \nknow whether or not that is a good expenditure of the taxpayers' money. \nI don't know if the President requested it in his bill. We have just \ngotten on this bill today.\n  We are going to have to look at this to know where we are going and \nwhat we are doing. There are some very controversial amendments that \nare going be offered. I think we are going to have to see what they are \nbefore we are going to be ready to limit our amendments.\n  I think there is a hope that this bill might be finished this week. I \nknow our leader has that objective. But it is going to take us time to \nget through the bill and look at it and see to what extent we are going \nto want to offer amendments.\n  Again, having just gotten the administration's position, given their \nstrong opposition to the bill, I think it is going to take a day or 2 \ndays or so for us to get through the bill and decide how we want to go \nabout it.\n  I know the Senator wants the trains to run on time, but there may be \npeople who decide to blow the train up. They would have a very \ndifferent objective.\n  It is going to take us time to absorb the bill and decide what we \nwant to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will sit down very shortly. My friend from \nTexas is one of the smartest people in the Senate. He is an academic, \nhe has a Ph.D., taught in college, and I certainly have every respect \nfor not only his academic brilliance but also his common sense.\n  Common sense dictates that this bill, which has been available since \nMay 23--it has been available. Staffs had it; my staff had it. Other \nstaffs have had an opportunity to look at it. There may be a lot of \nreasons why the Senator from Texas doesn't want to go forward with this \nlegislation, but it is not that this bill just got here, because the \nbill has been here since May 23. It was reported out May 22.\n  By Senate standards, it is a pretty thin bill. It is 117 pages. But \nin this there are a number of issues about which people have \ncomplained.\n  The Egyptian journalists section was not requested by Senator Byrd; \nit was requested by Senator McConnell. That\n\n[[Page S4945]]\n\nis why it is in the bill. The $3.5 million for the independent media in \nPakistan about which my friend complained, that was not requested by \nSenator Byrd; it was requested by Senator McConnell.\n  So I appreciate the concern of the Senator from Texas and others. But \nhe is right. We want to move this train. We have so many important \nthings to do and this is the most important thing we have to do now.\n  I repeat, this is a bill for further recovery and response to \nterrorist attacks in the United States. Every time we slow the train \ndown, there are resources not going to agencies and entities and people \nthroughout America that they desperately need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I don't want to get into lengthy debate \nhere. I raised the question about the journalists because I didn't \nknow. I could have spent our recess reading this bill. I did not. Maybe \nmany of my colleagues did. I doubt it.\n\n  We are not going to get this bill passed by passing it in a form that \nthe President has already said he is going to veto. It seems to me if \nwe are really in a hurry to pass this bill, that we need to figure out \nwhat we need to do to put it in a form so the President can and will \nsign it.\n  I think we have three clearly identifiable problems. One, it spends \n$3.8 billion more than the President requested. No. 2, it does not fund \n$10 billion of emergency programs the President did request. And No. \n3--what the administration says----\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield, that statement is really just \nnot correct. We just didn't fund it in the way he requested it, but we \nfunded what he requested.\n  Mr. GRAMM. All I know is if you take the programs he requested and \nyou take the programs that are funded here, that there is $10 billion \nof programs, as he defined them, that are not funded in this bill. That \nis the second problem.\n  The third problem is there are $14 billion of programs that he did \nnot request, that he did not designate as emergencies, that are funded \nin the bill.\n  So you have three major problems: It spends too much money, it leaves \nout $10 billion that the President asked for to fight the war on \nterrorism, and then it spends $14 billion for which the President did \nnot ask.\n  It may very well be that the way he asked and the way you provided \nare subtly different. I think that is one of the reasons we need to \nlook at it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. All I am saying is that is what the administration is \nsaying in these letters they are giving us. I appreciate the job of the \nSenator from Nevada. He does it well. But if our objective is to get \nthe money passed for the war on terrorism so it becomes law and the \nmoney can be spent, we are not going to do that by passing a bill the \nPresident today, in writing, is saying he will veto.\n  If we are in a hurry to get the money, what we ought to do is find a \nway to fix those three problems: No. 1, we are spending way too much \nmoney as compared to what the President requested. No. 2, $10 billion \nhe asked for in some form that we didn't provide. And then $14 billion \nhe didn't ask for, didn't say that they were emergencies, but we are \ncalling them emergencies.\n  Then we have a provision in the bill that says he cannot spend any of \nthe money as an emergency unless this $14 billion is deemed as an \nemergency, even though he doesn't think it is an emergency.\n  So I just think we are a long way from home. And if our objective is \nto get something the President will sign and will become law, there are \ngoing to have to be dramatic changes in the bill. If I knew how to fix \nthe bill today, I would do it; but I do not know how. It is just going \nto take time for us to figure it out. And that is what this is about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the President asked for this money as an \nemergency. The committee has made it a contingent emergency. And in \nterms of the accounting process, that turns up in one column or the \nother, but it is $10 billion in each column.\n  Now, it is true we do allocate some of that money in ways the \nPresident did not seek to allocate it. And there is a difference in \nwhether we want money to go to one Department or the other for homeland \ndefense, but it is all still there as in terms of the budget.\n  I understand the comments of the Senator from Texas about vetoes. If \nevery time we had a veto threat, since I have been in the Senate, we \njust stood still for 2 days, we would never pass any bills. The \nappropriations process always faces veto threats--until we come out of \nconference. And guess what. With very few exceptions, in the 30 years I \nhave been on the committee, we have not had vetoes of the \nappropriations bills. It is just a tactic of the administration that \ntells us: If you don't do this and that, we are going to veto the bill. \nWe will work this out, and eventually we will get the President's \nagreement to a bill.\n  We have to deal with the House, too. The House bill itself was \nfinally deemed acceptable after it passed, but it faced a veto threat \nbefore it passed. As far as I am concerned, the difficulty is we have \nto sit around for 2 days to wait for people to read a bill that has \nbeen here since May 22. I would like to find some way to get people to \ncome here and offer amendments to a bill that was here before we left \nfor the recess.\n  Now, it is high time that people start thinking about what they are \nsaying. They want 2 days to study this bill?\n  I think maybe tomorrow we will make a motion to proceed to third \nreading and see where the votes are. Let's see where the votes are. If \nthe Senate wants to get this bill to the President, what they need to \ndo is let us go to conference. And I will guarantee you, the bill that \ncomes out of conference will be a bill the President will accept \nbecause we do not want a supplemental emergency bill to be vetoed. But \nwe have to get to conference to work the matter out with the House and \nnot sit around here to wait for people, in 2 days, to tell us what they \nobject to in this bill that is going to the House for conference in any \nevent.\n  So I want to serve notice, tomorrow afternoon, unless the chairman \ndisagrees, I think we ought to have a test vote and see who wants to \ndelay the supplemental appropriations bill. We ought to go to third \nreading tomorrow and take this bill to conference on Thursday. And if \nwe did, we would have it back here next Tuesday so the matter would be \nsettled as far as the President is concerned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support the statements that have been made \nby the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, \nthe former chairman.\n  We had lengthy hearings on the bill. Those hearings were well \nattended by Members on both sides of the aisle. The witnesses who came \nbefore the committee were witnesses who were agreed upon by both the \nranking member, Mr. Stevens, and myself.\n  Everything was done that could have been done to try to ascertain \nwhat the true needs of the country are. We had seven Department heads. \nWe had the Director of FEMA. We had mayors, Governors, local \nresponders, the people who are first on the scene: the firemen, health \npersonnel, law enforcement people. And we assiduously studied the \nhearings results as we prepared the bill.\n  Now, it is easy to sit around and carp and complain and criticize, \nbut there are some around here who believe they have to do some things \nto help this country. We have to move a bill. It is easy to find fault, \nbut it is not so easy to try to develop the kind of support that this \nbill justifies. I think we have gone a long way to try to meet the true \nneeds of this country.\n  I have respect for the President, but he is not the fountain of all \nwisdom. I would hope that the President would take time to look at the \nbill, to study it. I think he will find there are provisions in it that \nhe did not request but which are justified. So I have faith that he \nwould be reasonable in that respect.\n  We appropriated the $14 billion the President requested for the \nDepartment of Defense. We appropriated the $5.5 billion for New York \nthe President requested. We appropriated the $1.6 billion for foreign \naid. And we appropriated the money for homeland defense in the amount \nof--we approved\n\n[[Page S4946]]\n\nhis $5.3 billion request. He saw a need for that.\n  We conducted the hearings. We are the representatives of the people. \nWe are the elected representatives of the people. We come here to \nrepresent the people. I do not come here by virtue of any President, \nDemocrat or Republican. No President sends me here, and no President is \ngoing to send me home. That is up to the people of West Virginia.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. REID. I was here in the Chamber when we went out a week ago last \nFriday, and there were people complaining about this bill. Remember, \nthey had the bill then. And people are complaining about it today, \nnitpicking it, for lack of a better description.\n  I say to my friend, the manager of the bill, people within the sound \nof our voices should understand that there is $6.7 billion in this bill \nto conduct military operations to continue the fight against terrorism. \nThat is there. There is $4.1 billion for National Guard and Reserve \npersonnel. People, including my friends in Nevada, have been called up. \nA Capitol policeman here, one person I know very well, left today for 6 \nmonths of active duty. He is leaving the Capitol Police, leaving his \nfamily, going off to fight for us, to protect us. We have to provide \nmoney to take care of that--$4.1 billion.\n  There is $2.7 billion for personnel, command, control, and \ncommunications, intelligence, and to replace munitions they are blowing \nup every day over in Afghanistan and other places.\n  I also say to my friend, it is true, is it not, there is money in \nthis bill for embassy security and other State Department activities \nrelated to the effort to respond to, deter, prevent international \nterrorism? That is in the bill.\n  We have $4.4 billion for the Transportation Security Administration--\nand I am certain we need that--to improve airport perimeter security, \nfund research for air cargo inspections.\n  There is $1 billion for first responders.\n  Mr. President, firemen, policemen, paramedics died going into those \nTwin Towers. People died. We need to have better training facilities \naround this country to help first responders. That is what this money \nis for, to make my family, as well as all families, all over this \ncountry, safer. So I am kind of tired of people coming over and \nnitpicking this bill.\n  We have $990 million for port security, $387 million for bioterrorism \nand to improve lab capacity at the Centers for Disease Control.\n  I went to the Centers for Disease Control with Max Cleland. That \nplace is an embarrassment. They do wonderful work, but they are in \nhundreds of buildings--little buildings, shacks. Some of them go back \nto before World War II. This money is to help them become more \nefficient. This is emergency money.\n  I say to my friend, I appreciate the work that has been done. I say \nthis not for me but for the people of Nevada, I appreciate the work \nthat you and the Senator from Alaska have done--providing $200 million \nfor security at nuclear weapons facilities.\n  Senators Lieberman and Clinton and I are holding hearings tomorrow in \nthe full Committee on Environment and Public Works because we believe--\nand there is a large segment of our society that believes--that our \nnuclear reactors are not secure. The Senator from West Virginia \nprovides money to help this, to make them safer; money for food safety; \ncyber-security; border security. There is money in the bill so that the \nEPA can complete vulnerability assessments of water systems. That is \nwhat they are telling us might happen; these evil people are going to \ncome in and poison our water so we can't drink it or, if we drink it, \neverybody will get sick. There is money in here to take care of that. \nThere is money to make sure the Postal Service can respond to \nbioterrorism attacks.\n  It is time we understand that this bill is important. It is emergency \nfunding for the programs I have mentioned. I am, for lack of a better \nword, kind of tired of people coming in, criticizing Senator Byrd and \nSenator Stevens for the brilliant work that was done getting the bill \nhere in the first place.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, this is a defense \nbill. This is for the defense of our homeland. This is for the defense \nof our people, our schoolchildren, our people who go to church, our \npeople who work in the mines and in the fields and the shipyards. We \nare talking about homeland defense. We can't get any closer to home.\n  Why some people would come to the floor and attempt to be critical \nover moneys that are for the defense of our homeland, for the defense \nof our own people, and in the many areas that have been explained by \nthe distinguished Democratic whip, Mr. Reid, is beyond me.\n  Last year, the President requested $6 billion for homeland defense. \nThe Congress appropriated $10 billion for homeland defense, $4 billion \nmore than the President requested. The President signed that \nlegislation.\n  The President made a request last year. The Congress, in its wisdom, \nin its collective wisdom, saw a need to appropriate more money. Those \nadditional moneys that Congress appropriated last year over the \nPresident's request have made a difference.\n  With all due respect to the President, I would say the distinguished \nranking member, Mr. Stevens, and I have worked together, and the other \nRepublicans on that committee, to report the bill; 14 Republicans, 15 \nDemocrats. That is a pretty good indication that this bill is a \nworthwhile piece of legislation.\n  I hope Members will stop complaining. If they have any amendments \nthey want to offer, offer them. Let's get on with the legislation and \nget it to conference and be prepared. We don't know what will happen 5 \ndays from now, a week from now. I hope Members will restrain their \nappetites to criticize, find fault and complain, and help us to put \nacross this legislation that is for the benefit of the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if there are complaints about specific items \nin this bill, offer an amendment to get rid of them. Don't come here \nand carp and complain about it. If they don't like the suggestion of \nSenator McConnell to have moneys for training journalists in other \ncountries, then move to strike it, have a vote. We could have a debate \non that in 15 or 20 minutes and move on to something else. If there is \nsomething else they don't like, move to strike it. These bills are not \nperfect by any sense of the word.\n  I hope, rather than trying to slow down the train, as my friend from \nTexas said, we will try to move the train along. This is important \nlegislation dealing with the peace and safety and security of the \nAmerican people.\n  We are back where we were this morning with a lot of talk and no \namendments. This morning there wasn't even much talk. I hope people \nwill come forward and offer amendments to this legislation. We are open \nfor business. It is too bad we don't have people here. I have had a \nnumber of people come to me and tell me they have amendments they want \nto offer. We hope they will come forward and do that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I request permission to speak \non the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank you for recognizing me. \nI wanted to come and add my voice to the many that have supported the \nsupplemental appropriations bill, and I want to give a unique \nperspective, that of Florida law enforcement, as to why we need this \nbill and not the House bill or the President's request.\n  It is most timely that we examine the question of what we are asking \nlocal and State law enforcement personnel to assume in the way of \nresponsibilities for investigation of crime and\n\n[[Page S4947]]\n\nnow terrorist activity. As we face the realistic fact of the threats to \nour society, not only do we look at the threats from organized crime, \ndrug crime, white-collar crime, all of those kinds of activities on \nwhich the FBI has traditionally done its investigation and worked with \nState and local law enforcement and worked with the U.S. attorneys and \nState attorneys, now with the additional requirement to protect the \nhomeland, we have to also marshal considerable law enforcement \ninvestigative resources to go after the element that would try to tear \ndown our society by terrorist acts. It also adds a much greater burden \nas we go about the process of investigating the activity of these \npeople we otherwise would call bad guys who are trying to destroy our \nway of life in this country.\n  So then we get to the point of last week's announcement by the FBI \nDirector that he is going to take 400 of his approximately 11,000 \nagents and shift them from going after normal criminal investigative \nprocedures and shift them specifically to terrorists. I don't think \nthere is any Member who disagrees.\n\n  We have to have pause and ask: How are we going to go about the \nnormal job of investigating all the other bad guys besides the \nterrorists? If we shift this resource of 400 agents, who typically have \ngone after drug crime and white-collar crime, to going only after \nterrorists, does that mean we will shift all of that burden of \ninvestigation to State and local law enforcement organizations?\n  Unfortunately, I come from a State that has one of the most active \ncriminal investigations, particularly in the Southern District of \nFlorida. The U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida is one \nof the most active in the country, in large part because we have to \nprosecute so much drug crime in Florida.\n  I spoke with one of my advisers this past week during the recess, the \nsheriff of Broward County, the second largest county in our State; he \nis an elected official. All the sheriffs in our 67 counties are \nelected. I asked his opinion. He clearly said, who does not support the \nshifting of these assets in going after the terrorists. In particular \nthe sheriff of Broward County had a tremendous working relationship \nwith the FBI, the DEA, and all the other Federal agencies that work \nwith State and local law enforcement.\n  He wanted to encourage that. However, he pondered how he could have \nthe needed resources for that burden of criminal investigation that the \nFBI was shifting to State and local law enforcement, particularly a \nvery big police force, a sheriff's department.\n  That is what brings me to the floor today, to speak in favor of this \nbill, not the House bill and not the President's position. This is a \nbig amount of money in a supplemental appropriations bill, $31 billion; \nthe President requested $27 billion; the House passed $29 billion. \nThere is a $2 billion difference.\n  What are some of the major differences? One of the major differences \nin the two bills and why we ought to accept the Senate bill is $1 \nbillion for first responder efforts, including firefighting, State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies, emergency medical personnel, and \nparticularly in emergency responding to biological, chemical, and \nnuclear threats. That is important. And there is more funding here than \nfrom the House.\n  If this will give law enforcement organizations such as my 67 \nsheriffs in Florida, our hundreds of police chiefs in Florida, our \nexcellent Florida Department of Law Enforcement, headed by Tim Moore--\nand I have had the privilege of working with him for years--if it will \ngive them the resources if the FBI is going to temporarily be pulled \nover to the bad guy terrorists, that is why we need to pass this Senate \nbill.\n  Furthermore, it is instructive, when you see the Web site of the FBI, \nto see what the FBI lists as its priorities. The first three priorities \nhave to do with going after and investigating the activities of \nterrorists. Priority No. 4 is public corruption and priority No. 5 is \ncivil rights. It is priority No. 6 that involves drug crimes and going \nafter the national and international criminal enterprise, including \nlots of activities of the mob.\n  Therefore, I want to make sure there is not one Member who does not \nsupport these priorities of the FBI. I want to make sure that in the \nprocess of supporting the Director as he reorients these 400 agents we \nhave not put an unbearable burden of investigation on State and local \nlaw enforcement to the point they cannot handle it and they get \noverworked and overextended, or that they have to retrench and that \nthose kinds of criminal activities in America go uninvestigated. That \nwould be unacceptable.\n\n  That is why I come to the floor today, to say to my colleagues that \nwe need to pass this Senate version of the supplemental appropriations \nbill which passed by a unanimous bipartisan vote out in the \nAppropriations Committee, led in great bipartisan fashion, as they so \noften do, by Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens, the two leaders of their \nrespective parties on this Appropriations Committee. We need to pass \nthis bill and get it to a conference committee to iron out the \ndifferences with the House and insist on the priorities.\n  There is one other priority that needs to be attended to. I come from \nFlorida. We have 14 deepwater ports in Florida. Fortunately, we are \nfinally waking up to the fact that terrorist activity may well happen \nin, at, or through one of those ports. Of the myriad containers that \ncome into this country through our ports, only about 3 percent are \ninspected. Those who want to do bad things clearly have an avenue. \nThus, we have to beef up our port security.\n  Within this appropriations bill, there is $970 million that will help \nincrease our security at these ports. That includes, clearly, Coast \nGuard surveillance. Can we get the Coast Guard to do everything? No. Do \nwe need the Coast Guard to have increased surveillance in our ports? \nYes. Do we need the Coast Guard continuing to do drug interdiction on \nthe high seas? Yes. How are we going to do it? We have to provide more \nresources.\n  I submit to the Senate that this supplemental appropriations bill is \na way to do that. I urge my colleagues to get on with it; stop standing \naround. Don't make us go to a cloture motion to have to cut off debate. \nLet's get this supplemental appropriations bill passed and into a \nconference so we can go about the business of the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3570\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3570.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To direct the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out a certain \n                           transfer of funds)\n\n       On page 7, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       Sec. 102. Not later than 14 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall \n     carry out the transfer of funds under section 2507(a) of the \n     Food Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (Public Law \n     107-171).\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my amendment simply requires the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to take action on a recently enacted farm \nbill conservation provision. The conservation provision is important. \nIt is already in the farm bill. I am simply asking that they do what \nthey are already required to do.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the farm bill is 1,000 pages long. The \nDepartment of Agriculture just met with the Senate staff to talk about \ntheir plans to implement this mammoth bill. It is taking the Department \na long time to work out the details of all the programs and provisions \nof this bill. The provision to which this amendment pertains requires \nUSDA to transfer conservation funds to the Bureau of Reclamation. This \namendment does not in any way change the underlying farm bill.\n  This is in there. They are required to do it. It requires the USDA to \ncarry out a mandatory congressional directive by a date certain so that \na small provision does not get lost in a sea of larger programs and \npriorities.\n  I want the two managers to have time to look at this amendment. I\n\n[[Page S4948]]\n\nwant others to, if they have any question about it. It is a fairly \nsimple thing, requiring the Department of Agriculture to do something \nthat the farm bill directs them to do.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \n$417 million in additional fiscal year 2002 funding for veterans health \ncare contained in this supplemental appropriation bill. First, let me \ngive a little background.\n  In November of last year, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony \nPrincipi identified a roughly $400 million shortfall in the VA medical \ncare appropriation for FY2002. This shortfall, driven by increased \ndemand for VA services as well as rising medical costs, threatened to \nforce the Secretary to stop enrolling new veterans into the VA system.\n  This was not something the Secretary wanted to do, but he is someone \nwho tries to face challenges honestly and he determined that he \ncouldn't maintain services for veterans already enrolled in the VA and \nserve new veterans at the same time. But rather than have that happen, \nthe White House told the Secretary that they would find him additional \nmoney.\n  But Mr. President, when the administration sent their supplemental \nrequest to Congress in March they only asked for $142 million for the \nVA--$258 million below the level the Secretary said he needed. To add \ninsult to injury, the VA was then told that it had to make up the \ndifference through ``management efficiencies.''\n  Well, Mr. President, I think we all know that ``management \nefficiencies'' is just inside the beltway talk for balancing the budget \non the backs of veterans. I was at any number of joint veterans \ncommittee hearings over on the House side where the veterans were \ntalking about the importance of leaving no veteran behind. And \nremember, this occurs in the context of half a decade in the mid-\nnineties of cost cutting and belt tightening at the VA. There really \nisn't much more fat to trim.\n  I knew that the administration's request was a non-starter. I knew \nbased on what I was hearing from veterans in Minnesota and the VA both \nhere and in Minnesota. I know that you, the Presiding officer, was \nhearing that in South Dakota as well. Already this year's shortfall has \nhad a tremendous impact in Minnesota and throughout VISN 23:\n  Higher waiting times generally for care at both hospitals and \ncommunity based outpatient clinics--28 days for current patients \nseeking primary care, 30-150 days for new patients seeking primary \ncare, 4 to 170 days for specialty care at the medical centers.\n  A freeze on new CBOCs.\n  A freeze on new patients at some of our medical centers.\n  The closing of clinics at our hospitals--specifically, for example, \nthe night clinics at the Minneapolis facility--the flagship hospital in \nour network. And at St. Cloud, the caregivers there tell me they have \nnever seen it so bad, in terms of the cuts they are having to make in \npersonnel and the way it is affecting quality of services.\n  But these problems are not unique to Minnesota, they are happening \nall over the country. That's why these additional funds are so \ncritical. Something had to be done.\n  I, Senator Johnson, now the Presiding Officer, and Senator Collins \ndrafted a bipartisan letter to the Appropriations Committee asking that \nthe committee include at least $400 million for VA health care in the \nsupplemental. Altogether, 27 Senators signed our letter--Republicans \nand Democrats. The veterans organizations that put together the \nIndependent Budget endorsed our effort. I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of each of those letters be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See Exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to say that the committee \nagreed to our request. In particular I want to thank Chairman Byrd and \nSenator Stevens as well as Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond, the chair \nand ranking member of the VA/HUD subcommittee. They all care deeply \nabout our veterans and they know better than anyone the challenges that \nthe VA faces.\n  The $417 million for veterans health care in this bill will mean that \nMinnesota's Network, VISN 23, will get an additional $21.4 million to \nreduce waiting times, keep clinics open, open new clinics, and improve \nthe quality of healthcare. This is very badly needed.\n  Mr. President, this bill has drawn criticism for going beyond the \nPresident's request. Well, at least on veterans health care the \nPresident didn't ask for enough. The VA is straining to serve more \nveterans while spending much less per patient. The VA is our back-up \nhealth care provider for the U.S. military. It is the back up provider \nfor our public health care system should there be--heaven forbid--\nanother terrorist attack on U.S. soil. This is money that will be well \nspent. I am proud to support it.\n  I say to the Chair, Senator Johnson from South Dakota, it has been an \nhonor to be involved with you in this joint effort. The Senate \nAppropriations Committee got it right. We need to get this bill to the \nPresident as quickly as possible.\n  I have seen the same pattern again and again. I will just tell you \nthat there are incredibly powerful and important claims by veterans who \nbelieve they are being left behind because they are not able to access \nthe kind of health care we promised we would deliver to them, because \nof the budget constraints. This supplemental will help, though it is \nnot a whole answer to the problem.\n  I have heard it and seen it with the education community. My State of \nMinnesota is still waiting for the $2 billion our State deserves--if \nthe Federal Government had lived up to its commitment on special \neducation over 10 years. I think it would have been an additional $40 \nmillion this past year. It would have made all the difference in the \nworld. Half of it would have been for special education, but the other \nhalf could have been applied to other programs that we had to take \nmoney from in order to fund special education.\n  I have had people come into my office to talk about the need for more \nresearch money for cancer, all kinds of cancer. This morning we were \ntalking about pancreatic cancer. Of course, we have talked about breast \ncancer and all kinds of cancer.\n  I have had people, more recently, come in and talk to me about the \nneed for more money for MS, muscular dystrophy, muscular dystrophy that \naffects children, Parkinson's disease, diabetes. Frankly, the list goes \non and on. The last thing we want is for one group of people struggling \nwith an illness to be pitted against another group. The concern is, \nwill there be enough money to dramatically continue with the research \neffort within NIH?\n  By the way, I would argue that ultimately a healthy Medicare \nrecipient makes for a better Medicare system. And to the extent we can \nfind a cure for some of these disabling diseases--including \nAlzheimer's--we will all be much better. There is the old adage: But \nfor the grace of God go I or my parent or my grandparent.\n  I have heard from people in Minnesota--elderly people, but not just \nsenior citizens, others as well--about what we talk about all the \ntime--and the majority leader said, indeed, we will bring this to the \nfloor of the Senate--affordable prescription drug legislation. But just \nas important as that is, our health care delivery system in Minnesota \nis in crisis. The Medicare reimbursement, which was dramatically cut in \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997, has just been devastating to our rural \nhospital system and, frankly, to metro as well--whether it be our \nhospitals, our nursing homes, our home health care providers, whether \nit be the whole issue of physician reimbursement vis-a-vis Medicare \nrecipients, whether it be the County Medical Center, which is one of \nthe best public hospitals in the United States. In Medicare and \nMedicaid, we are faced with some severe problems of underfunding.\n  To go back to the issue of veterans' health care, when I visit \nveterans in our medical centers, and then maybe spend some time talking \nto their\n\n[[Page S4949]]\n\nspouses, their spouses do not have a clue about what they are going to \ndo when their husbands get home. Maybe one of the veterans has had hip \nsurgery, and he is 75 or 80 years old. We don't know what to do about \nhome health care, how we can support people so they can stay at home.\n  But that does not affect just veterans; it affects all of us as we \nget older or, God forbid, it affects others who struggle with \ndisabilities at a much younger age.\n  I have been hearing from small businesses more in recent years. \nAlthough I have always believed our failure to finance, organize, and \ndeliver health care in our country in a way that makes sense most \nseriously affects, obviously, people with no insurance and people who \nare underinsured, my gosh, the self-employed and small businesspeople \nare getting killed by these spiraling health care costs. This is a \nsystem that is imploding.\n  Frankly, I think we ultimately have to get back to health security \nfor all. I think we have to get back to comprehensive health care \ncoverage.\n  I remind my colleagues about some of the reports in the New York \nTimes about nursing home conditions. These are elderly people who have \nbuilt a country, who are infirm, who wind up in nursing homes with \ninadequate staffing and some pretty horrendous conditions. And it is \nnot because the people in the nursing homes are cruel; it is that they \ndo not have adequate funding.\n\n  I could not believe the New York Times front page story, a three-part \nseries. I think the journalist should receive a Pulitzer for his work \non adult care for people struggling with mental illness, people who \njump out of windows and take their lives because they never received \npharmacological treatment, people who have died in heat, people who \nwear the same urine-soaked and urine-smelling clothing day after day \nbecause they have received no care.\n  This is in the United States of America in the year 2002. Surely we \ncan do better.\n  By the way, this Thursday there will be maybe as many as 2,000 men \nand women, who will have come to Washington, DC, from all across the \ncountry, who are basically going to say: When are you going to pass a \nmental health parity bill? When are you going to end the \ndiscrimination? We are here to meet with you, Representatives.\n  They are going to focus most of their effort on the House side. We \npassed this as an amendment last year in the appropriations bill. We \nhave 66 cosponsors. Senator Domenici has done a great job taking the \nlead. It has been an honor to be his partner in this effort.\n  But these are people who are just getting tired of waiting, tired of \nthe delay. It is their loved ones or themselves who are affected.\n  My only point is, I really do think we are on a collision course \nbetween tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts--too much of this, of course, \nfocused on the wealthiest citizens or multinational corporations--and \nnot having, therefore, any of the revenue or the funding to make any \ninvestment in these other areas.\n  I do not think, when it comes to education and health care, when it \ncomes to the question of conditions in nursing homes, and when it comes \nto the question of whether we are going to do everything we can to do \nthe research and find the cure for horrible diseases, that we should \nbasically be put in a position of not making the investment. How can we \ndo that? We will not be a better nation if that is the case.\n  So I really believe these tax cuts have put us in a straitjacket. \nWhen I look at what is being asked for the Pentagon, and then look at \nwhat is being asked--and probably there should be more--for homeland \ndefense, and then I look at these other compelling needs, and then I \nlook at all the tax cuts, I ask myself the question: How can you do all \nof it at the same time? And you can't.\n  So I hope we will sort that out and make some of these decisions. \nThat is part of what this battle has been about--veterans' health care. \nEverybody is for veterans. No Senator would ever make a speech saying \nthey were not for veterans. But veterans are saying: Look, when push \ncomes to shove, there is the Fourth of July, there is Memorial Day, and \nthere is Veterans Day. We appreciate the parades and we appreciate the \nceremonies, but the truth is, the best way you can honor us is by, \nplease, living up to your commitment to give us the very best health \ncare, by honoring us when we are in the later years of our lives, if we \nare World War II veterans, by making sure we are not tucked away in \nsome nursing home; if we are Vietnam veterans and we are homeless, and \nwe are struggling with PTSD, try to give us care; if we are Persian \nGulf veterans trying to figure out what happened to us, make sure we \nget the health care.\n  I think this supplemental bill is, at least in part, a recognition of \nthat. I appreciate the work of all involved, and I especially \nappreciate the work of the Presiding Officer, Senator Johnson. The \nPresiding Officer has been a real leader in this area. I know veterans \nin South Dakota thank Senator Johnson as well. And I thank Senator \nCollins for her good work also.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 2002.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations, The Capital, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations, The \n         Capital, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Stevens: We write to urge you \n     to include $400 million for veterans medical care in the \n     FY2002 Supplemental Appropriations bill. This is the minimum \n     amount necessary to allow the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     (VA) to maintain current services in the current fiscal year \n     without impairing veterans' access to quality, timely health \n     care.\n       The VA in recent years has stretched their appropriation as \n     far as possible, even as the number of veterans seeking VA \n     care has risen dramatically. In November of last year, \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony Principi identified a \n     $400 million shortfall in the VA medical care appropriation \n     for FY2002. This shortfall, driven by increased demand for VA \n     services as well as rising medical costs, threatened to force \n     the Secretary to restrict enrollment of new veterans into the \n     VA system.\n       The Administration has requested a $142 million \n     supplemental appropriation for the VA--$258 million below the \n     level the Secretary said he needed. While we appreciate that \n     the President included veterans medical care in his \n     supplemental request, we are concerned that it will not cover \n     the entire shortfall. VA has said the Veterans Health \n     Administration will make up the difference through \n     ``management efficiencies.'' However, such steps will \n     severely undermine the VA's ability to delivery quality, \n     timely health care to America's veterans. The impact of this \n     budget gap has already affected many veterans in the form of \n     longer waiting times for medical appointments, stressed and \n     overworked VA staff, closing of clinics, moratoriums on new \n     Community Based Outpatient Clinics and frozen enrollment at \n     existing CBOCs.\n       We know that the fiscal strains on the federal budget are \n     significant. However, the crisis in the veterans health care \n     system requires that it be made a top priority. To avert \n     further hardship on veterans, the supplemental should reflect \n     VA's actual need and include $400 million for medical care.\n       Thank you for your attention this request, We know of your \n     commitment to our veterans and look forward to working with \n     you as the appropriation process moves forward.\n           Sincerely,\n         Paul D. Wellstone; Susan Collins; James M. Jeffords; \n           Byran L. Dorgan; Harry Reid; Max Baucus; Barbara Boxer; \n           Dick Durbin; Robert G. Torricelli; John F. Kerry; Mark \n           Dayton; Patty Murray; Patrick Leahy; Tim Johnson; Jay \n           Rockefeller; Debbie Stabenow; Kent Conrad; Bill Nelson; \n           Tom Daschle; Max Cleland; Zell Miller; Gordon Smith; \n           Ted Kennedy; Olympia Snowe; Tom Harkin; Jean Carnahan.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The Independent Budget,\n\n\n                            A Budget for Veterans by Veterans,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: Last Autumn, Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     Anthony Principi stated that the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) was facing a shortfall of $400 million in this \n     fiscal year. In fact, the VA came perilously close to \n     curtailing the enrollment of veterans seeking health care in \n     order to meet this deficit. The co-authors of The Independent \n     Budget, AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed \n     Veterans of America, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, urge \n     you to sign-on to the Dear Colleague letter being circulated \n     by Senators Paul Wellstone, Susan Collins and Tim Johnson \n     seeking $400 million in FY 2002 supplemental funding for \n     veterans' health care.\n       The Administration has requested only $142 million in \n     supplemental funding for veterans' health care, $258 million \n     below the demonstrated need. Because of inadequate funding, \n     the VA health care system is in crisis and veterans are \n     facing de facto health care rationing. In fact, almost \n     175,000 veterans are waiting months and months for basic \n     appointments. This is why The Independent Budget has \n     recommended a $3.1 billion increase in FY 2003, and why we \n     urge\n\n[[Page S4950]]\n\n     you to help us achieve the $400 million in supplemental \n     funding veterans' health care needs this year.\n       Again, we urge you to support the funding levels needed by \n     veterans' health care.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rick Jones,\n       National Legislative Director, AMVETS.\n     Richard B. Fuller,\n       National Legislative director, Paralyzed Veterans of \n     America.\n     Joseph A. Violante,\n       National Legislative Director, Disabled American Veterans.\n     Dennis Cullinan,\n       National Legislative Director, Veterans of Foreign Wars of \n     the United States.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Can the Presiding Officer tell me when is the last time an \namendment was offered; what time was that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 3:47 p.m.\n  Mr. REID. At 3:47 p.m., Mr. President. It is now 4:47 p.m. That is an \nhour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The debate on that amendment took approximately 2 minutes. \nSo following the vote this afternoon, there was some dialog as to what \nwe should do on this bill. We asked unanimous consent to move forward, \nhaving expedited time for filing amendments. At that time, there were a \nnumber of people who said they did not like certain provisions in the \nbill. There was an example of some money that had been suggested by \nSenator McConnell for training journalists in the Middle East and in \nPakistan. Some colleagues said they did not like that part of the bill.\n  I would hope we would do what we are supposed to do. If Senators do \nnot like what is in the bill, let's do something about it. We are \nwaiting around here doing nothing on a bill that is called by title the \n``Supplemental Appropriations Act for Further Recovery from and \nResponse to Terrorist Attacks on the United States,'' and nothing is \nhappening.\n  People complain about the bill. There are major programs in this bill \nthat are not being funded. The President has told us on numerous \noccasions this is an important bill to move along. We are trying to do \nthat. But for his own party, we cannot do that.\n  I talked with Senator Byrd today publicly about some of the items in \nthis legislation: $6.7 billion to conduct military operations to \ncontinue the fight against terrorism. I do not think anyone would \ndispute that is necessary; $4.1 billion for National Guard and Reserve \npersonnel who have been called up to active duty, and I used the \nexample of one of the police officers who is part of the plain clothes \ndetail. He has very important duties on Capitol Hill. He has been \ncalled away for 6 months. There are thousands and thousands of people, \njust as James Proctor, who have been called to active duty.\n  We have to pay for this activity, and that is part of what Senator \nByrd and Senator Stevens are trying to do with this bill they are \nmanaging.\n  There is $.3 billion for combat air patrol missions within the United \nStates for obvious reasons. Because of September 11, we need these air \npatrol missions; $200 million for Guantanamo Bay support, fuel, and \nmiscellaneous costs. We have ongoing activities that certainly have \nbecome more difficult with the war on terrorism and because of what \nCastro has done in the past and also what he has threatened to do and \nthe fact we have moved al-Qaida and Taliban from Afghanistan to a \nprotective facility at Guantanamo Bay. There is $200 million in this \nbill to take care of those activities.\n  In this legislation, there are moneys requested by the President to \nbetter protect our embassy personnel, to prevent international \nterrorism, as well as for military and economic assistance programs to \nstrengthen the ability of other countries to fight terrorism.\n  In this bill there is $4.4 billion for the Transportation and \nSecurity Administration which funds their request. The bill includes \n$265 million in additional airport security funds. These monies would \nhelp airports meet the new Federal security standards. Local \ngovernments are eating these costs now.\n  We need to move forward. If there is something in the bill that \npeople do not like, let them move to take it out, have a debate, and an \nup-or-down vote. If it is not necessary to have something in the bill, \nthey can make their case. I am sure Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd \nwould be happy if that were done.\n  There are things in this bill for port security. These funds would \nimprove security at our ports, allow for increased surveillance by the \nCoast Guard, improve container inspections by the Customs Service, as \nwell as improve inspection technology generally. In this bill, there is \n$387 million for bioterrorism, including funds to improve lab capacity \nat the Centers for Disease Control and security at the National \nInstitutes of Health; $200 million for security at nuclear weapons \nfacilities and nuclear laboratories.\n  I traveled with Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman in recent \nmonths to the Los Alamos and Sandia Laboratories, something of which \nthis country should be very proud, but the problem is they have \ninadequate security. Maybe we should not announce that on the Senate \nfloor, but that is a fact. Some of the most sensitive work done in this \nGovernment is done in New Mexico at those two laboratories. We are \ntrying to get more money so that these laboratories are not subject to \nterrorist attack as easily as they might be.\n  I spoke to a Member of the House of Representatives today and I spoke \nyesterday to Senator Lugar. They traveled to Russia during the break, \nspent almost a week there. I am so happy we have improved our \nrelationship with Russia. It is so important we have done that. I am so \nhappy we have this treaty where each country is going to cut back by \ntwo-thirds the number of nuclear warheads, but we are a country that \nhas the means to help the former Soviet Union, Russia, get rid of some \nof those materials. They need help. There are biological weapons and \nnuclear weapons stored in facilities that one cannot believe how \ninadequate they are.\n  There is money in this bill--not very much, in my opinion, compared \nto what is needed, but in this bill there is $100 million for nuclear \nnonproliferation programs. That is important money. That is money well \nspent. One hundred fifty-four million dollars is for cyber-security.\n  This funding would help the private sector and Federal agencies \ndefend themselves from cyber-attack; $125 million for border security; \n$100 million so the EPA can complete vulnerability assessments of water \nsecurity systems; $286 million for miscellaneous home and defense \nneeds, Secret Service efforts to combat electronic crime, FBI \ncounterterrorist efforts, courthouse security, Department of Justice \ninformation systems. We even have to look at security for visitors to \nFederal monuments and museums.\n  So there is more in this legislation than I have outlined, but I am \ndumbfounded why people who oppose this legislation are, as my friend \nfrom Texas said, slowing down the train. This is not hurting the \nDemocrats. It is hurting our country. We need not slow down the train. \nIf there is something on the train that people do not like, have them \ntry to remove it.\n  This bill would provide the money that has been promised, that is, \n$5.5 billion to assist New York City for the response to the September \n11 terrorist attacks. These funds would be channeled through FEMA for \ndisaster relief. The Transportation Department will help replace, \nrebuild, or enhance mass transit systems and restore or reconstruct \nroads; the Department of Housing and Urban Development for grants to \nrebuild utility infrastructure.\n\n  We heard last week, the day before the event that was to commemorate \nthe removal of the last load of rubbish from the terrorist attack, that \nin New York City manhole covers were being blown into the sky. They \nwere being blown into the sky because the utility infrastructure that \nis now in existence\n\n[[Page S4951]]\n\nis overworked. They need to repair that and replace what was damaged \nand demolished by virtue of that terrorist attack. We need to do that. \nThat is what this money is all about.\n  I hope, and I guess this is a cry upon deaf ears, that somebody would \ncome, if they have amendments, and offer them. It is 5 p.m. All day \nlong we have done nothing. There was an amendment that was called up \nthat passed 95 to 4 or something like that. I do not know the vote, but \nit was basically an unnecessary vote. That is all we have done today, \nsomething the House put in the bill that everyone wanted out dealing \nwith making sure the airlines remain sound, secure, and strong \nfinancially. That is all we have done.\n  I think it is too bad that people who oppose something as much as \npeople say they oppose this emergency legislation for further recovery \nfrom and response to terrorist attacks in the United States are not \nwilling to come forward. We know it is only a few people, but a few \npeople can stop this body from moving sometimes.\n  Senator Stevens said he was going to move to third reading tomorrow, \nand if people did not want to go to third reading, they would have to \nrespond. That really is a debatable motion. People need to come over \nand tell us why they do not want to move forward.\n  I can understand that in this bill there may be parts of it people do \nnot like. If they do not like part of it, I repeat, try to get rid of \nit. It is not as if we are working on insignificant legislation. The \nPresident has devoted his weekly Saturday address to how important this \nlegislation is. He has given press conferences about how important this \nlegislation is, and for people to say the President is going to veto \nit, the President is not going to veto this legislation. We have a \nstatement of administration policy, unsigned, of course, and we all \nknow it came from some staff. The President certainly has not had \nanything to do with this, or if he has, it is general in nature.\n  If we pass something out of here, there is nothing for the President \nto veto. It goes to conference with the House, and then we would do as \nwe always do on something this important: We would work with the House, \nas we have to; work with the administration, as we have to; and work \nout differences if indeed there is something at that time that he does \nnot like.\n  Remember, this bill is going to pass by a wide margin anyway, so the \nPresident also has to be very careful as to what happens.\n  I heard a statement today from the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Miller, \nwho has just come into the Chamber. Having been Governor and being, as \nsome say, a legend in his own time as to popularity in the State of \nGeorgia for all the good things he has done in education and other \nthings, he was lamenting the fact how can this body, the Senate, on \nsomething that is this important do nothing? He was talking about \nprescription drugs. How can we keep going day by day and do nothing?\n  I say to my friend from Georgia, we have a bill for further recovery \nfrom the response to terrorist attacks in the United States and nobody \nis here. I have been here all day. Nothing has happened. We had some \nmeaningless vote that everybody supported basically, passing 94 to 4, \nor whatever it was. I am not too sure of the--anyway, I do not need to \ngive an editorial comment.\n  I think the Senator is so right. The only thing I would say to the \nSenator from Georgia is the Senator from Georgia said that it seems \nthat people who are a little older--and he mentioned specifically the \nSenator from West Virginia and the Senators from South Carolina and the \nSenator from Georgia--may understand how important it is to move \nforward. More than those Members with white hair understand the \nimportance of this, but a small minority are stopping the Senate from \nmoving forward on legislation, not only on this but other areas.\n\n  I did not have the chance at our luncheon to discuss the remarks of \nSenator Miller because time was short as Senators spoke on this \nsubject, but I wanted to propound before all the Democratic Senators \nhow good I thought the statement was this morning. I say now to the \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from Georgia, how good that statement \nwas. I underscore, underline, and put exclamation marks on everything \nthe Senator said.\n  How can we take up the time of this country and do nothing? We are \ndoing nothing. If Members do not like this bill or something in it, \ngive a speech, offer an amendment, do something. Staff sits around here \nstaring into space like I have all day.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I yield to my friend from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I ask the Senator from Nevada, is there any \nparliamentary obstacle to anyone bringing an amendment to the floor at \nany time? Is there anything the leader, or you, would do to interfere \nwith our right to offer an amendment, have a debate, and vote up or \ndown on any amendments?\n  Mr. REID. The answer is no.\n  I speak from pretty good information: I bet the minority leader, the \nRepublican leader, wants the bill passed. His President wants the bill \npassed. A few people are stopping us. We were told they want to slow \ndown the train.\n  I repeat to my friend from South Dakota, if they don't like something \non the train, take it off.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. If I may continue, I am struck that it is one thing to \nslow down the train on noncontroversial legislation, but is this not \nthe very legislation that our troops in uniform are relying on so they \ncan continue to be equipped, continue to have ammunition, continue to \nhave resources they need to fight in Afghanistan and around the world?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from South Dakota, I remember a very \nemotional time when the son of the Senator from South Dakota was called \ninto harm's way in Bosnia, the Balkans, wearing a uniform, carrying a \ngun, representing the United States. I remember that. I remember the \nemotion the Senator from South Dakota felt in expressing to me how \nconcerned the Senator was but at the same time proud of his son.\n  There are hundreds of thousands of American troops like your son, all \nover the world, waiting for the items included in this bill.\n  Part of this is to replace munitions. There is no endless supply. \nThey have to be manufactured in the United States and taken over there. \nThis legislation calls for part of this money to replenish our \nmunitions supply.\n  I say to my friend from South Dakota, the Senator is absolutely \nright. This bill is a supplemental appropriation for further recovery \nfrom and response to terrorist activities. There are major provisions, \nincluding $14 billion for the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. My oldest son returned from Afghanistan with the 101st \nAirborne just this week. We are proud to have him back.\n  I wish Members obstructing this legislation could go to Afghanistan \nand look at our forces in the north, at Baghram, our forces in the \nsouth in Kandahar, look them in the eye and tell them: We have other \nthings to do; we don't want to pass this legislation that allows you to \nhave the resources to conduct our war against terror, to defend \nAmerican families all over this Nation.\n\n  I cannot imagine what the Members obstructing this legislation must \nbe thinking or how they could look in the eye our law enforcement \nofficers, our firefighters, our first responders, our military, all of \nwhom it appears to me are going to be suffering from the lack of \npassage of this legislation, not to mention the fact, as Senator \nWellstone said so ably on the floor earlier today, this also contains \nthe funding necessary to keep our Veterans' Administration health care \nprogram going through the remainder of this year, for the people who in \nthe past have fought so hard to preserve our liberty, to preserve our \ndemocracy.\n  We have a handful who apparently are going to renege on those \nobligations, as well. This strikes me as truly an outrage. I certainly \nhope Senator Lott will do all he can and that the President of the \nUnited States will do all he can to prevail on those Members of their \npolitical party to allow this legislation to move forward, to allow \nfree up-or-down votes. Perhaps the Senator from Nevada and I will have \nprovisions in this bill which will be defeated. So be it. We will have \na fair up-or-down vote and debate.\n\n[[Page S4952]]\n\n  To have no debate and no opportunity to move the legislation forward, \nwin or lose, is truly an outrage.\n  I commend the Senator from Nevada for being on the floor today to \nclarify why this needed legislation, which frankly should have passed \nweeks ago, is still floundering.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize to my friend. I did not know that your son also \nnot only has served in a combat role in the Balkans but also in \nAfghanistan. Is that the same son?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Same son, just returned from the 101st this past week.\n  Mr. REID. I saw the pictures of this very young man who I knew as a \nboy, as an athlete. I am glad he is home.\n  The Presiding Officer proudly wears his marine pin. He has written a \nbook about the Marines.\n  I mentioned briefly, I attended a reception across the floor this \nmorning and met four of the wind talkers, the Navajo Indians who did so \nmuch. Here these old men were, finally after all these years, 4 of 29 \nwind talkers, getting recognition, value for what they did.\n  I also mentioned on the floor this morning, I talked to them and \nasked them where they went. They talked about Guadalcanal and Guam. One \nof the Navajo Indians spoke in the native Tarawa: That is where I lost \na lot of my buddies. He had tears in his eyes.\n  Mr. President, I don't want to be overly dramatic, but we had 3,000 \npeople killed at the Pentagon and New York City. That is what this \nlegislation is all about. It is about the war we have going on with \nterrorists. The next bill we will bring up is the hate crimes bill. We \nshould get this done and move to that. Why not legislate?\n  I have said it 10 times today, and I will say it for the 11th time. \nIf there is something in this bill that somebody does not like, move to \nstrike it. Get rid of it. Instead, nothing is happening. I don't \nunderstand how anyone can do that to our troops; the Senator is \nabsolutely right.\n  Part of this legislation provides $1.1 billion for payment of \nveterans' disability compensation. Veterans are not freeloaders. Talk \nabout something they need--disability compensation.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I am sure the Senator from Nevada finds the same \ncircumstances when he returns home to his State. We talk to our \nveterans, we talk to our military, we talk to our firefighters, we talk \nto our law enforcement officers, our ambulance people, our first \nresponders. These are all people willing to put their lives in harm's \nway, willing to work at very modest wages. They are willing to disrupt \ntheir families. They are willing to do a great deal. All they ask is \nthat the American people and the Senate stand behind them, reinforce \nthem, and show support.\n\n  What kind of signal does this inaction, this obstruction--what kind \nof signal does this send to those men and women in uniform who do so \nvery much for our Nation during this difficult time? This must be \ndispiriting to each and every one of them the longer this goes on. I \nwonder if the Senator has any observations from the people he has \ntalked to in his State about their expectation, that they will do these \nhard tasks and put their lives on the line but they do expect their \nNation to stand behind them.\n  Mr. REID. I confirm what the Senator said, of course, from my trip to \nNevada. I also traveled during the break and went to other places doing \nsome work as relates to the Senate--Utah, various parts of California, \nand Colorado. All over the country, not only Nevada and South Dakota, \nall over the country people want our soldiers, sailors, airmen, \ncoastguardsmen, to have enough resources to do their job. But also, as \nthe Senator from South Dakota has said, it is important that those \npeople who are first responders know they have the necessary equipment \nand the resources.\n  The problem we have is, every minute this bill does not pass, people \nin Georgia, South Dakota, and Nevada are having moneys paid out of \ntheir own budgets for issues that are the responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment. So the people of Nevada are being hurt as we speak because \nprograms that must be provided for first responders--fire, police, \nparamedics, and medical personnel--are being paid for out of their own \nbudgets. This will relieve them of some of that responsibility.\n  So the Senator is absolutely right. It is a shame. I do not \nunderstand why we are here doing nothing--I mean nothing. If somebody \ndoesn't like the bill, let them have the intestinal fortitude to come \nand tell us what they are going to do about it.\n  I say to my friend from South Dakota, we even tried: OK, if you don't \nlike the bill, let's have a time for a finite number of amendments. \nThey responded: No, we can't agree to that. We haven't had a chance to \nlook at the bill.\n  This bill, by Senate standards, is pretty small. I could sit down and \nread this bill from cover to cover in 10 to 12 minutes. It is 167 \npages, but it is great big print--let's say a half-hour. I think \nsomebody could find, from May 22 to today, a half-hour to read the \nbill. If not, if you are really slow, maybe assign several staff \nmembers and they could divide it up, 25 pages each, and give a report.\n  We could not get amendments. They said they needed more time to study \nthe bill. Then when I said why don't we try having a time when the two \ncloakrooms' staff would exchange amendments, we would have a finite \nlist of amendments--you may not want to offer all those, but we would \nhave a finite list, we could cut the amendments off, maybe 25, maybe \n250--whatever, they said: No, can't do that. We have to have time to \nstudy the bill.\n  But they did say the President had already studied it and sent us a \nstatement of administration policy. So some of the moles down in the \nadministration--I do not say that negatively, I mean people who work in \nthe bowels of the White House--have had a chance to look at this bill. \nFrom May 22 until today, they found a half-hour to look over it.\n\n  I would also say the threat of a veto doesn't work. If we passed the \nbill 10 minutes from now, the President would not have anything to \nveto. It has to go to conference with the House. That, I repeat, is \nwhere the House will work with us, work with the administration, and \ncome up with something the President will not veto.\n  Senator Byrd, Senator Stevens, some of the most senior Members of the \nSenate, have said they cannot remember an appropriations bill they \ncould not work out with a President. Senator Byrd I think has been here \nsince President Truman.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Would the Senator concur as a member of the \nAppropriations Committee, as this Senator is--I recall the hearings, \nwhich were substantial, that went into the formulation of this \nlegislation. Then I seem to recall a markup in the Appropriations \nCommittee where I believe this bill was passed something like 19 to 0.\n  Mr. REID. Every Member of the Senate who is on the committee voted \nfor the bill.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. This is not some legislation which the Democratic Party \nis somehow trying to shove past our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. In fact, Senator Stevens voted for this bill. We had unanimous \nbipartisan support in the Appropriations Committee by the people who \nfocused very closely on this and attended the many hearings that went \ninto the legislation.\n  If I understood the Senator correctly, Senator Lott as well would \njust as soon see this legislation move forward now.\n  I think it does need to be clear that this is not some sort of \npartisan, one-party-against-the-other gridlock. This is an instance \nwhere a small handful of people are using and manipulating the rules of \nthe Senate to thwart the will, not just of one political party but the \nlarge overall majority of the Senate who would wish to go forward.\n  So we have heard references to obstructionism around this Chamber \nover the course of this past year. I ask the Senator, what is the \nsource of the obstruction on this legislation and why are we not \nproceeding with it and the whole array of additional legislation which \nthe majority leader has outlined for us just today, which is daunting \nin terms of the scope and breadth of legislation this body is obligated \nto deal with in the coming couple of months. But we cannot begin to \neven move on that unless we take care of this urgent matter. That \nobstructionism appears to me to be not only a political tactic but one \nthat is a disservice to the men\n\n[[Page S4953]]\n\nand women in the uniform of this Nation, a disservice to those of us \nwho believe this Nation needs to move aggressively to prepare itself \nagainst terror.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have said and I believe Senator Lott \nsupports this legislation. I have not spoken to him in that regard. I \nhave spoken to those who have spoken to him, and that is my \nunderstanding. I do not want to put words in Senator Lott's mouth, but \nI do believe he wants this legislation passed.\n  I say to my friend from South Dakota, I very much appreciate his \nstatements. I think the perspective he has added dealing with his son \nspeaks volumes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this is our first full day back. We were \nin session yesterday. We are not off to a very strong start. I was \nhoping we could have a vigorous debate today on the supplemental; we \ncould offer amendments; we could move the process forward.\n  For those who may not be aware, we are now debating the supplemental \nappropriations for further recovery from and response to terrorist \nattacks on the United States. Let me repeat that because people ought \nto be cognizant of the gravity of the bill we are considering. It is \nthe supplemental appropriations act for further recovery from and \nresponse to terrorist attacks on the United States.\n  It includes $14 billion requested by the President of the United \nStates for the Department of Defense; $8 billion for homeland security \nefforts. It includes $5 billion for recovery in New York City. It \nincludes money for the global AIDs trust fund, and a number of very \nhigh priorities.\n  This legislation passed on a unanimous basis in the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  We are told by some of our colleagues on the other side that--I think \nthe phrase was--they wanted to ``slow walk'' this. For the life of me, \nI don't understand why our colleagues would want to slow walk a request \nby the President of the United States to address the supplemental needs \non an emergency basis for homeland defense and for the defense of our \ncountry under these circumstances. I don't understand that. But it is \nclear that is what is underway.\n  We must get this legislation passed. It must go to conference. We \nhave to get this done. We have virtually wasted an entire day. Senators \nhave not come to the floor to offer their amendments, and the calendar \npages are turning. I have shared a list of additional legislation with \nour caucus and with Senator Lott, and I must say that list is \nambitious. The Presiding Officer talked about the importance of getting \nprescription drug benefits passed. I said I would like to get that done \nbefore we complete our work this summer.\n  But it is hard to see how we can take on any priorities unless we can \ncomplete our work on an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. We \nhave been negotiating with a number of other colleagues with regard to \nthe budget and the deeming resolution that has been the subject of some \ndiscussion over the last several weeks.\n  We also must pass, at some point in the not-too-distant future, a \ndebt limit increase. That is not something anybody relishes. I \nindicated to Senator Lott this morning that if we cannot put a deeming \nmechanism in the supplemental--and I am told there is opposition on the \nother side to doing that--we will have no choice but to file a \nfreestanding debt limit resolution with the deeming language associated \nwith it. I intend to rule XIV--that is, put the legislation on the \ncalendar this week--as early as tomorrow. So we will do it one way or \nthe other. We will do it in concert with the supplemental \nappropriations bill or we will do it in a freestanding resolution. But \nit will be done. I hope our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nwork to achieve what we know must be done. So I hope we can find a way \nto resolve whatever other outstanding questions there are with regard \nto the deeming and the supplemental budget so we can move forward.\n  Mr. President, I must say that this has been a very unproductive day, \nand it is not a good beginning to what I hoped would be a very \nproductive week.\n  In order to expedite our consideration of the supplemental, I intend \nto send a cloture motion to the desk today so we might accelerate and \nbring to a close the debate on this bill so we can move to the other \npieces of legislation that must be considered, attended to, and \naddressed in a meaningful way in the short period of time we have \nduring the work period this month.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I send that cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to \na close the debate on the supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 4775:\n  Harry Reid, Patty Murray, Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein, Jack Reed, \nDick Durbin, Tim Johnson, Jeff Bingaman, Robert Torricelli, Tom Harkin, \nDaniel Akaka, Byron Dorgan, Joe Lieberman, Tom Carper, Bill Nelson, \nMaria Cantwell, Barbara Mikulski.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I had not intended to offer a cloture \nmotion this soon, but when I hear colleagues on the other side of the \naisle saying they intend to ``slow the train down''--those were the \nwords used on the Senate floor--on a bill to provide funding for \ndefense, for homeland security, and for New York City, we have no \nchoice but to accelerate the debate and bring this bill to a successful \nclose.\n  I am hopeful that, on a bipartisan basis, my colleagues will support \ncloture and that we can get this bill done this week.\n  I, very regrettably, announce that there are no more votes tonight. \nBut those Senators who are concerned about amendments are invited to \ncome to the floor early tomorrow and proceed with offering, \nconsidering, and voting on their amendments prior to the cloture vote \non Thursday. I know that on both sides there are amendments to be \noffered. Let's get on with that debate, get these amendments on the \nfloor, and let's have these votes.\n  Let's complete our work so we can move to the other pieces of \nlegislation that I know so many colleagues anticipated we would \nconsider this month and next.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record).\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the airline stabilization \nprogram is vitally important to my State, and I am pleased that we have \nreached agreement to strike a potentially threatening provision in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  Last September, we created the Airline Stabilization Loan Guarantee \nprogram to prevent a collapse of our airline industry in the wake of \nthe September 11th terrorist attacks. Such a collapse would have had a \ndisastrous effect on the national economy, and on communities \nthroughout America.\n  The loan program is a last alternative to bankruptcy for airlines \nstruggling to recover after September 11. The Air Transportation \nStabilization Board has been a strict guardian of public funds with \nrespect to the terms it has required of applicants. The program was \nintended to be a last resort for airlines and passengers when they have \nno place else to go.\n  We established the airline loan guarantee program less than 2 weeks \nafter September 11 because a number of airlines faced crushing losses \nand the threat of losing their insurance altogether. The law gives the \nairlines until\n\n[[Page S4954]]\n\nJune 28 to apply for loans because we knew the full effects of \nSeptember 11 would take at least that long to be realized. The \nairlines' continuing poor financial health has proven the case.\n  It is essential that we not undermine the industry's slow recovery by \nfreezing funding for the remainder of this fiscal year. Absent this \namendment, the supplemental would have prevented applicants from \nobtaining loan guarantees until October 1. Some major carriers, \nincluding West Virginia's most prominent airline, just can't wait that \nlong for relief. Here is why.\n  First, a freeze would have sent negative signals to the financial \nmarkets. Airline stocks are low already, and the only reason they \naren't even lower is because Wall Street is reasonably expecting \nsupport of the airlines from the loan guarantee program. Eliminating \nfunding--even if only temporarily--could signal Wall Street that the \nprogram is unstable and subject to changes in each Congress. Given the \nfinancial predicament of many airlines, these signals alone could be \ndevastating.\n  Second, airlines would not have been able to obtain commercial bridge \nloans between now and October. I know from hard experience in my \nefforts to help the steel industry that lenders do not offer bridge \nloans without a reliable Federal guarantee. Anything short of actual \nissuance of the credit instrument would be insufficient for the private \nmarket. A freeze on the loan board would have prevented this from \nhappening.\n  Without this important amendment, we were almost certain to see more \nairline bankruptcies. This would have been a terrible result, not just \nfor the airlines, but for the hundreds of communities that depend on \nthem.\n  My State of West Virginia would have been particularly hard hit, as \nwould rural regions throughout America--regions which frequently have \nlittle or no choice of airlines. The predominant airline serving West \nVirginia is US Airways, and it is expected to apply for a critically-\nneeded loan guarantee within the next couple of weeks.\n  As of March 31, US Airways had cash reserves of $561 million and was \nlosing $3.5 million per day. Airline officials said in a recent SEC \nfiling that, without the loan program, they will be forced to declare \nbankruptcy as early as this summer.\n  In Beckley, Bluefield, Parkersburg, and Morgantown, WV, US Airways is \nthe only provider of passenger air service. US Airways is the only way \nto fly from Clarksburg to Pittsburgh. It is the only way to fly from \nHuntington to Charlotte or Pittsburgh. It is also the only way to fly \nfrom Lewisburg to Charlotte or Pittsburgh. And it is the only way to \nfly from Charleston to Baltimore, Charlotte, Philadelphia, or \nPittsburgh.\n  For people all across West Virginia, US Airways is a critical \nconnection to the rest of the world, and a major force in our local \neconomy. If US Airways were to go under, the result would be a serious \nblow to my state.\n  Today's amendment is not about any one airline or state. It is about \ncommunities across the country that will suffer if airlines go \nbankrupt.\n  Last September, we decided that we could not permit the attacks of \nSeptember 11 to bring down our entire airline industry. That was the \nright decision then. And I am glad that my colleagues recognize that it \nis also the right decision today. I urge my colleagues to vote for the \namendment.\n  I should also note that today is a very proud day for my family as we \ngather for my youngest son's college graduation. I am confident the \namendment will pass by a large margin, and had I been present, I would \nhave cast my vote in support of the amendment. I am grateful for \neveryone's hard work in recent weeks to achieve this good \nresult.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of S. 2551, the 2002 Supplemental \nAppropriations Act for Further Recovery From and Response to Terrorist \nAttacks on the United States.\n  The Senate bill provides $31 billion in net, new discretionary budget \nauthority, of which $13.9 billion is for defense activities and $17.1 \nbillion is for nondefense activities. That additional budget authority \nwill increase outlays by a total of $8.43 billion in 2002. Of the total \nspending authority provided, the Appropriations Committee has \ndesignated $31.007 billion as emergency spending, which will increase \noutlays by $8.243 billion in 2002. In accordance with standard budget \npractice, the Budget Committee will adjust the Appropriations \nCommittee's allocation for emergency spending at the end of conference. \nThe Senate bill is within the committee's revised section 302(a) and \n302(b) allocations for budget authority and outlays. In addition, it \nprovides more than $1 billion less in net, nonemergency spending \nauthority than either provided by the House Appropriations Committee or \nrequested by the President.\n  The Senate bill violates section 205 of H. Con. Res. 290, the \nConcurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2001, by including \na number of emergency designations for spending on nondefense \nactivities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two tables displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   TABLE 1.--S. 2551, 2002 SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FURTHER\n  RECOVERY FROM AND RESPONSE TO TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES\n[Spending comparison--302(a) Allocations to Appropriations Committee (in\n                          millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Current\n                                    level plus      Senate    Difference\n                                   supplemental  allocations\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGeneral Purpose:\n  BA.............................      704,234       704,240          -6\n  OT.............................      686,966       692,717      -5,751\nHighways:\n  BA.............................  ............  ...........  ..........\n  OT.............................       28,489        28,489  ..........\nMass Transit:\n  BA.............................  ............  ...........  ..........\n  OT.............................        5,275         5,275  ..........\nConservation:\n  BA.............................        1,758         1,760          -2\n  OT.............................        1,392         1,473         -81\nMandatory:\n  BA.............................      358,567       358,567  ..........\n  OT.............................      350,837       350,837  ..........\n                                  --------------------------------------\n    Total:\n  BA.............................    1,064,559     1,064,567          -8\n  OT.............................    1,072,959     1,078,791     -5,832\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNotes: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

The Senate Budget Committee increases\n  the committee's 302(a) allocation for emergencies when a bill is\n  reported out of conference.\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee has allocated its remaining room\n  under its 302(a) allocation as follows: (1) $1 million in BA and $6\n  million in outlays to the Commerce, State, Justice subcommittee for\n  the conservation category, (2) $1 million in BA and $75 million in\n  outlays to the Interior subcommittee for the conservation category,\n  and (3) $6 million in BA and $5,751 million in outlays to the full\n  committee. All other subcommittees are exactly at their allocations\n  for each category.\nPrepared by SBC Majority Staff, June 3, 2002.\n\n\n   TABLE 2.--S. 2551, 2002 SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FURTHER\n  RECOVERY FROM AND RESPONSE TO TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES\n  [Spending comparisons--Senate-Reported Bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                Defense  Nondefense  Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Emergency:\n    Budget Authority.........    13,932     17,075   .........    31,007\n    Outlays..................     5,286      2,957   .........     8,243\n  Nonemergency:\n    Budget Authority.........  ........         -7   .........        -7\n    Outlays..................  ........        187   .........       187\n                              ------------------------------------------\n      Total:\n        Budget Authority.....    13,932     17,068   .........    31,000\n        Outlays..............     5,286      3,144   .........     8,430\nHouse-passed bill:\\1\\\n  Emergency:\n    Budget Authority.........    16,079     12,955   .........    29,034\n    Outlays..................     5,632      2,441   .........     8,073\n  Nonemergency:\n    Budget Authority.........       -59      1,112   .........     1,053\n    Outlays..................        -7        261   .........       254\n                              ------------------------------------------\n      Total:\n        Budget Authority.....    16,020     14,067   .........    30,087\n        Outlays..............     5,625      2,702   .........     8,327\nPresident's request:\\2\\\n  Emergency:\n    Budget Authority.........    14,048     13,095   .........    27,143\n    Outlays..................     5,310      2,491   .........     7,801\n  Nonemergency:\n    Budget Authority.........  ........      1,262   .........     1,262\n    Outlays..................        35        232   .........       267\n                              ------------------------------------------\n      Total:\n        Budget Authority.....    14,048     14,357   .........    28,405\n        Outlays..............     5,345      2,723   .........     8,068\n \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED\n             TO:\n \nHouse-passed bill:\n  Emergency:\n    Budget Authority.........    -2,147      4,120   .........     1,973\n    Outlays..................      -346        516   .........       170\n  Nonemergency:\n    Budget Authority.........        59     -1,119   .........    -1,060\n    Outlays..................         7        -74   .........        67\n                              ------------------------------------------\n      Total:\n        Budget Authority.....    -2,088      3,001   .........       913\n        Outlays..............      -339        442   .........       103\nPresident's request:\n  Emergency:\n    Budget Authority.........      -116      3,980   .........     3,864\n    Outlays..................       -24        466   .........       442\n  Nonemergency:\n    Budget Authority.........  ........     -1,269   .........    -1,269\n    Outlays..................       -35        -45   .........       -80\n                              ------------------------------------------\n      Total:\n        Budget Authority.....      -116      2,711   .........     2,595\n\n[[Page S4955]]\n\n \n        Outlays..............       -59        421   .........       362\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The table removes directives of the House Budget Committee to the\n  Congressional Budget Office on how to score certain provisions in the\n  House-passed supplemental bill.

BAILEY\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a true friend of \nOklahoma and the energy industry and a true friend of mine. Keith \nBailey, chairman of the Williams Companies, retired last month after \nleading that company for the last 29 years. Keith is a man of energy, \nof generosity and compassion, whose values have shaped Williams and set \na tone of integrity, creativity and vision for the industry throughout \nhis career. From his office in Tulsa, OK, Keith has run a global energy \ncompany with a full spectrum of energy products, services and \noperations. He has also championed innovation in the telecommunications \nindustry, overseeing the building of a nationwide communications \nnetwork, which sprang from the use of the company's former oil pipeline \nassets.\n  Keith is a respected leader in the energy industry and in the Tulsa \ncommunity. His view of corporate and personal success has always \nincluded support for people, education and charitable causes. He has \nenergetically gone about the business of supporting his community and \nhis neighbors in a quiet way, but in a measurable one. His \ncontributions of time, money and expertise have benefited hundreds in \nTulsa, in Oklahoma and thousands nationally. Keith has also provided \nleadership serving the United Way, both as campaign and board chair of \nthe Tulsa area, and on the United Way of America's Board of Governors. \nHe has also served as the chair of the Board of Trustees at the \nUniversity of Tulsa, board chair for the Philbrook Museum of Art and \nthe Board of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum. Recently, \nhe sponsored the buffalo mural project, which now adorns the capitol \nbuilding in Oklahoma City.\n  Keith places a high value on education. He served as a member of \nPresident George W. Bush's transition team on education. He has served \non the Education Task Force of the Business Roundtable and is currently \nthe chair of the National Alliance of Business and on the Board of \nAEGIS. He was actively engaged in promoting the President's education \nreform package. Three of his four children are educators, one of them \nteaching in Oklahoma.\n  Keith has been instrumental in the growth of Williams. He joined \nWilliams in 1973 and was named Chairman of the Board in 1994, when the \ncompany's assets totaled $5 billion. Today assets stand at $38 billion. \nShareholders have enjoyed a 790 percent return from 1990 to 2001. The \ncompany is listed at number 174 on the ``Fortune 500'' list this year. \nOn Bailey's watch, the company has grown to be the Nation's third \nlargest marketer of natural gas; a top 10 power marketer; North \nAmerica's second largest natural gas gatherer and producer; possessor \nof the largest petroleum storage facilities in North America; a top 10 \nindependent energy producer; and second largest gas pipeline \ntransporter in the Nation.\n  I know that for all his business achievements, shareholder return and \nasset growth, Keith Bailey clearly would like to be remembered in more \nhumanistic terms. Bailey has said, ``when I think of my time at \nWilliams, I don't think of the deals. I think of people.'' Keith Bailey \nlives the core values and beliefs of the company every day. I know he \nwill be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4955-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SYRIA ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this act recognizes the role that Syria \ncontinues to play in promoting instability and terrorism in the Middle \nEast. Syria's support for terrorism, its occupation of Lebanon and \nefforts toward the development of weapons of mass destruction threaten \nto hinder efforts to encourage democracy, the rule of law and a lasting \npeace in the region. As such, this bill represents an effort by \nCongress to express its outrage with these actions and urge President \nBush to take the needed steps that will prod Syria to halt these \nactions.\n  Syria has long been on the State Department's list of terrorist \nnations, and is known to support numerous terrorist organizations \nincluding Hizballah, Hamas and the General Command of the Popular Front \nfor the Liberation of Palestine. Just as importantly, the presence of \nSyrian troops thwarts the democratic aspirations of the Lebanese \npeople. The Taif accords which mapped out a security program for \nLebanon included Syria's commitment to the ``security independence and \nunity of Lebanon'' and its opposition to any action that ``threatens \nsecurity independence or [the] sovereignty'' of Lebanon. The current \nSyrian military presence in Lebanon and its influence in domestic \nLebanese politics runs counter to these commitments.\n  This legislation seeks to address the more pernicious elements of \nSyria's foreign policy, and I support that goal. That being said, this \nlegislation is not perfect. I am concerned that this legislation does \nnot grant the President a waiver that he might need ``in the interest \nof national security.'' In addition, some of the certification \nrequirements contained in the bill may need to be revised. When this \nlegislation comes to the floor, I will offer an amendment that \naddresses these concerns.\n  While Syria is a nation whose actions are of grave concern to me, \nSyria supported the Saudi Peace Initiative which recognized the right \nof the State of Israel to exist, and recently Syria's representative to \nthe United Nation's Security Council voted in favor of smart sanctions \nwhich will alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people while hindering \nSaddam Hussein's ability to obtain the materiel needed to support this \nefforts to obtain, develop and use weapons of mass destruction.\n  These are useful steps but pale in significance to the negative \nactions of Syria that have earned it the dubious distinction of being \none of the world's rogue states.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4955-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4955-S4956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to discuss a \nsecurity problem that exists in the Andean Trade Preference Act \nextension contained in H.R. 3009, as amended and passed by the Senate, \nand which must be addressed. The problem is that, in an understandable \neffort to support Andean economies by providing tuna export \npreferences, this bill unfairly harms the economies of Thailand, \nIndonesia, and the Philippines. Providing trade preferences to one \nally, or regional bloc, at the expense of others is patently unfair.\n  The problem this bill creates for the Philippines, and for American \ninterests in the Philippines, is particularly troublesome. The entire \ntuna industry in the Philippines is located in the southern region of \nMindanao. It is in Mindanao that Muslim terrorist cells, with reported \nties to al-Quaeda, are operating. In order to combat the terrorist \nthreat in the southern Philippines, American troops have recently been \ndeployed to Mindanao and are training Philippine forces to track down \nterrorists. Damaging the Philippines' tuna export market by tipping the \nscale in favor of other countries will damage the single largest \nemployer and increase instability in the exact area where U.S. troops \nare deployed to help create stability.\n  If that were not enough, Mindanao's tuna industry was largely created \nby U.S. and other donor nations' assistance as a means to increase \nopportunities and provide jobs for former guerrillas. This effort \nsucceeded and the majority of Muslim separatists in Mindanao have laid \ndown their arms. Disrupting Mindanao's tuna industry will not only \ncreate economic instability in a strategically sensitive region, it \nwill waste past investments of U.S. taxpayer money and could return \nsome former Muslim fighters to their violent ways.\n  I see my colleague from Alaska, the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee on the floor. He may wish to say a word about \nthis matter since he was responsible for bringing this issue to the \nattention of many Senators.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank my colleague and I agree with him about he \nseriousness of this matter. Senator Inouye and I became aware of this \nproblem on a recent trip to Asia during which we met with officials in \nBeijing, Singapore, Jakarta, and Manila. All of our meetings had one \ncommon element--terrorism. Since that trip, Senator Inouye and I have \nbeen working to find a solution to this national security problem.\n  As many of my colleagues may know, radical elements in Indonesia are \ncurrently trying to dominate the political and business communities in \nthat country. In Singapore, we were made aware of terrorist attempts to \nattack the American Embassy with a plot involving 100 tons of \nexplosives. The federal building in Oklahoma City was destroyed with \nonly 3 tons of explosives.\n  The major area of concern, however, is the Philippines, and in \nparticular the province of Mindanao where the notorious Abu Sayyaf \nGroup is kidnapping innocent people and wreaking havoc through bombings \nand murders. The general populace does not support this element, and \nhave therefore been victimized. Currently at the invitation of the \nPhilippine Government, American troops are in Mindanao advising and \ntraining Philippine troops to more effectively combat this terrorist \nthreat. The Philippines is clearly on the frontline in the war against \nterror.\n  Now, the major employee in Mindanao is the canned tuna industry. The \nbill before us will do significant harm to this industry. If the major \nemployer in Mindanao is not able to maintain economic stability, the \nchaos in Mindanao will be exacerbated. Damaging the economy of \nMindanao, as this bill will do, undermines the ongoing U.S.-Philippine \ncounter-terrorism operation. To harm an ally in the war on terror in \nthis manner clearly is not in the national security interest of the \nUnited States.\n  I strongly urge that a solution to this problem be found before the \nconference report is presented to this body.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank my colleague for that explanation and for bringing \nthis matter to the Senate's attention. I certainly will join him in \nseeking a solution to this important national security matter. The only \nfair solution is to maintain tariff parity for our anti-terrorism \nallies who compete in this market. I believe my colleague from Missouri \nwould like to make a comment.\n\n[[Page S4957]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my friend for yielding. I, too, would like to \nexpress my concern over the dire consequences extending preferential \ntariff treatment of packed tuna to the Andean region will have on our \nASEAN allies. I believe maintaining stability in Mindanao is of utmost \nimportance and I do not want to see our war on drugs succeed at the \nexpense of our war on international terrorism. I urge our colleagues to \naddress this issue during conference deliberations.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nexpressing concerns about the effects, however unintended, that the \nproposed duty-free status for Andean nations would have on the canned \ntuna industry in the Philippines. I refer specifically to the status \nthat would be accorded to canned tuna imports from Ecuador. I spoke \nduring the debate on the harm the current provisions will do to the \nPhilippine economy and how seriously it will undermine the anti-\nterrorist efforts in the Philippines and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. \nBut I want to point out again that the tuna industry in the Philippines \nis located in precisely the area where anti-terrorist efforts are most \nurgently needed.\n  Clearly a multitude of issues are involved in any trade legislation. \nThis issue is too important to be ignored and it is my hope that this \nserious problem will be resolved in the conference report when it comes \nbefore us for final passage.\n  Mr. LUGAR. For the benefit of our colleagues, I will ask that two \nrecent articles from the New York Times and one from the Asian Wall \nStreet Journal be printed in the Record at the end of this colloquy. \nThese articles detail the importance of the tuna industry to Mindanao \nand its strong connection to counter-terrorism efforts.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I appreciate my colleagues raising this national \nsecurity issue today. The unintended consequences of biasing our tuna \ntariffs against the Philippines were brought to my attention by both \nthe Philippine Ambassador, as well as through the work of my \ndistinguished colleagues. I am deeply concerned about how this bill \nwill undermine America's counter-terrorism work in Mindanao and fully \nsupport the view that this issue must be resolved before the conference \nreport is presented to the Senate.\n  Enough has already been said about how undermining Mindanao's largest \nemployer will spread instability, harm America's image, and waste past \ntaxpayer investment in a critically important region. I do not need to \nelaborate further on those points. I would like to take just a moment, \nhowever, to highlight for my colleagues how this ill-advised provision \ncame to be. The House Ways and Means Committee initially added it to \ntheir Andean trade bill. It was not part of the administration's \nrequest for Andean counter-narcotics legislation. It was added without \na hearing and without examination of the national security implications \nof making this change in trade law.\n  When the bill came before the Senate Finance Committee, the committee \nvoted to limit the extent of the preference granted to the Andean \ncountries. I supported that change as an improvement in the bill, but \nit did not go far enough to resolve the matter. I was hopeful that \nsuggestions made by Senators Inouye and Stevens might be included into \nthis bill to actually solve the problem created by this tuna provision. \nFixing this provision on the floor, however, will not now be possible. \nTherefore, I join my colleagues in urging that parity be maintained for \nall America's friends seeking to participate in our tuna market. \nTipping the balance of this market toward one group and away from \nanother is unfair, wasteful, shortsighted, and counter to America's \nbroader international interests.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, assisting Andean countries combat illicit \nnarcotics is an important national security goal for the United States. \nThe Foreign Relations Committee has heard considerable testimony from \nthe administration and other witnesses as to the importance of this \nissue, both for the United States and for the maintenance of democracy \nin South America. Much effort and resources are already being devoted \nto this important goal, and the Administration plans to do still more. \nThe Andean Trade Preferences Act extension passed by the Senate adds \nimportant additional support to this effort.\n  At the same time, however, the United States and our allies are also \nengaged in a war against terrorism. Defeating global terrorism is a \ngoal no less important than eradicating narcotics trafficking. One of \nthe frontline States in the war against terrorism is the Philippines \nwhere, at the invitation of the Philippine Government, U.S. troops have \nbeen deployed to train the Armed Forces of the Philippines in \ncounterterrorism. The reason our joint counterterrorism mission with \nthe Philippines is relevant to discussion of the Andean trade bill is \nbecause one provision contained in this bill, in a laudable effort to \nsupport the legitimate economies of Andean countries, will seriously \ndamage our counter-terrorism effort in the Philippines.\n  The problematic provision is one that would give preference to Andean \ncountries that export tuna to the United States. The primary loser in \nthe tuna market would be countries in the Asia-Pacific region, \nespecially our close treaty allies Thailand and the Philippines. \nMoreover, the Philippines' tuna industry is based in the southern \nprovince of Mindanao, precisely the region in which we are engaged in \nour counterterrorism mission. Indeed, Mindanao's tuna industry is in \npart the result of a successful U.S. foreign assistance program which \nhelped develop economic alternatives for Muslim insurgents that have \nbeen active in the region for many years. I say this economic \ndevelopment program has been successful in Mindanao because most of the \nformer insurgents have laid down their weapons and joined mainstream \nlife in the Philippines. Only the most radical remain terrorists.\n  So, in the Philippines today we have a successful counterterrorism \neffort underway that incorporates both economic incentives to give \npeople a reason to participate in civil society, and military action \nagainst the few extremists who remain committed to violence. We cannot \nafford to remove one of the pillars of this effort by giving a \ncompeting trade advantage to Andean countries. This must be corrected \nas this bill moves to conference.\n  Mr. LUGAR. As stated at the beginning of this colloquy, in addition \nto the Philippines, the economies of Thailand and Indonesia may also be \nimpacted by this bill. We are hoping the points expressed in this \ncolloquy will be addressed in conference.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the newspaper articles to \nwhich I referred earlier be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 21, 2002]\n\n     Reduced Tariffs for Some Nations Strains Relations With Others\n\n                          (By Keith Bradsher)\n\n       General Santos City, the Philippines, May 16.--How should \n     the United States set its tariffs and trade rules, globally \n     or country-by-country?\n       It is no arid academic debate to the tuna fishermen of this \n     knockabout port city on the south coast of Mindanao, nor to \n     sugar cutters in the Caribbean or garment workers in \n     Pakistan. Faraway changes in American fine print can have \n     very real, sometimes unintended consequences.\n       A move in Congress to extend trade preferences to Andean \n     nations, in part to help wean their economies off coca \n     production, could lead to the layoff of thousands of Muslim \n     workers in the tuna industry here, even as American troops \n     help the Philippine army fight Abu Sayyaf Muslim insurgents \n     in this region.\n       In Pakistan, officials have struggled to win a larger quota \n     for textile shipments to the United States as a reward for \n     Islamabad's help during the conflict in Afghanistan. And in \n     the Caribbean, the emergence of any especially pro-American \n     government brings a request for a larger quota to ship sugar \n     to the high-priced, highly protected American market.\n       By returning to the pre-1922 practice of awarding \n     preferential trade treatment to certain countries and \n     regions, often for political rather than economic reasons, \n     Washington now finds itself constantly badgered for trade \n     concessions by whatever friendly nation is in the news at any \n     given moment.\n       This is the problem that ``most favored nation'' status was \n     supposed to solve. When countries won that status--as nearly \n     all of America's trading partners did in recent decades--they \n     were assured that their exports would get the same tariff \n     treatment as any other, and that generally, concessions \n     awarded to one would be awarded to all.\n       After the ruinous bilateral trade competition in Europe in \n     the 1930's, the United States backed a global adoption of the \n     same\n\n[[Page S4958]]\n\n     approach, leading in the decades after World War II to the \n     international trade rules enshrined in the General Agreement \n     on Tariffs and Trade and later to the creation of the World \n     Trade Organization.\n       ``The history of trade negotiations basically was that, \n     because of the bilateral special deals that inevitably made \n     other nations unhappy, we came around to most-favored-nation \n     treatment and GATT negotiations,'' said William Cline, a \n     senior economist at the Institute for International Economics \n     in Washington.\n       Up through the 1980's, most economists criticized regional \n     trade agreements as just as bad as bilateral deals. Beyond \n     making winners of some countries and losers of others, \n     regional blocs can be bad for global efficiency, by promoting \n     importers to favor a higher-cost producer within the bloc \n     over a lower-cost producer outside whose goods are still \n     subject to high tariffs and quotas.\n       Global trade agreements minimize such drawbacks, because \n     these days very few countries remain outside them. But global \n     treaties are becoming increasingly difficult to conclude. The \n     last was wrapped up in Geneva in 1993; talks meant to produce \n     the next one did not get under way until last November in \n     Doha, Qatar, and are expected to take years.\n       But the regional free trade concept has become fashionable \n     again, in great part because of the success of the European \n     Union, which hugely increased trade among its 15 members by \n     eliminating tariffs and trade barriers. It helped inspire the \n     1992 North American Free Trade Agreement--joining the United \n     States, Canada and Mexico--as well as several other regional \n     groupings.\n       One provision of the Nafta treaty helped set off the \n     dispute now roiling American efforts to retain the support of \n     the Philippines in the war on terrorism.\n       Among the tariffs to be eliminated within North America by \n     the treaty is the American duty on canned tuna imported from \n     Mexico. It will not disappear until 2008, and for the moment \n     it means little because Mexico, well north of the equatorial \n     waters where the best fishing grounds are found, has a tiny \n     tuna industry. But tuna from other countries is subject to \n     duty of up to 35 percent, creating a big incentive for Mexico \n     to build up its tuna fleet, despite the high labor and fuel \n     costs for the long journeys to where the tuna swim.\n       Several smaller Central American and Caribbean nations also \n     have small tuna fleets; three years ago, Congress agreed to \n     phase out tuna duties for them on the same timetable.\n       To the Andean nations of South America, these concessions \n     posed a serious threat--that preferential access to the \n     United States would soon make big new competitors out of \n     Mexico and Central America. The United States had lower \n     tariffs on many products from Andean nations like Ecuador and \n     Colombia in 1991, but canned tuna was not among them. When \n     the 1991 concessions came up for renewal last year, the \n     Andean nations, supported by Starkist, demanded that they be \n     expanded to include canned tuna.\n       Ecuador has a huge tuna fishing fleet, and Colombia a \n     smaller one; both countries are eager to create jobs that do \n     not depend on narcotics trafficking. That persuaded the House \n     of Representatives to approve a bill earlier this year that \n     would immediately eliminate duty on Andean tuna.\n       A more limited bill that would phase out duty on about a \n     third of current shipment is before the Senate as part of a \n     broader trade bill. If it passes, differences between the \n     provisions would be worked out in a conference of senators \n     and representatives.\n       Now it is the Philippines' turn to feel threatened. Letting \n     Ecuador and Colombia, but not the Philippines, ship tuna to \n     the United States duty free would be both unfair and unwise, \n     officials in Manila are warning, because of the hardship it \n     would create in this poor, Muslim and sometimes rebellious \n     part of the country, where terrorists are believed to be \n     active. ``We understand you want to do this because of \n     narcotics,'' said Manuel A. Roxas II, the country's secretary \n     of trade and industry, ``but terrorism is just as \n     important.''\n       Washington has been on notice for some time that this kind \n     of chain reaction of anger and demands for relief was likely \n     to develop. An influential report by the United States Tariff \n     Commission foresaw that special deals for some countries \n     would ``lead to claims from states outside the agreement \n     which, if granted, defeat the purpose of the treaties, and \n     which, if not granted, occasion the preferring of a charge of \n     disloyalty to treaty obligations.''\n       The report was published in 1919.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 16, 2002]\n\n                Drugs, Terror and Tuna: How Goals Clash\n\n                          (By Keith Bradsher)\n\n       General Santos City, The Philippines, May 15.--This \n     industrial city on the southern coast of Mindanao Island \n     illustrates how America's various strategic aims in the wars \n     on drugs and terrorism can clash, alienating important allies \n     engaged in battling terrorism.\n       Among leaders of the Philippines' important tuna industry \n     here, resentment is running high over trade legislation now \n     on the Senate floor in Washington. The bill includes a \n     provision to eliminate steep import taxes on canned tuna from \n     Andean nations while keeping taxes in place for other \n     countries like the Philippines.\n       The provision has attracted Congressional support because \n     it is seen as bolstering America's war on drugs. The idea is \n     that the bill help create well-paid jobs in Ecuador and \n     Colombia as an alternative to the drug trade.\n       But in another war--the one against terrorism--the \n     legislation is causing anger in a country that has become an \n     important part of the administration's plans.\n       It comes at a time when 600 American soldiers are helping \n     the Philippine Army track Abu Sayyaf Muslim insurgents in the \n     southernmost Philippines, and President Gloria Macapagal \n     Arroyo has staked much political capital on helping the \n     United States fight terrorism.\n       Virtually all of the tuna industry of the Philippines is \n     located here and it employs thousands of migrant workers from \n     small Muslim fishing communities that used to be bastions of \n     various Muslim insurgencies. Local officials warn that the \n     legislation could wipe out the tuna industry.\n       President Arroyo said that passage of the trade provision \n     would deal a severe blow to the economy here while handing a \n     propaganda victory to the Abu Sayyaf movement.\n       The combination would create heavy domestic pressure for \n     the Philippines to retreat from its active support for the \n     American war on terrorism, she warned in a telephone \n     interview tonight.\n       ``I will try very hard not to, but I will be under \n     tremendous pressure,'' she said.\n       In much of the developing world, including Latin America \n     and Africa, trade restrictions on tariffs on products ranging \n     from steel to textiles are causing growing resentment toward \n     the United States. The perception that the Bush \n     administration is a projectionist one is growing.\n       President Arroyo argued that General Santos, the main city \n     on the southern coast of Mindanao and home to most of the \n     Philippines' tune fishing fleet and canneries, was central \n     both to the economic future of this region and to the fight \n     against terrorism.\n       A powerful pipe bomb with nails exploded on a crowded \n     sidewalk outside a supermarket here on April 21, killing 15 \n     people and wounding dozens. A second pipe bomb was safely \n     defused before it exploded at another supermarket the same \n     day, and two shopping complexes have recently burned down \n     here in the middle of the night in separate, unexplained \n     incidents.\n       Police detectives here say that they are still unsure \n     whether the attacks were terrorist incidents, criminal \n     attempts at extortion or some combination of the two. But \n     President Arroyo expresses no such doubts, saying tonight, \n     `The Abu Sayyaf has been trying to get into General Santos \n     and it has been very difficult for us to justify our support \n     for the United States.''\n       In a city where tunas festoon everything from billboards to \n     restaurant signs, and where even the golf tournament is the \n     Tuna Cup, the fishing industry's influence is impossible to \n     miss.\n       Workers heave baskets of fish onto crude steel carts, which \n     they then pull by hand over to a long open-sided shed. Women \n     wash and sort the fish on long tables, the concrete floor \n     beneath them dark and slippery with fish blood. A few larger \n     tuna, some the size of a man, are carried individually to \n     large, white boxes packed with half-melted ice, to be shipped \n     directly to Japan to be turned into sashimi.\n       Renato Alonzo, 47, a fisherman in a ragged T-shirt and \n     flip-flops whose boat had just docked after two weeks at sea, \n     said that he had sold his tiny farm and joined a boat crew 10 \n     years ago after learning he could nearly double his income, \n     to roughly $4,000 a year. Now he can afford to send his two \n     sons, aged 12 and 8, to school.\n       The bustling fishing port here and the nearby row of tuna \n     canneries contrast sharply with most of Mindanao, where \n     peasants still toil on subsistence farms and on large \n     pineapple and coconut plantations. Years of drought, coupled \n     with inadequate irrigation, have crippled agriculture while \n     the global glut of low-priced steel has forced the closing of \n     a big steel mill in northern Mindanao.\n       The tuna industry here barely existed until the late 1980's \n     when the United States led Japan, Italy and other donor \n     nations in an ambitious foreign aid program aimed at \n     rebuilding the Philippines after the fall of Ferdinand \n     Marcos.\n       A full-scale guerrilla war being waged in Mindanao then, a \n     far broader conflict than the handful of kidnappings and \n     possibly bombings linked to Abu Sayyaf now. General Santos \n     City was nearly surrounded by several very large insurgences \n     that attracted poor youths from the island's Muslim minority. \n     The city had a small fishing fleet, but it mostly caught fish \n     for local consumption.\n       But the world's richest fishing grounds lay between here \n     and Indonesia, although boats from Thailand mainly fished \n     them then. Foreign donors built the fishing port here as well \n     as a large cargo airport, a container port, extensive roads \n     and a modern phone system, hiring security guards from rebel \n     forces and buying sand, gravel and other construction \n     materials from rebel leaders' businesses.\n       With ready transportation to foreign markets, six big \n     canneries were built, each employing more than 1,000 workers. \n     The only two other tuna canneries in the Philippines are in \n     Zamboanga City in southwestern Mindanao, the staging area for \n     American troops pursuing Abu Sayyaf. Some 30,000 fishermen \n     now supply the canneries.\n       The tuna boom has helped persuade all of the rebel \n     movements except the Abu Sayyaf\n\n[[Page S4959]]\n\n     splinter group to lay down their arms under armistices with \n     the government. Many former rebel commanders and foot \n     soldiers have taken jobs at the canneries, which have had no \n     problem with the bombings that have afflicted shopping \n     centers.\n       Abuhasan Jama is a former major in the Moro National \n     Liberation Front who studied guerrilla warfare in Malaysia in \n     1979 and 1980 and then spent 13 years fighting the Philippine \n     government in the jungles of Mindanao.\n       Now he is the security chief at Ocean Canning here, his \n     eldest daughter is in college and he has found jobs at the \n     same cannery for three cousins who are also former \n     guerrillas. ``I like to work,'' said Mr. Jama, 41, recalling \n     that in the jungle ``sometimes you'd just eat leaves, the \n     roots.''\n       Mariano M. Fernandex, the general manager of Ocean Canning, \n     said that he used to carry two Smith & Wesson handguns, one \n     strapped on each hip. ``It was like the Wild West here,'' he \n     said, adding that he carries only a cellphone now.\n       Most of the tuna canned her is sold in the United States \n     under less famous brands like Keisha and Dagim. Bumble Bee \n     and Starkist used to buy large quantities of tuna here but \n     have recently begun relying on Ecuador instead, allowing that \n     country to edge past the Philippines last year to become the \n     second-largest foreign supplier of tuna to the United States, \n     after Thailand.\n       Starkist in particular is now pushing for the elimination \n     of import tariffs on canned tuna from Ecuador.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Asian Wall Street Journal, May 17, 2002]\n\nPoor Countries Find Free Trade Brings Few Gains; Tariffs on Tuna Trade \n          Snag; Philippine Fishing City: `We Were Very Naive'\n\n                           (By James Hookway)\n\n       The gospel of free trade is wearing thin in this remote \n     fishing city.\n       Freshly caught deep-sea tuna are so inexpensive here that \n     visitors buy them whole and check them in as luggage at the \n     bustling little airport. Back in Manila, passengers crowd \n     round the baggage claim, hoping for an early glipmse of their \n     catch emerging on the conveyors belt trussed up in yards of \n     plastic wrap.\n       Being so close to the rich tuna belt in the tropical waters \n     separating the Philippines and Indonesia gives General Santos \n     City a head start that is hard to beat in the fish business. \n     Sashimi and sushi aficionados in Japan prize Philippine tuna \n     for its high quality and low price. Free trade and the advent \n     of the World Trade Organization were supposed to help the \n     town build on that advantage by opening more markets for its \n     fish. Instead, Europe and the U.S. are putting up tariff \n     barriers that threaten the jobs of cannery workers here, \n     stunting economic growth in one of the most volatile corners \n     of Southeast Asia--a place where U.S. soldiers have recently \n     brought the war on terrorism.\n       And, along with a slew of recent restrictions from rich \n     nations, several of which are headed for the WTO's dispute-\n     resolution process, the tariffs are starting to sour many \n     Filipinos on the free-trade agenda their government \n     enthusiastically signed on to in the 1990s. ``We thought the \n     WTO was an idealistic thing, but nobody is abiding by its \n     true spirit,'' says Domingo Teng, who leads the local tuna \n     federation in between fishing trips. ``We were very naive.''\n       That's a perception many poorer countries are beginning to \n     share. A ground-swell of skepticism about the WTO has been \n     building steadily since the pied piper of free trade, the \n     U.S., imposed duties of as much as 30% on steel imports in \n     February. Thailand and Indonesia quickly followed suit, and a \n     month later, Malaysia imposed its own 50% steel tariff. \n     Developing countries, especially India, Pakistan and Egypt, \n     bitterly complained that the WTO hadn't done enough to \n     improve access for their products to rich markets at the \n     body's ministerial meeting in Doha, Qatar, in November. The \n     tension eased somewhat when richer countries agreed to \n     further open key agricultural, fishery and textile markets in \n     the next round of trade talks, due to conclude by the end of \n     2003.\n       Still, disappointment is rife in Asia, even among committed \n     free traders. ``There is a lot of disenchantment,'' says Alex \n     Magno, president of the Manila-based Foundation for Economic \n     Freedom. ``Free trade hasn't produced a lot of winners. What \n     we have here in the Philippines are losers, particularly in \n     garments and other labor-intensive industries. They can't \n     compete with more inexpensive producers such as China.'' This \n     resentment could worsen soon. President George W. Bush signed \n     a new U.S. farm bill this week that will boost crop and dairy \n     subsidies for American farmers. An 18-nation group of \n     agricultural exporters warns that the scale of the $180 \n     billion six-year farm-aid program will hurt farmers around \n     the world and threatens negotiations for freer world \n     trade. ``The impact will be particularly damaging on \n     developing countries,'' the group said in a statement \n     released in Geneva on Wednesday.\n       Of all the developing economies in Asia it was perhaps the \n     Philippines that most enthuisiastically embraced free trade \n     in the latter half of the 1990s. While Malaysia carefully \n     protected its car industry and Thailand and Indonesia \n     nurtured their cement markets, the Philippines accelerated a \n     series of tariff reductions. Despite foot-dragging on opening \n     up its retail industry to foreign hypermarkets, among other \n     stalled pledges, the Philippines has generally been keen to \n     shake off the shackles of a protectionist economy that left \n     the country dawdling during Asia's boom years.\n       Yet while the Philippines has benefited from investments \n     geared toward call centers and microprocessors, more \n     traditional industries that employ the bulk of the country's \n     work force have struggled. In Manilia's Divisoria market, the \n     piles of T-shirts and jeans stacked in the stalls arrive from \n     China; just a few years ago, most were made locally. Facing \n     rising unemployment at home, more and more Filipinos are \n     joining the line for visas at the U.S. Embassy in the hope of \n     joining relatives in America. ``The orthodoxy that more free \n     trade will lead to better lives has been severely \n     challenged,'' says Philippine Trade Secretary Manuel Roxas \n     II.\n       The Philippines is particularly upset with new tariff \n     barriers to the European Union. While tuna from former \n     European colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific is \n     levy-free, canned tuna from the Philippines is slapped with a \n     bruising 24% tariff. Mr. Roxas can hardly believe it. ``We \n     were a Spanish colony for 300 years,'' he says. ``What more \n     do they want?'' EU officials deny that the tariff waiver \n     hurts the Philippine tuna industry.\n       U.S. legislators, meanwhile, are moving toward reviving 10-\n     year-old reductions in import tariffs on packaged tuna, \n     textiles and cut flowers as a way to wean Ecuador, Bolivia, \n     Peru and Colombia off the drug trade. Senators are being \n     lobbied hard by H.J. Heinz Co.'s StarKist Foods to cut the \n     tariffs. StarKist fishes and cans tuna in Ecuador, and \n     cutting the Latin American tariffs will be a shot in the arm \n     for its business. It would also make Philippine tuna look \n     much more expensive.\n       Ignoring trade agreements is nothing new, of course, and \n     the WTO hasn't proven to be particularly speedy at resolving \n     trade disputes. Trade Secretary Roxas, however, is still keen \n     on giving it a go, at least for the time being. ``Let's see \n     where it gets us,'' he says. He will soon have his chance. \n     The Philippines' tuna row with Europe is headed for the WTO, \n     as is a dispute with Australia over bananas. Manila is \n     anxious to increase fruit exports to Australia, but farmers \n     there have successfully lobbied the government to keep \n     restrictions in place. Politicians in Canberra explain that \n     scientists haven't finished checking whether Philippine \n     bananas are disease-free and safe to import. The country \n     harbors five diseases, collectively known as the Black \n     Plague. Australian farmers worry that such imports could \n     decimate their crops, and government quarantine officials now \n     are conducting a risk analysis on importing the bananas, \n     which isn't likely to be completed soon. Meanwhile, \n     Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo finds it \n     difficult to contain her frustration. ``Sad to say, \n     sanitary requirements and technical standards now seem to \n     be the weapon of choice for protectionists,'' she told \n     business leaders in Malaysia.\n       But it is the tuna industry that stirs the strongest \n     passions. General Santos City, carefully mapped out just \n     before World War II, features broad, quite avenues instead of \n     the packed and pot-holed roads found in most Philippine \n     cities. But this sleepy backwater is also a place where \n     fortunes are made.\n       The source of those riches lies in the natural deep-water \n     bay the town straddles. Scores of tuna boats steam in every \n     morning to unload their cargo at the town's gleaming port, \n     sometimes after three months at sea. A kilometer or two down \n     the road, the General Tuna Corp. cannery churns out more than \n     300,000 cans of tuna a day for brands such as Chicken of the \n     Sea, Century Tuna and Fresca. Other factories line the coast \n     nearby. Outrigger boats meanwhile, head out to deeper waters \n     in the hope of landing a bluefin tuna. In Tokyo, bluefin \n     retail for around the price of a Toyota Corolla.\n       ``When I first came here in 1991, there wasn't much of \n     anything,'' recalls Neil del Rosario, plant manager at the \n     General Tuna cannery. ``Now there are hardware stores, beauty \n     parlors, restaurants. McDonald's is coming here soon. The \n     tuna industry has made such a big impact on the community.''\n       More than half of General Santos's 400,000 citizens are \n     dependent on tuna in one form or another. Mr. Teng, the head \n     of the fishing federation, says many more jobs would be \n     created if the tariffs are dropped quickly. ``This place \n     could really take off,'' he says.\n       The tuna industry can also help stabilize one of the more \n     volatile corners of Southeast Asia. Not far from General \n     Santos, about 1,000 U.S. special forces are training \n     Philippine troops to track down a Muslim guerrilla group \n     linked to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network. The Abu Sayyaf \n     has kidnapped scores of foreigners over the past few years, \n     and is currently holding hostage an American missionary \n     couple and a Filipino nurse. To the north, a larger but less \n     violent rebel army is in peace talks with the Philippine \n     government.\n       The 30-year-old uprising has killed more than 120,000 \n     people and severely retarded Mindanao's economy. The tuna \n     industry, however, helps provide jobs for Muslims who might \n     otherwise be tempted to join the decades-old rebellion \n     against Christian domination.\n       Government officials argue that if the U.S. is willing to \n     waive tariffs in Latin America to aid its war on drugs, then \n     it should also lift barriers on the Philippine tuna trade to \n     help the war on terrorism. For the time being, though, \n     General Santos will have to\n\n[[Page S4960]]\n\n     tighten its belt. General Tuna has cut back to running at 75% \n     capacity; other canneries are running at just half-time. And \n     if there isn't any work, there isn't any pay. Mr. Teng is \n     beginning to worry about the consequences of the trade war.\n       ``We need development before there is peace,'' he says. \n     ``Let's give these rebels the chance to come down out of the \n     hills. Maybe they can become millionaires too.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4960-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF MIDWAY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President today marks the 60th anniversary of the \nfirst day of a battle that is regarded as the turning point of the war \nin the Pacific and that many historians list as one of the two or three \nmost significant naval battles in recorded history. I am speaking, of \ncourse, about June 4, 1942, the beginning of the 3-day naval engagement \nknown as the Battle of Midway.\n  At 10:25 a.m. a Japanese armada including four carriers was steaming \neast toward Midway Island, 1,150 miles west of Pearl Harbor in the \nCentral Pacific. Its objectives: Invade the strategically situated \natoll, seize the U.S. base and airstrip, and (if possible) destroy what \nremained of our Pacific fleet after the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor \nthe preceding December.\n  At 10:30 a.m. three of the four Japanese carriers and their aircraft \nwere a flaming shambles. Moments before, Japanese fighter cover had \nswatted down torpedo bomber squadrons from the U.S. carriers \nEnterprise, Hornet, and Yorktown, the final, fatal mission for 35 of 41 \nAmerican planes and 68 of 82 pilots and gunners. But their courageous \nattack had drawn the fighters down to deck level, leaving the skies \nnearly empty for the 37 U.S. dive bombers who then appeared and, in \nfive fateful minutes, changed the course of history. By nightfall, the \nfourth Japanese carrier, too, was a blazing wreck, a fitting coda to a \nday that reversed forever the military fortunes of Imperial Japan.\n  ``So ended,'' wrote Churchill, ``the battle of June 4, rightly \nregarded as the turning point of the war in the Pacific.'' ``The annals \nof war at sea,'' he intoned, ``present no more intense, heart-shaking \nshock'' than Midway and its precursor in the Coral Sea, battles where \n``the bravery and self-devotion of the American airmen and sailors and \nthe nerve and skill of their leaders was the foundation of all.''\n  Few today pause to remember Midway, now six decades past. And I call \nthe Senate's attention to this for it was indeed a turning point in a \nwar that to that point had few bright spots, and which launched us on \nthe road to eventual victory.\n  I'd also like to call attention to one American who's nerve and skill \nwere paramount in leading American forces to this pivotal victory which \nsaw the demise of the four carriers that had attacked Pearl Harbor six \nmonths earlier. Raymond Ames Spruance was an unlikely figure, a little-\nknown, soft-spoken, publicity-averse 56-year-old Rear Admiral from \nIndiana. Yet it is doubtful that any other American in uniform \ncontributed more than this quiet Hoosier to our World War II triumph--a \nfoundation for every blessing of peace and prosperity we now enjoy.\n  When I was 13, I heard Admiral Spruance speak. He was visiting \nShortridge High School in Indianapolis, his alma mater and soon to be \nmine. Only years later did I really understand how important he had \nbeen to achieving victory in the Pacific and subsequent victories, \nincluding 1945's hard-fought invasion of Iwo Jima. It was Spruance who \nmade the crucial decision at Midway to launch all available aircraft, \nwhich led to devastation of the enemy carriers. He then preserved the \nvictory, instinctively resisting Japanese attempts during the next two \ndays to lure the American fleet into a trap.\n  Throughout Spruance's 45-year Navy career, he maintained the \nunassuming attitude that downplayed his own role at Midway. And, unlike \nsome of his contemporaries, Spruance avoided self-promotion. One \nconsequence was that he forwent levels of recognition accorded others.\n  As you may be aware, near the end of the war, Congress authorized \nfour five-star positions each in the Army and Navy. The new Generals of \nthe Army were George Marshall, Douglas MacArthur, Dwight Eisenhower and \nHenry ``Hap'' Arnold. The first three five-star Admirals were Chester \nNimitz, Ernest King, and William Daniel Leahy. But an internal battle \nraged for months over whether the fourth Fleet Admiral would be the \ncolorful William ``Bull'' Halsey (who was ultimately selected) or his \nless flamboyant colleague, the victor at Midway. Later, when Congress \nauthorized another five-star post for the ``GI General,'' Omar Bradley, \nit overlooked creating a fifth Navy five-star opening, which \nunquestionably would have gone to Bradley's ocean-going counterpart, \nRaymond Spruance.\n  Among all the War's combat admirals ``there was no one to equal \nSpruance,'' wrote famed Navy historian Samuel Morison. ``He envied no \nman, regarded no one as rival, won the respect of all with whom he came \nin contact, and went ahead in his quiet way winning victories for his \ncountry.''\n  As some of you know, I introduced legislation to correct this \noversight. Some of you have joined me in sponsoring S. 508, and I \nencourage my other colleagues to do the same because what we choose to \nhonor says a great deal about who we are. Like many of the veterans of \nthe Battle of Midway, Raymond Spruance's humility and character stand \nin contrast to much of what our political and popular culture \n``honors'' today. Much of what our political and popular culture \n``honors'' today, with celebrity and fortune and swarms of media \nattention, is the foolish and flighty, the sensational and self-\nindulgent. Too often, the pursuits made possible by freedom are \nunworthy of the sacrifices that preserved freedom itself.\n  No one lived the values of freedom and service more fully or nobly, \nand with less thought of personal fame, than Raymond Spruance. On any \nlist of the great Allied military leaders of World War II, his \ncharacter and his contributions stand in the very first rank. It is \nfitting and proper for us now to award him rank commensurate with his \ncharacter and contributions.\n  When complimented on Midway years after the War, Spruance said, \n``There were a hundred Spruances in the Navy. They just happened to \npick me for the job.'' Herman Wouk's masterful ``War And Remembrance'' \nhas the best rejoinder, which the author puts in the mouth of a \nfictional wartime adversary: ``In fact, there was only one Spruance and \nluck gave him, at a fateful hour, to America.''\n  In June 1942, all of America drew strength from the victory at \nMidway. Today, the nation and the Naval service celebrate that victory \nand we continue to draw strength from the brave contributions of the \nmen who nobly fought 60 years ago and those who there made the ultimate \nsacrifice as they turned the tide of a very perilous war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4960-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4960-S4961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SPOKANE TRIBE OF INDIANS OF THE SPOKANE RESERVATION GRAND COULEE DAM \n                 EQUITABLE COMPENSATION SETTLEMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, on Thursday, May 23, 2002, I, along with \nmy distinguished colleagues Senator Murray from Washington State and \nSenator Inouye from Hawaii, introduced the Spokane Tribe of Indians of \nthe Spokane Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Equitable Compensation Act. In \n1994, Congress passed legislation providing the Confederated Tribes of \nthe Colville Reservation with a settlement for the losses the tribe \nincurred from the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam. The legislation \nwe are introducing today will provide a proportional settlement for \nsimilar losses experienced by the Spokane Tribe.\n  The Grand Coulee Dam is an integral part of the Northwest's power \nscheme. As the largest concrete dam in the world and the world's third \nlargest producer of electricity, the Grand Coulee Dam enables the \nBonneville Power Administration, BPA, to fulfill its legal obligation \nof providing the Northwest with an ``adequate, efficient, economical \nand reliable power supply.'' My state and all of BPA's customers \ngreatly benefit from the Grand Coulee Dam.\n  Since the beginning of the project in the early 1930s, Federal \nofficials acknowledged that the tribes affected by the construction of \nthe dam were entitled to compensation for their losses. The Spokane \nTribe is now asking Congress to follow through on that promise.\n\n[[Page S4961]]\n\n  The Colville Tribe already receives an annual payment in perpetuity \nof approximately $15 million, plus the one-time payment of $53 million. \nThe Spokane Tribe lost an area that is 39.4 percent the size of the \nColville loss, and although the Spokane Tribe did not settle at the \ntime of the Colvilles in 1994, the Administration and Congress have \ncontinued to echo the belief held since the 1930s: that the Spokane \nTribe, which was affected by the construction of Grand Coulee along \nwith the Colvilles, is deserving of equitable compensation.\n  During the Colville Settlement hearing in 1994, Senators Murray, \nInouye, McCain, and Bradley stated repeatedly that, while the United \nStates was not settling with the Spokane Tribe at that time, the United \nStates had the obligation to provide equitable compensation to Spokane \nTribe. Just like the Colville Tribe, the Spokane Tribe's lands, fishing \neconomy and culture were significantly impacted.\n  We are here today because the Spokane Tribe and the Bonneville Power \nAdministration have been unable to reach a settlement that is mutually \nagreeable to both parties during its negotiations thus far.\n  I believe that that the United States has a moral obligation to \nsettle with the Spokane Tribe just as it settled with the Colville \nTribe. I am eager to see a fair settlement go forward. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on May 23, 2002, I was pleased to \nintroduce with Senators Cantwell and Inouye, ``The Spokane Tribe of \nIndians of the Spokane Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Equitable \nCompensation Act.'' This bill will provide compensation to the Spokane \nTribe for its contribution to the production of hydropower by the Grand \nCoulee Dam. This legislation, S. 2567, is very similar to S. 1525, \nwhich Senator Inouye and I introduced in the first session of the 106th \nCongress.\n  The Grand Coulee Dam is the largest concrete dam in the world, the \nlargest electricity producer in the United States, and the third \nlargest electricity producer in the world. It provides electricity and \nwater to one of the world's largest irrigation projects, the one \nmillion acre Columbia Basin Project. The Grand Coulee is the backbone \nof the Northwest's Federal power grid and agricultural economy. The Dam \nhas provided and continues to provide tremendous economic benefits to \nthe region.\n  But for the native peoples of this region, the construction of the \nGrand Coulee Dam came at a very high price. To the Spokane Tribe, the \nDam meant an end to a way of life. The dam flooded the Tribe's \nreservation on two sides. The Spokane River changed from a free flowing \nwaterway that supported plentiful salmon runs to barren slack water \nthat now erodes the southern lands of the reservation. The benefits \nthat accrued to the nation and the Northwest were made possible by \nuncompensated injury to the Native Americans of the Columbia and \nSpokane Rivers.\n  In 1994, Congress enacted settlement legislation to compensate the \nneighboring Confederated Colville Tribes. That legislation provided a \nonetime payment of $53 million for past damages and approximately $15 \nmillion annually from the proceeds from the sale of hydropower by the \nBonneville Power Administration, (BPA).\n  The Spokane Tribe settlement legislation would provide a settlement \nproportional to that provided to the Colville Tribes, which was based \non the percentage of lands appropriated from the respective tribes for \nthe dam. This translates into 39.4 percent of the past and future \ncompensation awarded the Colville Tribes. S. 2567 would provide a one-\ntime payment of approximately $21 million from the General Treasury as \ncompensation for past damages. The bill would provide from BPA about \n$10 million to the Tribe to account for payments the Colvilles have \nreceived since 1995. In addition, the legislation would direct BPA to \nallocate approximately $6 million annually to the Spokanes.\n  Since the 1970s, Congress and Federal agencies have indicated that \nboth the Colville and Spokane Tribes should be compensated. Since 1994, \nwhen an agreement was reached to compensate the Colville Tribes, \nCongress and Federal agencies have expressed interest in providing fair \ncompensation to the Spokane Tribe, too. This legislation will provide \nfor a long overdue settlement for the Spokane Tribe. I hope my \ncolleagues will support this bill. I also hope the Senate Indian \nAffairs Committee will hold a hearing on S. 2567 at the Chairman's \nearliest convenience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4961-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n TRIBUTE TO TIBURON FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT FIRE CHIEF ROSEMARY BLISS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I recognize and pay tribute \nto Rosemary Bliss, fire chief for Tiburon Fire Protection District in \nmy home county of Marin, CA, as she prepares to retire after 30 years \nin firefighting.\n  Chief Bliss is truly a credit to firefighting. When highlighting the \ncareer of Chief Rosemary Bliss, the word ``first'' features \nprominently. Chief Bliss joined the Tiburon Fire Protection District as \nfire marshal in 1981. She was the first female fire marshal for Marin \nCounty. When she was promoted from fire marshal to fire chief in 1993, \nshe became California's first woman career fire chief. And, notably, in \n1973 when she began her career in firefighting, she was the first woman \nfirefighter with the Chatauqua Volunteer Fire Department in New York. \nChief Bliss set an example from the very beginning of her career that \npaved the way for many other women in firefighting.\n  During her time with the Tiburon Fire Protection District, she worked \nto ensure the completion of the new fire headquarters on Tiburon \nBoulevard. Before the new headquarters, the firefighters worked out of \nan old gas station and an old railroad building. Chief Bliss' \ndedication and achievements are truly exceptional and worthy of \nrecognition.\n  I am honored to congratulate and pay tribute to her, and I invite my \ncolleagues to join me in conveying best wishes to Fire Chief Rosemary \nBliss as she closes one remarkable chapter of her life and embarks on a \nnew path.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4961-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4961-S4962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NORTH KOREA\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask that the following article \nby Robert Cohen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, \nregarding the humanitarian crisis in North Korea be printed in the \nRecord. This article should have been referenced in my floor statement \nof May 20, 2002, also on North Korea.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 16, 2002]\n\n                        Aid Meant for the Hungry\n\n                           (By Roberta Cohen)\n\n       Washington.--Hunger still threatens millions in North \n     Korea, and one symptom of the harsh conditions is the \n     desperation of North Korean refugees trying in the past few \n     days to elude Chinese police and seek asylum at American and \n     Japanese consulates in China. As the Bush administration \n     prepares to restart talks with North Korea, food, as well as \n     weapons and troops, should be on the agenda. Despite the \n     tense relationship between the two countries, the United \n     States is the leading donor of food to North Korea, which \n     cannot feed its 22 million people. American negotiators \n     should insist on assurances that this aid is reaching those \n     most in need.\n       Since 1995, the United States has provided more than $500 \n     million in food and other commodities to North Korea--up to \n     350,000 metric tons of food each year. This year this aid is \n     down to 155,000 metric tons because of demands for aid in \n     Afghanistan; other countries are also sending less to North \n     Korea. But American deliveries of food and fuel remain \n     critical to Pyongyang. Sending food aid has helped the United \n     States persuade the North Koreans to engage in talks on \n     military-strategic issues. The aid also shores up the \n     Pyongyang regime, which Washington would rather see improve \n     than collapse, since sudden disintegration could overwhelm \n     South Korea with refugees and create political and economic \n     turmoil. But there is also an overriding humanitarian \n     imperative. More than 2 million North Koreans are reported to \n     have died from starvation and related diseases between 1994 \n     and 1998, and large pockets of hunger and starvation remain. \n     At least 40 percent of children under 5 are malnourished, \n     according to the World Food Program, a United Nations agency.\n       No one really knows, however, how much donated food is \n     diverted to the North Korean military, police, Communist \n     Party officials, essential workers and those loyal to the \n     regime. The World Food Program argues that food aid is not \n     going to the military because the military has the first cut \n     from national harvests. But the agency has no evidence \n     because there is no independent monitoring of donated food. \n     As the main conduit of American aid, the World Food Program \n     has managed to increase the number of North Korean counties \n     it can visit to 163, but its staff is\n\n[[Page S4962]]\n\n     barred from more than 40, and its visits everywhere are \n     supervised. It cannot make random spot checks or bring its \n     own Korean-language interpreters or visit farmers' markets \n     where it could find out whether its food aid is being sold on \n     the black market. At a Congressional hearing this month, the \n     World Food Program claimed to have a ``reasonable degree of \n     assurance'' that the food was getting to those who need it. \n     But others at the hearing strongly disagreed. ``Anyone who \n     has sat and talked to the North Korean refugees would find it \n     really difficult to believe the assurances of the W.F.P.,'' \n     Sophie Delaunay, North Korean project representative for \n     Doctors Without Borders, told Congress. In interviews by \n     humanitarian groups and journalists in the past few years, \n     refugees among the 100,000 to 200,000 who fled to China in \n     search of food have said that they never got any donated \n     food in North Korea and that the regime has denied food \n     aid to those whose loyalty it questions.\n       It is time for the United States to set some standards. \n     America must not be complicit in food distribution that \n     favors some and discriminates against others. In the coming \n     negotiations, the United States should insist upon \n     unrestricted access to all areas of the country where food is \n     delivered. It should require lists of the actual institutions \n     to which food and medicines are going and uncontrolled access \n     for the World Food Program. It should press the North Korean \n     government to allow international aid groups to set up \n     feeding stations of their own that are accessible to all \n     hungry North Koreans. The precarious situation of the North \n     Koreans who have crossed into China should also be on the \n     table.

Mr. President, today I recognize James Johnson \nupon his retirement from DaimlerChrysler and as president of UAW Local \n1183 in Newark, Delaware after more than thirty-eight years of \ndedicated service. Known to friends and colleagues alike as ``JJ,'' he \nis a man with a kind heart, diverse interests and great abilities. JJ \nembodies the best of Delaware, the UAW and the America worker.\n  JJ joined Chrysler as an assembler in 1964 and affiliated with UAW \nLocal 1183. Over time, he began to work his way up through the \nleadership ranks of his local. By the 1980's, he had been elected a \ncommitteeman, and he served as a facilitator for the negotiation of the \nassembly plant's historic Modern Operating Agreement. His leadership \nability apparent, he continued to climb the leadership ladder. \nBeginning in the early 1990's, his brothers and sisters of Local 1183 \nelected him as their vice-president three times, a post that he held \nfor eight years. Then, in June of 2001, JJ assumed the post of \npresident of his local, a leadership position that he has held until \nhis retirement.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing JJ for more than two decades. We \nfirst worked together when I was Delaware's state treasurer in 1980 and \nnegotiated the state's loan to Chrysler during the company's darkest \nhours. Right from the start, JJ impressed me as one who possessed the \nqualities of a leader. He was interested in doing what was right. He \nbelieved in doing things well. He followed the Golden Rule, treating \nothers the way he wanted to be treated. He was adept at hammering out \ncompromises, but when he knew he was right, he was loath to give up. \nNever boisterous or overbearing, JJ's quiet confidence helped to make \nhim an effective advocate for his members and won the respect of \nChrysler's management team at their Newark, Delaware assembly plant. I \nespecially respected his willingness to share the credit when things \nwent right, while assuming the blame when things went wrong.\n  JJ deserves a good deal of the credit for helping to foster the \npositive relationship between labor and management that is the hallmark \nof DaimlerChrysler's Newark assembly plant. The rapport he helped to \nestablish has served to preserve the plant during an era when many \nother automotive plants were closed due to over-capacity. Under his \nleadership, an atmosphere of cooperation emerged to replace the \natmosphere of confrontation that had earlier existed. Under his \nwatchful eye, quality products were built and productivity was enhanced \nas labor and management learned to work together towards common goals.\n  JJ has been a respected colleague for over half of his life, and he \nremains a trusted friend to many. He takes pride in his work and has \nmade thousands of autoworkers proud to work alongside of him. I thank \nhim for his friendship, congratulate him on a successful first career \nand wish him and his family only the very best in all that lies ahead \nfor him and for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4962-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO FARMERS NATIONAL BANK OF LEBANON\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise among my colleagues today \nto duly honor Farmers National Bank of Lebanon, KY. For well over a \ncentury, Farmers National Bank has provided the people of Lebanon with \nquality financial and social services.\n  Founded in 1890 by T.S. Edelen and a group of local citizens, Farmers \nNational Bank officially opened its doors to the public on April 1, \n1890 with a capitalization of $50,000. In 1914, the bank joined the \nFederal Reserve System, and in 1917 it purchased the property it had \nrented on Main Street since its opening morning. During the depression \nof the 1930s, banks across the Nation and Kentucky were forced to close \ntheir doors to their respective communities due to a lack of financial \nassets. Farmers National Bank of Lebanon stayed financially strong \nduring even the darkest days of the great depression and remained open \nthroughout. Today, led by president Gene Spragens who took over control \nin 1950 after serving 28 years as bookkeeper for the bank, Farmers \nNational Bank has 26 employees and assets of $88 million; pretty \nimpressive for a bank which started off with a mere $50,000.\n  Besides the financial services it has provided since 1890, Farmers \nNational Bank of Lebanon has also worked extremely hard to promote the \nperforming arts in the local community. Over the years, programs have \nincluded pianists, string quarters and even a chorus with an orchestra. \nGene Spragens firmly believes that a bank has a responsibility to the \npeople to make a community as prosperous financially and socially as \npossible. Whether it be a much needed home loan or a aesthetically \nmoving piano recital, Farmers National Bank is working for the people \nof Lebanon.\n  In this day and age, locally owned, community oriented businesses are \nfew and far between. For over 100 years now, Farmers National Bank of \nLebanon has remained just this. They have been through good times and \nbad times. They have gone blow-for-blow with the hands of time and \nsurvived even the most difficult of circumstances. I ask that my \ncolleagues join me in thanking everyone involved with Farmers National \nBank of Lebanon over the last 112 years for their dedicated service to \nthe betterment of the Lebanon community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4962-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4962-S4963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN HONOR OF DR. NORMAN SAMUELS\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I recognize Dr. Norman \nSamuels, who has served as the Provost of the Newark Campus of Rutgers, \nthe State University of New Jersey for the past 20 years. Dr. Samuels \nis retiring from his position as Provost after 20 years of outstanding \nservice.\n  Dr. Samuels has been a member of the Rutgers-Newark family since \n1967, when he first joined the university as an assistant professor of \nPolitical Science. He then proceeded to serve as Associate Dean for \nAcademic Affairs at the Rutgers Newark College of Arts and Sciences, \nNCAS, from 1971-76; as Dean of NCAS from 1976-82; and as Provost since \n1982.\n  During his tenure as Provost, Dr. Samuels has directed the \ndevelopment of the Newark campus into a major national research \nuniversity center with extensive undergraduate, graduate, professional \nand outreach programs. It has been Dr. Samuels' vision and dedication \nto create an inspiring new atmosphere in Newark, along with his \ncommitment to establish an imaginative urban educational enterprise \nthat has led to Rutgers-Newark becoming what it is today. As a result \nof his many fine efforts, Rutgers-Newark is ranked first among national \nuniversities in diversity by U.S. News and World Report and has held \nthat title\n\n[[Page S4963]]\n\never since the magazine created that category.\n  Dr. Samuels, a native of Montreal, Quebec, received his B.A. from \nMcGill University, and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Duke University. He \ncurrently resides in West Orange with his wife Sandra, a physician in \nthe Rutgers-Newark's student health center. In his post-retirement \nlife, Dr. Samuels plans a return to teaching as a political science \nprofessor at Rutgers-Newark.\n  So I join with Newark Campus of Rutgers University in recognizing Dr. \nNorman Samuels, a visionary who helped steer the University from its \ndifficult days of civil unrest to its current burgeoning resurgence. On \nthe campus of Rutgers-Newark, no one person has had a greater hand in \nRutgers' commitment to its students and the City than Dr. Samuels. He \nis to be saluted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4963-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak \nabout hate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in \nMarch of last year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 7, \n1991 in New York, NY. A gay man was attacked and beaten with a bottle. \nThe assailant shouted anti-gay epithets toward the victim and his \ncompanion. Lahosha Duggins, 19, was arrested in connection with the \nincident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4963-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF SHARON MONSKY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take this moment to \nreflect on the life of Sharon Monsky. I feel proud and fortunate to \nhave known Sharon, who was a wonderfully effective advocate for those \nwho suffer from scleroderma. Scleroderma is an autoimmune disease that \naffects primarily women.\n  As a strong supporter of her important mission, I was profoundly \nsaddened to learn that, at the age of 48, Sharon Monsky died of \ncomplications from scleroderma on May 11 in Santa Barbara, CA. Her \nstrong passion for finding a cure for scleroderma has helped raise \nawareness and has made a tremendous impact on the lives of many of \nthose living with this devastating disease.\n  Born in Omaha, NE, Sharon Monsky was a nationally ranked figure \nskater during her teenage years, and later graduated at the top of her \nclass from Pitzer College in Claremont. After earning a BA in \neconomics, she began a career at McKinsey & Co., an international \nmanagement-consulting firm in San Francisco, and received an MBA from \nStanford University. However, her career took a different path when \nMonsky developed scleroderma in 1981.\n  Determined to win her battle with scleroderma and help others \nsuffering from the disease, Sharon Monsky decided to devote her life to \nfinding a cure. In 1986, she found the Scleroderma Research Foundation, \nwhich has raised more than $14 million and funds two research centers: \nthe San Francisco Bay Area Scleroderma Center at the University of \nCalifornia at San Francisco and the East Coast Scleroderma Research \nCenter at John Hopkins University. Monsky received many awards for her \nwork, including Research America's National Volunteer Advocacy Award, \nthe America's Award and the American Medical Association's \nInternational Health and Medical Film Award.\n  Sharon Monsky's tragic death represents a great loss for California \nand the Nation. She served as a powerful voice for those stricken with \nscleroderma, and will be deeply missed by me and by all those who were \nprivileged to have known her. Although Sharon Monsky ultimately lost \nher battle with this disease, she has helped make it possible to \nprevail against this disease. I will never forget her moving words, \ncompassionate heart and enduring strength. Her spirit will continue to \ninspire us all for generations to come.\n  I owe her a great debt for involving me in the fight against \nscleroderma. My heart goes out to her beautiful family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4963-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IN RECOGNITION OF DR. ANNEMARIE ROEPER AND THE ROEPER SCHOOL\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Dr. \nAnnemarie Roeper on her seven decades of making a difference in the \nfield of education including the success of The Roeper School for 60 \nyears of academic excellence. Dr. Roeper and her school have given \nselflessly to the Michigan community.\n  As the horrors of World War II ravaged Europe, Annemarie Roeper and \nGeorge (deceased) fled their native Germany for America in 1941; a year \nlater they founded The Roeper School. Prescient in its design, the \nmission of The Roeper School was groundbreaking in 1942 and is \nespecially relevant in the aftermath of September 11 as an institution \ndedicated to teaching the values of basic human rights, membership in a \nglobal community, and awareness of self. The curriculum fosters a \ncompassionate environment in grades K-12, that seeks to form students \ninto curious and socially responsible citizens and respectful adults.\n  Today, America faces challenges unforseen by its founding fathers. \nOne of the keys to meeting and conquering these challenges lies in the \ninstitutions that have the great task of formulating dynamic and \nrelevant methods to educate our youth. In that regard, The Roeper \nSchool has been a resounding success. This year, six seniors have been \nselected as finalists in either the National Merit Scholarship Awards, \nNational Achievement Scholarship Awards, or the National Hispanic \nScholarship Award. These achievements would have been impossible \nwithout the hard work and conviction of Dr. Annemarie Roeper.\n  As Dr. Roeper enters her seventh decade of education, she has created \na legacy of positive achievement. The Roeper School stands as a \ntestament to her contributions in forming an environment of mutual \nrespect and understanding. That testament grows even to this day as the \nschool's Capital Campaign seeks to expand Dr. Roeper's dream to enlarge \nthe school. Her selfless dedication has built The Roeper School into an \ninstitution that not only educates our children but challenges them to \ntake hold of their future and design a truly multi-cultural and \npeaceful society.\n  I am sure that the staff, teachers, students, and family of Dr. \nAnnemarie Roeper are extremely proud of her accomplishments. In \naddition I would like to give my own heartfelt congratulations and \nthanks. I know that my Senate colleagues join me in celebrating the \nhard work of Dr. Roeper.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4963-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4963-S4964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ``WE THE PEOPLE . . .

Under the direction of teacher Patrick Gainey, these students \nhad an outstanding performance in the ``We the People . . . The Citizen \nand the Constitution'' national finals held in Washington, D.C. May 4-\n6, 2002.\n  This program, which is administered by the Center for Civic \nEducation, is the most extensive of its kind, reaching more than 26.5 \nmillion students at elementary, middle, and high schools throughout the \nNation. These outstanding young people competed against 50 other \nclasses from all across the Nation. Their extraordinary interest and \ndedication to learning and\n\n[[Page S4964]]\n\nstudying are demonstrated in their remarkable understanding of the \nfundamental ideals and values of American constitutional government.\n  The national finals competition simulates a congressional hearing in \nwhich high school students testify as constitutional experts before a \npanel of judges. Not only does this program encourage learning, but it \nalso gives the students a chance to articulate what it is they have \nlearned. In order to speak intelligently about any subject, it is \nimportant to be well-prepared, and these students have done just that. \nThey have dedicated time and hard work, and have committed themselves \nto performing to their best abilities.\n  The preparation and dedication the students of Spearfish High School \ncommitted to the national final competition is to be commended. All of \nSouth Dakota is proud of their performance. They represented our state \nwith tremendous poise and motivation. Their success is an example for \nother talented young people to emulate.\n  Again, congratulations to Spearfish High School for their outstanding \nperformance in the ``We the People . . .

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to share \nwith the Senate the accomplishments of one of my constituents, Belinda \nGuadarrama, of Petaluma.\n  It is my great pleasure to honor the tremendous contributions Ms. \nGudarrama has made to our economy. She has been recognized by the Small \nBusiness Administration as the California Small Business Person of the \nYear for 2002.\n  In 1986, Ms. Guadarrama started GC Micro with two employees, $20,000 \nand some money from a retirement account. Through her hard work, \ndiligence and business acumen, the firm is now one of the Nation's \nleading suppliers of computer hardware and software products to the \ndefense and aerospace industries. Today the company employs 28 people \nand sales last year topped $34 million.\n  Building GC Micro from the ground up was not easy. When Ms. \nGuadarrama applied for a $5,000 loan for her company, a bank laughed at \nher lack of collateral. However, Ms. Guadarrama persevered.\n  Through hard work and a passion for customer service, Belinda \novercame the perception that a minority woman couldn't make it in the \ncompetitive field of technology and marketing to defense-related \ncontractors. She never gave up and her success is a testament to her \ndetermination.\n  Ms. Guadarrama has been a strong advocate for minority business \ndevelopment in America. In working with the National Association of \nSmall Disadvantaged Businesses, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and \nthe Hispanic Business CEO Roundtable, she effectively brings the \nconcerns of the minority business community to the attention of the \nmedia and policy makers.\n  Belinda's story has been an inspiration to many Latinas.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the \nArkansas Army National Guard Task Force 2-153--or as they're more \ncommonly known, the Arkansas Gunslingers.\n  The Gunslingers were mobilized on October 8, 2001. After a brief \nperiod of training in Fort Carson, Colorado, the 529-member unit was \ndeployed to Sinai, Egypt, as the first pure National Guard unit in \nhistory to serve as part of a ``Multinational Force and Observer'' \nmission in this region. In this peacekeeping capacity, the Gunslingers \ntask force is responsible for observing and reporting activity along \nthe eastern side of the Sinai peninsula. This zone includes the desert \nmountains and coastal areas from Eilat, Israel, to the southern tip of \nthe peninsula along the Gulf of Aqaba.\n  Time does not permit me to recognize by name each of the dedicated \nmen and women of the Gunslingers Task Force, though they all deserve \nsuch recognition for the sacrifices they make in service to their \ncountry. However, I do want to take a moment to pay special tribute to \nTask Force Commander Lieutenant Colonel Steve Womack. When not serving \nwith the Task Force, Steve also serves as mayor of the city of Rogers, \nArkansas. His commitment to public service, both in uniform and as a \ncivilian, sets an example for all of us, and he stands as a wonderful \nrepresentative of the values that animate the entire Gunslingers unit. \nI am proud to recognize him and his fellow Guardsmen on the floor of \nthis body today.\n  Today we face tremendous challenges in the world arena, as the threat \nof international terrorism has brought heightened tensions both at home \nand abroad. In such an uncertain time, it is reassuring to know that we \nhave dedicated soldiers such as the Gunslingers to ensure a stable and \npeaceful international order. I ask that all my colleagues in the U.S. \nSenate join me in expressing our gratitude to the Gunslingers Task \nForce.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4964-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4964-S4965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF JAMES JOHNSON'S RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. CARPER.

He followed the Golden Rule, treating \nothers the way he wanted to be treated. He was adept at hammering out \ncompromises, but when he knew he was right, he was loath to give up. \nNever boisterous or overbearing, JJ's quiet confidence helped to make \nhim an effective advocate for his members and won the respect of \nChrysler's management team at their Newark, DE assembly plant. I \nespecially respected his willingness to share the credit when things \nwent right, while assuming the blame when things went wrong.\n  JJ deserves a good deal of the credit for helping to foster the \npositive relationship between labor and management that is the hallmark \nof DaimlerChrysler's Newark assembly plant. The rapport he helped to \nestablish has served to preserve the plant during an era when many \nother automotive plants were closed due to over-capacity. Under his \nleadership, an atmosphere of cooperation emerged to replace the \natmosphere of confrontation that had earlier existed. Under his \nwatchful eye, quality products were built and productivity was enhanced \nas labor and management learned to work together towards common goals.\n  JJ has been a respected colleague for over half of his life, and he \nremains a trusted friend to many. He takes pride in his work and has \nmade thousands of autoworkers proud to work alongside him. I thank him \nfor his friendship, congratulate him on a successful first career and \nwish him and his family only the very best in all that lies ahead for \nhim and for them.\n\n[[Page S4965]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4965-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF RICHARD SYLBERT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to reflect on the rich life \nand memory of Richard Sylbert, an admired and talented production \ndesigner, whose work made a tremendous impact on the entertainment \nindustry and on the lives of so many.\n  At the age of 73, Richard Sylbert died on March 23, 2002 of cancer in \nWoodland Hills, CA. Richard, through his remarkable creativity and \nimagination, helped bring more than 40 stories to the screen, including \n``Chinatown,'' ``Dick Tracy,'' ``The Graduate'' and ``Who's Afraid of \nVirginia Woolf.'' He was a true visionary.\n  Born in Brooklyn in 1928, Sylbert served our country in Korea and \nattended the Tyler School of Art at Temple University before returning \nto his home state of New York. In 1954, he got a job painting scenery \nat NBC. He started working on films 2 years later, and collaborated \nwith his twin brother Paul as an art director for ``Baby Doll.'' In \n1975, he became the vice president in charge of production at \nParamount, marking the first and only time a production designer headed \nproduction at a major motion picture studio. After he left Paramount, \nthe two-time Academy Award winner continued to work in film and \ntelevision, making each piece of work compelling and moving.\n  I extend my deepest condolences to Richard's family, friends, and all \nthose touched by his work. His career spanned four decades, and was \nextremely versatile and varied in scope. Although Richard is no longer \nwith us, his lasting contributions to entertainment are forever \ndocumented in works we will enjoy for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4965-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4965-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4965-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COMMODITY CREDIT CORPORATION FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                              2000--PM 88\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry:\n\n       To the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the provisions of section 13, Public Law 806, 80th \nCongress (15 U.S.C. 714k), I transmit herewith the report of the \nCommodity Credit Corporation for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2000.\n                                                      George W.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico relative to \n     the Island Municipality of Vieques; to the Committee on Armed \n     Services.\n\n                               S.R. 1508\n\n\n                          statement of motives\n\n       The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, in its \n     Section 4 of Article II, establishes that ``no law shall be \n     made abridging the freedom of speech . . . or the right of \n     the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the \n     government for a redress of grievances.'' It further provides \n     that ``persons may join with each other and organize freely \n     for any lawful purpose''. Article II, Section 6 of the \n     Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n       It has been recently reported that Navy personnel used tear \n     gas and fired rubber bullets against persons assembled in \n     front at the gates of Camp Garcia on the Island Municipality \n     of Vieques. According to the information reported, the Navy \n     of the United States of America used unreasonable and \n     disproportionate force and violence against the protestors \n     who--in the full exercise of the above stated rights--were \n     expressing their opposition to the occupation of the land and \n     to the military practices conducted by the Navy in Vieques.\n       All the members of this Body, the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, took an oath to defend the \n     constitutional postulates cited above and the laws of Puerto \n     Rico when sworn into office. This entails the use of the \n     available mechanisms to watch over and protect the rights \n     recognized for all our citizens in our code of laws. \n     Therefore, this Senate emphatically censures the use of \n     unreasonable and disproportionate force and violence in order \n     to limit or restrict the right of all U.S. citizens to freely \n     express themselves and to assemble peacefully.\n       This Senate rejects the use of force and violence without \n     reasonable justification for the purpose or effect of \n     limiting or restricting the rights recognized by the \n     constitution or by our laws. The violence displayed by navy \n     officers should have the effect of reaffirming in the people \n     of Puerto Rico their desire to achieve the ceasing of \n     military practices and the prompt return of the occupied \n     lands on the Island Municipality of Vieques. The cause of \n     Vieques is for peace; not for violence: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of Puerto Rico:\n       Section 1.--The Senate of the commonwealth of Puerto Rico \n     emphatically rejects the use of force and violence by the \n     United States Navy without reasonable justification for the \n     purpose or effect of limiting or restricting the right of all \n     U.S. citizens to freely express themselves and to assemble \n     peacefully against the occupation and the military practices \n     of said branch of the Armed Forces of the United States of \n     America. The cause of Vieques is for peace; not for violence.\n       Section 2.--This Resolution shall be translated into the \n     English language and remitted to the President of the United \n     States of\n\n[[Page S4967]]\n\n     America, the Secretary of Defense of the United States of \n     America, the Secretary of the United States Navy, the \n     President and Floor Leaders of the Senate of the United \n     States of America, the Speaker and the Floor Leaders of the \n     House of Representatives of the United States of America, the \n     Secretary General of the United Nations, Amnesty \n     International, the International Civil Rights Commission, and \n     the Civil Rights Commission of Puerto Rico, and to the Human \n     Rights Commission in Geneva, as well as to the media.\n       Section 3.--This Resolution shall take effect immediately \n     after its approval.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-247. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the Federal \n     Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Act; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 409\n\n       Whereas, In 1934, Federal Prison Industries (FPI) was \n     created as a wholly owned government corporation. Today, FPI \n     operates 103 factories, with over 21,000 inmate workers and \n     annual sales of more than $500 million per year. The \n     operation offers over 150 products. FPI enjoys significant \n     advantages over private manufacturers making similar products \n     because of government procurement policies, including a \n     ``mandatory source'' requirement for government agencies; and\n       Whereas, With obvious personnel and benefits advantages \n     over private sector firms, there is a clear penalty to \n     employers and workers under the current situation. Some of \n     the most respected companies in many fields suffer \n     significantly from the unfair competition from FPI; and\n       Whereas, In Michigan, the impact of current FPI policies \n     has been strongly felt by many working families. Last year, \n     Michigan lost thousands of manufacturing jobs; and\n       Whereas, Congress is presently considering a measure that \n     would bring comprehensive reforms to the operations of FPI. \n     The Federal Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Act \n     would address directly the present unfair government \n     purchasing policies. This legislation, H.R. 1577, includes \n     specific requirements that FPI would have to follow to \n     achieve fairness and promote the training of inmates. Under \n     the Federal Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Act, \n     FPI would compete for contracts in a manner that minimizes \n     unfair advantages and ensures that government agencies get \n     the best value for taxpayer dollars. The legislation also \n     includes numerous accountability measures, increased emphasis \n     on preparing inmates for a return to society, and enhanced \n     restitution for victims of crime; and\n       Whereas, A more appropriate approach to prisoner-based \n     manufacturing will not only bring fairness to the marketplace \n     and thousands of America's working families, but it also will \n     enhance the federal corrections system; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact the \n     Federal Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Act; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the numbers of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-248. A substitute joint memorial adopted by the \n     Legislature of the State of Washington relative to designate \n     the former Eagledale ferry landing on Bainbridge Island as a \n     national memorial to remember the unconstitutional internment \n     of Japanese-Americans during World War II; to the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                  Substitute House Joint Memorial 4026\n\n       Whereas, during World War II on February 19, 1942, \n     President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order \n     9066, setting in motion the forced exile of more than one \n     hundred ten thousand Japanese-Americans from Washington, \n     Oregon, and California; and\n       Whereas, in Washington state, twelve thousand eight hundred \n     ninety-two men, women, and children of Japanese ancestry--\n     most of them United States citizens--experienced three years \n     of unconstitutional internment, deprived of their rights \n     granted under Amendment XIV of the United States Constitution \n     to protect their life, liberty, and property through due \n     process of law; and\n       Whereas, on March 30, 1942, two hundred twenty-seven \n     Bainbridge Island men, women, and children of Japanese \n     ancestry--most of them United States citizens--where escorted \n     by United States Army soldiers to the former Eagledale ferry \n     landing where they solemnly boarded the ferry Kehloken and \n     departed on a lonely journey with an unknown destination and \n     fate; and\n       Whereas, with only six days' notice they would be taken \n     away and only allowed to bring whatever they could carry or \n     wear, they were forced to hastily sell, store, or make \n     arrangements for all of their possessions, businesses, and \n     property; and\n       Whereas, the two hundred twenty-seven people from \n     Bainbridge Island were the first Japanese-Americans in United \n     States history to be forcibly removed from their homes by the \n     United States Army and sent to the Manzanar internment camp \n     located in a remote California desert; and\n       Whereas, not every Japanese-American from Bainbridge Island \n     boarded that fateful ferry; some were drafted into the \n     military, some were unjustly imprisoned, and some moved away, \n     but all were forced to leave; and\n       Whereas, their only crime was being Nikkei--persons of \n     Japanese ancestry; and\n       Whereas, to commemorate this momentous and tragic event in \n     United States history, the Bainbridge Island WWII Nikkei \n     Exclusion Memorial Committee, a joint endeavor of the \n     Bainbridge Island/North Kitsap Interfaith Council and the \n     Bainbridge Island Japanese-American Community, is working \n     with members of Washington state's federal delegation and \n     appropriate federal authorities to designate the former \n     Eagledale ferry landing as a national memorial; and\n       Whereas, it is the vision and hope that the proposed \n     national memorial will honor those who suffered, cherish the \n     friends and community who stood beside them, and inspire all \n     Americans to not repeat the mistakes of the past by \n     safeguarding constitutional rights for all; and\n       Whereas, the proposed national memorial could become an \n     international treasure, attracting, informing, and inspiring \n     people from around the world by telling an important and \n     timeless story for future generations; and\n       Whereas, it is vital that all Washington citizens remember \n     and learn from this period of our nation's history;\n       Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that \n     Congress continue its worthy endeavor to designate the former \n     Eagledale ferry landing on Bainbridge Island as a national \n     memorial to remember the unconstitutional internment of \n     Japanese-Americans during World War II;\n       Be it resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable Goerge W. Bush, President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of \n     Congress from the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-249.

A bill to preserve the sovereignty of the United States over \nproperty owned by the United States, to preserve State sovereignty over \nand private property rights in non-Federal property surrounding Federal \nProperty, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to introduce the Senate version of the American Land \nSovereignty Act of 2002. Quite simply, this\n\n[[Page S4970]]\n\nlegislation would help to ensure American sovereignty over property and \nprivate property rights will be part of the World Heritage Program and \nthe United Nations Man and Biosphere Program. The two programs \nreferenced in this legislation are international land conservation \nprograms in which the U.S. is a signatory and active participant. As \nwritten, these international agreements could impose international land \nuse policy on the United States and have a terrible consequence on \nprivate property owners by prohibiting or limiting the use of private \nland located near any designated sites. Put simply, the intent of my \nlegislation is to protect private property rights.\n  The purpose of the World Heritage Convention is to identify and list \nworldwide natural and cultural sites and monuments considered to be of \nsuch exceptional interest and such universal value that their \nprotection is the responsibility of all mankind. Each country adopting \nthe Convention, which the United States did in 1973, pledges to protect \nlisted sites and monuments within its borders. Twenty U.S. sites are \nlisted, including many of our own natural wonders like Yellowstone and \nGrant Canyon National Parks.\n  The purpose of the Biosphere Reserve Program is to promote \ncooperation and communication among a worldwide network of areas that \nwould include all major ecosystems. Under the Program, countries can \nnominate an area for inclusion into the Program based on the area's \nsignificance for ecological research and study of representative \nbiological regions of the world. There are currently 47 biosphere \nreserves in the U.S., including Everglades and Dry Tortugas National \nParks, Glacier National Park, and the New Jersey Pinelands.\n  While the intentions of both of these programs are admirable, the \nUnited States should not participate without assurances that American \nsovereignty and private property rights are protected above all else. I \nhave been deeply concerned with the erosion of U.S. sovereignty by \nvarious international agreements for some time and have grave concerns \nwith any action by the United Nations, or any other body, that would \ninfringe upon private property rights.\n  The American Land Sovereignty Protection Act aims to protect the \nsovereignty of the U.S. and the rights of private property owners by \nrequiring congressional approval before any area within the borders of \nthe United States is made a part of an international land reserve. In \nso doing, this bill asserts the constitutional power of Congress to \nexercise its right and responsibility to preserve and protect the \nrights of individual property owners, and create laws that govern lands \nbelonging to the United States.\n  Given that inclusion of an area into one of these programs could \ncause an adverse impact on the value or use of private property in the \narea and on the local and regional economy, the legislation also \nrequires that any nominations made to these two programs undergo public \ncomment. Additionally, I will be giving full consideration to adding a \nprovision that will allow States, local governments, or private \nproperty owners a veto right over any nomination. I look forward to \nexploring this possibility as the legislation moves through the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2575\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Land Sovereignty \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the power to dispose of and make all necessary rules \n     governing property belonging to the United States is vested \n     in Congress under section 3 of article IV of the \n     Constitution;\n       (2) some Federal property designations under international \n     agreements concern land use policies and regulations for \n     property belonging to the United States that, under section 3 \n     of article IV of the Constitution, can be implemented only by \n     an Act of Congress;\n       (3) some international property designations, such as those \n     under the United States Biosphere Reserve Program and the Man \n     and Biosphere Program of the United Nations Scientific, \n     Educational, and Cultural Organization, operate under \n     independent national committees, such as the United States \n     National Man and Biosphere Committee, that have no \n     legislative directive or authorization from Congress;\n       (4) actions by the United States in making such \n     designations may affect the use and value of nearby non-\n     Federal property;\n       (5) the sovereignty of the States is a critical component \n     of our Federal system of government and a bulwark against the \n     unwise concentration of power;\n       (6) private property rights are essential for the \n     protection of freedom;\n       (7) actions by the United States to designate property \n     belonging to the United States under international agreements \n     in some cases conflict with congressional constitutional \n     responsibilities and the sovereign powers of the States; and\n       (8) actions by the President in applying certain \n     international agreements to property owned by the United \n     States diminish the authority of Congress to make rules \n     respecting the property.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to reaffirm the power of Congress under section 3 of \n     article IV of the Constitution over international agreements \n     that concern disposal, management, and use of property \n     belonging to the United States;\n       (2) to protect State powers not reserved to the Federal \n     Government under the Constitution from Federal actions \n     designating property under international agreements;\n       (3) to ensure that no United States citizen suffers any \n     diminishment or loss of individual rights as a result of \n     Federal action designating property under an international \n     agreement for the purpose of imposing restrictions on use of \n     the property;\n       (4) to protect private interests in property from \n     diminishment as a result of Federal action designating \n     property under international agreements; and\n       (5) to provide a process under which the United States may, \n     when it is desirable to do so, designate property under an \n     international agreement.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish the Northern Rio Grande National \nHeritage Area in the State of New Mexico, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nestablish the Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area in northern \nNew Mexico. The national heritage area will be established as part of a \ncollaborative effort between local residents, Indian tribes, \nbusinesses, and local governments, who are coming together to preserve \nthe area.\n  By establishing the Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area, I \nhope to commemorate the significant but complex heritage of northern \nNew Mexico communities and Indian tribes, from the pre-Spanish \ncolonization period to present day. Establishing a national heritage \narea will benefit the northern New Mexico communities, local residents, \nstudents, and visitors, as well as help the local protection and \ninterpretation of the unique cultural, historical, and natural \nresources of northern New Mexico. By introducing this legislation, it \nis my hope that we will not only honor the past, but also inspire the \nfuture.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2576\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Rio Grande National \n     Heritage Area Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 280\n\n       Whereas food insecurity and hunger are a fact of life for \n     millions of low-income Americans and can produce physical, \n     mental, and social impairments;\n       Whereas recent census data show that almost 13,000,000 \n     children in the United States live in families experiencing \n     hunger or food insecurity;\n       Whereas the problem of hunger and food insecurity can be \n     found in rural, suburban, and urban America, touching nearly \n     every American community;\n       Whereas although substantial progress has been made in \n     reducing the incidence of hunger and food insecurity in the \n     United States, certain groups, including the working poor, \n     the elderly, homeless people, children, migrant workers, and \n     Native Americans remain vulnerable to hunger and the negative \n     effects of food deprivation;\n       Whereas the people of the United States have a long \n     tradition of providing food assistance to hungry people \n     through acts of private generosity and public support \n     programs;\n       Whereas the United States Government, through Federal food \n     assistance programs like the Federal Food Stamp Program, \n     child nutrition programs, and food donation programs, \n     provides essential nutrition support to millions of low-\n     income people;\n       Whereas there is a growing awareness of the important \n     public and private partnership role that community-based \n     organizations, institutions of faith, and charities provide \n     in assisting hungry and food insecure people;\n       Whereas more than 50,000 local community-based \n     organizations rely on the support and efforts of more than \n     1,000,000 volunteers to provide food assistance and services \n     to millions of vulnerable people;\n       Whereas a diverse group of organizations, including \n     America's Second Harvest, the United States Conference of \n     Mayors, and other organizations have documented substantial \n     increases in requests for emergency food assistance over the \n     past year; and\n       Whereas all Americans can help participate in hunger relief \n     efforts in their communities by donating food and money, by \n     volunteering, and by supporting public policies aimed at \n     reducing hunger: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 5, 2002, as ``National Hunger Awareness \n     Day'';\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Hunger Awareness Day''--\n\n[[Page S4973]]\n\n       (A) with appropriate ceremonies, volunteer activities, and \n     other support for local antihunger advocacy efforts and \n     hunger relief charities, including food banks, food rescue \n     organizations, food pantries, soup kitchens, and emergency \n     shelters; and\n       (B) with the year-round support of programs and public \n     policies that reduce hunger and food insecurity in the United \n     States; and\n       (3) office of Senator Richard J.

I rise today to support S. Res. 253, which condemns the \ngrowing intolerance and acts of persecution against Jews in many \nEuropean countries.\n  The Resolution urges European governments to own up to this growing \nevil, to reject any excuse for it, to use every tool at hand to combat \nthese crimes, and to punish the criminals.\n  Finally, the Resolution calls upon European governments to cultivate \nan atmosphere of cooperation and reconciliation among the continent's \nJewish and non-Jewish residents.\n  Making Jews scapegoats for societal ills has an ominous history. The \nNazis' Holocaust was preceded by centuries of gradually increasing \nanti-Semitism--first by religious dogma, then by racial pseudo-\ntheories--spread through preaching, villainous written propaganda, \nexclusionary laws, and finally pogroms and massacres.\n  The so-called civilized governments of the twentieth century largely \nremained silent and failed to confront the rising tide of anti-Jewish \npersecution. As a result, they set the stage for the murder of the vast \nmajority of European Jewry.\n  Some of the individuals committing anti-Semitic acts today are the \naffluent beneficiaries of unprecedented Western European prosperity. \nSome may be bigots. Others may simply be ignorant of the hideous \ncausality of the Holocaust, now more than fifty years in the past. \nStill others are mindless thugs.\n  In France, where a large number of violent attacks have occurred, \nmany of the perpetrators are young anti-Israel Arab immigrants from \nNorth Africa who feel alienated from their host country.\n  Nearly all European leaders have condemned physical violence against \nJews, although occasionally politicians have tempered their criticism \nwith ill-considered advice. An unfortunate example of this was the \nwell-intentioned Mayor of Berlin who, after a vicious attack on an \nOrthodox Jewish American tourist, warned Jewish Berliners that if they \ndidn't want to be similarly beaten up on the street, they shouldn't \nwear clothing identifying them as Jews.\n  Rhetorical anti-Semitism has been met with even less principle. \nInstead, verbal expressions of anti-Semitism in Europe are increasingly \nbeing trivialized.\n  For example, we might consider the recent London dinner party at \nwhich the French Ambassador to the U.K. made a demeaning, scatological \nreference to the State of Israel. What happened when the story was \nleaked to the press? The major scandal was the so-called \n``indiscretion'' of other guests for having revealed the French \nAmbassador's crude, bigoted, and amateurish behavior!\n  Or we might note the wife of Wim Duisenberg, the President of the \nEuropean Central Bank, who after flying the PLO flag from her house in \nAmsterdam complained that ``Israel is being kept going by those rich \nJews in America.'' Her highly respected husband removed the PLO flag \nbut remained silent on her incendiary political commentary.\n  A similar example of objectivity came from Oslo where a member of the \nNorwegian Nobel Committee declared that she would like to rescind \nShimon Peres's Nobel Peace Prize. Needless to say, she didn't choose to \nmention, let alone criticize, Yasser Arafat or the suicide bombers whom \nhe aids and abets.\n  Even venerable European political institutions no longer seem immune \nto the anti-Semitic virus. Consider the blatant attempt to woo right-\nwing voters by Juergen Moellemann, one of the top officials of \nGermany's Free Democrats, a party with a proud history of liberalism \nand tolerance. Moellemann explained that the Deputy Director of the \nCentral Council of Jews in Germany had brought on anti-Semitism himself \nby his supposedly aggressive behavior as a television talk-show host! \nIf this weird argumentation weren't so dangerous, it might almost be \nfunny. But it's not.\n  To Germany's credit, Moellemann's warped demagoguery has come in for \nmassive public criticism, including from both Chancellor Gerhard \nSchroeder and his conservative challenger Bavarian Minister-President \nEdmund Stoiber.\n  I want to believe that most Europeans reject the nauseating anti-\nSemitism of the last several months. I want to believe that a trans-\nAtlantic community of shared values still links us with the continent.\n  But without continuous efforts by European statesmen to combat anti-\nSemitism, my optimism may prove to be naive.\n  Instant communication means that how Europe responds to these acts of \nhatred matters around the world. Europe must make bigots, not Jews, its \noutcasts. No temporizing, no rationalizing, and no excuses.\n  Toward that end, I urge my colleagues to vote for S. Res. 253.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 253), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, as amended, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 253\n\n       Whereas many countries in Europe are protectors of human \n     rights and have stood as shining examples of freedom and \n     liberty to the world;\n       Whereas freedom of religion is guaranteed by all \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     participating states;\n       Whereas the 1990 Copenhagen Concluding Document declares \n     all participating OSCE States will ``unequivocally condemn'' \n     anti-Semitism and take effective measures to protect \n     individuals from anti-Semitic violence;\n       Whereas anti-Semitism was one of the most destructive \n     forces unleashed during the last century;\n\n[[Page S4981]]\n\n       Whereas there has been a startling rise in attacks on \n     Jewish community institutions in cities across Europe in the \n     last 18 months;\n       Whereas these violent incidents have targeted youth such as \n     an assault on a Jewish teen soccer team in Bondy, France on \n     April 11, 2002, and the brutal beating of two Jewish students \n     in Berlin, Germany, the burning of Jewish schools in Creteil \n     and Marseille, France and even the stoning of a bus carrying \n     Jewish schoolchildren;\n       Whereas attacks on Jewish houses of worship have been \n     reported in many cities including Antwerp, Brussels, and \n     Marseille and as recently as April 22 an automatic weapon \n     attack on a synagogue in Charleroi, Belgium;\n       Whereas the statue in Paris of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, who \n     was the victim of anti-Semitic accusations and became a \n     symbol of this prejudice in the last century, was defaced \n     with anti-Jewish emblems;\n       Whereas the French Ministry of Interior documented hundreds \n     of crimes against Jews and Jewish institutions in France in \n     just the first two weeks of April, 2002;\n       Whereas the revitalization of European right wing \n     movements, such as the strong showing of the National Front \n     party in France's presidential election, reaffirm the urgency \n     for governments to assert a strong public stance against \n     anti-Semitism, as well as other forms of xenophobia and \n     intolerance;\n       Whereas some government leaders have repeatedly dismissed \n     the significance of these attacks and attributed them to \n     hooliganism and Muslim immigrant youth expressing solidarity \n     with Palestinians;\n       Whereas the legitimization of armed struggle against \n     Israeli civilians by some governments voting in the U.N. \n     Commission on Human Rights has emboldened some individuals \n     and organizations to lash out against Jews and Jewish \n     institutions;\n       Whereas hostility, frustration and disaffection over \n     violence in the Middle East must never be permitted to \n     justify personal attacks on Jewish citizens;\n       Whereas when governments have raised a strong moral voice \n     against anti-Semitism and worked to promote and implement \n     educational initiatives which foster tolerance, we have seen \n     success; and\n       Whereas Congress recognizes the vital historical alliance \n     between nations of Europe and the United States and has high \n     regard for the commitment of our allies to fighting \n     discrimination, hatred, and violence on racial, ethnic, or \n     religious grounds: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n       That (a) the Senate calls upon European governments to--\n       (1) acknowledge publicly and without reservation the anti-\n     Semitic character of the attacks as violations of human \n     rights;\n       (2) utilize the full power of their law enforcement tools \n     to investigate the crimes and punish the perpetrators;\n       (3) decry the rationalizing of anti-Jewish attitudes and \n     even violent attacks against Jews as merely a result of \n     justified popular frustration with the conflict in the Middle \n     East;\n       (4) take measures to protect and ensure the security of \n     Jewish citizens and their institutions, many of whom suffered \n     so grievously in Europe in the past century;

Res. 280) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 280\n\n       Whereas food insecurity and hunger are a fact of life for \n     millions of low-income Americans and can produce physical, \n     mental, and social impairments;\n       Whereas recent census data show that almost 13,000,000 \n     children in the United States live in families experiencing \n     hunger or food insecurity;\n       Whereas the problem of hunger and food insecurity can be \n     found in rural, suburban, and urban America, touching nearly \n     every American community;\n       Whereas although substantial progress has been made in \n     reducing the incidence of hunger and food insecurity in the \n     United States, certain groups, including the working poor, \n     the elderly, homeless people, children, migrant workers, and \n     Native Americans remain vulnerable to hunger and the negative \n     effects of food deprivation;\n       Whereas the people of the United States have a long \n     tradition of providing food assistance to hungry people \n     through acts of private generosity and public support \n     programs;\n       Whereas the United States Government, through Federal food \n     assistance programs like the Federal Food Stamp Program, \n     child nutrition programs, and food donation programs, \n     provides essential nutrition support to millions of low-\n     income people;\n       Whereas there is a growing awareness of the important \n     public and private partnership role that community-based \n     organizations, institutions of faith, and charities provide \n     in assisting hungry and food insecure people;\n       Whereas more than 50,000 local community-based \n     organizations rely on the support and efforts of more than \n     1,000,000 volunteers to provide food assistance and services \n     to millions of vulnerable people;\n       Whereas a diverse group of organizations, including \n     America's Second Harvest, the United States Conference of \n     Mayors, and other organizations have documented substantial \n     increases in requests for emergency food assistance over the \n     past year; and\n       Whereas all Americans can help participate in hunger relief \n     efforts in their communities by donating food and money, by \n     volunteering, and by supporting public policies aimed at \n     reducing hunger: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 5, 2002, as ``National Hunger Awareness \n     Day'';\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Hunger Awareness Day''--\n       (A) with appropriate ceremonies, volunteer activities, and \n     other support for local antihunger advocacy efforts and \n     hunger relief charities, including food banks, food rescue \n     organizations, food pantries, soup kitchens, and emergency \n     shelters; and\n       (B) with the year-round support of programs and public \n     policies that reduce hunger and food insecurity in the United \n     States; and\n       (3) office of Senator Richard J. Durbin is authorized to \n     collect donations of food from June 5, 2002, until June 14, \n     2002, from concerned Members of Congress and staff to assist \n     families suffering from hunger and food insecurity in the \n     Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/04/senate-section/article/S4983-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DISCHARGE AND REFERRAL--S. 2546\n\n  Mr. REID.
