Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly this morning on an \nissue about which we have heard a lot in the last few days and in which \na number of us have participated diligently over the last several \nmonths. The subject is education, kindergarten through 12th grade, a \nperiod of time which, as we all know, in large part determines how \nsuccessful one is later in life--how well equipped one is to deal with \nchallenges in an increasingly challenging world.\n  This important issue has caused many of us to reflect over the last \nseveral years on what has been accomplished in the last 35 years with \nFederal intervention in education. What we have found, for the most \npart, is that in spite of major expenditures by the Federal \ngovernment--a small fraction of what is spent across the country but a \nhuge and growing investment, to the tune, in just one program, title I, \nof about $120 billion focused on disadvantaged children--the results \nhave been disappointing.\n  They have been disappointing to Republicans, Independents, and \nDemocrats. They are disappointing because through careful study, \nthrough careful documentation, people have come to realize that we have \nnot succeeded. By practically every single measurement, the results \nhave been flat.\n  Some people say that is a good result; we could have gotten worse.\n  But there is no reason in a time of economic prosperity and \nincreasing prominence of the United States in the world order--we are \nthe superpower--for results to be flat when billions of dollars are \nbeing expended.\n  When we peel away the layers and look at the results, we see growing \nachievement gaps between the served and underserved; between those \nfinancially well off and those less financially well off; between \nminority and non-minority. However one looks at the achievement gap \nover the last 35 years, it has deteriorated; it has gotten worse.\n  The subject is complex. It is hard. It is not a matter of just more \nmoney, smaller class size, or better school buildings. Society has \nchanged. The challenges before us have changed. Our responsibility is \nto look at the last 35 years and address what has not worked and, \nthrough debate, hearings, and discussions, come forth with a policy \nthat will reverse the trend of an achievement level that is flat. No \nnet results after an increase in attention and after an increase of \ndollars is not an acceptable outcome.\n  From both sides of the aisle, we have heard over the last several \ndays--and very appropriately so--applause for President Bush's first \n100 days. Education is his No. 1 policy priority. We have made \nsignificant progress on tax relief, spending, and a number of military \nand defense issues.\n  Now we come back to what is most important to the United States of \nAmerica--where we are today and where we want to be 5 years from now, \n10 years from now, 20 years from now in what is becoming a smaller and \nsmaller world.\n  The President's top priority is education. We have heard it from all \nsides; we have seen it in the newspapers and other media; and we have \nsaid it ourselves on the campaign trail. But the message really comes \nfrom the words of President George W. Bush, and that is ``to leave no \nchild behind.'' When you say ``leave no child behind,'' you look at an \nindividual and wonder how, in spite of 20, 50, 100, 150, 200 programs, \nall well intended, coming out of a Congress that says here is another \ngood program to address a particular problem, we fall short. In spite \nof hundreds of different federal education programs, and in spite of \n$120 billion spent in a single program, title I, we continue to fail.\n\n  Leaving no child behind means we probably have to change our \ntargeting. Many of us believe we should channel increased resources to \nthe child who is disadvantaged, to raise that child's performance. That \nhas not been possible from a political standpoint.\n  In leaving no child behind, the solution means we should focus on the \nchild. We do not focus on bureaucracy. We focus on the child. We do not \nfocus on more money for still another program. That has been tried \nagain and again. It means we need to make sure the child, the \nindividual, learns.\n  Right now, we have testing and some general accountability measures. \nPeople argue passionately about national standards, State standards, \nand local standards. That needs to be debated. But for 35 years we \nnever said of the child: we will follow you over time so we can \ndetermine whether you are failing, staying the same, or progressing \nand, based on that, determine the proper action for this body.\n  We need to make sure kids learn. That will require increased \naccountability.\n  How do we do that? The bill that will be put forward and marked up in \nthe Health Education Committee, the BEST bill, is strong on \naccountability. Through the bipartisan working groups that have been \nvery actively involved over the last 2 months, that accountability can \nbe strengthened. We need to reward schools that are performing well. If \nschools are not doing well, we will have to give them the tools, the \nequipment, the resources, and the chance to do better. When they \nrepeatedly fail, year after year after year and if a child is locked \ninto such a school, at some point we have to reconstitute that school \nor give the parents the opportunity to take their child out of that \nfailing environment that society has created and put them in an \nenvironment where they have a real chance to learn.\n  Students in persistently failing schools should not be trapped there. \nThey are trapped today. We need to do something about it. We have not \nbeen able to do anything about it in 30 or 35 years. The failure is in \npart because of Federal involvement. It is in part a failure of the \ncurrent system. We need to change the system. That means make sure kids \nlearn, with accountability. No. 2, give parents a choice. No. 3, let's \nproceed with reform.\n  No longer can people sit back and say: here is the system of 760 \nprograms, let's pour more money into that system and we will be OK. We \nknow that will not work. Therefore, we have to have reform. We have to \nhave modernization of that system.\n  The good news is Democrats and Republicans together and from a policy \nstandpoint understand what modernization means today. It means \nflexibility, knowing what works and what doesn't work, taking what \nworks and putting it on a pedestal and supporting it. Yes, that means \nfinancially. More money will be put in education. We heard the \nPresident of the United States say again and again and again over the \nlast several days, especially as we are at the negotiating table, that \nhe is willing to put more money than has been put into education last \nyear or the year before that or the year before that. This President \nwill invest in education if we agree to link it to reform, to \nmodernization, to flexibility, to accountability, to having some \nelement of parental involvement. Nobody cares more about that \nindividual child than the parents.\n\n  Global competition is one of the reasons we can stand up and say we \nare failing today in spite of our good intentions, in spite of teachers \nwho are working hard, getting up each morning, teaching all day, \npreparing through the night and working summers to become even better \nteachers. In spite of their best efforts, we are failing. The National \nAssessment of Educational Progress, NAEP, is the only test using an \naccurate and careful statistical sampling from a cross-section study \nacross the country of what happens at a certain point in time in \nvarious States and various school districts. It is also longitudinal, \ncomparing what happens after 1 year to 3 years to 5 years to 10 years \nlater.\n\n[[Page S3935]]\n\n  A recent NAEP study confirmed that our current education system is \nnot working. The statistics, the data, are very accurate. As a \nscientist and someone who depends on statistics, I am convinced it is \ngood data. The data show that the achievement gap is not closing, but \ncontinues to widen.\n  I am hopeful we can address the issue of education now or next week \nin a way that links that policy to the debate we are talking about, \nwhich is how much more money it will take to succeed.\n  The NAEP uses four levels of achievement. They are: advanced, \nproficient, basic, and below basic. You can track each of these. \nLooking at the below basic category is fascinating. Take one element, \nsuch as reading. In the below basic level, for the most part, too many \nstudents simply cannot read. Mr. President, 37 percent of those tested \nscored below basic. Even more disturbing is the fact that 63 percent--\nalmost two-thirds of black fourth graders, 58 percent of Hispanics, 47 \npercent of students in urban areas, and 60 percent of poor children--\nscored below basic. That means they cannot read.\n  Secretary Paige--a wonderful leader--articulates through his \nexperience what is happening on the ground: ``After spending $125 \nbillion of title I money over 25 years, we have virtually nothing to \nshow for it.''\n  The data also show how well we are performing internationally. Look \nat math and science. I have a junior in high school; so we are thinking \nabout college. As a physician, math and science are two fields that \nmean a lot to me as we predict how well prepared people will be in this \nnew economy fueled by technology and dissemination of information. In \nmath and science, we are not first in the world. We are not fifth in \nthe world. We are not tenth in the world. We are not fifteenth in the \nworld. The United States of America is seventeenth in math and \neighteenth in science.\n  What does that say as we go out and compete in this global economy \nfor jobs, for economic growth?\n  We have a wonderful opportunity to go forward under the leadership of \nPresident George W. Bush. He has put on the table a very clear agenda \nthat stresses accountability; an agenda that focuses on what works; an \nagenda that will reduce the redtape and bureaucracy that is handcuffing \nour teachers; and an agenda that will increase flexibility and local \ncontrol. It is an agenda where needs can be identified locally and an \nagenda that empowers parents.\n  I very much appreciate the opportunity to participate in this \ndiscussion. I am hopeful we will be able to turn to the bill next week. \nIt means at the end of 2 weeks from now we can have a bill that will \nengage in a major modernization of education, where we truly can say \nthat the United States of America has stepped up to that big challenge, \nthat challenge of leaving no child behind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will please call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with and that I be yielded 10 minutes or until \na Senator arrives, at which time I will yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise once again to continue remarks from \na few minutes ago on education, and I will do so until another Senator \narrives to speak. I want to take a moment to bring my colleagues up to \ndate on the underlying bill that came out of the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions. It is a bill called BEST--I mentioned \nit earlier--the Better Education for Students and Teachers Act. It is a \nbill we debated in the Committee and most probably will be the bill \nthat is brought forward once we make further progress in discussions on \nthe appropriate amount of money to invest.\n  This particular bill, which will be modified and debated and \ndiscussed on the floor, has four principles about which I want to \nbriefly comment. What it does, is to embody what President Bush has \nfocused on and that is this very important belief, fundamental belief, \nthat enterprise works best when authority and responsibility are \naligned. Good results occur when responsibilities are accompanied by \nlatitude and flexibility so that judgments can be made on information \nthat is available and when those who are responsible for teaching, for \nmaking decisions for education, for leaving no child behind, are held \naccountable. Those principles are very simple. They link innovation \nresponsibility, flexibility, and results.\n  The BEST bill has four components to it. No. 1, it will increase \naccountability for student performance. It is just remarkable, I \nbelieve, and it is important for our colleagues to understand and \npeople around the country to understand, that we as a government are \ninvesting taxpayer money without demanding accountability--no \nmeasurement, no results, are required. We are pouring money into a \nsystem and we don't know if it works. As I mentioned earlier the data \nthat has come out this morning shows the current system does not work.\n  First and foremost, accountability: States and school districts and \nschools that improve achievement that eliminate or narrow that \nachievement gap which we know is getting worse those entities, will be \npraised, will be rewarded in the underlying bill.\n  The flip side of that is those schools and those districts and even \nthose States that continue to fail after they receive new resources and \na fair clause to show progress--they will then be sanctioned. They will \nbe held accountable. That is something basic. It is something we do in \nour homes. It is something we do in our small businesses. We do it in \nour everyday lives. But when it comes to government, for some reason \nfor the last 35 years we have not done it. Now is the time to do it. \nAnd we are going to do it.\n  The parents will have new information on how their children are \nprogressing. They will no longer be limited to just assessing at night \nand talking to their child, or talking to other parents at night. That \nwill continue, of course, but parents will know much more about whether \nthe schools are succeeding. For the first time, assessments can be \ncompared across communities and States, and across the U.S. and even to \nother countries. Parents will know that their schools are being held \naccountable as well.\n  Parental involvement is crucial, we can do a lot here in Washington, \nDC, in this great Capital and this great body, but ultimately it has to \nbe the millions of parents who are out there holding accountable the \nschools, the teachers, the school districts, and the local governments.\n  There are going to be annual State reading and math assessments for \ngrades three through eight. That is something I feel very strongly \nabout.\n  Two, the BEST bill focuses on what works. Federal dollars will be \nspent on effective research-based programs and practices. Funds will be \ntargeted to improve schools and enhance teacher quality.\n  That ultimate goal has to be to have a student and a classroom that \nis safe and drug free, but with a good teacher at the head. Therefore, \nthe ``t'' in the BEST bill means teachers. And the focus will be on \nteachers.\n  Third, the BEST bill will also reduce bureaucracy and increase \nflexibility. Additional flexibility will be provided to States and \nschool districts, and flexible funding will be increased at the local \nlevel.\n  Finally, this bill will empower parents. Parents don't now have the \ninformation to be able to either hold schools accountable or make \ndecisions. They will be given that information about the quality of \ntheir child's progress and their child's school. Students in \npersistently low-performing schools will be provided options so that \nthey are not locked in a bad school.\n  It is important as we go forward to understand what the underlying \nbill is.

Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly this morning on an \nissue about which we have heard a lot in the last few days and in which \na number of us have participated diligently over the last several \nmonths. The subject is education, kindergarten through 12th grade, a \nperiod of time which, as we all know, in large part determines how \nsuccessful one is later in life--how well equipped one is to deal with \nchallenges in an increasingly challenging world.\n  This important issue has caused many of us to reflect over the last \nseveral years on what has been accomplished in the last 35 years with \nFederal intervention in education. What we have found, for the most \npart, is that in spite of major expenditures by the Federal \ngovernment--a small fraction of what is spent across the country but a \nhuge and growing investment, to the tune, in just one program, title I, \nof about $120 billion focused on disadvantaged children--the results \nhave been disappointing.\n  They have been disappointing to Republicans, Independents, and \nDemocrats. They are disappointing because through careful study, \nthrough careful documentation, people have come to realize that we have \nnot succeeded. By practically every single measurement, the results \nhave been flat.\n  Some people say that is a good result; we could have gotten worse.\n  But there is no reason in a time of economic prosperity and \nincreasing prominence of the United States in the world order--we are \nthe superpower--for results to be flat when billions of dollars are \nbeing expended.\n  When we peel away the layers and look at the results, we see growing \nachievement gaps between the served and underserved; between those \nfinancially well off and those less financially well off; between \nminority and non-minority. However one looks at the achievement gap \nover the last 35 years, it has deteriorated; it has gotten worse.\n  The subject is complex. It is hard. It is not a matter of just more \nmoney, smaller class size, or better school buildings. Society has \nchanged. The challenges before us have changed. Our responsibility is \nto look at the last 35 years and address what has not worked and, \nthrough debate, hearings, and discussions, come forth with a policy \nthat will reverse the trend of an achievement level that is flat. No \nnet results after an increase in attention and after an increase of \ndollars is not an acceptable outcome.\n  From both sides of the aisle, we have heard over the last several \ndays--and very appropriately so--applause for President Bush's first \n100 days. Education is his No. 1 policy priority. We have made \nsignificant progress on tax relief, spending, and a number of military \nand defense issues.\n  Now we come back to what is most important to the United States of \nAmerica--where we are today and where we want to be 5 years from now, \n10 years from now, 20 years from now in what is becoming a smaller and \nsmaller world.\n  The President's top priority is education. We have heard it from all \nsides; we have seen it in the newspapers and other media; and we have \nsaid it ourselves on the campaign trail. But the message really comes \nfrom the words of President George W. Bush, and that is ``to leave no \nchild behind.'' When you say ``leave no child behind,'' you look at an \nindividual and wonder how, in spite of 20, 50, 100, 150, 200 programs, \nall well intended, coming out of a Congress that says here is another \ngood program to address a particular problem, we fall short. In spite \nof hundreds of different federal education programs, and in spite of \n$120 billion spent in a single program, title I, we continue to fail.\n\n  Leaving no child behind means we probably have to change our \ntargeting. Many of us believe we should channel increased resources to \nthe child who is disadvantaged, to raise that child's performance. That \nhas not been possible from a political standpoint.\n  In leaving no child behind, the solution means we should focus on the \nchild. We do not focus on bureaucracy. We focus on the child. We do not \nfocus on more money for still another program. That has been tried \nagain and again. It means we need to make sure the child, the \nindividual, learns.\n  Right now, we have testing and some general accountability measures. \nPeople argue passionately about national standards, State standards, \nand local standards. That needs to be debated. But for 35 years we \nnever said of the child: we will follow you over time so we can \ndetermine whether you are failing, staying the same, or progressing \nand, based on that, determine the proper action for this body.\n  We need to make sure kids learn. That will require increased \naccountability.\n  How do we do that? The bill that will be put forward and marked up in \nthe Health Education Committee, the BEST bill, is strong on \naccountability. Through the bipartisan working groups that have been \nvery actively involved over the last 2 months, that accountability can \nbe strengthened. We need to reward schools that are performing well. If \nschools are not doing well, we will have to give them the tools, the \nequipment, the resources, and the chance to do better. When they \nrepeatedly fail, year after year after year and if a child is locked \ninto such a school, at some point we have to reconstitute that school \nor give the parents the opportunity to take their child out of that \nfailing environment that society has created and put them in an \nenvironment where they have a real chance to learn.\n  Students in persistently failing schools should not be trapped there. \nThey are trapped today. We need to do something about it. We have not \nbeen able to do anything about it in 30 or 35 years. The failure is in \npart because of Federal involvement. It is in part a failure of the \ncurrent system. We need to change the system. That means make sure kids \nlearn, with accountability. No. 2, give parents a choice. No. 3, let's \nproceed with reform.\n  No longer can people sit back and say: here is the system of 760 \nprograms, let's pour more money into that system and we will be OK. We \nknow that will not work. Therefore, we have to have reform. We have to \nhave modernization of that system.\n  The good news is Democrats and Republicans together and from a policy \nstandpoint understand what modernization means today. It means \nflexibility, knowing what works and what doesn't work, taking what \nworks and putting it on a pedestal and supporting it. Yes, that means \nfinancially. More money will be put in education. We heard the \nPresident of the United States say again and again and again over the \nlast several days, especially as we are at the negotiating table, that \nhe is willing to put more money than has been put into education last \nyear or the year before that or the year before that. This President \nwill invest in education if we agree to link it to reform, to \nmodernization, to flexibility, to accountability, to having some \nelement of parental involvement. Nobody cares more about that \nindividual child than the parents.\n\n  Global competition is one of the reasons we can stand up and say we \nare failing today in spite of our good intentions, in spite of teachers \nwho are working hard, getting up each morning, teaching all day, \npreparing through the night and working summers to become even better \nteachers. In spite of their best efforts, we are failing. The National \nAssessment of Educational Progress, NAEP, is the only test using an \naccurate and careful statistical sampling from a cross-section study \nacross the country of what happens at a certain point in time in \nvarious States and various school districts. It is also longitudinal, \ncomparing what happens after 1 year to 3 years to 5 years to 10 years \nlater.\n\n[[Page S3935]]\n\n  A recent NAEP study confirmed that our current education system is \nnot working. The statistics, the data, are very accurate. As a \nscientist and someone who depends on statistics, I am convinced it is \ngood data. The data show that the achievement gap is not closing, but \ncontinues to widen.\n  I am hopeful we can address the issue of education now or next week \nin a way that links that policy to the debate we are talking about, \nwhich is how much more money it will take to succeed.\n  The NAEP uses four levels of achievement. They are: advanced, \nproficient, basic, and below basic. You can track each of these. \nLooking at the below basic category is fascinating. Take one element, \nsuch as reading. In the below basic level, for the most part, too many \nstudents simply cannot read. Mr. President, 37 percent of those tested \nscored below basic. Even more disturbing is the fact that 63 percent--\nalmost two-thirds of black fourth graders, 58 percent of Hispanics, 47 \npercent of students in urban areas, and 60 percent of poor children--\nscored below basic. That means they cannot read.\n  Secretary Paige--a wonderful leader--articulates through his \nexperience what is happening on the ground: ``After spending $125 \nbillion of title I money over 25 years, we have virtually nothing to \nshow for it.''\n  The data also show how well we are performing internationally. Look \nat math and science. I have a junior in high school; so we are thinking \nabout college. As a physician, math and science are two fields that \nmean a lot to me as we predict how well prepared people will be in this \nnew economy fueled by technology and dissemination of information. In \nmath and science, we are not first in the world. We are not fifth in \nthe world. We are not tenth in the world. We are not fifteenth in the \nworld. The United States of America is seventeenth in math and \neighteenth in science.\n  What does that say as we go out and compete in this global economy \nfor jobs, for economic growth?\n  We have a wonderful opportunity to go forward under the leadership of \nPresident George W. Bush. He has put on the table a very clear agenda \nthat stresses accountability; an agenda that focuses on what works; an \nagenda that will reduce the redtape and bureaucracy that is handcuffing \nour teachers; and an agenda that will increase flexibility and local \ncontrol. It is an agenda where needs can be identified locally and an \nagenda that empowers parents.\n  I very much appreciate the opportunity to participate in this \ndiscussion. I am hopeful we will be able to turn to the bill next week. \nIt means at the end of 2 weeks from now we can have a bill that will \nengage in a major modernization of education, where we truly can say \nthat the United States of America has stepped up to that big challenge, \nthat challenge of leaving no child behind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will please call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with and that I be yielded 10 minutes or until \na Senator arrives, at which time I will yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise once again to continue remarks from \na few minutes ago on education, and I will do so until another Senator \narrives to speak. I want to take a moment to bring my colleagues up to \ndate on the underlying bill that came out of the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions. It is a bill called BEST--I mentioned \nit earlier--the Better Education for Students and Teachers Act. It is a \nbill we debated in the Committee and most probably will be the bill \nthat is brought forward once we make further progress in discussions on \nthe appropriate amount of money to invest.\n  This particular bill, which will be modified and debated and \ndiscussed on the floor, has four principles about which I want to \nbriefly comment. What it does, is to embody what President Bush has \nfocused on and that is this very important belief, fundamental belief, \nthat enterprise works best when authority and responsibility are \naligned. Good results occur when responsibilities are accompanied by \nlatitude and flexibility so that judgments can be made on information \nthat is available and when those who are responsible for teaching, for \nmaking decisions for education, for leaving no child behind, are held \naccountable. Those principles are very simple. They link innovation \nresponsibility, flexibility, and results.\n  The BEST bill has four components to it. No. 1, it will increase \naccountability for student performance. It is just remarkable, I \nbelieve, and it is important for our colleagues to understand and \npeople around the country to understand, that we as a government are \ninvesting taxpayer money without demanding accountability--no \nmeasurement, no results, are required. We are pouring money into a \nsystem and we don't know if it works. As I mentioned earlier the data \nthat has come out this morning shows the current system does not work.\n  First and foremost, accountability: States and school districts and \nschools that improve achievement that eliminate or narrow that \nachievement gap which we know is getting worse those entities, will be \npraised, will be rewarded in the underlying bill.\n  The flip side of that is those schools and those districts and even \nthose States that continue to fail after they receive new resources and \na fair clause to show progress--they will then be sanctioned. They will \nbe held accountable. That is something basic. It is something we do in \nour homes. It is something we do in our small businesses. We do it in \nour everyday lives. But when it comes to government, for some reason \nfor the last 35 years we have not done it. Now is the time to do it. \nAnd we are going to do it.\n  The parents will have new information on how their children are \nprogressing. They will no longer be limited to just assessing at night \nand talking to their child, or talking to other parents at night. That \nwill continue, of course, but parents will know much more about whether \nthe schools are succeeding. For the first time, assessments can be \ncompared across communities and States, and across the U.S. and even to \nother countries. Parents will know that their schools are being held \naccountable as well.\n  Parental involvement is crucial, we can do a lot here in Washington, \nDC, in this great Capital and this great body, but ultimately it has to \nbe the millions of parents who are out there holding accountable the \nschools, the teachers, the school districts, and the local governments.\n  There are going to be annual State reading and math assessments for \ngrades three through eight. That is something I feel very strongly \nabout.\n  Two, the BEST bill focuses on what works. Federal dollars will be \nspent on effective research-based programs and practices. Funds will be \ntargeted to improve schools and enhance teacher quality.\n  That ultimate goal has to be to have a student and a classroom that \nis safe and drug free, but with a good teacher at the head. Therefore, \nthe ``t'' in the BEST bill means teachers. And the focus will be on \nteachers.\n  Third, the BEST bill will also reduce bureaucracy and increase \nflexibility. Additional flexibility will be provided to States and \nschool districts, and flexible funding will be increased at the local \nlevel.\n  Finally, this bill will empower parents. Parents don't now have the \ninformation to be able to either hold schools accountable or make \ndecisions. They will be given that information about the quality of \ntheir child's progress and their child's school. Students in \npersistently low-performing schools will be provided options so that \nthey are not locked in a bad school.\n  It is important as we go forward to understand what the underlying \nbill is. It is a sweeping introduction of the four principles: \naccountability, focusing on what works, reducing bureaucracy and \nincreasing flexibility, and empowering parents.\n  I look forward to discussing that in greater detail as we, hopefully, \nget to this bill next week. I think the BEST bill is a great start for \nwhat we all want, and that is to leave no child behind.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak with colleagues \nabout global warming, which quite literally is a cloud that is looming \non our horizon. As many have feared, there is evidence that this cloud \nhas recently grown darker and more ominous.\n  Over the last few months, in fact, the United Nation's \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its third report on \nglobal warming. This report was authored by over 700 expert scientists. \nTheir conclusions, I am afraid, offer convincing evidence of a planet \nin distress, one that is slowly overheating with very serious--some \nwould say disastrous but certainly very serious--consequences for those \nwho will follow us on this Earth.\n  According to these scientific experts, unless we find ways to stop \nglobal warming, the Earth's average temperature can be expected to rise \nbetween 2.5 and 10.4 degrees Fahrenheit during this next 100 years. \nSuch a large rapid rise in temperature will profoundly affect the \nEarth's landscape in very real and consequential terms. Sea levels \ncould swell enormously, potentially submerging literally millions of \nhomes and coastal properties under our present day oceans. \nPrecipitation would become more erratic, leading to droughts that would \nmake hunger an even more serious global problem than it is today. \nDiseases such as malaria and dengue fever would spread at an \naccelerated pace. Several weather disturbances and storms triggered by \nclimate phenomena, such as El Nino, would be aggravated by global \nwarming and become, I am afraid, more routine.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the first time we have heard such \ndisconcerting predictions, which in their way are so extreme that they \nmay be hard for some to believe, although I find as I go around my \nState and on occasion around the country that the public is ahead of \ntheir political leadership on this issue--at least a lot of the \npolitical leadership. The public has been reading these reports and \nunderstands that something is happening with the weather that will \naffect life on this planet unless we do something about it.\n  For years, scores of scientists from throughout the world have issued \nwarning after warning attesting to the harmful effect of increasing \namounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. While it is true \nthat there have been some efforts to curb the release of these gases, I \nam afraid we have spent a lot more time debating the credibility of the \nwarnings than doing something about them.\n  Truly, this new data does not end the serious debate about whether \nglobal warming is a fact. This most recent scientific report is the \nmost advanced study we have had on the subject. I personally conclude \nthat the science is now incontrovertible.\n  As this latest report reminds us, the threat is being driven by our \nown behavior. Remember the old Pogo cartoon: We have met the enemy and \nit is us. That is, unfortunately, the case with global warming. Let me \nquote the scientists in the report directly.\n\n       There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming \n     observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human \n     activities.\n\n  Human beings have added more than 3 billion metric tons of carbon to \nthe atmosphere every year for the past two decades. In fact, the \ncurrent levels of carbon dioxide are likely the highest they have been \nin 20 million years of history.\n\n  In the face of this mounting evidence, what have we done? I am afraid \nwe have a statement from President Bush saying that he ``takes the \nissue of global warming very seriously.'' But, unfortunately, thus far \nthe acts that have followed that statement do not match the statement.\n  I am afraid the only global cooling that will occur under this \nadministration is the cooling of our foreign relations with countries \naround the world, including some of our foremost allies who are very \nanxious to work with us to do something about global warming. Last \nmonth the administration unilaterally announced, without consultation \nwith Congress, and apparently without consultation with our allies or \nothers around the world, that it had ``no interest in implementing'' \nthe Kyoto Protocol. In doing so, the administration did not just back \naway from America's signature on an international agreement. They \nbacked away from the process that resulted in the accord, and that \naction not only undermines our global environment but it also \nundermines our credibility with our allies.\n  This is one issue that is so serious and will so profoundly affect \nthe lives of our children and grandchildren and those who follow us \nhere on Earth that we ought to be at the head as the greatest nation in \nthe world of international efforts to stop this problem, to deal with \nit, and not be viewed by most of the rest of the world as loners going \nour own way not listening to science experts and not acting \nresponsibly.\n  I am afraid the Bush administration has also walked away from its \nchief domestic initiative on climate change, which was a very hopeful \ninitiative, when it reversed the President's campaign pledge to adopt a \nmarket-based trading mechanism regulation of carbon dioxide emissions \nfrom powerplants. Those emissions account for up to 40 percent of our \nNation's carbon dioxide emissions and 10 percent--one-tenth--of the \nglobal carbon dioxide emissions at this point coming from American \npowerplants.\n  We have to take firm and decisive action--we ought to be taking it \ntogether; we ought to be taking it across party lines--to address \nglobal warming. If we act soon, we can still avoid the bleak fate that \nwill otherwise await our children and grandchildren on this good Earth \nthat the Good Lord gave us. We are visitors here, temporary visitors. \nWe have an obligation to act not only as good visitors but as trustees \nof the planet for those countless generations that will follow.\n  Science is giving us a warning. We all ought to put ideology aside \nand figure out a way to cooperate to respond to that warning, to \nprotect the planet and those who will follow us on it. Doing so will \nrequire two things. One is global leadership, and the other is a shared \neffort to change the source of the problems and deal with them through \ntechnology and through cooperative effort.\n  In the clear absence of Presidential action thus far, we in the \nSenate, I am pleased to say, have begun to provide some leadership on \nthis issue. Just before the recess, we passed an amendment to the \nbudget resolution that reestablished funding for all climate change \nprograms throughout our Government, including funding for energy \nefficiency programs, funding for programs to encourage emissions \nreductions in developing countries, and the funding for full and \nadequate participation in international negotiations.\n  I hope President Bush and others in the administration will take note \nof the Senate's concern about climate change, represented by this \namendment, and join with us in taking action on this problem. There \nhave been some strong voices within the administration that clearly \nunderstand the dimensions of the problem and want to work to be leaders \nin dealing with it. I am speaking of the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. \nO'Neill, and the Administrator of the EPA, Ms. Whitman.\n  The alarming conclusions of the U.N. scientists' report should be of \nconcern to all of us. Global warming is most decidedly not a partisan \nissue; it is a human problem. It is a problem for all of us who inhabit \nthe Earth. Neither party wants to allow the apocalyptic future \nprojected by the scientists' report. The evidence is compelling. Our \nplanet is, in fact, slowly overheating. So now we have to join together \nacross party lines and international borders and agree to act. This is \na challenge because we are talking about a problem whose beginnings we \ncan see now but whose worst effects will probably, hopefully, not be \nfelt until some years have passed.\n  So this requires leadership--political leadership--to avoid a problem \nwhose worst effects most of us will not experience in our lifetimes, \nbut it is the responsible thing to do to take such action.\n  Kyoto set a framework. I was at Kyoto when that agreement was \nnegotiated. It is not a perfect document by far. But considering the \nfact that we were dealing with so many of the nations of the world, \napproaching this problem from different places, it is a framework for \ninternational cooperation.\n  I hope the administration, on second look, will view it that way, \nwill go to\n\n[[Page S3937]]\n\nthe international meeting in Germany in July, which is the next step in \nthe Kyoto process, will consult with our allies and others in the \nworld, and will find a way, together with us--both parties in \nCongress--to move forward to deal with this problem.\n  We deal with serious problems every day in the Senate. It is part of \nthe challenge and, indeed, the excitement of the privilege we have to \nserve our Nation. It is when we deal with those problems effectively \nthat we have together--all of us--the moments of greatest satisfaction.\n  This, in the long run, is one of the largest problems which any of us \nin this Chamber will ever confront. The sooner we get together and make \nsome progress to deal with it, the better will be the world's future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I now move to proceed to S. 149, and I \nunderstand that there are some opening statements that can be made. I \nhope that we can work through the objections so that we can actually \nmove to the legislation. I move to proceed to the bill at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion, and \nit is debatable.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for moving to \nbring this bill to the floor of the Senate. As many of my colleagues \nknow, the Congress has not reauthorized the Export Administration Act \non a permanent basis since the early 1990s. As a result, we have been \nin a period where we have sought to get multilateral action on export \ncontrols to protect critical national security secrets, but we have had \na very difficult time having standing on those issues among our allies \nwhen we do not even have a regime in place to monitor exports coming \nout of the United States of America.\n  I think it is a terrible indictment of the Congress that for so many \nyears we were unable to enact a bill to restore our export control \nauthorities. I understand that these are very difficult issues, and \nthey are difficult for a very simple reason: the Nation has apparently \nconflicting goals. We want to export high-tech items, we want to \ndominate the world in new technology, we want new innovations to occur \nin America, and we want to be the principal beneficiary of the \ntechnological revolution that is changing our lives and the life of \nevery person who lives on the planet. And to do these things, we want \nAmericans to be able to sell high-tech products on the world market.\n  Wages in these industries are among the highest wages in the world. \nThey really will determine the future of economic development on the \nplanet, and it is a very high American priority to see that we generate \nthese new technologies, that we generate these new jobs, and that \nAmericans be the highest paid workers on the planet.\n  Our problem comes in that we also have an objective of trying to \nprevent sensitive technologies that have defense applications from \ngetting into the hands of people who might, at the current time or in \nthe future, become adversaries of the United States of America. First \nof all, I think we have to admit to ourselves that there is an apparent \nconflict in these two goals and, hence, you have the difficulty in \ndealing with this problem.\n  Now, I want our colleagues to understand that, first, the Banking \nCommittee has very large jurisdiction as it relates to national \nsecurity. In fact, other than the Armed Services Committee, no \ncommittee in Congress has authorizing jurisdiction in defense that \nrivals the Banking Committee.\n  Let me give some examples. The Defense Production Act is under the \nexclusive jurisdiction of the Banking Committee.\n  The Trading with the Enemy Act is under the exclusive jurisdiction of \nthe Banking Committee.\n  The International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which has frequently \nbeen used for export control purposes, is under the exclusive \njurisdiction of the Banking Committee.\n  The Export Administration Act, which is before us today, is under the \nexclusive jurisdiction of the Banking Committee.\n  The Exon-Florio amendment, which set up the process whereby we look \nat foreign ownership of defense industries, to look at the national \nsecurity implications of foreign investments and mergers, is under the \nexclusive jurisdiction of the Banking Committee.\n  Sanctions bills that imposes economic sanctions against any country, \nwhether it be the Iran-Libyan Sanctions Act, or whether it be any \nsanction imposed in the future, would be imposed in legislation that \nfalls under the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee.\n  Quite frankly, I believe some of this dispute is about jurisdiction. \nI did not write the rules of the Senate, but I believe that when this \njurisdiction was put under the Banking Committee, it was the right \ndecision because the Banking Committee is basically the Banking and \nEconomic Committee. These issues have to do with economic matters that \nhave defense implications. I think the correct decision was made in \nplacing these items within the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee.\n  We have spent 2 years exercising our responsibility in trying to come \nup with a workable and, I believe, if I may say so immodestly, a \nsuperior Export Administration Act. We have held extensive hearings on \nthe Export Administration Act.\n  I want to show my colleagues some of the studies that have been done \nthat we have looked at. We have had the authors of these studies appear \nbefore our committee.\n  The first, of course, is the now famous Cox Commission report. This \nwas focused on China, and it was focused on the loss of American \ndefense secrets. The Cox Commission report made a series of \nrecommendations. Those recommendations are now embodied in the bill \nthat is before the Senate.\n  Rather than trying to go through all of the elements of this lengthy \nreport at this time, which obviously would empty the Chamber for \nseveral days as I would be standing alone talking about them, given how \nvoluminous they are, I will share with the Senate one point that Chris \nCox made in presenting these reports to us and giving us the \nrecommendations which we have incorporated in this bill.\n  And this is critically important because I have colleagues who say \nthat now is not the time to do this bill because of our recent problem \nwith China. I say to my colleagues, we should have done this in 1995, \nbut given the problems we have had with China,\n\n[[Page S3938]]\n\ngiven their irresponsible behavior, we need this bill in place now more \nthan ever. If it was not the time to do this 3 weeks ago, it is the \ntime to do it today. I say the time to do it was 5 years ago, and we \ncertainly need to do it today.\n  Chris Cox, in looking at the loss of technology to China, cautioned \nthe committee on something that I think every Member of the Senate, as \nwe begin this debate, needs to be cautious about. What he cautioned us \nabout was doing feel-good things, doing things where we pound our chest \nand act as if we are doing something, when in reality we are not \nachieving anything.\n  One of the things I am very proud to say about this bill is that \nthere is no feel-good provision in this bill. Everything we did we did \nbecause we believed it would work, not because it simply made us feel \ngood to place it in the bill.\n\n  The quote I want to read from Chris Cox is the following:\n\n       We ought not to have export controls to pretend to make \n     ourselves a safe country. We ought to have export controls \n     that work, and you have to assume that if the Ministry of \n     State Security in the People's Republic of China can gain \n     access to the computers at Los Alamos, they can probably gain \n     access to the Radio Shack in Europe.\n\n  One of the fundamental principles of this bill is that we want to \nfocus our attention on technologies that have defense implications, \nthat are significant, and where we have some hope of being successful \nin controlling those technologies. When a million copies of a computer \nhave been manufactured, when they are sold at Radio Shack in Bonn, when \nthere are a million distributed worldwide, there is no possibility that \nwe can keep that computer from falling into anyone's hands who might be \npotentially hostile to the United States of America.\n  We might want to do it. We might wish we could keep an agent from a \nforeign country from going into Radio Shack in Bonn and buying this \ncomputer, but when there are a million copies of it worldwide, only \ndivine intervention could keep someone who wanted that computer from \nhaving it.\n  So rather than waste our time and energy on products that are sold by \nthe millions, we try to focus our attention in this bill on trying to \ndeal with those technologies where we have some realistic hope of being \nsuccessful. Our current Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, said it \nbest when he said we need to build higher walls around a smaller number \nof things, and that is what we have tried to do.\n  The next point that I want to raise from one of the witnesses before \nour committee I think reinforces what Congressman Cox said. It is from \nDonald Hicks, who is the former Under Secretary of Defense for Research \nand Engineering and chairman of the Defense Science Board Task Force on \nGlobalization and Security. Here is what Donald Hicks said. He refers \nto what he calls the ``utter futility of the U.S. attempt to control \nunilaterally technologies, products, and services that even its closest \nallies are releasing on to the world market.''\n  This study in my hand is the study that was done by Under Secretary \nHicks making this point.\n  The next quote I want to give is from John Hamre, who is the former \nDeputy Secretary of Defense. We all knew him when he was the staff \ndirector of the Armed Services Committee. Here is what he says on this \nsubject:\n\n       America needs effective export controls to protect its \n     national security. Our current system of export controls \n     fails that test and fails badly. In ultimately approving 99.4 \n     percent of the requests, we are not really protecting our \n     security. In fact, we are diverting resources from protecting \n     the most important technology and products.\n\n  That is a critical point of this bill. When we have a system where we \nare approving 99.4 percent of the requests for licenses, we have a \nsystem where many things are in the system that should not be in the \nsystem. We are granting licenses on computers that are being \nmanufactured by the millions and sold all over the world.\n  We try to focus our attention where it can do us the most good. Frank \nCarlucci, the former Secretary of Defense and former National Security \nAdviser, gets right to the heart of it when he says:\n\n       But we should do only that which has an effect, not that \n     which simply makes us feel good. Many technologies are \n     uncontrollable, given the access to the Internet. Others can \n     and will be supplied by our competitors. Our job, your job, \n     is to strike the right balance. Don't help our enemies. But \n     at the same time, allow and encourage innovation and research \n     to flourish.\n\n  We have spent 2 years looking at all of these studies, having the \nauthors of all of these studies appear before our committee, and in \neach and every case their recommendation to us is quit doing things \nthat make you feel good. Quit forcing us into a mechanism where we are \nhaving to deal with thousands of items, when 10 are really important. \nBy dealing with thousands, we are not paying enough attention to the 10 \nthat ultimately affect American security.\n  We have put together a bill that I believe dramatically improves the \nexport control process, the export control review mechanism that is \nused, and greatly enhances national security. I am proud to say this \nbill is supported by the President. The President said in very simple \nterms, ``I believe we've got a good bill and I urge the Senate to pass \nit quickly.'' He said this in the East Room of the White House on March \n28.\n  The bill before the Senate has been endorsed by the Secretary of \nDefense, by the Secretary of State, by the President's National \nSecurity Adviser. We gave them an opportunity when the new \nadministration came in, to take the bill we had worked on, and go \nthrough it in detail. They suggested some 21 changes. We adopted those \nchanges. In several cases I thought the previous bill was stronger, but \nwe adopted those changes. I think in the process, on net, we have \nimproved the bill.\n  What does the bill do? The bill strengthens national security. No. 1, \nand most importantly of all these other things, while it doesn't sound \nas robust as these other things I will mention, it is actually more \nimportant. We focus the attention of the export administration process \non defense sensitive items where we have some hope of being successful.\n  We set up a procedure whereby the President is given tremendous \npowers to negotiate international agreements with our major trading \npartners to cooperate to try to prevent sensitive technologies from \ngetting into potentially hostile hands.\n  We establish new criminal and civil penalties for knowing and willful \nviolations. One of our problems under the current situation we face is, \nfor example, that with the question of an illegal transfer of missile \ntechnology to China, given the laws that are in place, even if the \nparties are convicted, the penalties would be trivial. No one will call \nthe penalties in this bill trivial. The penalties in this bill begin \nwith $5 million for a violation. In the case of multiple violations, \nthe penalties could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. We \nhave tough prison sentences for knowing and willful violations. When we \nhave those penalties, we affect people's behavior, which is what we \nneed to do.\n  Again, it is very difficult to enforce these laws. It is difficult to \nprove intent. Knowing it is difficult to catch people, we wanted to \nhave very severe penalties when they are apprehended, prosecuted, and \nconvicted.\n  We strengthened the hand of the national security agencies by, for \nthe first time, giving them a formal procedure by which to be involved \nin this process. We were very concerned that in the previous \nadministration the Defense Department was in a position of not being in \nconcurrence with some decisions that were being made but not having an \neffective way to show it did not agree. So we provided a process \nwhereby if any member of the review panel--and we would assume in \ngeneral it would be the Defense Department--objects, that individual, \nwith the concurrence of the designated political appointee in his or \nher department, has the ability to object and force that decision to \nthe next highest review level. That is a substantial strengthening, in \nmy opinion, of the process.\n\n  We have greater predictability in the process, as well, which is \nimportant both for national security and economic reason.\n  I will end with this: We do have a cloture motion. At some point that \npetition may be filed, because it is critical to national security we \nget on with this process.\n\n[[Page S3939]]\n\n  I conclude by talking about the balance we are trying to establish. \nWe want a balance that allows us to provide for the national security \nof the United States, but on the other hand, we want to be able to be \nthe dominant high-tech manufacturer in the world.\n  Please remember, despite any feel-good speech we could make, most \nhigh-tech companies have operations worldwide, so when they are \ndeveloping a new product, they can develop it in Germany or they can \ndevelop it in Dallas. If we have an export control process that is \ncumbersome or inefficient or costly or overly burdensome, they will \ndevelop these products in Germany and not in Dallas. That is harmful to \nour security, and it is harmful to people who are working in America.\n  This bill is good for security because it restores the expired \ncontrol authority. It adopted the recommendations from the studies I \nreferred to earlier, such as the Cox Commission and the commission \nstudying proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It protects \nsensitive U.S. goods and technologies. It strengthens the role of the \nnational security agencies, and it toughens criminal and civil \npenalties.\n  That is how it strengthens national security, why it is good for \nnational security.\n  Why is it good for trade and for job creation and for the economic \ndevelopment and economic dominance of the United States of America?\n  No. 1, it streamlines controls and procedures.\n  No. 2, it removes ineffective controls where we know an item is mass \nmarketed. A million copies are sold on the world market, and an \nAmerican company trying to get market share ends up, under current \npractices, being delayed for long periods of time to get approval to \nsell something that is readily available on the world market. That \nmakes no sense and it burdens the process to such a degree that we are \nnot paying attention to the things that are really important when we \nare doing those things. This bill changes that, it fixes that problem.\n  This bill brings certainty and transparency to the licensing process. \nWhen somebody applies, they know how the process works. They know what \nthe timetables are. They know they are going to get an answer--yes or \nno. As anybody who has ever been contacted by a high-tech manufacturer \nknows, what they want to know is, yes or no. If the answer is no, they \ncan deal with it. If the answer is yes, they can rejoice. What they \ncannot deal with is no answer, which is what the current process is \nproducing, even though it is eventually approving 99.4 percent of the \napplications.\n  This bill seeks to restore the international cooperation that we had \nunder the cold war export control regime, where we had multilateral \nagreements and where we could prevent things from being sold by one \ncountry or another to our potential adversaries. This bill, first, sets \nup the best system we can set up given we are acting unilaterally, but \nit also gives the President strong new directive to go to England, to \ngo to Germany, to go to Japan, and try to work out multilateral \nagreements, and then this bill automatically makes those binding.\n  Finally, it creates a framework compatible with the high-tech economy \nin which we live and work. We have currently set into static law the \nnumber of MTOPS, millions of theoretical operations per second, that a \ncomputer could generate as a condition for export, when we know that \nthis number is doubling every 6 months. So what did this provision of \nthe law do? What it did was put American producers at a disadvantage \nbecause they would have to go through our export control process, while \ntheir competitors in Germany and Japan could rush right out into the \nmarketplace. Our producers would fool around, trying to get a \nPresidential decision to update the standard, generally with legions of \nhigh-tech people coming to kiss the President's ring and in some cases \nattend his fundraisers.\n\n  That is an unworkable system. It breeds corruption. It hurts America. \nIt does not enhance security. So we in this bill we repeal the MTOP \nlimit and set out a process where the focal point is not on something \nthat is doubling every 6 months--we cannot change that, we cannot \nlegislate it away.\n  I do not question the sincerity of the critics of this bill. I do not \nthink their hearts are any less pure than mine. But I would like to say \nthat I don't take a backseat to anybody in America in supporting \nnational defense. I was in the House, and I helped write the budget in \n1981 that rebuilt defense and helped fund Peace Through Strength that \ntore down the Berlin Wall. I am concerned about American security. My \ndad was a sergeant in the Army. I am from a part of the country that \nlost a war. I understand something about national security and why it \nis important. So while I do not doubt that I have colleagues who have \nnational security concerns, I have those concerns as well. They are \nreflected in this bill and its provisions.\n  I believe we put together a good bill. I know that not everybody \nagrees with that. We got a vote of 19-1 in the Banking Committee. I \nhave been the ``1'' many other times, on other committees under other \ncircumstances, and that didn't make me any the less right that the \nother 19 people voted the other way. I understand that. But we have \ncome to the point where we have to make a decision.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's go to the bill, let's make our cases, and \nI will pledge to them if they convince me that they are right--I helped \nmy colleagues in the committee write the bill the way we wrote it \nbecause I thought it was best, but if there is a better way, I am \nwilling to support changing it. I cannot speak for other people. But if \nmy colleagues can convince me there is a better way of doing it, I will \ndo it that way.\n  What I do not think I can be convinced of is that the best thing to \ndo is to do nothing, that the best thing to do is to continue to limp \nalong without having an effective process in place. I am concerned \nabout the potential threats we face as a nation. I think we need this \nbill to help meet those threats. I urge my colleagues to support the \nbill, but if they are not going to support the bill, tell us how they \nwould make it better, let's look at it, let's have votes on it. Again, \nanybody who has a way to make it better, I am willing to support it. I \ndo not think we have reached the perfect bill yet, but I do think we \nhave a dramatic improvement on the status quo.\n  I thank my colleagues. I thank Senator Enzi and Senator Johnson for \nthe great work they have done. I have never seen a Member get as \ninvolved in issues as Senator Enzi has been involved in this process. I \nhave never seen a Member of the Senate who went to the actual meetings \nof these agencies and sat for hours, trying to figure out what they do \nand why they do it and how it works. The quality of this bill is in \nlarge part due to the work that he did and the work he did with Senator \nJohnson on the International Finance and Trade Subcommittee.\n  I thank Senator Sarbanes. This is a bipartisan effort. Senator \nSarbanes and I are far apart on some kind of mythical, philosophical \nline. But I think the reality is that we have been very effective in \nlegislating and we have been effective because we have tried to work on \na bipartisan basis. If we can work in a bipartisan basis, it can be \ndone.\n  I thank my colleagues for their leadership and their cooperation. I \nam hopeful we will pass this bill. I hope after the debate our \ncolleagues who are concerned about the bill will be convinced--not \nnecessarily to be for it--but will be convinced that maybe it is an \nimprovement over the status quo, and maybe it is not quite as bad as \nthey would think.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is debating the motion to proceed \nto S. 149.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to adopt the motion to proceed and \ngive itself the opportunity to move to the substantive consideration of \nS. 149, the Export Administration Act of 2001. The adoption of this \nmotion to proceed would enable Senators, then, to consider the bill on \nits merits, to offer amendments, if they have them, to alter or change \nthe bill in whatever direction they think is desirable. I think this is \nimportant legislation. I am frank to say I think this bill before us\n\n[[Page S3940]]\n\nis well crafted and deserves the support of the Senate. But in any \nevent, whatever your attitude on that question is, I certainly think \nthis issue, and this legislation dealing with this issue, deserves to \nbe considered by the Senate.\n  I very much hope, after we have had this opportunity for some \ndiscussion, we will be able to move ahead and consider the bill on its \nmerits. I understand it is the leadership's intention to file a cloture \nmotion--the leadership, as I understand it, on both sides of the \naisle--in order to enable us to go to this legislation. I hope that \nwill not be necessary. I think there is a compelling argument for \ntaking up this bill and addressing this issue.\n  Let me say a few words about the bill itself. Earlier this year, I \nwas pleased to join with my colleagues, Senator Enzi, Senator Johnson, \nand Senator Gramm, in introducing this legislation. It was reported out \nof the Banking Committee on a bipartisan vote of 19-1, so there was a \nvery strong majority within the committee. That was on March 22 that we \nmet and marked up the bill and reported it to the floor of the Senate.\n  The Export Administration Act provides the President authority to \ncontrol exports for reasons of national security and foreign policy. I \nthink there is a strong national interest in Congress reauthorizing the \nExport Administration Act. If we do not do that by August, there will \nbe no Export Administration Act. And, in fact, we are now working under \na temporary extension of the Export Administration Act, passed in the \nlast Congress, which will expire in August.\n  Before we passed that temporary extension, we were dealing under the \nInternational Economic Emergency Powers Act. Let me be very clear about \nthis because it is very important. We need to understand what the \nsituation has been and what the situation will be if we do not act on \nthis legislation. The Export Administration Act has not been \nreauthorized since 1990, except for temporary extensions in 1993, 1994, \nand last year. In other words, for most of the past decade we have been \noperating without an Export Administration Act. We are now in the \nframework of a temporary extension that expires on August 20 of this \nyear.\n  Without these temporary extensions--in other words, for over this \npast decade--the authority of the President to impose export controls \nhas been exercised pursuant to the International Economic Emergency \nPowers Act--the so-called IEEPA.\n  In my view, it is highly desirable for the Congress to put in place a \npermanent statutory framework for the imposition of export controls. \nThat is what this bill will do. That underscores the importance of \nconsidering this legislation. Export controls should not be imposed \npursuant to the emergency economic authority of the President.\n  One example of the reason for depending on IEEPA is that penalties \nthat may be imposed under export controls under IEEPA are significantly \nless than those imposed by this legislation. In other words, reliance \non IEEPA and the President's extraordinary authority under that \nlegislation still leaves us falling short in terms of the penalties for \nviolations of export controls for what this legislation provides.\n  It is ironic that this bill is being in effect contested on these \nnational security grounds when in fact it does more to protect the \nnational security concerns than the existing IEEPA scheme.\n  The IEEPA scheme is also weak in the sense we are quite worried that \nit will be subject to a court challenge, which in effect would make the \nlimited penalties that it contains inapplicable. I think that has to be \nkept very much in mind as we consider taking up this legislation.\n  This legislation has been worked over very carefully. I think it \nrepresents a carefully balanced effort to provide the President \nauthority to control exports for reasons of national security and \nforeign policy while at the same time responding to the need of U.S. \nexporters to compete in the global marketplace.\n  We have two major objectives we are trying to harmonize. I think this \nlegislation does it in a balanced way.\n  In preparation for acting on this legislation, the Banking Committee \nheld two hearings in this Congress. We held a number of hearings in \nprevious Congresses and two hearings with representatives of industry \ngroups and foreign and Defense Department officials. Extensive \nconsultation took place with representatives of the current \nadministration, including representatives of the Defense Department, \nthe State Department, the intelligence agencies, the Commerce \nDepartment, and the National Security Council.\n  Prior to the markup of the legislation in the Banking Committee, \nCondoleezza Rice, Assistant to the President for National Security \nAffairs, sent a letter to the committee. I will quote it because I \nthink it is important. I will quote it actually in full. The Assistant \nto the President for National Security Affairs in a letter to the \nchairman of our committee stated:\n\n       The Administration has carefully reviewed the current \n     version of S. 149, the Export Administration Act of 2001, \n     which provides authority for controlling exports of dual-use \n     goods and technologies. As a result of its review, the \n     Administration has proposed a number of changes to S. 149.\n\n  Actually a number of colleagues were involved in urging the \nadministration to seek such changes, including colleagues I see on the \nfloor now and who remain, I take it, concerned about this legislation.\n  To go back to the letter:\n\n       The Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of \n     Commerce, and I agree that these changes will strengthen the \n     President's national security and foreign policy authorities \n     to control dual-use exports in a balanced manner, which will \n     permit U.S. companies to compete more effectively in the \n     global market place. With these changes, S. 149 represents a \n     positive step towards the reform of the U.S. export control \n     system supported by the President. If the Committee \n     incorporates these changes into S. 149, the Administration \n     will support the bill. We will continue to work with the \n     Congress to ensure that our national security needs are \n     incorporated into a rational export control regime.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, a major effort was made by the committee \nto work through the list of proposals by the administration. Those \nproposals were incorporated into the bill during the Banking \nCommittee's markup. I thought the administration's recommendations were \na balanced set of proposals. I believe they strengthen the overall \nbill.\n  Subsequent to that and subsequent to the committee reporting the bill \nout, the President in remarks to high-tech leaders at the White House \non March 28 urged quick passage of this bill by the Senate.\n  In that appearance at the White House--and I will quote briefly from \nthe President's--actually, he started off by saying to this group:\n\n       Thanks for coming. I appreciate that warm welcome. And \n     welcome to the people's house. It's a nice place to live. And \n     I'm glad I'm living here.\n\n  That is the President talking.\n  He went on and said to the high-tech group:\n\n       I've got some good news and you may have been watching the \n     Senate Banking Committee. But after a lot of work with \n     industry leaders and the administration and members of the \n     Senate, the Export Administration Act--a good bill--passed \n     the Banking Committee 19-1.\n\n  He then goes on to say that ``this has been crafted as a good bill. \nAnd I urge the Senate to pass it quickly.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these remarks of the \nPresident in a meeting with high-tech leaders be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remark.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I commend very strongly Senator Enzi, \nwho was chairman of the relevant subcommittee in the last Congress and \nchairman of the International Trade and Finance Committee, and Senator \nJohnson, who is the ranking member of that subcommittee, for their \nextraordinary work in developing this legislation. They worked \ntirelessly both in the last Congress and again in this Congress to help \nbring us to this point.\n  I commend Senator Gramm and the staff of all Senators and the \ncommittee staff for their strong efforts to develop a bipartisan \nconsensus on this legislation.\n  Senator Hagel and Senator Bayh, who have taken over these positions \nnow in the new Congress on the subcommittee, also made constructive \ncontributions in moving this legislation forward this year.\n\n[[Page S3941]]\n\n  Let me say this about the legislation. It generally tracks the \nauthority provided the President under the Export Administration Act, \nwhich expired in 1990, as I indicated earlier. But a significant effort \nwas made with the excellent assistance of the legislative counsel's \noffice to delineate these authorities in a more clear and \nstraightforward manner.\n  We made a very strong effort to inject an element of clarity and \ndirectness into the statute which would make it easier for the \nexecutive branch agencies to administer the statute and for the \nexporters to comply with it.\n  The bill makes a number of significant improvements to the EAA. It \nprovides, for the first time, a statutory basis for the resolution of \ninteragency disputes over export license applications. The intent is to \nprovide an orderly process for the timely resolution of disputes while \nallowing all interested agencies a full opportunity to express their \nviews.\n  This is very important. There is an orderly process now by which \ndisputes can be moved up the ladder in order to be resolved. So any \nconcern that any department or agency of the Government has as they \nwork through this interagency process can be heard and dealt with and \nresolved, and, if necessary, at the final level, be resolved at the \nPresidential level. This orderly process was an issue of great concern \nto the administration, to the national security community, and to \nindustry.\n  I think we have reached a reasonable resolution of the issue in this \nbill. This was an issue on which Senator Enzi and Senator Johnson spent \ncountless hours in order to try to work out arrangements that would be \nacceptable to all. As I have indicated, now they are acceptable to the \nagencies and the departments of the executive branch across the board. \nNot one department or agency is coming in now and telling us they think \nthis is not a workable system under which they can operate.\n  The bill significantly increases both criminal and civil penalties \nfor violations of the Export Administration Act, reflecting the \nseriousness of such violations.\n  The bill provides new authority to the President to determine that a \ngood has mass market status in the United States and should therefore \nbe decontrolled. This gets at this issue of, well, you can go out and \nbuy a store on the market. Why are we controlling this good? But the \nbill retains authority for the President to set aside a mass market \ndetermination if he determines it would constitute a serious threat to \nnational security and that continued export controls would be likely to \nadvance the national security interests of the United States. So we \nretain an ultimate authority in the President with respect to this \nmatter.\n  At the particular urging of Senator Enzi, the bill contains a \nprovision that would require the President to establish a system of \ntiers to which countries would be assigned based on their perceived \nthreat to U.S. national security. The intent of this provision is to \nprovide exporters a clear guide as to the licensing requirements of an \nexport of a particular item to a particular country.\n  The bill would also require that any foreign company that declined a \nU.S. request for a postshipment verification of an export would be \ndenied licenses for future exports. The President would have authority \nto deny licenses to affiliates of the company and to the country in \nwhich the company is located as well.\n  You get a sense of the reach of some of these provisions in providing \nimportant protections for national security concerns.\n  We also included a provision in the committee to make a number of \ntechnical corrections and incorporate the suggestions made by the \nadministration.\n  The bill contains a provision from the expired EAA relating to the \nimposition of export controls on crime control and detection \ninstruments that inadvertently had not been included in the bill as \nintroduced.\n  So, to close, let me just again underscore that this is a very \ncarefully crafted piece of legislation. It is a very balanced piece of \nwork. I believe that the Senate, when it finally is able to get to the \nsubstance of the bill, will provide broad support for it, just as it \nhad broad support in the committee.\n\n  Again, I underscore that though it is asserted now that the \nprotections are inadequate for national security and foreign policy, \nthat runs so counter to the situation in which we find ourselves. If \nyou compare what is in this bill with the existing arrangements, or \nwith the previous arrangements under the EAA, this bill has done a good \njob of providing clarity and providing process of procedure of the \narrangements to be followed, which gives to the exporters more \ndefinition and more certainty in how they can proceed, what the rules \nof the road are, while at the same time retaining for the \nadministration, ultimately for the President, very significant powers \nin controlling exports.\n  As I indicated, it establishes tough new criminal and civil penalties \nfor export control violations. It strengthens our ability to control \ncritical technologies by building a higher fence around the truly \nsensitive items. That is very important. One of the things we are \ntrying to accomplish is a focus on the truly sensitive items. It grants \nthe President special control authorities for cases involving national \nsecurity, international obligations, and international terrorism. It \npromotes discipline in licensing decisions by codifying the role of \nnational security agencies in the licensing process and then \nstreamlining licensing procedures, and it encourages U.S. participation \nin strong multilateral export control regimes.\n  We have a short timeframe to deal with this legislation this year, \ngiven that the short-term extension of the EAA expires this summer in \nAugust. We need to put in place a permanent statutory framework for the \nimposition of export controls. I believe this legislation is that \nframework. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the effort to move \nto this legislation and subsequently to enact it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Remarks by the President in Meeting With High-Tech Leaders, March 28, \n                                  2001\n\n       The President. Thanks for coming. I appreciate that warm \n     welcome. And welcome to the people's house. It's a nice place \n     to live. (Laughter.) And I'm glad I'm living here.\n       . . . As well, I've got some good news and you may have \n     been watching the Senate Banking Committee. But after a lot \n     of work with industry leaders and the administration and \n     members of the Senate, the Export Administration Act--a good \n     bill--passed the Banking Committee 19-1.\n       The technology that you all have helped develop obviously \n     gives us an incredible military advantage, and that's going \n     to be important. And it's an advantage, by the way, that we \n     tend--want to develop, to make sure we can keep the peace, \n     not just tomorrow, but 30 years from now. We've got to \n     safeguard our advantages, but we've got to do so in ways that \n     are relevant to today's technology, not that of 20 years ago.\n       The existing export controls forbid the sales abroad of \n     computers with more than a certain amount of computing power. \n     With computing power doubling every 18 months, these controls \n     had the shelf life of sliced bread. They don't work.\n       So in working with the Senate, we're working to tighten the \n     control of sensitive technology products with unique military \n     applications, and to give our industry an equal chance in \n     world markets. And I believe we've got a good bill. It's a \n     bill that I heard from you all during the course of the \n     campaign. The principles we discussed are now a part of this \n     bill. I want to thank Senator Phil Gramm for his hard work in \n     working with us and industry and some members of the Senate \n     to make sure the bill that has been crafted is a good bill. \n     And I urge the Senate to pass it quickly.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I objected to the motion earlier to \nproceed to the Export Administration Act. I want to share some of my \nconcerns in why I did that.\n  I, too, serve on the Banking Committee. I have been on it 15 years. I \nworked with Senator Gramm, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Enzi, and Senator \nJohnson. It is a great committee. It is the committee of jurisdiction \nfor this legislation. I also happen to be chairman of the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence. And this is why I am concerned about this \npiece of legislation today.\n  Yesterday, we in the Intelligence Committee spent 2 hours being \nbriefed on the damage of our national security from China's seizure of \nsensitive technologies aboard our EP-3 reconnaissance plane, which \nremains, as of this hour, in Chinese custody.\n  Chinese technicians are picking that plane apart, and I do not \nbelieve they\n\n[[Page S3942]]\n\nare looking for loose change under the seat cushions.\n  Yet today, right now, we are talking about moving to debate a bill \nthat will make it easier for the Chinese, and others, to get technology \nlike that aboard the EP-3 and other advanced technologies without any \nlicensing or export restrictions.\n  I ask my colleagues: What is wrong with this picture?\n  I am sure the Chinese leadership can't believe its luck. The U.S. \nSenate, which until a few days ago was criticizing China's aggressive \ntactics, militaristic policies, and disdain for the rule of law, is now \nrushing to open the floodgates for the advanced technologies China \nneeds to upgrade its military.\n  And a few days after the administration announced an unprecedented \npackage of arms to help Taiwan defend itself, the Senate wants to sell \nChina the very technologies that will help it to overcome Taiwan's \ndefenses, and threaten the U.S.\n  The events of the last several weeks underscore a fact that has been \napparent to many of us for some time: China is not our strategic \npartner. It is our competitor and could be our adversary.\n  Yet we are moving ahead on this bill today as if these events never \noccurred. I fear the Senate is signaling to the Chinese that whatever \nthey do and however much we may criticize their actions, we will always \nput our commercial interests ahead of our national security.\n  We have done this in the past, and we are reaping the results today.\n  Equally important is the risk of advanced dual-use technologies \nfalling into the hands of countries such as Iran, Iraq, or Libya.\n  While supporters emphasize the economic benefits of provisions in \nthis bill that would ease controls on exports to large markets like \nRussia and China, they don't tell you that Russia and China are \nroutinely identified by the Director of Central Intelligence as the \n``key suppliers'' of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons \ntechnologies.\n  Although this bill may help our U.S. technology industry increase its \nexports in the short run, I believe its impact on our national security \nin the long run may be disastrous.\n  As a result, I cannot support proceeding to this bill at this time \nuntil the entire U.S. Government has had an opportunity to thoroughly \nreview the legislation, take a fresh look at our overall China policy, \nconduct an in-depth study of our export control policies, and address \nthe national security concerns shared by the chairmen of the national \nsecurity committees in the Senate.\n  In addition to these governmentwide efforts, we in the Senate must do \nour homework. This is an extremely complex piece of legislation that \nraises a host of extremely complex issues. They need to be debated and \nlooked at thoroughly.\n  The economic benefits of increased high technology exports are \nquickly apparent and relatively obvious; the national security \nimplications are less immediate, less obvious, and often classified.\n  Therefore, before voting on this legislation, every Senator should \nhave the benefit of the extensive briefings that Senators Warner, \nHelms, Thompson, Kyl, McCain, and I have had.\n  Should the Senate now vote to take up the EAA, I intend to join my \ncolleagues from the other national security committees in setting forth \nin detail our concerns about the national security implications of this \nbill.\n  We believe the case is compelling for those who are willing to \nlisten.\n  That is why I object to proceeding with the bill so soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this historic \nlegislation before the Senate. I regret that there is resistance to the \nmotion to proceed. I believe it would be best to proceed to the \nconsideration of this legislation by the full Senate, to debate the \nmerits of the legislation, and, for those who object, to provide \nopportunities for them to offer amendments to be debated on their \nmerits in the course of our consideration.\n  Whether we move forward today or are delayed a couple more days, it \nis important that we move ahead as expeditiously as we can on passage \nof the Export Administration Act reauthorization.\n  This legislation is the culmination of many long hours of bipartisan \ncooperation to modernize America's export laws to reflect our rapidly \nchanging world. It was first put together last year, when I served as \nranking member of the Subcommittee on International Trade and Finance \nof the Banking Committee. Senator Enzi, my Republican colleague from \nWyoming, served as chairman of that subcommittee. We were able to pass \nsimilar legislation out of the committee on a 20-0 vote. This year \nSenator Enzi and I have moved on to other subcommittees but have \nremained actively involved in this issue.\n  I particularly commend Senator Enzi for his continued strong \nleadership and the work he and his staff have put into this effort. The \nconsequence of that work during this Congress has been the legislation \nbefore us that passed out of the Banking Committee on a bipartisan vote \nof 19-1 and which has the support of the President of the United \nStates, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the Secretary \nof Commerce, as well as the National Security Adviser to the President.\n  While there are some who raise the specter of diminished security \nconcerns, it is interesting that, in fact, not only is there \noverwhelming bipartisan congressional support for this balanced piece \nof legislation, but the people who are most knowing or most in the \nposition to advocate for strong national security in America, our \nPresident and Secretaries of Defense and State, are all supportive of \nthis legislation. To raise the specter of China strikes me as something \nthat has been thought through very carefully by our President and our \ndefense establishment in the course of endorsing and supporting this \nbill.\n  The fact is, under this legislation, our national security would be \nstrengthened, not diminished. Yes, sales of technology items could be \nmade to China but only those items which our defense establishment and \nour President endorse as appropriate sales and which are otherwise \navailable on the open market.\n  I have had the great pleasure of working on a team with Senators \nEnzi, Gramm, Sarbanes, and their staffs, to craft this legislation. I \nthank them for their professionalism and their cooperation on this \neffort. It is rare that legislation of this importance comes before the \nSenate with this level of bipartisan support, and the cooperation and \nsupport of the White House and the defense and commerce establishments \nin the United States. It is a rare day that legislation of such \nconsensus comes before us. I had hoped we would not lose this \nopportunity to advance the interests of our national security and our \neconomy at the same time.\n  I am gratified for the support of the Bush administration and their \nwillingness to express their support for the legislation.\n  I also note with appreciation the role Senators Gramm and Sarbanes \nhave played. We have had constructive participation across the board, \nand that spirit contributed to the construction of the newly amended \nversion of S. 149 that is before the Senate today.\n  As my colleagues know, we live in a truly global economy. America has \nenjoyed unprecedented growth in recent years in large part because of \nthe expansion of our marketplace overseas. American businesses look \nwell beyond our borders for customers, and exports play a critical role \nin keeping our economy strong. We have also seen enormous changes in \nthe goods, services, and the technologies American companies produce.\n  Back in my home State of South Dakota, we have seen a 172-percent \nincrease in high-tech employment over this past decade. Our workers \nhave benefited from the good jobs and fair salaries that the high-tech \nsector brings. The goods, the services, and the technologies they \nproduce are in tremendous demand throughout the world.\n  However, we must not be naive. Certain products and technologies can \nbe used for the wrong purpose. But we must not allow fear to prevent us \nfrom crafting laws that face those issues head on and establish a \nbalance between economic growth and national security, and our other \nneeds.\n\n[[Page S3943]]\n\n  The Export Administration Act is a thoughtful, balanced bill. EAA is \nan important step toward ensuring our continued ability to export \nAmerican goods to the rest of the world. At the same time, EAA includes \nthe necessary safeguards to ensure that our export policy protects our \nvital national security interests.\n  Since EAA's expiration in 1990, Congress has declined numerous \nopportunities to reauthorize the EAA. I lament those missed \nopportunities, and strongly urge my colleagues not to squander the \nopportunity before us today.\n  Reauthorization has become still more urgent as the courts consider \nthe legality of our reliance on an expired EAA, and on the annual \ntemporary extensions we provided in the underlying legal authority \nclaimed under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. I fear \nthe day that one of these challenges will ultimately succeed and strip \nthis Congress of any control over sensitive dual-use technologies. \nContrary to what some of my distinguished colleagues may argue, \nreauthorization of the EAA in fact greatly enhances our national \nsecurity.\n  We had a simple goal when we embarked on this effort: reduce or \neliminate controls on exports with no security implications, and \ntighten controls on exports that raise security concerns. These \nprinciples are not controversial; yet crafting legislation that puts \nthese principles into practice has been difficult to accomplish.\n  We worked very closely with concerned Senators, the national security \nestablishment, the administration, and the impacted industries. I \nbelieve we addressed the major concerns in a balanced manner.\n  We increased the penalties on export violations, so that violators of \nexport control laws will pay a real price for breaking the law. We made \nrealistic assessments with respect to what items should be decontrolled \nbased on foreign availability and mass market standards.\n  It does us no good to be trying to limit the export of items that can \nbe found anywhere on the open market throughout the world.\n  In one respect, however, I am disappointed. I am disappointed that we \nwere forced to drop title IV, which lifted the practice of using food \nand medicine as a weapon against rogue nations. It is my understanding \nthat a majority of the national farm groups believe our language could \npotentially delay regulatory actions with respect to the lifting of \nsanctions.\n  But as important as that legislation is, I also acknowledge that \nthere are other forms, other vehicles, legislatively for those issues \nto be taken up at a time when we need to focus primarily on the export \nof high-technology products and the defense implications of those \nexports in the course of this debate. I am confident there will be \nother opportunities to raise the larger issue of economic sanctions on \nagricultural and medical products throughout the world.\n  My colleagues, the Export Administration Act is a good bill. It is a \nbalanced bill. It is good for America and for Americans.\n  S. 149 strengthens our national security--it doesn't weaken it. To \nthose who argue against this legislation in light of recent events with \nChina, I respectfully refer to them to the Cox Report that specifically \nrecommended reauthorization of the EAA as a way to strengthen our \nnational security with respect to exports to China. The EAA is a \nstrategic, intelligent response to the real threats that face America.\n  America benefits when our businesses prosper. Exporting technology \nhas long been an American success story. The high-tech field will lead \nour economy into the next century. We understand, new technologies \ncould prove dangerous in the wrong hands, and our national security \ndepends in part on limiting access to limited specific goods, services \nand technologies. That is the balance we seek to strike, and I believe \nS. 149 does that.\n  That is the balance that has caused this broad-based, bipartisan \nsupport, and the support of the White House, for this effort.\n  I look forward to a vigorous debate of these important issues. \nPassage of this EAA bill will make a significant contribution to our \nnational security and will help bring transparency to our export \ncontrol system. I encourage my colleagues to join this bipartisan, \nbalanced approach to these critical issues.\n  I regret that we may not proceed today on the motion. If that is the \ncase, I have great confidence that with the cloture motion we will be \nback on this legislation within a very short period of time.\n  Again, in closing, I commend the leadership of Senator Enzi, my \nfriend from my neighboring State of Wyoming, and his staff for the work \nthey have devoted to this effort, as well as to Chairman Gramm and the \nranking member, Senator Sarbanes, who have worked with us and with \ntheir staffs throughout this entire effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I support the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, who objected to proceeding at this time on this \nbill. First of all, I wish to state my reasons for supporting an \nobjection to proceeding at this time.\n  I do not think this bill is going to be delayed indefinitely. It is \nnot my wish to do that. I think the Export Administration Act ought to \nbe reauthorized. I have thought that for a long time.\n  The question is, What is going to go in the act when we reauthorize \nit? We have had a vigorous bipartisan debate inside the Senate, and I \nwould venture to say also inside the House, among our Members, as to \nwhat we ought to do about controlling or decontrolling certain \nsensitive items in this country. We all have the same goals, but we \nhave markedly different views regarding certain aspects of how to \nachieve those goals. We now are being--after having about 24 hours' \nnotice--asked to take up a piece of legislation which has national \nsecurity implications, which is controversial, which is going to take \nsome time in order to consider amendments which we think can benefit \nand strengthen the bill. It is going to take some time in that regard. \nIt is simply not something that we should be fitting in in the middle \nof a week for a day, or day and a half, and either dispose of it or \ncontinue it on to another time. We ought to try to get together and set \naside some time, a reasonable time--I would be in favor of a time \nagreement to do that--so amendments can be heard and we can debate the \nmerits of the bill.\n  This is not the time to do that. It is going to take more time than \nwhat we have right now. At the outset, perhaps in some respects in a \nvery general sense, balancing our concern over commerce with national \nsecurity is what we are about. But that is not what the Export \nAdministration is all about. That is not what export controls are all \nabout.\n  It is pretty clear that what that is all about is national security. \nIt doesn't say anything in this bill or anything in the legislation on \nthe books now that we should engage in this balancing act of commerce \nversus national security. What it says is that you protect national \nsecurity. In the bill before us, the purposes are set out. The purposes \nof national security export controls are the following: To restrict the \nexport of items that would contribute to the military potential of \ncountries so as to prove detrimental to the national security of the \nUnited States and to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n\n  That is what this bill before us states is the purpose of these \ncontrols. That is with what we are dealing.\n  As we proceed, I hope we do not think we should strive so hard to \ndraw a 50-50 balance with regard to the considerations involved because \nthey are heavily weighted, to say the least, toward national security. \nThat, of course, is the basis of our concern.\n  In terms of the timing, it is my understanding that a part of the \nadministration's position is they want to draft an Executive order that \nwill strengthen the visibility and the voice of other Federal agencies \nin the interagency dispute resolution process that will give the \nDepartment of Defense greater visibility and a major role in the \ncommodity classification process and ensure that deemed exports are \ncovered, which are not covered by this law. Those are three very \nimportant provisions that the administration says it wants to address \nby means of an Executive order.\n  I think we are entitled to see that Executive order. I believe we \nwould\n\n[[Page S3944]]\n\nwant to consider whether or not to make them a part of the legislation. \nThey are very important items, as important as several of the items \nthat are in the legislation.\n  It is only proper, considering the severity of the issues with which \nwe are dealing, that we have all of the cards on the table and that we \ndeal with them in an appropriate manner.\n  Also--and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee alluded to \nthis--this is the wrong time to bring this up for another reason. It \nhas broad ramifications and broad applications with regard to many \ndifferent items and many different countries, but this is, in many \nrespects, a China trade bill.\n  Much of the impetus among the commercial world for getting this \npassed has to do with decontrolling previously controlled items, many \nof which are high-technology items, many of which have potential \nmilitary application, and many of which would be going to China. They \nhave a vast potential market. Only about 10 percent of the items we \nexport to China are controlled items. So it is not a large part of what \nwe are doing with them right now.\n  Apparently the idea is, with China's concentration on high tech and \ntheir need for our supercomputers and other sensitive matters, that \ntrade will pick up and the desire among industry is to more easily \nexport without having to apply for a license, that trail of what \ngranting a license entails. That is what this is all about.\n  At a time when the Chinese leadership is issuing belligerent \nstatements with regard to our policy toward Taiwan, right after they \ndetained 24 American crew members and, as the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee pointed out, we are feverishly trying to destroy \ncomputers aboard those airplanes and other items of hardware and \nsoftware, at a time when the Chinese are engaged in a rapid military \nbuildup and have 300 missiles on their coastline that can be used \nagainst Taiwan, at a time when they are detaining Chinese American \nscholars against their will, I do not think this is the time to send \nthe message to China that we are going to engage not only in business \nas usual but become even more liberal in our policies of sensitive \nexports. We had best wait until that dust settles a little bit before \nwe take it up.\n\n  We have had a policy in this country for some time of controlling \ncertain matters that fall into the sensitive category with regard to \nsupercomputers, milling machinery, centrifuges, and a host of items \nwhich have dual use, both civilian and potential military use.\n  It has always been a concern as to how far we can go in allowing \ncivilian trade without the items being used by the military. We find \nfrom time to time, on the rare occasions we check on them, that China \nhas diverted from civilian to military use. The Cox Commission points \nout to us that they are using our high technology to benefit their \nmilitary. It is not that we have to speculate about that.\n  This Congress has responded in various ways with regard to high-\nperformance computers which can be used for simulation, for nuclear \ntesting, reliability, and without actually doing the testing of the \nbombs. They can use computers nowadays to test the efficacy of their \nbombs by use of high-speed computers. So Congress in 1998, as a part of \nthe National Defense Authorization Act, provided, with regard to these \nhigh-speed computers, that there should be a national security \nassessment to see to what extent we might be harming ourselves.\n  That act also provided for postshipment verifications for tier III \ncountries, such as China; in other words, to see how these computers \nare actually being used in China.\n  It also required congressional review with regard to notification \nthresholds. We require our exporters to notify the authorities when \nthey are doing certain things at certain levels. If the President is \ngoing to change that notification threshold, he needs to notify \nCongress.\n  The bill before us would basically do away with all of those \nrequirements and would abrogate those requirements that Congress set \ndown in 1998. If we take these broad categories of items totally off \nthe books and say there is no licensing at all, there will be no \nmonitoring even of what is being shipped to whom. There will be no \nability for a cumulative effect analysis. This particular item or that \nparticular item does not have a serious effect but the cumulative \neffect of all of them might. That is a requirement of the law that has \nnot been observed in the last decade, as far as I know.\n  This is going to be the basis of the discussion. That is not to say \nwe should not reauthorize the act. That is not to say we cannot improve \nand close some of these openings that I believe are unfortunate and \nuncalled for and deleterious to those issues on which we all agree.\n  We hear all this talk about building bigger fences around a smaller \nand smaller number of items, but I do not see where the fences are. I \nwould like to have explained to me how we are building higher fences by \nthis act, because this is a decontrolling, in large part. There are \ncertainly other provisions, but I see nothing where there is a \ntightening of the process in building higher fences. We are winding up \nwith more openings in that fence instead of building a higher fence.\n  Substantively, the bill before us is a good improvement over the \nfirst draft last year. We had certain concerns about it. We had a lot \nof discussions about it. It was vigorously defended.\n  The administration has come in and just within a few days--they have \ntwo people confirmed in the Department of Defense right now. That is \nwith what we are dealing. When we talk about the administration and all \nthese various agencies that have a piece and a part of this as we go \nthrough the licensing process, let's keep that in mind.\n  It will be the better part of a year before this administration is \nintact because of the scandalous difficulty we have in getting people \nthrough this process in our Government. It has been going on for a long \ntime.\n\n  A lot of these things require input of people who are appointed by \nthe President and confirmed by the Senate. If this bill was part of the \nlaw today, as far as defense is concerned, as far as appealing \nsomething, for example, in the export control process, it would either \nhave to be Mr. Rumsfeld or Mr. Wolfowitz because they are the only ones \nwho fit that criteria. That is totally unworkable.\n  Another reason not to rush is that we do not have an administration \nthat is fully staffed in the relevant departments.\n  One of the key provisions involves foreign availability, the idea if \nunder the Secretary's determination, after consulting with others, the \nSecretary of Commerce determines there is foreign availability of an \nitem, they will lift controls, the idea being it will not do any good \nto try to control that.\n  There is probably some truth to that. It very well may be we are \ntrying to control more than what can be controlled. The real question \nis not whether or not we on this side of the issue or our colleagues on \nthe other side of the issue can sit here and determine what ought or \nought not be controlled. The question is, can we come up with a \nprocedure where on the questionable items, we know they will get full, \nfair, and complete consideration by people who ought to be considering \nthe products. That is the question. We are not talking about things all \nover the world, through Radio Shacks around the world. Keep in mind, we \nare not talking about restricting any of these items from being \nexported. We are talking about whether we ought to have a license \nrequirement.\n  Most of these items are going to be exported anyway. The difference \nis whether or not it will take 30 or 45 days or whatever the normal \namount of time is. Sometimes goods are held up longer than that. \nSometimes they are held for national security reasons and this cannot \nbe explained to the person making the application. There is a bit of \ndelay there. In most cases it is not a great delay.\n  Some say our competitors are so hot on our trail, our European allies \nare so close to us in technology that the month delay will mess up a \nlarge number of sales. That is not very credible as far as I am \nconcerned. We have the lead in so many areas that going through the \nlicensing process, if it goes through as it should and is supposed to, \nis not going to make the difference in terms of this commercial \nactivity.\n  We need to think through the foreign availability argument. If the \ngenie is out of the bottle and none of these things can be controlled, \nwhy do we still have restrictions on rogue nations? If we furnish \nSaddam with the\n\n[[Page S3945]]\n\ncomputers, wouldn't that be better than having somebody else furnish \nthem, if he is going to have them anyway, or the centrifuges or the \nmilling machines--they are sensitive--that go to make nuclear items? \nThere are certain good arguments, good reasons to be made that he will \nhave it anyway; why not supply it with our companies so we know exactly \nhow it works.\n  I find it a bit inconsistent to say none of this stuff is \ncontrollable. It is out there; you can't do anything with it. But we \nwant to make real sure we keep these controls on rogue nations--Iran, \nIraq, and the bad guys. Clearly there is a limit. Clearly there is a \nline. Maybe we have not drawn the line in the right place in times \npast. Maybe even the old end top criteria is out of date. It has been \ngoing so rapidly up it has become almost irrelevant. Many have been \ncritical of the Clinton administration for raising it so rapidly and \nnow it will be done away with altogether. We are having to take a new \nlook at that. People say you cannot regulate computing power. You have \nto regulate or deal with the software. You have to deal with the \napplication being made with the use of the computer. It is a different \nkind of world with which we are dealing.\n\n  We have to be careful. While acknowledging that technology has \ngreatly expanded and there are more things in the world that perhaps \ncan't be controlled, there are still some areas where we do not want to \nopen the floodgates. The question is, What are those areas and what \nkind of procedure will we have to ensure that those are not sent along \nwith the rest? When we deal with thousands and thousands of items, it \nis not an easy answer.\n  The President, it has been pointed out, under this bill, can have a \nset-aside if there is a threat to national security. On this business \nof balancing commercial interests over national security, get a load of \nthis: The set-aside provides the President can take this action only if \nthere is a threat to national security, not because it has national \nsecurity implications. I assume this is a direct threat. I don't know. \nBut the President cannot do this until there is a threat to national \nsecurity. Then once he makes the determination that there is a threat \nto national security, he has to leap more hurdles than if he were in \nthe average track meet. If he makes the designation, he has to report \nto Congress and justify himself. Then under this bill he is required to \npursue negotiations to try to get the countries making this available \nto quit making it available. He has to notify Congress about that. Then \nthe President has to review this matter every 6 months.\n  Remember, this is a matter that is a threat to national security. He \nis required to review this every 6 months so it can be lifted if the \ncircumstances change. He has to report that to Congress and justify not \nlifting it. Then the President, after having gone through all of that, \nif the set-aside is still standing, has to relinquish his set-aside if \nthere is still not a high probability that there will be any changes \nmade in terms of the foreign availability picture, and if there is no \nagreement under any circumstances after 18 months, the President has \nthis authority. We make the President do a lot of things and place \nburdens on him to do that.\n  As far as mass marketing is concerned, it has to be a serious threat \nto national security. Foreign availability, he can set it aside with a \nthreat to national security. For some reason, if the item in question \nis mass marketed, just in the United States, presumably, the President \nhas a set-aside if there is a serious threat to national security.\n  We will want to debate and see whether or not we can improve that \nlanguage, whether or not we want to set that high standard for a \nPresident to stop an export, that it has to reach that extremely high \nstandard when we know already that the Chinese are using our high \ntechnology to benefit their military.\n  The penalties are great in this bill. There is no question about \nthat. But before an item has already been decontrolled, there is no \ndanger of any penalty coming into play.\n  My concern is this: We have a couple of basic trends going on in this \ncountry. One is that we are moving pell-mell to decontrol. The genie is \nout of the bottle. There is no question about that. The last \nadministration certainly liberalized our control procedures. The \nChinese and others certainly took advantage of that. We are still \nmoving in that direction. Perhaps we should, to one extent or \nanother. But there is no question that using the word ``decontrolling'' \nwith regard to matters of high technology, with regard to matters of \ndual use, with regard to matters that have military significance, we \nare saying, ``What, me worry?'' and rapidly decontrolling. This would \nenhance that process and take it to another level.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am glad to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is there any doubt in the Senator's mind that over the \npast 8 years of the previous administration--is there any doubt in his \nmind that sensitive technology that affects American national security \nwas transferred to China, Iraq, and other nations?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. No, there is no doubt in my mind, Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So my further question is, If sensitive technology which \naffects American national security was transferred to China, to Iraq, \nand perhaps other countries, are we going in the right direction with \nthis legislation or are we going in the opposite direction of loosening \nthese controls, according to this legislation?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. There is no question that we are loosening. There is no \nquestion that it will inure to the benefit of the Chinese, who are well \nknown to be concentrating especially on high-technology matters, \nbuilding up their military, building up their missile capability--both \nICBMs and shorter range missiles.\n  I think the best witness on this, Representative Cox, has been quoted \na few times. The Cox Commission stated in July 1999:\n\n       The People's Republic of China was diverting U.S. \n     manufactured high-performance computers for unlawful military \n     operations. Specifically, it was using American-made \n     computers to design, model, test, and maintain advanced \n     nuclear weapons. The commission clearly stated that the \n     illegal diversion of high-performance computers for the \n     benefit of the People's Republic of China military is \n     facilitated by the lack of effective post-sale verifications \n     of the locations and purposes for which the computers are \n     being used. High-performance computer diversion for PRC \n     military use is also facilitated by the steady relaxation of \n     U.S. export controls over the sale of high-performance \n     computers. The committee added that U.S. origin high-\n     performance computers have been obtained by PRC organizations \n     involved in the research and development of missiles, \n     satellites, spacecraft, submarines and military aircraft, \n     just to name a few.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. If there is no doubt in the Senator's mind, and I think \nit has been clearly established in several cases--I think one was the \ncase of Loral where the Chinese missile technology was increased \nthrough the transfer of technology--I am curious, if it is a severe \nproblem, and obviously our relations with China have not improved \nrecently, to say the least, our sanctions efforts against Iraq have \nbeen eroded by the disappearance or dramatic reduction in the coalition \nthat imposed sanctions on Iraq, yet we are now trying to pass \nlegislation in very short order that reduces these controls that \ninhibit our ability to examine these systems and their export to these \ncountries.\n  Finally, could I ask the Senator, how much involvement have the \nsponsors of this legislation allowed the Senator from Tennessee and my \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, and Senator Shelby? Have they \ntried to involve you in negotiations, conversations, or amendments?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. We have had extensive conversations on this over the \npast, I guess, year and a half. My desire would be that--this has been \noff the table now for some time. Until yesterday, I did not know it was \ngoing to be brought back up. But now that it has been brought back up, \nit is back on the table, as we all knew it would be and should be, that \nwe would sit down again on some proposed amendments to see if we could \nagree on some. We might be able to.\n  As I say, I think they have improved the bill. It is all in the eye \nof the beholder. The thinking was it was a bill right where it ought to \nbe. The administration came along and made 20-some-odd suggestions. I \nunderstand they were adopted. Presumably, it is a better bill. Maybe it \ncan be even a better bill.\n\n[[Page S3946]]\n\n  Up until yesterday, the negotiations did not go the way I would have \nliked for them to go, frankly, but I cannot complain about not having \nbeen included in discussions. We have had a lot of discussions.\n  What I would like to do is address the question of the Senator, \nthough, a little bit more directly, the other question he asked. The \nquestion is: Why? I think the answer would be that for some of these \nitems, there is foreign availability. If they are out there and France \nor someone, or Russia, let's say, is supplying China with these items, \nwhy shouldn't we?\n  It raises a question--I did not plan on getting into the substance of \nthe debate as much today as we will later on--as to whether or not \nthere is a moral dimension to our foreign policy, whether or not there \nis a moral dimension to our export policy, whether or not, because some \nother entity is supplying somebody with something they should not have \nthat hurts our national security potentially--and these items I am \ntalking about, some of them, are serious threats to our national \nsecurity, as acknowledged in the bill, if it is mass marketed--whether \nor not, even if they would get them, we ought to be supplying them.\n  I would not feel any better to find American troops shot down with \ntechnology supplied by American companies if I knew there was mass \nmarketing of those products. In the last year, the PRC reportedly was \nillegally using American supercomputers to improve their nuclear \nprograms. Just 2 months ago, we learned that Chinese technicians were \ninstalling fiberoptic cable for Iraqi air defenses, a clear violation \nof U.N. sanctions.\n  Worse yet, this assistance and technology which were provided to \nChinese companies by American firms when President Clinton decontrolled \nthis equipment over the objections of NSA in 1994 aided Saddam Hussein \nin his quest to shoot down American and allied pilots.\n  I don't know if it proved whether or not this very strand of \nfiberoptic was used down there or not. But what apparently is pretty \nclear is that we took this Chinese company from a startup and, because \nof business that we did with it, put it in a position where they could \ngo down to Iraq and help Saddam Hussein better shoot down our pilots. \nThat merits serious consideration. It does not merit a day or a day and \na half of discussion in some kind of desire to balance what we are \ntalking about with our commercial interests.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask a final question--and I would like to state I \nagree with Senator Thompson. This is a very serious issue. It brings \ninto question the influence of big money and big business in American \npolitics. But would the legislation that we are discussing have \nfacilitated the ability of the Chinese to acquire that technology and \ntransfer it to Iraq or would it have been made more difficult?\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I have not thought it through. I think after it was \ndecontrolled in 1994, over the objections of the National Security \nAgency, the cat was out of the bag. I am not sure it would have made \nany difference.\n  I think the point is that what we are dealing with today would \nfurther decontrol a host of additional items that heretofore you had to \nhave a license to get.\n  Some of those--I would venture to say the large majority of those \nthings--would be harmless. But my concern is whether or not we have a \nprocedure to catch the ones that are not harmless. That is what we are \ntrying to deal with here. I hope we can move in that direction.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I am interested, given his remarks today, whether the \nSenator views President Bush's support for this legislation, support \nexpressed by our Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State, as \nreflecting an inadequate consideration of the implications relative to \nChina and inadequate consideration of the moral dimensions of our trade \npolicy in the United States and certainly an inadequate consideration \nof the national security fundamentals of our Nation. Does the Senator \nsuggest the Bush administration is in error in their support of this \nlegislation?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I would respond to the Senator that my concentration \nhas to do with my own obligation. I respect the members of this \nadministration who have taken a look at this in a few days, and with \nthe few people they have had take a look at it.\n  I respect their opinion. I weigh it very seriously. We are another \nbranch of Government. We have obligations also. The Senator from Texas \npoints out that the Banking Committee has a lot of jurisdiction. That \nis true. The chairman of the Intelligence Committee has a lot of \njurisdiction. The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee has a lot \nof jurisdiction. The chairman of the Armed Services Committee has a lot \nof jurisdiction. They are all concerned about this. I am concerned \nabout it.\n  I would like to always be in agreement with all of my friends. \nSometimes it is difficult to do.\n  I referred to the Cox Commission report. As I say, he has been quoted \nin regard to this piece of legislation. I am not sure where he stands \non this piece of legislation. I am sure he supports the Export \nAdministration Act reauthorization, as I do, but it has been said that \nthe bill addresses the major findings and recommendations of the Cox \nCommission report. Upon closer examination, many of the Cox \nCommission's conclusions are not addressed. For example, the Cox \nCommission recommended that the Government conduct a comprehensive \nreview of the national security implications of exporting high-\nperformance computers to the PRC. Yet S. 149 does away with that \nrequirement.\n  The Cox Commission also recommended reestablishing higher penalties \nfor violations, which was done, but the evidentiary standard was \nlowered and promotes the sale of high-performance computers to the PRC \nfor commercial but not military purposes provided the PRC establishes \nan open and transparent system to conduct on-site inspections of the \nend use of these machines.\n  This bill takes these recommendations in an opposite direction. We \nare going to have an opportunity to go through in detail the extent to \nwhich this comports with the recommendations of the Cox Commission.\n  The Rumsfeld Commission, of course, points out that one of the more \nserious concerns that we have had in Congress for some time is the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Even though it was \nsignificant to learn the extent to which some of these rogue nations \nhave the ability, or rapidly developing the ability to hit the United \nStates with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, and the fact that \nthey were getting a lot of their capability from China and Russia, I \nthink perhaps the most significant and troubling part was the fact that \nour intelligence was not aware of the extent of these things.\n  Intelligence is not perfect--nobody's intelligence and no country's \nintelligence. I think they do a good job on most occasions, but they \nwere behind the curve on this.\n  I simply reiterate that in matters of this importance it is not \nsomething we ought to take to the floor and discuss in general terms, \ntalk about balancing, and do in a day and a half. We need to be \nconcerned about what else is not going to be caught by this process. We \nneed to be concerned about the big picture, and we need to be concerned \nabout the little details that have to do with the interagency dispute \nresolution.\n  For example, as was pointed out, if someone disagrees with a \ndetermination as to whether or not an item ought to be controlled, it \ncan be escalated by a majority vote. But it can only be escalated by \nsomeone who has been appointed by the President and has been confirmed \nby the Senate.\n  Hopefully, we will have these Departments staffed. We have Defense, \nwe have Commerce, and we have several other Departments that have a \nplace in this. But they are grossly understaffed and will be for some \ntime.\n\n  Incidentally, the process has never been taken to the President of \nthe United States in the history of process, if you want to know about \nthe practical application of this thing. But it looks pretty good on \npaper, and maybe it can work.\n  Do we really want to have that escalation done only by someone \nappointed by the President? Shouldn't he be able\n\n[[Page S3947]]\n\nto delegate that somewhere for someone to handle that kind of paperwork \non the thousands of the items that are going to be coming to the floor? \nIs the intention to make it such a high level to escalate that there \nwill be much less escalation so that people who may have concerns and \nobjections will not bother under that kind of a system? I think we have \nseen that before.\n  We had extensive hearings before the Governmental Affairs Committee \nwith our inspector general, who looked at all of this. They came to the \nconclusion at that time that the Defense Department was under the \nimpression that there was inadequate input by the Defense Department.\n  Will this cure that? I do not know. It looks to me as if it is more \ndifficult under this regime to raise a question. They are supposed to \nbe included under the bill. Are they really going to have a practical \nvoice? Those are the kinds of things we need to look at.\n  Again, my objection to doing this now after having learned about the \nconsideration of it yesterday was not because I necessarily opposed the \nreauthorization of the Export Administration Act. I do not. The world \nis not going to come to an end if we don't consider this now. It has \nbeen in this condition for several years now. It can wait a little \nwhile longer until hopefully the dust settles down in terms of our \nrelationship with some of the people to whom we are going to be sending \nall of these additional items. Wait until the administration becomes a \nlittle better staffed so they can deal with these things.\n  I respect the administration and the people handling it. I respect my \ncolleagues who have pushed this because I think they have legitimate \ninterests in making sure we are not unnecessarily hurt in terms of our \neconomy.\n  But we have to make sure in the present environment--I read as well \nas anybody else about the tremendous interests out there that have been \nbrought to bear on getting this done, and we have to make sure we \nlisten to their legitimate points but that we don't lean too far too \nfast in that direction until we have thoroughly explored the \nalternatives. Hopefully, we will have some amendments that will improve \nupon this, and maybe we can even agree to some amendments.\n  But, again, we are on a motion to proceed right now. It has been \nobjected to. I agree with that objection for those reasons.\n  This is not the kind of issue we should consider in short order and \nin the limited amount of time that we have now, unless we can reach \nsome time agreement that I will agree to right now after consulting \nwith my colleagues who have other amendments in order to have a \nthorough debate on this issue. It is going to come.\n  We cannot and will not hold this up. I know which way the wind is \nblowing. I can guess probably what the outcome is going to be. But \nhopefully it will be done after a thorough and deliberate consideration \nin this Chamber of all of the ramifications and with a fair \nconsideration of some amendments.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The gentleman from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of all the Members \nwho preceded me. It has been a very nervous situation to have to sit \nthrough all the statements when I would like to have been contributing \nall along. Over 2 years of my life I have invested in extensive \nmeetings on this bill. I figured I could wait a little longer.\n  I support the motion to proceed. I unequivocally support the motion \nto proceed. I am sincerely disappointed that we didn't get the motion \nto proceed. I would be happy to agree to a time agreement. What we are \nfaced with right now is unlimited debate on whether we get to debate.\n  So I would like to have some kind of a time agreement, if we got \npassed this motion to proceed--which is unlimited debate on whether to \ndebate--then we have unlimited debate on unlimited amendments. So there \nis the capability of doing extensive debate on any amendment that \nanybody wants with no time limits on any of those amendments or debate \non the entire bill. So I would be just delighted if we could proceed \nand look at those amendments.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Tennessee's response about the \nextensive meetings that we had previously. I am sure he has noticed \nthat in this bill there are extensive changes that resulted from those \nmeetings. The most particular one is the Presidential set-aside, the \nPresidential set-aside that allows the President ultimate authority \nover every bit of national security, which is what the President should \nhave. We did allow that in every instance. We think it is \nconstitutional. We did not think it had to be in the bill, but it is in \nthe bill now. We think that change alone makes the biggest difference \nin national security in the history of the United States, but \nparticularly in the history of export administration.\n  We have some things in this bill that are absolutely crucial. We have \nsome things that need to be done for national security. I am not \ntalking about a balance. I am talking about basic national security, \nwhere everybody who looks at national security says we need this Export \nAdministration Act. We do not need a temporary extension of it. We \ndefinitely do not need to be operating under the President's Executive \norder, the IEEPA process, in order to have some control over our \nnational security. That is what has led to the national security \nproblems we have had since the act expired in 1994.\n  These problems we are talking about in relation to China--and I am \nglad we are having that discussion--you will recall we said, bring this \nbill up any time; we do not care what kind of international crisis \nthere has been with China; it is a good time to discuss national \nsecurity, no matter what the timing with China. We did not expect it to \nbe quite this timely, but we are willing to work with that because we \nwant to make sure this country's secrets are not taken.\n  Most of what has been referred to happened after the act expired in \n1994. When it expired in 1994, we were faced with an Executive Order \nand the President using some of his emergency powers. What is the big \ndifference with that? Penalties are the big difference with that. \nPenalties dropped down to $10,000 a violation. On the multimillion-\ndollar contracts we are talking about around the world, $10,000 is less \nthan a contingency. It is less than the cost of an ad in many cases.\n  Mr. President, $10,000 is not a penalty. It is not a deterrent.\n  Penalties are an important part of this act. The penalties expired in \n1994. We have them under a short extension of that old bill that lacks \na lot of the security we need, purely by an agreement that we would \nextend it until August 20 of this year. That means on August 20 of this \nyear we are back to the same old bind where companies can violate \nnational security for less than the cost of an ad. It should never \nhappen in our country.\n  When I became chairman of the International Trade and Finance \nSubcommittee, with Senator Johnson as the ranking member, and found out \nthat the main piece of business we had to face was this Export \nAdministration Act, we started digging into it. We have kind of lived \ntogether for a couple years, going to meetings, meeting with anybody we \npossibly could who had an interest in it, trying to find out how the \nprocess worked, looking at what had happened to it before. There were \n12 previous attempts to get this passed. How could something that is \nthis important to the country not make it through on 12 successive \nattempts? Well, I am getting a better and better idea every day. Part \nof the reason is that we are so security minded we would lock up all \nexports in exchange for security. But that will not provide security. \nSo we need a system that will work. Bringing everybody together on a \nmechanism that will work has been an interesting and difficult process.\n\n  I do thank my colleagues on the Banking Committee for their support \nand their recognition that this legislation is needed to strengthen our \nexport control system. I do appreciate the support of the \nadministration. President Bush and his team immediately realized that \nthe reauthorization of EAA was vital to the national security and the \neconomic interests of this country.\n  With the few changes that were made by the Banking Committee during \nmarkup, the bill received the written endorsement of President Bush's \nnational security team. That includes the Secretary of State, the \nSecretary of\n\n[[Page S3948]]\n\nDefense, and the National Security Adviser. Those are people who are in \nplace. I know they have had advice from people who have been working on \nthis issue for years.\n  On March 28, 2001, not very long ago, President Bush called the \ncommittee's action good news and urged the Senate to pass it quickly. \nYou have heard the longer versions of that earlier in this Chamber.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. May I put a question to the Senator from Wyoming?\n  Mr. ENZI. Certainly.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Given the support of this legislation by the Bush \nadministration, including the Department of Defense, the Secretary of \nState, the Secretary of Commerce, it has been noted in this Chamber \nthat somehow the Bush administration is not yet staffed up. Do you \nbelieve that the Bush administration would endorse legislation of this \nconsequence and of this importance if they felt that somehow their \ncounsel had been inadequate or had been short? Or do you believe that \nthe Bush administration felt very comfortable about its familiarity \nwith the details of this legislation in issuing its recommendation for \npassage?\n  Mr. ENZI. I am certain that the Bush administration has felt the \nimportance of getting the EAA reauthorized. They have been looking at \nthe documents that have been mentioned on the need for this for several \nyears.\n  I was very pleased during the campaign that President Bush addressed, \nas part of his campaign, this Export Administration Act. He had looked \nat a number of the principles. In fact, on his Web site he has listed \nwhat he thought ought to be included in the Export Administration Act. \nIt gave me a lot of confidence that he had looked at the Export \nAdministration Act that you and I worked on because it went point by \npoint on it. I was pleased with the diligence with which the \nadministration and their staff spoke to me and my staff. We were able \nto go through a lot of the points and a lot of the questions and a lot \nof the past discussions and a lot of the past meetings we had had with \nother Members to be sure to cover as completely as possible those items \nof national security.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. ENZI. I will. I was hoping to finish my statement.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am sorry.\n  Since my comment was referred to, I want the Senator to be aware, if \nhe is not, that my reference was meant to be with regard to staffing, \nnot with regard to making the recommendations that they have made. It \nwas with regard to carrying out the bill once it has been enacted. It \nhas to do with personnel, people appointed by the President and \nconfirmed. My concern is, these various departments, they have a \nskeleton crew of people that fit that description.\n  So my reference to a lack of staffing has to do with their ability to \neffectuate the appeals process, and what have you, once this is \nenacted.\n  Mr. ENZI. I am glad the Senator raised that point because we have \nexport security that is being executed at the moment. We do not need \nthis bill for export security to begin. It is happening right now. The \npeople who are in place right now are in charge of our national \nsecurity under export administration. They are having to deal with \ninadequate legislation to be able to do what needs to be done.\n  So while the staff isn't there, they are still having to comply with \nlicensing. I do not know how they are doing it except that there are \nstill many civil service employees who have been around, and will be \naround, and are dealing with these problems. But the problem goes on \nright now. It does not matter whether this bill is in place or whether \nwe are operating on the extension of the old one.\n  There are some definite improvements in this Export Administration \nAct that absolutely need to be in place to provide for our national \nsecurity. I hope that, first of all, we do not have to continue to \noperate under that old Export Act, regardless of who is in place, and, \nsecondly, that that old Export Act does not expire on August 20 without \na backup bill that does something extensive such as this bill does.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Gramm. \nHe has probably been more involved at a member level on this bill than \nperhaps any bill Banking has done. He has involved all of us in that \nprocess; at least whenever Senator Johnson and I have asked him to be \nat a meeting, he has been at the meeting. He has been willing to \nparticipate, learn the bill in tremendous detail, and work on it that \nway.\n  The same is true with Senator Sarbanes. There has never been a time \nSenator Johnson or I have invited him that he did not show up to help \nout in the process. He has been involved with this particular bill for \nabout 20 years and understands it to a higher level than most of the \npeople we have run into who have been involved. His comments have been \nextremely valuable, and a couple of times he has even reined in my \nenthusiasm a little bit, making very good points that needed to be \nincorporated. He has been one of the Senators who contributed very much \nby listening to the other side in the debates to make sure we got these \nprocesses included.\n  I have already mentioned Senator Johnson and his help on the \nsubcommittee. I don't know how many panels we served on, answering \nquestions about how this works and how it could work better. That has \nalways been our approach to the bill: How can we make it better? How \ncan we improve it so that it works?\n  This legislation is unfinished business left from the 106th Congress. \nThe activity Senator Johnson and I engaged in didn't happen this year. \nAs soon as we got chairmanships, we started working on the bill. That \nwas our prime emphasis for the 2 years of the last session. It took all \nof that time. It took all of that time to go through the process of \nunderstanding exactly how the bill works, reviewing previous failures, \nvisiting the Department of Commerce. Of course, the Cox report we have \nreferred to several times came out during this process.\n  One of the actions I took was to go over to the Intelligence \nCommittee and read the Cox report when it was still a secret document. \nI am always amazed that just by being elected a Senator, one gets a top \nsecurity clearance. I understand why that is and I am glad that it \nhappens. I understand we have had a pretty good review of our \nbackground by the time we get elected, whether we want it or not. I \nwent over and received a briefing and read the document. I wanted to be \nsure the ideas we were generating for solving the problem followed the \ndirection of the people who were really concentrated on the Export \nAdministration Act and the security of the country, particularly as it \nrelated to China.\n  I was convinced and am convinced that we did what can be done \nlegislatively. There are a lot of other processes that need to go on, \nparticularly in the executive branch, to deal with this, but that is \nnot legislation. We deal with the legislative part.\n  We also lived with people from the Departments of Defense, Commerce, \nand State for a long time. I have to thank Dr. Hamre and Secretary \nReinsch for their dedicated devotion to coming up with a solution. Both \nof them had worked intensively on this issue from their own positions \nin Defense and Commerce. Without their interaction and daily meetings \nand telephone calls, we would not have been able to get to the \nreasonable position that we have.\n  I was able to get some people on my staff for a very short time who \nhad dealt with license applications. We wanted to know what the person \nputting in the license had to go through. Then following that, because \nof the concern over enforcement and particularly the postshipment \nverification, I brought somebody into my office who was an enforcement \nofficer, somebody who had actually done some of these things on site, \nsomebody who knew how to calculate old penalties under IEEPA versus the \npenalties under EAA as we propose it. It was fascinating, absolutely \ncrucial to what we are doing.\n\n  Of course, this was reviewed and endorsed by the Clinton \nadministration. Now the Bush administration has taken a look at it, and \nit has been endorsed by them. We have many people from both sides of \nthe aisle who have been looking at this, working on it, and hoping that \nat some point, after extensive debate and amendment, it would come to a \nvote.\n  What we are debating today is whether or not we ought to proceed. We \ncould save a lot of time if we proceeded to offering amendments. All of \nthose\n\n[[Page S3949]]\n\namendments won't be debated on the floor. If there are some that deal \nwith a top secret security, those will be dealt with as we do with that \nkind of an amendment. If some of the discussion or parts of the \ndiscussion cannot be in the Chamber, it will be held in one of the \nrooms designed for that kind of discussion. We have done that before. \nIn fact, two of the hearings we held were done under those \ncircumstances so that the people in the intelligence community who \nneeded to communicate some of the problems they saw could get those \nproblems directly to us.\n  We invited every Member of the Senate, but we haven't had every \nMember of the Senate listen to it. Those of us who have attended, who \nhave worked on this bill, think we have incorporated the solutions that \nwere brought out in the hearings into this bill.\n  What happened on it last time? We ran out of time. It is pretty easy \nto run out of time on a bill, I am finding. This one is in trouble of \nrunning out of time. I am hoping, because we were able to bring up this \nversion at this point in time, that that will not be the case.\n  We need this bill. I emphasize, the reauthorization provides \nauthority to control exports for commercial or dual-use items. I need \nto mention that because we are not talking about munitions here. That \nis a separate process. That needs to be reviewed, too. In fact, one of \nthe suggestions we had was that the fines in this bill should not get \nout ahead of the fines in the munitions bill. This is way out ahead of \nthe fines in the munitions bill. It was our suggestion that maybe if we \ncut the fines back a little bit, that the munitions bill could be \nbrought up to this so that there were sufficient fines in that bill.\n  At any rate, we don't want the two confused. I don't want to talk \nabout that very much because that has been one of the difficulties with \nthis. It gets confused with munitions and satellites. These are the \ndual-use items. These are items that, yes, there could possibly be a \nmilitary application for them. If there is a military application that \nwould be detrimental to the security of this country, we have put in \nthe provision that the President of the United States can set aside any \nother permission, any other possibility of licensing, and protect that \nitem. We have included that national security aspect.\n  It does establish the modern effective framework recognizing items \navailable in foreign or mass markets that are not effectively \ncontrolled. It puts stronger controls over a few items, which should \nequal more effective controls. We are talking about building a higher \nfence around fewer items. I will talk about that, too.\n  I did have the fortunate opportunity to cochair and work with \nCongressman Cox on the study group to enhance multilateral export \ncontrols for U.S. national security. Together we released the study \ngroup's final report on Tuesday, April 24. That was this week. There is \na need beyond the export and included in the Export Administration Act \nto enhance multilateral controls. What we do as a country by ourselves, \nif it is being done everywhere else, isn't going to cut it. We need to \nhave everybody who has that item working with us to make sure it \ndoesn't get in the wrong hands.\n  That is what the report we released on Tuesday dealt with. Mr. Cox \nreferenced the fact that we need a commonsense export control policy. \nHe said that we should not make the mistake of confusing a more \nburdensome system with the more effective system. He went on to mention \nthat the current export control system has ``an instinct for the \ncapillary rather than the jugular.'' In other words, the current system \noften has the tendency to put the same focus and expend the same amount \nof energy on the more trivial items, as opposed to concentrating on the \ntruly dangerous items. That is what we are trying to do. That is what \nwe talk about in building higher fences around fewer things, but being \nable to control them. If we try to control absolutely everything and \nexpend an equal amount of effort on each item that the United States \nproduces, we don't stand a chance of keeping up. So this bill focuses \nand gets some concentration and handles the problem.\n  I do happen to agree with Mr. Cox that S. 149 is structured in a way \nthat will focus on the jugular, not the capillary. As everybody is \naware, Mr. Cox chaired the Select Committee on U.S. National Security \nand Military Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China. I \nmentioned that before. It investigated several export-control-related \nproblems concerning China and offered recommendations to improve our \nexport control systems. He noted during his testimony before the \nBanking Committee last year that:\n\n       We ought not to have export controls to pretend to make \n     ourselves safe as a country. We ought to have export controls \n     that work.\n\n  That is what S. 149 aims to do. It will make export controls work. It \nwill make export controls effective.\n  The bill would establish a strong, but flexible, export control \nframework that can adapt to our national security needs in today's \nglobalized and uncertain world. Recent events tell us that as \nsituations change, the administration should be provided with the \nflexibility it needs to adapt to that change. S. 149 does not lock the \nU.S. into a policy position toward any particular country or any \nparticular item. It sets the framework that the administration would \ncarry out. The Congress would then have the appropriate oversight \nresponsibilities.\n  The bill provides the President with authority to control items \nbeyond current law. Section 201(d) of the bill--and I have mentioned \nthis before--grants the President special control authorities for cases \ninvolving national security and international terrorism, as well as \ninternational commitments made by the United States. Section 201(c) \nallows controls to be imposed based on the end use or end user of an \nitem if it could contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I remind my colleagues that these two provisions could be used \nregardless of foreign availability or mass market status of the item.\n  Other national security items are also included in the bill. For \nexample, it requires that whenever items are to be taken off the list, \nthe Secretary of Defense concur with the decision. In addition, country \ntiering would be made by the President. He would be the one to \ndetermine where a country is assigned to a tier for each controlled \nitem or group of items. The President is to take into consideration \nseveral risk factors, including the present and potential relationship \nof the country to the U.S. and the country's weapons of mass \ndestruction capabilities and compliance with multilateral export \ncontrol regimes. In other words, if they are cooperating with us and \nour allies, they will be rated better. If they are a rogue state, they \nwill be rated terrible, and that can vary as we find out things about a \ncountry. There is no country referred to by name in this bill, and that \nis so that the President and the Congress have the total flexibility in \ndealing with any country as they become friends or as they become \nenemies.\n\n  Additionally, it will establish tough new criminal and civil \npenalties for export control violations much greater than are in the \ncurrent law. Those penalties were outdated and needed to be enhanced, \nand they have been enhanced dramatically. These penalties will deter \npotential violators, rather than be computed as part of doing business.\n  The bill establishes a program to increase compliance with the \nfreight-forwarding firms--the people shipping the items. This will in \nturn allow enforcement to detect and interdict possible illegal \nshipments. That is an improvement over the old system. It increases the \noverseas presence of enforcement agents who conduct prelicense and \npostshipment checks.\n  A very important part of the bill is its emphasis on multilateral \nexport controls--the report that we put out this last Tuesday. Many \ndramatic changes have occurred over the past decade that present \nadditional challenges to the effective control of sensitive technology. \nThe U.S. now is rarely the only producer of militarily useful high-tech \nproduct. The effects of globalization, such as increased flows of \ntrade, foreign investment, and international communications have \ncontributed to the more widespread production and availability of high-\ntech products. The threats are now different and more diffuse. \nTherefore, the bill urges the administration to strengthen the existing \nmultilateral export control regimes. Multilateral export controls are\n\n[[Page S3950]]\n\nthe most effective controls. The U.S. has to exercise its leadership in \nthis area now more than ever, and the bill provides a mechanism for \nencouraging and, in fact, forcing that.\n  Our position of world leadership in stemming the transfer of weapons \nof mass destruction is compromised by our failure to enact a more \npermanent national vehicle to authorize our export control program. \nPassage of S. 149 will reaffirm U.S. leadership in the area of export \ncontrols. U.S. leadership in this area has been lacking in large part \nbecause of Congress' failure to reform and reauthorize EAA. If we don't \nhave good controls in place, it is very difficult for us to talk to our \nallies and ask them to join us in these multilateral processes.\n  I look forward to the President signing this bill. It is essential \nthat the EAA be reauthorized and reformed this year before August 20. \nPassage of S. 149 will advance both our national security and our \neconomic objectives.\n  Is this the final answer? No. There is always going to be more work \nthat is needed to be done on national security. Times change. We have \nhad a drastic change in the times. The Iron Curtain came down. But this \nbill operates the same way. We always have to be working on it, but we \nhave to have something in place now. We ought to be proceeding to the \ndebate on this bill. We should be talking about those amendments that \nwere referred to earlier and debating them now. We should be proceeding \non the debate.\n  If we can proceed on the debate, we can reach a logical conclusion \nthat will solve the security problems of the United States, or at least \nbegin the process. I could answer some of the other things, and I \nshould answer some of the other things that were mentioned. Computers \nis one of the items that was brought up, and it was mentioned that we \nare taking out a provision that has been present for a decade. Well, \nthe way the computers operate now, as everybody in the country knows, \nhas changed dramatically. They are not the same mechanism they once \nwere. They are being linked in unusual ways to provide capabilities \nusing older machines or less capable machines than some of the brand \nnew machines.\n\n  Another discovery: I sat by a guy on the airplane and he was talking \nto me about supercomputers. I had to check out what he said. He said \nthe U.S. was no longer producing any supercomputers; that Japan is the \nonly country producing them. Do you know that he is right? We have some \nspecial linkages of computer chips that provide as much or more \ncapability than the supercomputer that Japan makes. But if you are \ntalking about a single computer, Japan makes the supercomputer; we \ndon't. That takes out some of the mechanism for measurement that we \nused to have. We need to have a knew measurement. That is recognized by \nthe Department of Defense and the Department of Commerce and the \nDepartment of State and the security agencies. So that is why we have \nmade some provisions to do something with computers.\n  Foreign availability: A lot of what was talked about isn't current \nlaw. The change in foreign availability is that we have a Presidential \nset-aside. We give the President authority to set aside in national \nsecurity instances. We change the word ``significant'' down to \n``detrimental'' so it would be easier. But we are talking about the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Who determines whether the President of the United States sets it \naside for a significant security reason or a detrimental security \nreason? Actually, the President of the United States determines that. \nSo whatever he says is detrimental or significant would be detrimental \nor significant. It is very easy for him to justify any of his actions.\n  We also call for multilateral controls when foreign availability is \nput in place so it is not just the United States saying what cannot be \ndone, it is all of the countries that produce that product saying it \ncannot be so. That is the only way to solve that problem.\n  I have to talk a little bit about the appeals process because there \nis some confusion on that. I suspect a lot of the reason we are not \ndebating this right now, why we are not proceeding to this legislation \nis that there is some confusion.\n  I have a little trouble with the suggestion that we are moving ahead \ntoo fast. We did it last year. We met extensively last year. We brought \nit up this year. We talked to all of the parties--all of the parties--\nwho were willing to sit down and talk again this year. We brought it to \ncommittee. We debated it in committee. We had amendments from the \nPresident's staff. Those were circulated, and the people who were \nopposing our motion to proceed had meetings with the President.\n  When we passed it out of committee, everybody had to suspect that at \nthe first possible moment we could bring up this bill, particularly in \nlight of the August 20 deadline, that we would bring it up for the \nsecurity of this Nation. We wanted to bring it up as soon as possible.\n  This is one of those gaps in legislative time that came up. We were \nasked: Do you want to bring it up now, particularly in light of what \nhas happened with China?\n  We said: We need to bring this up at any time we can, particularly in \nlight of what has happened with China, both now and in the past.\n  We are not afraid of any amendments. There are ways that a bill can \nalways be improved. That is why we have this legislative process in \nwhich 100 people participate. It is so everybody can have a say from \ntheir perspective. The group as a whole can determine whether that is \nsomething that needs to be a part of whatever legislation is being \nconsidered at that time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that, following my remarks, the summary of \nEAA discussions that me and my staff have had with different groups be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, under the present appeals system, for \nsomeone to appeal a decision on licensing at the committee level, they \nhave to talk to their boss and educate their boss enough about that \nparticular license so their boss can file the appeal. There has to be a \nlot of tension, particularly in the military, of someone having to \ndisturb somebody further up the line over a decision. Uniformly people \nagreed there was some difficulty with that.\n  We have provided for an appeal in the first round by the person \nsitting on that committee. He prepares the documents now. As it gets up \nto the decision level, then the decision has to be made by people who \nare in office.\n  Did China get our secrets? Yes, China got our secrets. Does this bill \nstop that? This bill stops it to the best ability I know, and it is \ncertainly better than doing it under an Executive order, an emergency \nprovision by the President.\n  This bill is needed. We should be debating it. We should be \nproceeding with whatever amendments are needed. The country desperately \nneeds this bill.\n  Again, I thank Senator Gramm, Senator Sarbanes, and particularly my \nranking member on the subcommittee, Senator Johnson, for all of the \nhours they have spent on this legislation. We are still willing to \nspend hours. We want to have a debate. We want to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 Summary of EAA Discussions, 1999-2000\n\n       Jan. 20, 1999, 10 a.m.--Subcommittee on International Trade \n     and Finance--Hearing on the Reauthorization of the Export \n     Administration Act.\n       Jan. 28, 1999, 3:30 p.m.--Enzi staff meets with Thompson \n     staff to discuss issues regarding reauthorization of EAA.\n       Feb. 8, 1999, 10 a.m.--Enzi staff meet with Gary Milhollin, \n     Wisconsin Nuclear Arms Control Project.\n       Feb. 8, 1999, 2 p.m.--Enzi staff meet with NSA staff.\n       Feb. 9, 1999, 10 a.m.--Enzi staff meet with Senate \n     Intelligence Committee staff member (Joan).\n       Mar. 16, 1999, 9:30 a.m.--Subcommittee on International \n     Trade and Finance--Hearing on the Reauthorization of the \n     Export Administration Act and Managing Security Risks for \n     High Tech Exports.\n       Mar. 18, 1999, 3 p.m.--Enzi staff meet with WMD Commission \n     staff.\n       April 14, 1999, 10 a.m.--Subcommittee on International \n     Trade and Finance--Hearing on the Export Control Process.\n       April 28, 1999, 1 p.m.--Enzi staff meet with Kyl staff.\n       June 7, 1999, 9 a.m.--Banking staff meet with Cox \n     Commission investigator.\n       June 10, 1999, 10 a.m.--Banking Committee Hearing on Export \n     Control Issues in the Cox Report.\n       June 17, 1999, 10 a.m.--Banking Committee Hearing on \n     Emerging Technology Issues and\n\n[[Page S3951]]\n\n     Reauthorization of the Export Administration Act.\n       June 22, 1999, 10:30 a.m.--Enzi meets with John Barker, \n     State Department.\n       June 23, 1999, 10 a.m.--Banking Committee Hearing on \n     Reauthorization of the Export Administration Act: Government \n     Agency Views.\n       June 24, 1999, 10 a.m.--Banking Committee Hearing on \n     Reauthorization of the Export Administration Act: Private \n     Sector Views.\n       June 28, 1999, 4 p.m.--Enzi staff meet with Mack staff.\n       July 29, 1999, 9:30 a.m.--Enzi staff meet with Kyl staff.\n       June--July/Sept. 1999--Numerous meetings with \n     Administration (BXA, State, Defense, intelligence), industry, \n     Senators and staff to discuss draft EAA.\n       Sept. 16, 1999, 9 a.m.--Banking Committee staff meet with \n     AIPAC staff.\n       Sept. 23, 1999, 10 a.m.--Banking Committee Votes 20-0 to \n     Approve Export Administration Act of 1999.\n       Sept. 27, 1999, 11 a.m.--Banking Committee meets with DoD \n     staff to discuss S. 1712 issues.\n       Oct. 6, 1999, 10 a.m.--Banking Committee meets with AIPAC \n     staff.\n       Oct. 10, 1999, 10 a.m.--Enzi meets with Cochran.

The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, what is the time arrangement? Is Senator Enzi \ncontrolling time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no control of time.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to support the Export \nAdministration Act of 2001. I support the effort to move this debate \nalong for all the reasons my distinguished colleagues have mentioned.\n  I am an original cosponsor of this bill. I have participated in a \nnumber of the hearings over the last 2 years, so I have some sense of \nthe thoughtfulness and the depth of the hearings, the testimony taken \nand the analysis given to this bill. I do want to make some brief \ncomments, but as I lead into those comments, I want to make a couple of \ngeneral observations.\n  First, Senator Enzi said a few minutes ago that the previous \nadministration supported this bill and the current administration \nsupports this bill. The current administration consists of Vice \nPresident Cheney, who has some practical and working knowledge of \nnational security as he served with great distinction in the House of \nRepresentatives, was the No. 2 Republican there for years, and he was \nour Secretary of Defense at a very critical time in the history of this \ncountry.\n  Secretary of State Powell supports this bill. Secretary of State \nPowell's entire life has been about national security as he served as \nNational Security Adviser to President Reagan, as he served as Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents Reagan and Bush; two \ntours in Vietnam, decorated. I do not think there is a question about \nwhether Secretary Powell or Vice President Cheney would risk national \nsecurity for the dynamics of any legislation, but yet they strongly \nsupport this bill.\n\n  Our current Secretary of Defense, Don Rumsfeld--we all recall that \nSecretary Rumsfeld is on his second tour of duty as Secretary of \nDefense. I ask the same question about Secretary Rumsfeld: Would he, in \nfact, be supporting a bill that would jeopardize the national security \ninterests of this country? I do not think so, nor do I think President \nClinton would have risked the national security interests of this \ncountry, nor do I believe President Bush would risk the national \nsecurity interests of this country.\n  So this talk about national security not being well thought through \nand not being advanced and prioritized, that somehow we are selling out \nto big business and commercial interests, with all due respect, that is \nnonsense. That is complete fabrication.\n  Senator Enzi talked a bit about the current law, the current rules, \nrestrictions, and regulations that we are dealing with today. Does it \nenhance our national security? Is it relevant to today's challenges? \nNo, it is not. This update, this new bill makes our export control \nregime relevant to the challenges of a very complicated new world.\n  America is faced with a very challenging dilemma. We live in an \nunpredictable and dangerous world. Part of our dilemma is a result of \nthe fact that America leads the world in products and technologies that \ncan be used for the best possible technologies, ends, and purposes and \nalso the worst technologies, ends, and purposes.\n  Again, there is no higher interest for America than our national \nsecurity interest. We all agree America's national security interest is \nits most fundamental interest, so let's not cloud this debate about \nthat.\n  While always putting our national security first, our responsibility \nand challenge is to develop a workable and relevant balance that allows \nAmerica's economic and trade interests to be protected as well. That is \nthe challenge. In fact, our economic and trade interests are very much \nintegral and part of our national security interest. They are not \nseparate. You do not deal with trade and economic interests in this \nvacuum and national security interest in this vacuum. It doesn't work \nthat way.\n  The Export Administration Act of 2001 is a very important piece of \nlegislation. It represents an effort to deal with this balance, to come \nto grips with the realities of this balance: How do we ensure we \ncontinue to sustain our economic growth and yet ensure, as best we can, \nthat Saddam Hussein and other dangerous tyrants on the world stage do \nnot gain access to our technologies that could aid in advancing their \nweapons programs, detrimental to our national security interests and \nthe national interests of the world.\n  We will begin to build a missile defense system in the near future \nbecause of the real and growing threat posed by infant ballistic \nmissile programs in other nations. The world's collective failure to \nprevent nuclear proliferation is a constant threat to civilization. We \nneed an export control regime that recognizes the real threats to this \nNation, to our allies, to all the world and, at the same time, \nrecognizes the utter futility of trying to control everything.\n  This bill is based on the premise we need to build a higher fence \naround a smaller number of items, just as Senator Enzi said a few \nminutes ago. In the 1970s, you could track high-performance computers \nworldwide because there were fewer of them, less sophisticated, less \npowerful, easy to do in a bipolar world--the Soviet Union and the \nUnited States. Today, computers with nearly unlimited power, far more \npowerful than anything we saw in the 1970s or the 1980s, with far more \ncapacity and capability, are available at Radio Shack. Are we going to \nshut down Radio Shack? Let's get real with a sense of economic sense in \nhow we deal with this.\n  Many components manufactured and sold in the United States are \nreproduced by foreign competitors with little lapse of time or effort. \nThe world is simply too integrated. Some may not like that, but it is a \nfact of life. Capabilities abroad advanced so far to put the old system \nin jeopardy are not working, and we are dealing now with an old system \nthat, in fact, is not effective. It is no longer relevant to today's \nglobal economy and national security interests and world threats.\n  Our exports must recognize the realities of today's worldwide \ninterconnections. The President of the United States, Secretaries of \nCommerce and Defense, our entire intelligence community, and our \nbusiness community can all work within this legislative structure to \nprovide a flexible export regime and continue to protect our national \nsecurity interests. This bill establishes a system which meets both our \nsecurity and commercial concerns.\n  Only a control regime that raises the fence on the most critical \ndual-use technologies makes any sense. Our dilemma on exporting \ntechnology can only be solved by making control of critical technology \na critical issue. Exporters and national security officials need \nclarity.\n\n  We should not treat exporters as unpatriotic or unconcerned about \nproliferation or our national security interests. I have heard in the \nSenate over the last year not so veiled charges to that point. I have \nheard in the Senate things such as the almighty dollar is most \nimportant for many of the corporations of America. My goodness, what \nare we saying?\n\n[[Page S3953]]\n\n  I come from the business world. I am a businessman personally \noffended by that kind of statement. I don't know one businessman--there \nmay be a businessman out there--I do not know one responsible corporate \ncitizen in this country who would say to me privately or publicly that \nthe interests of his or her company are more important than the \nnational security interests of this country. It isn't true. Be careful \nabout throwing around loose language, saying many of America's \ncompanies and corporations are more concerned about their bottom line \nthan the national security interests of this country. That is not \ncorrect.\n  This legislation provides a structure that will allow our exporters \nto be partners in the overall objective of helping to prevent weapons \ndevelopment by the world's most dangerous and irresponsible dictators. \nWe need to work more closely with our allies to continue to enhance \nmultilateral controls and reporting on the movement of sophisticated \ntechnologies.\n  America continues to provide the leadership and the negotiating \nprocess, as we have from the beginning, for more effective, \nmultilateral controls. This bill ensures continued U.S. participation \nin multilateral export control regimes that support U.S. national \nsecurity objectives. The United States will continue to exercise its \nleadership in export controls worldwide under this bill.\n  In conclusion, I acknowledge Chairman Gramm and Senators Enzi, \nSarbanes, and Johnson. These four have worked tirelessly, effectively, \nover the last 2 years to bring together a responsible, relevant piece \nof legislation of which we can be proud, and I am proud of being part \nof it. They have developed a commonsense and strong proposal for \nimproving the current system. I look forward to continuing to work with \nthem to get this legislation enacted so we can update America's \napproach to export controls for this hopeful new world where all 6 \nbillion people reside together. That is doable. Let's get on with the \nwork at hand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \ndocument I received from the White House and their Office of Management \nand Budget, a statement of administration policy expressing support for \nS. 149 and also clarifying that there is minimal pay-go consequence to \nthis legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n       The Administration supports S. 149, as reported by the \n     Senate Banking Committee. The bill provides authority for \n     controlling exports of dual-use goods and technologies. The \n     Administration believes that S. 149 would allow the United \n     States to successfully meet its national security and foreign \n     policy objectives without impairing the ability of U.S. \n     companies to compete effectively in the global marketplace. \n     As reported, S. 149 includes a number of changes that the \n     Administration sought to strengthen the President's national \n     security and foreign policy authorities to control dual-use \n     exports. The Administration will continue to work with \n     Congress to ensure that our national security needs are \n     incorporated into a rational export control system.\n\n\n                         pay-as-you-go scoring\n\n       S. 149 would affect receipts and direct spending; \n     therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) \n     requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) \n     of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimates is that the \n     PAYGO effect of this bill is minimal. Final scoring of this \n     legislation may deviate from this estimate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first, I express regret the Senate is being \nasked to take up this legislation at this time. As pointed out earlier, \nthe Export Administration Act, which this bill reauthorizes, with \nchanges, has not been reauthorized for over a decade. It is not as if \nthere is an emergency to do it this week. We have lived without a \nreauthorized bill for over 10 years.\n  What we have done is reauthorized it on a year-to-year basis from \ntime to time--most recently, last year. I believe it is in October that \nreauthorization runs out, so we have to take some action before that \ntime. I believe we should. I believe the Senate should act on this \nlegislation before that time. I suspect there will be some amendments \noffered. I suspect there will be a healthy debate.\n  But at the end of the day, in one form or another, the bill will pass \nand the Export Administration Act will be reauthorized as significantly \nmodified. President Bush, when campaigning, campaigned on that promise, \nand he has made good on that promise by supporting this legislation. I \nappreciate that effort on his behalf. But I think it would be wrong to \nsuggest that it was the administration that requested the bill be \nconsidered at this time.\n\n  The administration was asked by a group of Senators who have \nexpertise in national security matters to evaluate the bill that is \nbefore us. In less than a 2-week period that evaluation was complete, \nand it was done largely by people about whom Senator Thompson was \ntalking this morning, who are not new additions to this administration. \nMeeting this morning with Secretary Rumsfeld, we found that there are \nonly two confirmed positions in the Defense Department--Secretary \nRumsfeld and the No. 2 person in the Defense Department, Secretary \nWolfowitz: That is it. So it is not as if a new Bush team has evaluated \nthis legislation, has had the time to give it the kind of critical look \nI had hoped it would be able to do.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to continue making a point. The Senator has had \nquite a bit of time. I will note, however, I have heard the questions \nof my colleague. The question is the same: Essentially, as a good \nRepublican, why wouldn't you support the Republican administration with \nall its expertise on this? I guess part of my answer is if the Senator \nfrom South Dakota is willing to abide by the expertise and \nrecommendations of this administration on all matters from here on, I \nwould almost be persuaded to sit down and to pocket his votes on the \ntax cuts, education bill, all the defense matters that come before us, \nand everything else.\n  The fact is, reasonable people can differ. The Senator from South \nDakota can agree with the administration on some things and disagree \nwith them on others, just as people on this side of the aisle can do. \nSo it is no great argument to say if you belong to the party of the \nPresident, you have to walk in lockstep with the President or somehow \nthere is a suggestion that your position is tainted.\n  But let me go on with my point.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. If I might respond?\n  Mr. KYL. I will be happy to yield for a moment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I will be very brief. I appreciate the Senator's \nthoughtful remarks. I do not want to delay his proceeding with those.\n  The question is not whether the Senator supports the White House on \neach and every issue. The question simply is, Does the Senator support \nthe administration and Colin Powell and the defense establishment of \nthis administration on this specific issue?\n  The point the President has made is that he wished this legislation \nwould be brought up in a very timely, very expeditious manner. The \nquestion is not whether he supports the President--of either of our \nparties, all the time. Certainly we do not. The question is whether \nthere was a disagreement with the defense establishment of this \nadministration on this specific issue.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate the question being reasked by the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, and my answer is as I indicated and as I will continue to \ndemonstrate in my remarks. I think it would be a mistake for us to take \nthe position on either side that this is an all-or-nothing proposition. \nIt is not.\n  I respect, for example, the work of Senator Enzi from Wyoming, a \nmember of the Banking Committee, who has worked very hard on this \nissue, and in good faith, and his chairman, Senator Gramm. There is no \none in this body for whom I have greater respect than Senator Gramm, \nthe chairman of the committee. Because they are putting this \nlegislation forward at this time, and some other Senators disagree on \nnational security grounds as to whether it is exactly the right bill to \nbe passing at this time, I would think it absolutely appalling that \nanyone would question in any way their commitment to national security \nbecause that would simply be wrong.\n\n  By the same token, it would be wrong for anyone to question the \nsincerity or the knowledge of those who\n\n[[Page S3954]]\n\nmay oppose every jot and tittle of this legislation on the grounds that \nthey are somehow either not in synchronization with the administration, \nnot in favor of free trade, or somehow caught in cold war legislation, \nor something of that sort.\n  Anytime you get that kind of personal suggestion in a debate, it \nlowers the tone of the debate and is not productive to a rational and \nconstructive solution to the problem.\n  What is the problem? We need to reauthorize the law in a way that \nproperly melds both the trade and national security ramifications. \nThere are those in this body with a great deal of expertise in national \nsecurity matters who have come to the conclusion that the bill that \ncame out of the Banking Committee would in some respects be inimical to \nnational security and have asked for an opportunity, a greater \nopportunity, to try to work out some of the differences they have with \nthe sponsors of the bill.\n  These are not people without expertise. We are talking about \ncommittee chairmen of every committee in this body that has \njurisdiction over national security matters; specifically, Senator John \nWarner, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who I believe is \ngoing to be here within the hour to speak to the issue; Senator Shelby, \nwho is chairman of the Intelligence Committee on which I sit; Senator \nThompson, who chairs the Governmental Affairs Committee, the committee \nthat had the jurisdiction to look into Chinese espionage and other \nmatters; Senator McCain, chairman of the Commerce Committee and also a \nmember of the Armed Services Committee; and Senator Helms, chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. All of these Senators have extensive \nexperience in matters relating to our national security.\n  I have not added up the combined years of wisdom represented by them, \nbut it is not inconsiderable. They have all raised a red flag. None of \nthem has said they are opposed to reauthorization of an Export \nAdministration Act. All of them assume we are going to do this. But all \nwould like to do so in a way that accommodates both interests. These \nSenators simply are not of the view that we have had the opportunity to \ndo that yet.\n  I spoke to the issue of timing a moment ago. There is another reason \nI think it is unfortunate that the legislation is brought up right now. \nNot only is it not critical that it be done this week or even this \nmonth, I am fearful that having this kind of debate at this time could \nvery well send the wrong signal to China. China is very much in the \nnews today. It holds our reconnaissance aircraft. It improperly held \nAmerican crewmen for 11 days. Its pilot wrongly and accidentally \nendangered the lives of our crew members, in the process of which he \nlost his own life. China has been making extraordinarily belligerent \ncomments in recent months. It has continued to hold and has arrested \npeople, some of whom are U.S. citizens or relatives of U.S. citizens, \nwithout much explanation, and it has acted very negatively to the U.S. \nresponse to these actions.\n  This is all in the context of a buildup of military might across from \nTaiwan, accompanied by threats that if Taiwan does not negotiate its \nreturn as a province to mainland China, there is a possibility that \nChina would use force against Taiwan to achieve that reunification.\n\n  This is all quite troubling, and it is a circumstance that requires \ngreat care on the part of the United States. We want to live in peace \nwith China. We expect we are going to be able to do that for decades \nand decades. We would like very much to have good trading relationships \nwith China. But we also understand that there are some tensions in our \nrelationship.\n  Part of the reason for these tensions is, I suspect, misunderstanding \nbetween the leaders of our two countries--misunderstandings, frankly, \nbetween the peoples of our two countries. It is frequently said we just \ndo not understand the Chinese well enough and we do not deal with them \nvery well as a result. I suspect the converse is true as well. So there \nis a great deal of talk about sending messages. I think it is important \nfor us not to send the wrong messages.\n  I think in this regard the President was masterful in his handling of \nwhat was a serious crisis. A country was improperly holding U.S. \ncitizens. The President, in a very understated but very firm way, was \nable to effect the return of our people and I hope not send any \nnegative messages and in fact send some pretty positive messages, at \nleast designed to elicit cooperation from China.\n  He was very sensitive, in other words, to the notion of what kind of \nmessages were being sent. He sent another message when he decided to \nsell defensive arms to Taiwan--arms necessary for Taiwan's defense in \nthe face of an attack by the PRC. That has grated on the PRC. And they \nreacted publicly to it. But he was very candid and clear about \nobligations of the United States in this regard. Again, he sent the \nright message: We mean you no harm. Obviously, we want to avoid \nconflict.\n  The best way to do that is to ensure that Taiwan can defend itself \nbecause, obviously, we wouldn't want the PRC to be tempted to engage in \nany kind of belligerent activity toward Taiwan.\n  Messages that are sent are very important. My fear is that by acting \non this legislation at this time, whatever we end up doing, we are \ngoing to end up sending the wrong message. To the extent that this \ndebate boils down to a question of whether or not those who are in \nfavor of enhancing trade prevail over those who are involved in trying \nto preserve our national security--a very false dichotomy--but to the \nextent that is the way it is played--and it will be played that way by \nthe media--we send a very bad message to our friends in China. It is a \nmessage that trade trumps national security. That is wrong. It would be \nan incorrect interpretation. But that is a message that I guarantee you \nwill be in the headlines and in the papers to the extent that people \npay attention to this debate.\n  I am trying to bend over backwards not to characterize it that way. \nThe people who are sponsoring this bill are very interested in national \nsecurity, and they believe they have crafted a bill that meets national \nsecurity requirements, as does the administration.\n  There are others who very much believe in free trade and expanding \nour trade with China but who believe there are additional changes that \nneed to be effected in this legislation and that it can best be done \nbefore the bill is brought to the floor for the amendment process.\n  It will be a wrong message, but it will be, nonetheless, a message \nthat will be delivered, and I guarantee you that the longer this debate \ngoes on the more of us are going to be called by the talk shows. They \nare going to call, for example, the Senator from Wyoming and myself. \nThey are going to say: Will the two of you debate trade versus national \nsecurity? Both of us are going to say that we really do not want to \ndebate this issue in those terms because that is a false dichotomy. But \nthat is the way it is going to be interpreted. It would be the wrong \nmessage at this crucial time in our sensitive relations with China. \nChina represents only something like 1 percent of our trade and much \nless than that relates to dual technology.\n  In some sense, this whole question about what kind of export controls \nto put on dual technology items is much overblown. It is not nearly as \nimportant as a lot of people would have us believe. We are not talking \nabout an amount of trade that is going to affect the U.S. economy, or \neven any specific segment of our economy. We are talking about a very \nsmall number of items.\n  I happen to agree with the authors of the bill that there are many \nitems that can be decontrolled. That is the word we use. It is now \npossible because of the evolution in technology to take items that were \nat one time deemed to be sophisticated off the list because they are \nsimply no longer state of the art, and they are no longer all that \nuseful if applied to military weaponry.\n\n  That is one of the features of the bill that I think is good. I think \nwe all agree with that. But I also think it would be a big mistake to \nassume that just because the cold war is over there is no longer any \nconcern or shouldn't be any concern on our part and any justification \non national security grounds for controlling the exports of \ntechnologies which have dual uses; that is to say, both civilian uses \nand military\n\n[[Page S3955]]\n\nuses. It would be just as wrong to characterize the proponents of this \nlegislation as believing in that.\n  There is a middle ground. I think one of the problems with the \nlegislation that has not been adequately addressed is the fact that a \nnew regime has been introduced. The regime is that if these items are \nreadily available, either domestically or on the foreign market, then \nthey are no longer subject to the same kinds of stringent controls that \nthey were before. That something has a dual application to both \ncivilian use and military use, by definition virtually everything that \nwe are concerned about will, therefore, have applicability because it \nwill be available either in the United States or on the foreign market \nfor civilian uses, and, therefore, for military uses as well.\n  That is the definition of dual-use technology, and that is the \nconcern we have. The mere fact that something is available to be \npurchased in the United States or abroad for civilian purposes doesn't \nnecessarily mean we should forget about any kind of restrictions with \nrespect to its export, irrespective of whether its export might result \nin its use in military equipment that could be used against the United \nStates. It doesn't mean that at all.\n  Yet because of provisions of this bill, it is going to be very \ndifficult to regulate the export of items which one can argue are \navailable either in the United States or abroad.\n  Why is that argument so important?\n  When it comes to U.S. military equipment, we have always had superior \ntechnology, and while it is possible that a particular item might be \navailable in another country--I am just speaking hypothetically. But \nlet's say the French manufacture it, the Israelis manufacture it, and \nmaybe the Germans manufacture it as well as the United States. It \ndoesn't necessarily stand true that all of those items are equal and \nthat purchasers of those items are indiscriminate with respect to from \nwhom they buy it. If that were the case, it wouldn't much matter unless \nthe U.S. products were a whole lot cheaper. These other countries are \ngoing to be able to export their products, in any event.\n  The truth is that in most cases, even when U.S. products are more \nexpensive--in some cases much more expensive--they are the items that \nare sought because other countries understand that for various reasons \nthe U.S. product is superior. Some of these products have intelligence \ncomponents associated with them. They know that in certain cases other \ncountries have certain capabilities with respect to that equipment that \nmakes their use suspect. Not so with the United States. They know they \ncan buy these products from the United States and have no worry about \nbeing compromised through their use. They cannot be so sure with \nrespect to the very same item that they might buy from someone else.\n  Just because an item is available someplace else doesn't necessarily \nmean that it is comparable, or that the United States should allow our \nproduct to be exported even when we know that its use will be embedded \nin military equipment and it could be used against the United States in \nthe future.\n\n  That is part of the problem. While the legislation itself grants to \nthe President, and only the President, the ability to waive certain of \nthese requirements, even the President is limited. He can only do it \nthree times. He can only do it for 6 months at a time, and after 18 \nmonths even he can't control the item or require an export license for \nit.\n  There are some significant concerns that I think we have to be aware \nof before we just necessarily assume that because we are all for free \ntrade--and most of us are for free trade--therefore, we ought to adopt \nthis legislation.\n  The very fact that the President just this week announced the arms \nsales to Taiwan because of the threat that China poses to Taiwan should \ngive us some pause. China is the same country which bought fiberoptic-\ncable technology items from American companies and then was found to \nhave helped the Iraqis imbed those fiberoptic cables in Iraqi air \ndefenses causing the United States enough concern that in February the \nPresident ordered U.S. jets--and British jets accompanied ours--to \ncarry out airstrikes against those very same Iraqi air defense systems. \nIt was because of the upgrade through the installation of the \nfiberoptic cable provided and installed by China.\n  Fiberoptic cable is a dual-use item, and it is of considerable \nstrategic importance. Its export to China is permissible under Senate \nbill S. 149. Let there be no mistake, fiberoptic cable not only \nincreases the amount of data that can be transmitted, virtually \nexponentially, but it is also extraordinarily difficult to intercept \nsignals in fiberoptic cable as opposed to, for example, through \nmicrowave transmissions or through regular copper wire.\n  This is an item that is in clear use all over the United States. You \ncan buy it on the market. But when it is applied to certain kinds of \nmilitary uses, such as military equipment, it can become very dangerous \nto the United States. We have actually taken action against it for that \nvery reason.\n  Why should we liberalize its export to countries? If Iraq could have \ngotten that equipment and China could have gotten that equipment from \nanywhere else in the world, why didn't they? They buy it from the \nUnited States because we have the best products. If we deny that for \nmilitary use to countries in the world that we do not want to have it, \nthen they are going to have to accept an inferior product, one which \npresumably, at least, hopefully, we would be able to deal with much \nbetter than our own particular product.\n  Let me try to also put in perspective what all the bill relates to. \nThere are literally thousands of items on the list of dual-technology \nmaterials or services that could be, in effect, decontrolled through \nthis legislation. I certainly do not have time to go through all of \nthem. Let me give you some ideas of what some of these are. I have a \nvery lengthy report which, given the time, I will be happy to go \nthrough in some detail because I think it is most illustrative in \nrelation to those who believe there is not much of a problem. One of my \ncolleagues said that you can buy it all from Radio Shack. The truth is, \nyou cannot buy all this from Radio Shack. Yet it has enough \navailability to escape the requirements of an export license.\n  We talked about the Chinese company that helped Iraq outfit its air \ndefenses with fiberoptic equipment. This results in high-speed \nswitching and routing. That equipment is all provided by U.S. companies \nwhich, by the way, would like to sell some additional items, various \ncommunications technology, to the very same Chinese firm that provided \nthis technology to Iraq. Is that what we want to be doing? I am not so \nsure. I think we want to think about this very carefully.\n  We ought to have the ability to deny an export license for this kind \nof dual-use technology to a company such as the Chinese company that \nbought it in this case. Yet under this bill these technologies would be \ndetermined to have foreign availability because of their marketing \nabroad, and they would meet the mass market criteria in the bill. \nTherefore, unless the President himself exercised the authority that I \ntalked about, they would be eligible for export.\n  That is a very recent example. Let's go back to look at some other \nexamples. There were news stories at the time of ball-bearing grinders \npurchased from the United States. Since then, there have been quite a \nfew public reports, although much of it is classified. But the fact is, \nin the 1970s the Soviet Union purchased ball-bearing grinders from the \nUnited States ostensibly for its use in civil industry. It used them, \nin fact, to produce pin-sized bearings for use in the SS-18 guidance \nsystem.\n  The SS-18 is the most fearsome weapon on the Earth today--a nuclear-\ntipped intercontinental ballistic missile. These ball bearings are \ncrucial to produce the guidance system capable of ensuring the very \nhigh degree of accuracy which this missile possesses. Those are the \nmissiles that could incinerate every American living today. The \nguidance systems are perfected because of the ball bearings produced by \nequipment that the United States sent.\n\n  These precision machine tools and ball bearings are controlled by the \nCommerce Department under the authorities granted by the Export \nAdministration Act. But under the legislation pending here, these items \nwould be available to foreign sources. The bill prohibits export \ncontrols on them unless the President is able to set aside\n\n[[Page S3956]]\n\nthe determination. And he can only do that for 6 months at a time.\n  Submarines have to be quiet in order to be effective. The advantage \nof United States submarines is that they are the quietest submarines in \nthe world. The other side cannot detect them, and we can pretty much go \nwhere we want to at will.\n  The dual-use technology control list contains numerous technologies \nthat can be used to make submarines quieter. This technology is, to \nsome extent, available from foreign suppliers. Its export should be \nregulated to prevent nations such as China from freely purchasing it \nfrom American companies.\n  While foreign submarine manufacturers such as Russia and Sweden have \nmade great strides in submarine technology, we think U.S. technology is \nsuperior, and it is unique to U.S. submarines, and, if nothing else, \nits export could compromise the vital capability of U.S. submarines.\n  There are those in Government who also like to talk about something a \nlot more mundane. I am choosing examples almost at random, but this \ncaught my eye: a variety of devices that can be used to torture \nprisoners.\n  We are now talking human rights, folks. These devices that can be \nused to torture prisoners--some of which are as mundane as electric \nprods and shock batons and shackles, and so on--are controlled for \nexport due to human rights considerations. You can get these on the \nopen market. If you are a bad guy, and you go shopping for them, you \ncan find them somewhere in the world.\n  Should the United States be selling them to countries that we know \nengage in human rights abuses? That is the kind of consideration that \ndistinguishes America from many of the rest of the nations of the \nworld. We just do not sell equipment and items to other countries that \nwe know will be used to hurt people improperly, even though that \nequipment can be obtained from other places.\n  It is perhaps a small point, but I think it makes a big difference. \nEven if people can buy something from someplace else, it is not \nnecessarily a good idea for the United States to be selling it, again, \npartially because of the signals that we send.\n  I may, if I have a little time later, also discuss in greater detail \nabout technology that relates to the production of nuclear weapons, \nnuclear reactors, tritium plants, fissile material, liquid and solid \npropellant rocket engines, chemical and biological processing \nequipment, encryption software, flow-forming machines for a variety of \nproduction applications. All of these are items that are on the dual-\nuse control list.\n  I am going to talk a bit about maraging steel and gas centrifuges in \njust a moment. But suffice it to say, on this list there is page after \npage after page of items that have dual uses; that is to say, perfectly \npermissible civilian uses and also very sophisticated and, in some \ncases, very dangerous military uses.\n\n  The question is, just because you can buy them for civilian purposes, \nshould the United States be allowing the export of these items, without \nsome control, to nations of the world that we believe would or could \nuse them against us?\n  In some cases, we use the export control regime for the purpose of \nnot prohibiting the export but providing some conditions on it or \nlimiting it in some way. Part of the ability to calibrate what we allow \nto be exported is lost as a result of the specifics of this \nlegislation.\n  I am sure my colleagues would agree with me--those who are supporting \nthis legislation--that in some cases we may want to ultimately grant \nthe export license but to have certain conditions on them.\n  One of the conditions we have had in the past, for example, has to do \nwith who the end user is. There are some fairly well-known cases of \nsituations in which we thought that the end user was a civilian entity, \nand it turned out not to be the case. I have in mind two cases. One of \nthe cases is where McDonnell Douglas--a very prominent company; a \ncompany that was formerly in my State, as a matter of fact--thought it \nwas selling machine tools for the manufacture of civilian aircraft, and \nit turned out it went to China for the production of military aircraft.\n  We also had some very sophisticated computers that we did not want to \ngo to a military end user in China. It went, I think, to a research \ninstitute. But it ended up in the wrong hands. My recollection is, in \nthat case, because of some limitations we had put on the export \nlicense, we were able to pull it back.\n  There are cases where if you have some ability to regulate the \nspecifics of how the license is granted, you can actually prevent items \nfrom falling into the wrong hands.\n  I haven't talked about computers yet. We know that high-performance \ncomputers are one of the main areas of contention here because the \nevolution of the technology is so rapid now that something that was \nreally leading edge a year or 18 months ago is relatively passe today, \novertaken by much more high speed and capable computers. U.S. computer \ntechnology exceeds that of all foreign competitors, yet our \nmanufacturers argue for more and more liberal ability to export, to the \npoint that the Clinton administration, for all practical purposes, \neliminated controls on high-performance computers without any \ncompelling evidence that reasonably comparable foreign systems were \nseriously sought by foreign customers.\n  That brings up another question. There isn't any real definition in \nthis bill of what we mean by ``availability.'' It is a very subjective \nterm. One wonders why or how it is that we are going to judge something \nto be available. If the market that they really want to buy from is the \nU.S. market, then maybe the availability of a so-called comparable \nforeign product isn't as great as we might think it to be. That is an \nelement that needs a further look.\n  There is a very interesting example that was pointed out by Gary \nMilhollin of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. He noted \nthat high-precision electronic switches needed to detonate nuclear \nweapons would be decontrolled under the act because of their civil \napplication in medical instruments. I believe this device is used in \nthe lithotripters, the equipment now that can actually blast apart gall \nstones so you don't have to painfully extract them from an individual. \nThey are blasted apart and taken out like little bits of sand. The \nelectronics of that are the very same electronics that are used in the \nnuclear detonation components of weapons.\n  Similarly, he points out that glass and carbon fibers are used in \nballistic and cruise missile construction as well as in the enrichment \nof uranium for nuclear weapons and that they could be decontrolled \nbecause of their use in the manufacture of skis and tennis rackets and \nboats and golf clubs. We have heard recent reports in the news about \nthe possibility that different countries--Iraq comes to mind--might be \nbuying some of these items off the shelf in fairly huge quantities. \nEveryone asks: Why would they be buying so many of those? The \nspeculation is, of course, that it just might be because they want to \napply them to one of their military uses.\n  I mentioned maraging steel before. This is a very special kind of \nsteel that is used in the manufacture of solid rocket motor cases, \npropellant tanks, and interstages for missiles as well as in the \nenrichment of uranium. It would be decontrolled because its application \nin commercial rocketry and also the fact that in many forums it is \navailable in other countries. There are many other items.\n  I will summarize a couple: Corrosion resistant valves used in the \nenrichment of uranium for nuclear weapons; they are also used in the \ncommercial paper, energy, and cryogenic industries. This is a list of \npretty deadly serious military applications of items that nonetheless \nwould be decontrolled under this legislation because of their \napplicability to civilian uses as well.\n  I talked in the beginning about a concern I had that this legislation \nis being debated at the wrong time. I hope I am not, by articulating \nthis list of items--and again, we can talk about a lot more--leaving \nthe impression that there is no role for the approach of this \nlegislation to get rid of a lot of items on the list that have both \ncivilian and military applications. The legislation moves in the right \ndirection because there are a lot of items that\n\n[[Page S3957]]\n\ndon't need to have this kind of regulation. There are some that do. The \nquestion is, have we discriminated properly in drawing the dividing \nline between those that do and those that do not?\n\n  There is another provision of this bill that has to do with another \nway we can judge whether or not something would be automatically exempt \nfrom the export control regime. It has to do with how much value an \nembedded component has. On the surface, you would say, what difference \nshould that make? If you have a very highly classified component and it \nrepresents only, let's say, 10 percent of the cost of an item, simply \nbecause it is only 10 percent of the cost of the overall item, should \nthat mean that the entire item is decontrolled and another country has \nthe ability, then, to reverse engineer the entire component so that it \ncan take out the part that is highly classified?\n  That is what this legislation allows. It says that if only a certain \npercentage of the value is in this very highly controlled component, \nyou can go ahead and sell it. There is sort of a presumption that it \ncan't be all that big a deal if it is only a small percentage of \nvalue--10 or 25 percent. A case that I don't think is included in this \nlegislation, because of action that the Congress took last year to take \nit out of the Commerce Department and put it back with the State \nDepartment, but which obviously we had to act on or it would have been, \nis the case of rocket motors. I shouldn't say rocket motors, rather, \nthe so-called kick motors that are in many cases embedded in \nsatellites. These are very highly classified items. We take a satellite \nthat we want to launch, and when it is kicked into its final orbit by \nthis little motor, it can actually perform the way we want it to \nperform.\n  In the case of China, for example, the Chinese have made it a \ncondition for some companies doing business in China that those \ncompanies allow China to launch a certain percentage of the satellites \nthat they want to launch. So those companies, in order to do business \nin China, have to agree to that, and they have. These satellites are \nsupposed to be under the control of Americans at all times because they \nare very sophisticated. We don't want them to fall into the wrong hands \nand to be reverse engineered. We don't want our technology to be stolen \nfrom them. That certainly applies to an item such as the kick motor \nembedded in the satellite.\n  We recall that a couple years ago there was a great deal of evidence \nof the fact that certain American companies had allowed satellite \nlaunches in China without adequate security, the result of which was \nthat we believe there was some compromise of American technology by the \nChinese. It is not only the kick motors. There are other components, \ntoo. Had Congress not acted last year to retrieve those satellite items \nfrom the Commerce Department and put them back on what was called the \nmunitions list, where the State Department would have the authority to \nrequire license, we wouldn't have had the same degree of control over \nthem that we do today. This is the kind of thing that can happen.\n  Again, the timing is wrong here because we are forced to talk about \nsituations involving China over and over and over again. I don't \nparticularly care to do that. This is a time when it would be nice if \nwe could kind of lower the rhetoric and try to develop a relationship \nwith China which very clearly states our goals and tries to deal with \nChina in a way that doesn't result in more belligerency on their part.\n\n  By the authors of the legislation being insistent on bringing it up \nnow, some of us have no choice but to use examples that are, \nunfortunately, very real examples of where we believe that sensitive \ntechnology has been either sold to or acquired by China in ways that \nthis legislation would not prevent. I wish we didn't need to talk about \nthat at this time, but since they are very real examples, we will talk \nabout them. Again, I hope the message isn't misunderstood. This is not \nabout either having trade or national security. The authors of this \nlegislation agree with me and I with them that we can do both. We have \nto do both. We will do both. But this will be portrayed as trade \ntrumping national security. That would be a mistake.\n  With the indulgence of my colleagues, I will continue now to discuss \nsome of this other technology that I mentioned would be impacted by \nthis legislation. I talked before about maraging steel. Here are some \nof the countries where this product is of particular interest. This, \nagain, is the high-alloy steel that has very high yield strength. \nPakistan has used it for uranium enrichment centrifuges; India for its \npolar satellite launch vehicle; Russia and Iran, special alloys for \nmissiles.\n  I talked before about the bearings and gas centrifuge. There are \nmilitary applications for high uranium production, and there is some \nevidence that China has sold this technology to Pakistan for the \nproduction of nuclear weapons in Pakistan. The centrifugal isotope \nseparation plant, equipment and components, the military applications: \nRussia's uranium isotope separation plant has played a significant role \nin warhead production. The plant is primarily a centrifuge enrichment \nfacility, and it has produced about 40 percent of the Soviet Union's \nenrichment uranium. I talked about explosive detonators earlier.\n  Aluminum alloys is another very interesting case. This is obviously \nvery useful in rocket technology and missile technology for casings. \nChina has developed a welded aluminum alloy used in the design of the \ntorpedo hull. It manufactures aluminum alloy casings. India is \nmanufacturing heavy-duty aluminum alloy extruded composition and has \nconducted studies on this that are very significant relating to its \nsatellite launch vehicle.\n  All of these are items that would be impacted by this legislation. \nThe ceramic composite materials are a new and increasingly important \nkind of material because they don't conduct electricity. Therefore, \nthey have some very unique military applications. They have been used \nin ballistic missiles and reentry vehicle antenna windows, for example. \nThey are produced, by the way, by companies in France, Germany, India, \nJapan, Russia, as well as the United States.\n  Laminates: Again, missile parts are often made from these other kinds \nof materials. Composite structures and laminates are materials used in \nrocket systems, including ballistic missiles and space vehicles, and \nthey are produced in a whole variety of countries, including the United \nStates.\n  There are military applications to something called crucibles. These \nare used to melt and reduce and cast uranium and plutonium for nuclear \nexplosive devices. I realize when I read these, people may say: Wait a \nminute; we are not talking about just putting these things on the open \nmarket. What I am saying, folks, is they would be items that are no \nlonger controlled under the dual technology control regime under the \nold Export Administration Act, which everybody would like to see \nreauthorized, with some changes. Because of the liberalization under \nthis act, these items, in effect, become decontrolled.\n  In the early 1990s, for example, the U.S. was licensed to sell a \nsignificant volume of this equipment for making crucibles for high-\nperformance furnace systems. It found its way to Iraq and to Iraq's \nnuclear missile and chemical weapons program, and for its nuclear \nweapons design and research center. This particular item at that time, \nbecause of a law that existed, was stopped by Presidential order. That \nwould not be possible today if this legislation were to pass.\n  Guidance sets for missiles--you might think this is pretty technical \nstuff that we should not be selling on the open market. But there are \nitems here that have dual uses. So ballistic missile guidance sets are \noften built to fit into a particular missile to be used in a hostile \nenvironment, and it would perform with a high degree of accuracy. It \ncould have both civilian and military uses. They are produced in a \nwhole variety of countries, in addition to the U.S.\n  There are services as well as products--and I will not go into all of \nthese. We are not just talking about the military applications of \nspecific pieces of equipment. We are also talking about certain kinds \nof services showing people how to do certain kinds of things.\n  We talked about propulsion systems and components. Here are some of \nthe military applications of that. On one occasion, they were disguised \nas automotive spare parts on the airwaves of a\n\n[[Page S3958]]\n\ncertain country and were destined for Libya. This was very recently, by \nthe way. Some of the paperwork indicated that the seized shipments had \nalready reached Libya, I might add.\n  The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, which was \nsanctioned by the U.S. in August of 1993 for missile proliferation \nactivities, designed and researched propulsion systems, among other \nthings. Russia aided Iran with the design of guidance and propulsion \nsystems, some of which found their way into the Shahab 3 and Shahab 4 \nballistic missiles for Iran. There are a variety of examples that I can \ngive you.\n  Reentry vehicles--we are familiar with those--for both commercial and \nmilitary applications. These, too, would be subject to the provisions \nof this legislation.\n\n  And I hate to talk about China again, and I wish we didn't have this \ndebate right now. Chinese engineers were arrested for trying to steal \nsome blueprints from a plant in the Ukraine. Yet these very items would \nbe subject to sale because they are produced by a variety of countries \nand have dual applications.\n  Without getting into a lot of detail, I will indicate the nature of \nsome of these other activities or products. Propellant additives, \npropellant control systems, propellant production equipment, radar \nsoftware--you can easily understand why that could be a dual item--\nradiation-hardened computers. The applications here for military use \nare obvious.\n  Ramjet engines: The military applications there, I think, are fairly \nobvious; rocket motor mounts and sounding rockets as well. These all \nhave to do with space, and also aircraft, such as airborne radar, \nnavigational systems, depleted uranium, fly-by-wire flight control. \nObviously, that is the way our commercial aircraft is now designed. It \nis also a very important military design. We have various kinds of \nnoise reduction and acoustic mounts and valves and other kinds of \nthings that are used in quieting for the Navy, primarily.\n  Precision tracking systems: We are all familiar with how we are able \nboth in civilian and military applications to precisely track using the \nglobal system. Yet many of those items would also be covered by this \nlegislation and no longer require license: side-looking airborne radar, \nsonar signal processing equipment, underwater breathing apparatus, wind \ntunnel applications.\n  Mr. ENZI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, is the Senator aware that we are not doing \naway with the control list and any item on the list continues to stay \non the list unless it goes through the process? Is the Senator aware \nthat we have added country tiering so that rogue states are taken care \nof that way?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. Is China defined as a rogue state in the legislation?\n  Mr. ENZI. It could be.\n  Mr. KYL. But it is not.\n  Mr. ENZI. It doesn't say any particular state.\n  Mr. KYL. I answer the Senator that I am aware that the items are not \nautomatically decontrolled. But by virtue of what I talked about \nbefore--and I think the Senator was here--because of availability for \ncommercial purposes, the items will also be available under the dual \ntechnology regime that is contemplated by the legislation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, the legislation specifically \ngives the President the authority to continue to control any item. I \ndon't think the items the Senator is listing would be mass market items \nunder this legislation. But even if one or a few were to be sold \nclassified, the President has the authority under this legislation to \ndeny that category and to continue to control the item.\n  Mr. KYL. First of all----\n  Mr. SARBANES. I don't understand.\n  Mr. KYL. Does my colleague want an answer to his question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. There are examples that happened under the previous \nregime. This bill will actually improve the regime.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator has mischaracterized what I said. I pointed out \na couple of instances in which these items got into the wrong hands in \nthe past. But under the previous law, we had the ability to pull them \nback. I did cite some examples. We would not have that authority under \nthe legislation as the Senator has written it. Moreover, I am perfectly \naware that many of these items would not necessarily be mass marketed. \nYet every one of them would be subject to the definition of \navailability, foreign availability, or U.S. availability.\n  That is precisely why I picked these items because under any \nreasonable definition, you would have to say, yes, those are available \nsomeplace. Now, if the Senator is telling me some of those look serious \nand I don't think we would want to consider them available, then I say \nwe have to be more careful about how we draft this legislation.\n  On that point I agree with the Senator, but as to the first point, \nthe Senator raised the suggestion--I heard it made several times: The \nPresident has the authority to waive this. No, the President does not \nhave the authority to waive this. The authority is very constricted. \nThe President, and only the President--as if he did not have anything \nelse to do--can three times for 6 months only, for a total of 18 \nmonths, waive the applicability of that section.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is not right.\n  Mr. KYL. That is absolutely correct, and I would be happy to cite the \nprovision of the legislation. To think it is going to work very well--\n--\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator do that for us?\n  Mr. KYL. To think it would work very well to have a regime in place \nwhere the President is going to have to continually be waiving its \nrequirements I think is going at it the wrong way.\n  Therefore, while it is important for any President to have a waiver \ncomponent--we frequently have national security waivers of one kind or \nanother--if you set up the presumption that it is going to be sold and \nrequire only the President to stop it, you are going to be putting a \npretty big burden on him.\n  In the past, the presumption has been effectively the other way. Part \nof this is due to the fact that there is no really clear way of \ndefining availability. I talked to that before the Senator arrived.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Wyoming may wish to join in this. If \nso, that is perfectly fine with me. I stand corrected. The \nauthorization for this current extension of the EAA runs through a date \nin August--August 31?\n  Mr. ENZI. August 20.\n  Mr. KYL. Not October. We will either have to pass a resolution \nextending the date beyond that, which I presume would be relatively \neasy to do, or act on the reauthorization of the EAA in some form prior \nto that time.\n  Frankly, that is fine with me. As I have said now several times, the \neffort of the Banking Committee to rewrite this legislation in light of \nchanged circumstances in the last decade is a laudable effort, and \nthere are a lot of changes that need to be made in the legislation. \nThere is no argument about that. That, frankly, is what President Bush \ncampaigned on and what he said he was for. That is perfectly \nappropriate.\n  We are talking about details. It is evident that reasonable people--\nor at least I hope the chairmen of these committees would be deemed to \nbe reasonable; certainly my friends in this administration are \nextraordinarily competent on these matters. I believe with a little bit \nof time reasonable people will be able to resolve whatever differences \nexist. I know some are not quite that sanguine about those prospects.\n  I also am aware of the fact that the administration has an idea which \nis a good one. That is, not everything in this regard ought to be put \nin the legislation itself, which can become relatively inflexible. As \nwe have seen, it is a little bit harder to change than an \nadministrative action. Therefore, the administration has in mind \ndeveloping an Executive order that would implement this legislation and \nrelated legislation in such a way as to provide the President with a \nlittle more flexibility to handle particularly those situations that \narise very quickly.\n\n  The shelf life of some of the equipment we are talking about is very \nshort, and therefore sometimes there may be a need to act with \nalacrity. Under the provisions of the bill, it may be too slow, though \nthey intend to speed it up.\n  There are also intelligence considerations which I cannot go into at \nthis\n\n[[Page S3959]]\n\npoint, but they, too, can be dealt with by means of an Executive order.\n  I applaud those members of the administration who raised this as a \npossible way of dealing with some of these issues. The fact is they \nhave not had time to do this, and I fully appreciate that. Those of us \nwho have concerns about the legislation would very much appreciate the \nopportunity to await the drafting of that order. As I said, I suspect \nthat will remove many of the concerns some of us have just about the \nbill itself.\n  That said, I go back to the point I made in the beginning, which is, \nthis is the wrong time to bring up this legislation.\n  I also, again with some trepidation, make the following point: Some \nof my colleagues have said: Look, bringing it up now actually helps you \nbecause you are able to talk about a situation that has rubbed the \nAmerican public pretty raw these days, and that is a belligerent and \noverly hostile China. In fact, China has obtained a lot of its \ntechnology in the past, not all of it properly so, as pointed out \nbefore. So actually this is a good time to bring this up because you \nwill be at your strongest in arguing we should not be passing this \nlegislation right now when it could only make it easier for China to \nobtain this equipment.\n  At the same time, some of these folks say: Look, this legislation is \nactually tighter; it is more strict; it is more conservative than ever \nin the past. We are actually tightening the law; we are enhancing \nnational security. Mr. President, you cannot have it both ways. It is \nmy view the legislation is not tight enough, that it could result in \ntechnological acquisition by countries that would use that technology \nagainst the United States and that we do not want to do that; there are \nways to prevent that.\n  Our argument is over some relatively narrow points. If we appreciate \nthat, then we can also appreciate that it is possible to come together \non those, come to closure on those without necessarily engaging in a \ngreat long public debate which I really do not think serves anybody's \npurpose at this point in time, especially given the circumstances that \nexist with respect to our current relationship with China.\n\n  My hope is the authors of the legislation on this Thursday afternoon \nwill say, all right, let's talk about this for a little bit, get a date \ncertain to bring up the legislation, and see what additional fixes are \nneeded, if necessary, and get additional amendments that might be \noffered so we can persuade colleagues, if there are certain changes to \nmake, we can do that and take it up at a time when perhaps nerves are \nnot quite as raw.\n  Frankly, I fully expect the administration to engage at that point in \ntime because they have a great deal of expertise and they are all \npeople whom I know people on this side of the aisle respect a great \ndeal. So we will be taking their views very much into consideration.\n  That is my hope. I hope our leadership will focus on elements of this \nPresident's agenda of which everybody on our side of the aisle is very \nmuch in favor, including this tax cut and education proposals.\n  By virtue of the fact I had to be on the floor, I missed discussion \nof the tax proposals that I very much hoped to attend because we are \ntrying to put together the final package that will effectuate President \nBush's campaign promise of tax relief for all Americans. I hope we can \ntake that up next week. If not, we will take up education reforms next \nweek and take the tax bill up the week after that.\n  If we are stuck debating the Export Administration Act, all of that \ngets delayed. That is not good for the American people. My hope is the \nauthors of the legislation will be willing to work with us and defer \nthis until we take care of these other items that are a little bit more \nimportant, in my view, and then come back to this with plenty of time \nto do it prior to the time the authorization expires. If need be, we \ncan clearly do a temporary resolution extending the time of the EAA \nuntil we are able to act upon it later this year.\n  With that, I relinquish the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I need to answer some of the items that have \nbeen raised. I appreciate the Senator correcting the date on which the \npresent extension of the EAA runs out. I know that confusion came from \nme. I am involved in another bill with a sunset at a later date, and I \nmentioned the wrong date. August 20 is the drop-dead date on the Export \nAdministration Act.\n  Can we extend it again? It was extended last time under a unanimous \nconsent agreement in both Houses. That won't necessarily happen again. \nUnanimous consent is not the easiest thing to get. We were running out \nof time under appropriations last time and believed that was an \nappropriate action to take. However, it is not necessarily the same \naction that will be taken again.\n  We are running out of time to solve the export administration \nproblem. Education will be coming to the floor. I am on the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee. We did the education bill. It \nactually went through committee faster than any other ESEA bill of \nwhich I am aware. Normally it takes a couple of weeks for debate. It \nwent through the committee in 2 days. Normally the bills come out of \nthat committee along party lines. It came out unanimously. There are \nstill details on which to work.\n  I think we will have an Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nreauthorized shortly. I would not want to stand in its way. However, it \nis not ready or we would be debating that now. There are still details \nbeing worked out.\n  That leaves a window. It was mentioned that taxes need to be debated. \nI am one of the proponents of the tax cut and have been working \nsteadily to get that and would not stand in the way of a tax cut. \nHowever, the tax cut isn't ready for floor debate. It will be.\n  Education will be ready. Taxes will be ready. And then something else \nextremely important to this country--appropriations will come out. We \nhave to pass 13 appropriations bills. That is supposed to be over by \nOctober 1, but that usually takes us well into October, sometimes into \nNovember. That is past October 20, without an opportunity to do this \nextensive debate that is purported to be needed.\n  One of the things we have done is killed 4 hours--not really \n``killed'' because everybody needed to make their statement and get \ntheir stance out on the Export Administration Act. I am glad we have \ndone that. From this point forward, the time we are taking is time we \ncould actually be debating these amendments.\n  I have had some Members on the other side say, we know what will \nhappen to those amendments. That is how education works around here. If \nyou don't have the majority of the vote, you lose on your amendment. \nThere is a point to which people see amendments as being reasonable and \nhelping national security, but there is a point where they see it as \nstopping all trade.\n  There is a balance. We still intend to be a country that has a good \neconomy--not just a country that is militarily capable of being the \nbest in the world. This bill has been a deliberate and timely attempt \nto reach that kind of situation.\n  What we need is the amendment suggestions through the debate process. \nI submitted the list earlier. It is in the Record. You can look at all \nthe meetings we have had--probably not all of them, but the ones we \nrecorded as having. Those produced the suggestions in this bill.\n\n  Now a perfect bill will prevent any law from being in place. There \nisn't such a thing as a perfect bill. When I was legislating on the \nState level, as well as here, I had a pretty good idea when I was \nholding hearings on a bill that there was somebody in the audience who \nknew a loophole to that bill and they were not about to share it until \nthey had taken advantage of it. However, we hope to catch as many of \nthose as possible when it is being considered. That is why we have 100 \npeople, we have 100 different opinions--at least 100 different opinions \nfrom 100 different perspectives contributing to a bill.\n  When we debate whether we go ahead and debate, we are not making any \nprogress toward a final solution.\n  On the China issue, there probably isn't a time that could be more \nsensitive. But the ones who are talking about greater security than \nwhat this\n\n[[Page S3960]]\n\nbill provides would have it to their advantage to talk about it because \nof the timing of the situation with China.\n  We don't have any problem debating it. We don't have any problem \nconsidering amendments to this bill, even in light of the China \nsituation. The reason we don't is that we are sure we have addressed \nthose issues. If we missed something, we need to know about it and take \naction.\n  Everybody keeps saying there are a very small number of items that \nneed to be regulated. How do we go about doing that? Give me a \nsuggestion if you have one other than the way we are doing it.\n  There was a comment that there is a new regime, that we are talking \nabout things readily available in either foreign or mass markets; that \nthese other countries have access to all of those things and we will \ngive up all of our control. Not true. We have tried to address keeping \ncontrol in every possible way. There still will be a control list. We \ndidn't get rid of the control list. The wording in the bill says any \nitem that is controlled now will continue to be controlled until the \ncommittee makes a decision otherwise. So if it is controlled now--and a \nbunch of the items mentioned were controlled and were against the law, \nbut they were done anyway.\n  How did somebody get away with that? I imagine things will still be \ndone illegally no matter what kind of bill we pass because we don't \nhandle ethics and morals; we just handle the law.\n  One of the problems we have under the law is, for about a 6-year \nperiod we did not have sufficient findings to get anybody's attention \nof the fines and penalties and prevention, more so than beating \nsomebody up after it happens--although that has to be there for the bad \nactors.\n\n  We have a number in this bill that will get people's attention. For \nthose people who are talking about this bill not having enough \nsecurity, the last version, the one we could have done at the end of \nlast year, had penalties that were twice as big, but we were asked to \nreduce those to get them more reasonable, to make it closer to what the \nmunitions list has. If anything ought to have fines and penalties to \nget the attention of people, it ought to be the munitions list. We \nwould not agree to go to that low a level.\n  In fact, there is even jail time involved in this one. I think some \nof the those things are needed to keep people's attention. So we have \ntightened up the bill.\n  We talked a little bit about Iraq. We have to trust that the \nadministration will rate Iraq as one of those countries that should get \na very poor rating under the tier system--the worst. I suspect they \nwill. I will not dictate which ones ought to be the bad guys and which \nones ought to be the good guys. I have been contacted by a number of \ncountries that wanted to be specifically mentioned in the bill as one \nof the good guys. I said: No, the administration makes that decision \nbased on your relationship with the United States and your involvement \nin making and selling weapons of mass destruction. We have some \ncriteria by which you are considered a good country. I have no doubt \nthe administration will adequately do that rating on those countries.\n  That is something brand new, too. We did not have the tier system \nbefore. Now we have a tier system so countries that are adverse \ncountries will not get items. We have a control list so that items we \ndo not want people to get they cannot get. So some countries are going \nto be prohibited both for being on the control list and being a country \nto which we will not sell that kind of item. I do not know how you \ncould make it tighter than that.\n  Then--and this was at the suggestion of the people who are asking we \nnot be allowed to go ahead and debate this motion--that the President \nbe able to have total control over absolutely any item that can be \nsold. This is a Presidential enhanced control. Yes, it says the \nPresident has to do it. We know the President will get a suggestion \nfrom somebody along with all the backup reasoning on why it ought to \nhappen. Some of those decisions will be pretty pro forma. I do not \nthink we are talking about a huge expenditure of time on the \nPresident's part. On those items that are really a national security \nissue, I hope the President is personally and timely involved.\n  But the President can control absolutely everything. How much \ndocumentation, how much review does he have to do? That is for a little \ntransparency, so we know what is being controlled. But the President is \nthe ultimate authority on all of it. We have given him that \nconstitutional right. We have now put it in writing.\n  We also have some extra control authority, which are on page 183 of \nthis little document that is on every single desk for the end use and \nend user controls. And then the most important paragraph, the enhanced \ncontrols. So if somebody has a suggestion on how to make it tighter \nthan that and still be able to sell to our allies the things that we \nwant our allies to have that would be beneficial to them and to us, \ntell me how to do that; present an amendment.\n  Of course, we cannot present an amendment until we get past this \ndebate about how long we are going to debate about whether we get to \ndebate.\n\n  I have been here before on this bill. I have to say it is a lot \neasier to defeat a bill than it is to pass a bill--I noticed that \nthrough my legislative career, as well as my senatorial career--because \nif you create a little confusion, confusion goes a long way.\n  We have heard a lot of confusion. I think we can address everything \nthat has been mentioned to this point. We can show where it has been \ncovered in the bill. But it is easier to defeat a bill. I have to say \nin the Senate it is even easier than that because we have this thing \ncalled filibuster and that is where you stop the motion to proceed and \nhave people debate on whether to debate for a long period of time.\n  I understand the other side understands how many people there are who \nhave been working on this bill, been involved in this bill, who will \nvote for this bill. If we file cloture, we will get cloture. It is just \na long process and a way of delaying it. But it is a route that can be \ntaken.\n  We had the signatures for that last year but ran out of time. I only \nmention this time again to get back to the original point, which is \nAugust 20 is when the bill runs out. If we have not solved it by that \ntime, we may not be able to solve it. So I ask that we get past this \nmotion to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reluctantly I rise to differ with my good \nfriend from Wyoming. I come from the perspective of chairing the \nReadiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I have \nlooked carefully at some of the problems over the last 8 years in a \ncouple of respects. First of all, we are dramatically and grossly \nunderfunded in most of our accounts for our military relative to the \nthreat that is out there. We have gone through a difficult time with \nChina and hopefully it is coming to an end now. If we go back to 1995 \nwhen we started getting some of the very first comments made by the \nChinese that have been very threatening to the United States, it was \nduring the elections not long ago in Taiwan when the Chinese were \ndemonstrating their missiles in the Taiwan Strait and the statement was \nmade ``we are not concerned about the United States coming to the aid \nof Taipei because they would rather defend Los Angeles.'' That is at \nleast an indirect threat.\n  Most recently there have been statements made from more than one high \nChinese official saying war with America is inevitable. Over the last 8 \nyears, we found that half of our nuclear secrets--we had a total of \n16--were compromised during the Clinton administration, 8 of them were \ncompromised prior to the Clinton administration. We found out in 1999 \nthat way back in 1995 the other 8 nuclear compromises took place. There \nwas an informant who came in, in 1995, and informed us these \ncompromises had taken place. This was covered up, I am sorry to say, by \nthe administration until the Cox report discovered it and released it \nin 1999, 4 years later.\n  We look at those things that have taken place, the transfer of \ntechnology to the Chinese, and we now see a massive military buildup by \nthe Chinese. This is the same country that is saying war with America \nis inevitable. We know they made some purchases of SU27s and SU30s. \nThey will have aircraft that is better and more modern\n\n[[Page S3961]]\n\nair-to-air aircraft than anything we have in our arsenal, including the \nF-15. We are looking at a percentage of their budget that is going now \nto buildups. We also know they have virtually all--at least those 16--\nof our nuclear secrets.\n\n  We have been facing also, during the Clinton administration, the \nsigning of waivers. In order to make it easier to transfer technology, \nthey took the waiver process out of the State Department and put it \ninto the Commerce Department, only to reverse that later on when we \nfound out that many of the transfers had taken place.\n  We remember regretfully the time President Clinton signed a waiver to \nallow the transfer of guidance technology that was produced by the \nLoral Corporation. That is something that would be very dangerous for \nthe other side to have.\n  Considering what little we do have left in terms of technology, I \ncannot imagine a worse time in our Nation's history to be making it \neasier to transfer technology from a pure national security standpoint \nthan right now. So I am hoping my colleagues will look at what has \nhappened over the last 8 years, look at what has happened over the last \n2 weeks, and come to the conclusion that maybe this is a good idea for \nsometime in the future. It is not a good idea for this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we have had considerable discussion \nabout the President's authority under this proposed legislation. The \npoint has been made that we have a fail-safe provision--that the \nPresident can always intervene and stop some item from being exported \nthat should not be exported. But I think if you examine the \nlegislation, you would have to conclude that through this legislation \nthe drafters have made it difficult for the President to intervene and \nstep in under those circumstances even in matters that constitute a \nthreat to the national security.\n  If you look at section 212, which gives the President the right to \nset aside the foreign availability status--as you recall, under this \nlegislation, something that heretofore has been controlled required a \nlicense. If there is a determination made by the Commerce Secretary \nthat it is a matter of foreign availability under the criterion that \nthey come up with, it will be decontrolled. They will be able to send \nit to China, Russia, or any of the other what have been tier III \ncountries in times past. But there is a provision in here that the \nPresident can step in and exercise a set-aside.\n  Here is what the set-aside language says. It says if the President \ndetermines that decontrolling or failing to control an item constitutes \na threat to the national security of the United States, and export \ncontrols an item which advances the national security interests of the \nUnited States--I will skip some of what I don't think are particularly \npertinent provisions--it says the President may set aside the \nSecretary's determination of foreign availability.\n  Then it goes on to say that the President may not delegate the \nauthority provided in this paragraph.\n  In the first place, we make it so that the President and only the \nPresident must deal with this matter, considering all the matters that \nhe has to deal with, especially as I would again point out while he is \ntrying to build his administration and while he is trying to get his \npeople in place.\n\n  Then the act goes on to say that the President shall promptly, if the \nPresident chooses to use their nondelegation authority, notify the \nCongress. He shall promptly report any set-aside determination as \ndescribed along with any specific reasons for the determination to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the \nCommittee on International Relations in the House.\n  In other words, if the President chooses to intervene for reasons of \na threat to national security, he must justify that to the Banking \nCommittee and to the Committee on International Relations in the House. \nThen he must publish the determination in the Federal Registry.\n  That is not all the President has to do. Then the President has to \nengage in negotiations with foreign powers. It says in any case in \nwhich the export controls are maintained on an item because the \nPresident has made a determination under subsection (a), the President \nshall actively pursue negotiations with the governments of appropriate \nforeign countries for the purpose of eliminating such availability.\n  It may be a desirable thing. It might have been a desirable thing to \nnegotiate with foreign countries even before somebody wanted to export \nsomething under this act to get them to try to do the right thing. But \ndo we want to require the President to enter into negotiations with \nforeign countries? I assume we can do that under the separation of \npowers doctrine, if we choose to do so. But it is a rather significant \nstep--all, again, under the rubric of the conditions that the President \nmust comply with if he is going to step in and exercise this authority \nthat we say he has to stop something from being sent abroad that \nconstitutes a threat to the national security of this country.\n  That is not all the President has to do. It says he then has to \nreport to Congress. Not later than the date the President begins \nnegotiations, the President shall notify in writing the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Development of the Senate and the Committee \non International Relations in the House of Representatives that the \nPresident has begun such negotiations, and why the President believes \nit is important to the national security that the export controls on \nthe items involved be maintained.\n  Again, the President is required not only to enter into negotiations \nbut to justify to the Senate Banking Committee and to the International \nRelations House Committee as to why he thinks this is important. But \nthat is not all that we impose on the President if he wants to \nintercede on behalf of national security because of a threat to the \nNation.\n  There is a periodic review of determination provision. It says the \nfollowing:\n\n       The President shall review a determination described in \n     subsection (a) at least every six months.\n\n  Here he has made this determination that this item constitutes a \nthreat to the national security, and now he must review it every 6 \nmonths. Promptly after each review is completed, the Secretary shall \nsubmit to the committees of Congress a report on the results of the \nreview together with the status of international negotiations to \neliminate the foreign availability of the item.\n  Again, the President has to make the review every 6 months. Then the \nSecretary has to go back to the committee and give them a report about \nthe review, and then the status of negotiations. The President, through \nhis representative, has to give the committee a status of these \nnegotiations that have been imposed on the President.\n\n  But that is not all we require the President to do in order to \nintervene on behalf of national security.\n  There is an expiration of Presidential set-aside time. It says the \ndetermination by the President described in subsection et cetera shall \ncease to apply with respect to an item on the earlier date--that is 6 \nmonths after the date on which the determination has been made--or if \nthe President has not commenced international negotiations to eliminate \nthe foreign availability of the item within that 6-month period; B, the \ndate on which the negotiations described in paragraph 1 have terminated \nwithout achieving an agreement to eliminate foreign availability; C, \nthe date on which the President determined that there is not a high \nprobability of eliminating foreign availability on the item through \nnegotiation; or D, the data is 18 months after the date on which the \ndetermination described in subsection et cetera is made if the \nPresident has been unable to achieve an agreement to eliminate foreign \navailability within that 18-month period.\n  In other words, after setting up all of these obligations on the \nPresident, in\n\n[[Page S3962]]\n\norder for him to intervene on behalf of national security because of a \ndirect threat to this country, the determination that has been made \nwill go away and the thing can still be shipped unless he complies with \nthe provisions I just read--if at the outside it is an 18-month time \nperiod, unless he can report back that they have concluded their \nnegotiations successfully.\n  So then it says:\n\n       Action On Expiration Of Presidential Set-Aside.\n       Upon the expiration of a Presidential set-aside under \n     paragraph (3) with respect to an item, the Secretary shall \n     not require a license or other authorization to export the \n     item.\n\n  Then we get to the final point. If the President, after going through \nthis process, has not followed each of these items in any way, then the \nitem is still shipped even though he originally made a determination \nthat it constituted a threat to national security.\n  My point is this. I do not particularly object to any particular \nprovision. I have not thought about it enough, quite frankly. I did not \nrealize yesterday we were going to be having this debate in this much \ndetail. But my point is this. Clearly, we are making it kind of tough \non the President to intervene on behalf of national security, even when \nthere is a threat to the national security of the United States.\n  He is going to look at this--and somebody on his behalf, hopefully, \nwill look at it beforehand--and look at the onerous requirements, \nincluding entering into negotiations with foreign countries, reporting \nrequirements time after time to congressional committees and \ncertifications, in effect, as to what they are doing, giving up-to-date \nreports on how negotiations are going.\n  The President has to make the determination himself because under the \nact you cannot delegate. He has to do it himself. This is a burden on \nthe President. While it is true that the President, under some \ncircumstances, can intervene on behalf of national security, it is not \nan easy path for the President to take. That has to do with regard to \nmatters of foreign availability status.\n  There is another section--I am not going to put you through the \nentire section 213, but there is another section called the \n``Presidential Set-Aside Of Mass-Market Status Determination.'' So even \nthough there is a determination that an item is mass marketed in this \ncountry:\n\n       If the President determines that--\n\n  And I am reading from the provision--\n\n     decontrolling or failing to control an item constitutes a \n     serious threat to the national security of the United States, \n     and\n     export controls on the item would advance the national \n     security interests of the United States, or [et cetera]\n     the President may set aside the Secretary's determination of \n     mass-market status with respect to the item.\n\n  Why it requires a threat to national security under the foreign \navailability set-aside, and a serious threat to the national security \nfor the mass-market status determination, I do not know. But there is \nthat distinction.\n  So here, even more than was applicable in the preceding discussion we \nhad, it focuses our attention on a matter where the President of the \nUnited States could make a determination that something is a serious \nthreat to the national security and still ``[i]n any case in which \nexport controls are maintained on an item . . . the President shall \npromptly report the determination.''\n  He must give reasons for the determination to the committees that I \njust mentioned and ``shall publish notice of the determinations in the \nFederal Register not later than 30 days after the Secretary publishes \nnotice of the Secretary's determination that an item has mass-market \nstatus.''\n  The President shall review a determination made under subsection (a) \nat least every 6 months.\n\n  Here is a President who has made a determination that something is a \nserious threat to the national security of our country, and we, as a \nCongress, require him to review that because we want to make sure the \nPresident did not make a mistake and say something was a serious \nnational security threat when it was not, presumably. He is required to \nreview it every 6 months. I quote:\n\n       Promptly after each review is completed, the Secretary \n     shall submit a report on the results of the review to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, Urban Affairs of the Senate \n     and the Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n  So, again, my point is not that there is anything intrinsically wrong \nwith any particular part of what I just read. It is that clearly this \nlegislation is designed to make things more easily subject to export. \nIt is clearly designed to decontrol even to the point where we give the \nPresident authority to step in. We are setting up several steps for the \nPresident to go through over a period of time before he can do that.\n  So I want to make sure anyone who might be listening to this \nunderstands that, yes, the President can step in under some \ncircumstances with regard to certain determinations but that he cannot \nsnap his fingers, and he cannot pick up the phone, he cannot write out \na memo; he has to go through a procedure that is a long-drawn-out \nprocedure involving several steps if he wants to do that.\n  One of the things we are going to have to ask ourselves when we deal \nwith this in a little bit more detail is whether or not, in matters \ninvolving a serious threat to this country, it is so important for us \nto lower the export standards that we are not willing to give the \nPresident a little more leeway, that maybe even if he justifies it to \nCongress and we do not agree with him, are we not willing to give the \nPresident perhaps a little more leeway in making a determination that \nunder the words of the statute is a serious threat to our national \nsecurity?\n  That is a serious question. That is one question that we are going to \nhave to answer. That gets back to why we are in this Chamber today. We \nare still on a motion to proceed today. That is why we do not believe \nit is appropriate to notify us 24 hours in advance, and to try to push \nfor a resolution of this matter in such a short timeframe, when \namendments have not been fully drafted, when the Executive order that \nthe administration is working on has not been drafted.\n  These are serious matters, serious questions. I may be overly \nconcerned about what I just talked about. I am not sure. I have not had \na chance to really digest it. All I know is that it is not enough to \nsay that the President can step in and, lickety-split, there is no \nproblem; he has taken care of the problem. It is not that simple at \nall.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator from Tennessee yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. KYL. Apart from the steps the President has to take if he is \ngoing to obtain this national security waiver, so that the item would \nbe controlled, how long does that order last? And isn't there a \nlimitation so that he can only issue that three times, for 6 months at \na time, after which the President no longer has any control? In other \nwords, the longest period of time he can control an item is 18 months. \nAnd after that, even the President has no authority.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That gets back to the provisions in subsection (3) (A) \n(B) (C) and (D) on pages 200 and 201 in the document I think we are all \nlooking at. It talks about the expiration of the Presidential set-\naside. It says: ``A determination by the President described in \nsubsection (a)(1)(A)(i) or (ii) shall cease to apply with respect to an \nitem. . . .'' and it sets up conditions under which it ceases to apply \nwith respect to the earlier of several dates. The Senator is right, \nthere is an 18-month maximum period.\n  If some of these things happen earlier than 18 months, it would cease \nto apply then, as I understand it.\n  Mr. ENZI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. ENZI. I am beginning to see the problem. We have ignored page 183 \nwhich is the section that, when we went through those extensive \nnegotiations, we added that supersedes all of these 18-month, 6-month \nparagraphs about which we have been talking. Those are options. But \nundoubtedly the option the President would take would be the one on \npage 183, which allows the President to override anything in section \n204, which are provisions that deal with components we have heard about \nearlier, and 211, which is the foreign availability and mass market \nstatus determination. This is a much easier section for him to use.\n\n[[Page S3963]]\n\n  It does mention significant threat, but the President gets to \ndetermine significant threat. Nobody has the right anywhere in this \nbill to override whatever the President thinks. There is a reporting \nrequirement, but that is all it is. He reports to the committees that \nhave some jurisdiction on foreign availability and mass marketing. It \ndoesn't say that the committee can challenge anything he says.\n  There is no recourse for the Congress other than knowing that he did \nit, and we asked for the transparency through the process. That \nparagraph overrides, at your request, the sections on foreign \navailability and mass marketing. I was hoping that had taken care of \nthe problem and was of the understanding that that did eliminate the \nproblem.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. This is very good, if I may respond. We did indeed talk \nabout this. I was interested to see whether or not it was your view \nthat this provision you just described did in effect override what I \njust read. If so--and I ask the Senator if he will agree with me--are \nthese pages I have been discussing with regard to criteria for \nPresidential set-aside under 212--does that not make those requirements \nunder 212 superfluous or irrelevant, and in what case would 212 apply \nwhen the enhanced controls provision would not apply?\n  Mr. ENZI. We had the language in section 212 in the versions when we \nwere discussing it before. The President could use that. It is a \nmechanism. We thought that that provided Presidential control, even \nbefore we had our discussions. But we were specifically asked for \nsections 204 and 211, that we do something that was more overriding and \nmore comprehensive, and we did.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. But 212 is not discretionary. The language of 212, and \nin certain important respects, requires the President to do certain \nthings--the President shall actively pursue negotiations, et cetera. So \nif the language remains there, it is mandatory language, and it seems \nthere might be some inconsistency there. I am wondering whether or not \none of the things we might talk about is maybe paring this thing down a \nlittle bit in terms of some of this language in that it does appear--if \nmy friend agrees that the enhanced control provisions are overriding. \nIt does appear that this language would be superfluous and, if it \nremains, would be contradictory. I am wondering if perhaps that would \nbe the basis of some discussion.\n  Mr. ENZI. It wasn't our intent to make it contradictory, but it was \nlanguage that was already in there. The request was to override those \nsections, and we did that by putting in another one. Perhaps there \ncould be a way to address this.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. With all due respect, I suggest there is more to it \nthan that. It is not a matter of shortening it or making it more \ndifficult. We have one provision here that says the President can \nintervene and override, in effect, if he goes through several steps, \nincluding negotiating with foreign countries. Then we have another \nprovision--although the standard is a little bit different--that lets \nhim do the same thing without going through all those steps.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. The criteria you mentioned of foreign availability is \ncurrent law. That is what the President is forced to do at the moment.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am not saying I necessarily object to any portion of \nthis. I am saying there is an inconsistency here.\n  Mr. ENZI. We were trying to get the administration, whatever \nadministration it was, to work more on multilateral controls because \neverybody agrees that multilateral controls have more impact than \nunilateral controls. That is why we were encouraging the President to \nnegotiate with the other governments to get them to fall in line on the \ncontrols so that we would have an effective multilateral control \nprocess as well. That was covered in the report we put out last \nTuesday.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Well, I understand it might be desirable for the \nPresident to do that. For my part, I would rather leave it up to the \nPresident to decide when he wants to negotiate with foreign leaders on \nthese matters.\n  I will also suggest that when the President makes the determination \nunder this enhanced control provision, that you just pointed out, that \nan item on one of these lists would constitute a significant threat to \nthe national security, he ought to be given quite a bit of leeway. It \nmight be a good idea to negotiate with foreign leaders; it might be a \ngood idea to do a lot of things. We have to ask ourselves how many \nhoops we want the President to jump through if, in fact, he makes a \ndetermination that it constitutes a significant threat to national \nsecurity.\n  I am not trying to negotiate the details of the bill with my friend \ntoday. This is one of the benefits of discussing this today and one of \nthe reasons we are not ready to put a bill to bed. I don't claim to \nhave all the answers to it. I haven't had a chance to think all the \ndetails through. But I believe we really need to ask ourselves how many \nhoops we want the President to have to jump through before he can \nexercise some authority when he makes a determination that there is a \nsignificant threat to the national security.\n  All these requirements I read a while ago having to do with the \nPresident negotiating, with reporting to Congress, having the thing \nexpire--it even expires under that set of provisions--that is greatly \ndifferent from the enhanced control provision that doesn't put any of \nthose requirements on him if he determines that there is a significant \nthreat to national security.\n  We don't want a court 2 years from now having to be the one to decide \nwhat we meant when we drafted this legislation. We need to decide here \nin this Chamber, after thorough debate and consideration, just exactly \nhow that ought to be worded and whether or not we want to have what \nappears to me to be inconsistent provisions in the legislation.\n  I thank my friend for his comments. It is the basis for some \ndiscussion, as far as I am concerned, in an attempt to reach some \nresolution. I was not aware we were going to debate all the details. I \nwelcomed the opportunity to have done that. The issue before us today \nis whether or not this is the right time, in the midst of everything \nthat is going on in the country right now and everything that is \nhappening internationally, to choose to signal to the world that we \nwant to liberalize our export policies with regard to dual-use, high-\ntech, military-related items when we know the primary beneficiary of it \nis going to be China.\n  It is not a good time, and that is the reason I join my colleagues in \nopposing the motion to proceed. I do look forward, when we have had a \nchance to draft our amendments and hopefully have had a chance to look \nat the administration's Executive order that is supposed to fill in \nsome of the areas that are a little bit sparse, to coming up with an \nExport Administration Act that is reauthorized but one that does what \nthe Export Administration Act was designed to do--not to balance \ncommerce with national security but to protect national security and do \nthose things that are reasonable.\n  Nobody is intent on trying to protect things that are unprotectable. \nNobody is intent on basing the legislation on yesterday's technology. \nEverybody knows that the world has changed. But that does not mean we \nshould, without very careful consideration, change a policy we have had \nin this country for decades in terms of controlling those kinds of \nitems and go to something that might sound reasonable and logical: The \ngenie is out of the bottle; they can get it anywhere else; our friends \nwill sell it to them; we might as well sell it to them. I am not there \nyet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Wyoming might \nrespond to a question I have. As I read the bill, the section that he \ncited before, which relates to an override of sections 204 and 211, \ndoes not apply to section 213. Section 212 has to do with foreign \navailability, 204 deals with incorporated parts and components. The \nmass marketing section is 213.\n  As I read the President's authority under enhanced controls in that \nsection the Senator referred to, on page 183, it deals with sections \n204 and 211 only.\n  Mr. ENZI. Section 211 covers both foreign availability and mass \nmarket status. You are talking about the set-aside of the mass market \nstatus.\n  Mr. KYL. So the significant threat override authority would apply to \nany of the three items that we just talked\n\n[[Page S3964]]\n\nabout--mass marketing, foreign availability, or component parts; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ENZI. We are hoping that adequate information will be given to \nthe Senate for their oversight and their understanding of what is going \non. We have always wanted that.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator for his information.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join Senators Thompson, Shelby, Kyl, and \nother members in objecting to the rushed consideration of the Export \nAdministration Act of 2001.\n  This legislation, which governs the exports of sensitive technology \nto overseas buyers, has critical ramifications for American national \nsecurity. Republicans in Congress rightly raised grave concerns over \nthe Clinton Administration's export control policies, which had the \nappearance of being linked to campaign donations, and which we know \nimproperly enhanced Chinese and Iraqi military capabilities. This \nRepublican Congress, and our Republican Administration, must ensure \nthat our national security controls on sensitive exports prevent \npowerful technology from falling into the hands of those who would do \nAmerica harm.\n  This bill does not yet meet that threshold. Since the beginning of \nthis year, six Senators, including Senator Kyl and the Chairmen of the \nArmed Services, Foreign Relations, Intelligence, Governmental Affairs, \nand Commerce Committees, have sought and continue to hope to work with \nthe sponsors of this bill, and with the Bush Administration, to ensure \nthat S. 149 strikes the proper balance between our country's commercial \nand national security concerns.\n  I will save my specific, technical concerns about this legislation \nfor the full floor debate on this measure, whenever it should occur. At \nthis time, let me say that the bill's restrictions on presidential \nauthority to regulate national-security related exports, the enhanced \nrole given the Secretary of Commerce in the national security decision-\nmaking process, and the liberalization of exports of all goods, however \ndangerous to U.S. security interests, that may be otherwise available \nfor sale in the United States or overseas pose problems that need to be \nresolved before the Senate can properly address this legislation.\n  As Chairman of the Commerce Committee, and as a strong supporter of \nfree trade, it comes as no surprise to me that American businesses \ndominate world markets and have propelled the Information Age. Unlike \nbusinesses, however, we in this body have responsibility not only for \nthe prosperity of this country, but also for its security in an \nuncertain and hostile world.\n  Let's be clear, far less than 1 percent of total U.S. exports fall \nunder the jurisdiction of the EAA. Within that small proportion of \nexports that are sensitive, we have an obligation to ensure that these \ngoods are appropriately controlled so that the peace and prosperity we \nenjoy are not threatened.\n  Have no doubt, our enemies, be they foreign nations or terrorist \ngroups, have no qualms whatsoever with buying dual-use American \nproducts and putting them to military use. In this time of peace, let \nus work to sustain the dynamism of our economy while safeguarding our \npeople by striking the right balance between the commercial and \nnational security provisions in this bill. We have much work to do. \nThat is why I join my distinguished colleagues in objecting to \nconsideration of this measure until we have had the chance to prepare \namendments and continue our work with the Administration to improve the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I don't want to interrupt the flow of \ndebate. I have a matter I would like to discuss that doesn't pertain to \nthe matter before us. I see my good friend from Virginia. He may want \nto comment on this debate. If that is the case, then I will yield for \nthis discussion to go forward, since I don't want to necessarily \ninterrupt the flow.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have joined my colleagues for the \npurpose of contributing to the debate at hand. I think maybe I need 10, \n12 minutes. Much material has already been covered. I don't wish to be \nredundant, but there are some points I would like to make.\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to my colleague from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I reflected, as I approached the Chamber, \nthat in my 23 years in the Senate, I don't know if I have ever opposed \nmy leader on a motion to proceed. But, reluctantly, I do so this time \nbecause of my fervent belief that the views I have and share with a \nnumber of my colleagues are in the best interests of our Nation's \nsecurity. With that in mind, I have tried for over 2 years to work with \nmy distinguished colleagues, who have been speaking for some time, to \nresolve disputes within this legislation.\n  These disputes have cut to the very essence of how the United States \nplans to protect its national security in an era of rapid globalization \nand proliferation of technology--most particularly technology related \nto weapons of mass destruction.\n  On many occasions over the past year, I have joined others and have \nthought that we were close to obtaining a resolution on how to proceed \non this bill. But each time, details have derailed us, regrettably, and \nthose details indeed have overwhelmed the ability to compromise. I say \n``details,'' but I think they are very important points.\n  My goal has been to strike, together with others, the proper balance \nbetween national security and commercial interests. This is a \ncomplicated issue that cuts across the jurisdiction of six committees. \nFive committee chairmen with the responsibility for national security \nmatters in this country are together on this issue. I think that \ncarries a subtle message in and of itself.\n  We have continuously expressed opposition to this bill in a \nrespectful manner. I will not list the others because they are in the \nRecord in the course of this debate. In addition, Senator Kyl, although \nnot a chairman, has taken a leading role. He has sort of been the \n``Paul Revere.'' Each time this matter is approaching, he sounds that \nalarm and we respond.\n\n  This is an effort that requires careful thought and deliberate \naction. All of our committees should be united in an effort to reform \nour export control laws. If we do not obtain that type of unanimity--\nand I say this respectfully to my good friend from Wyoming and my good \nfriend from Texas--we could be doing a disservice to our country.\n  At the present time, I believe it is premature to move this bill \nthrough the Senate, for two very good reasons: First, we need to give \nthe administration, our new President, sufficient time to provide \nCongress with the promised details on how it plans to implement this \nlegislation. I know full well that it has been stated--and I believe it \nis factually correct--that the administration has contributed a number \nof suggestions--which I think is 21--in the Banking Committee. The \ndistinguished manager of the bill is present, and they have \nincorporated all of those. But when I look at it and listen and talk \nwith the administration, those areas in which we have special concern \nare to be brought forth in an Executive order.\n  Very simply, we are just saying allow time for the administration to \ndo the Executive order. Otherwise, we risk spending a lot of time on \nthe floor with amendments if we should go ahead with the bill and \nproceed in addressing issues that may be better left to the discretion \nof the executive branch.\n  Secondly, moving this bill at this time without establishing \nconsensus sends a wrong signal and could complicate a very difficult \nand tenuous policy toward China, which is still evolving. I cannot \nthink, therefore of a worse time to pass legislation that could result \nin an increase of exports of high technology to China. I think we \nshould listen carefully to the people in this Nation on this issue. \nThis China policy is not just reserved to the bureaucrats in \nWashington--I say that respectfully--the executive branch and the \nCongress. The people of this Nation have very deep-rooted concerns \nabout our relationship with China, and this subject goes to the very \nheart of those relationships.\n  I have serious reservations about bringing up the bill at this time, \nas I said. We are still awaiting specifics from the administration on \nhow it will\n\n[[Page S3965]]\n\nimplement this bill. We need to give the administration enough time to \nrespond to our inquiries and deliver on their promises of additional \ninformation.\n  The administration reviewed this bill at the request of myself, \nSenators McCain, Shelby, Thompson, Helms, and Kyl. We had one meeting \nwith the National Security Adviser on this issue. While the review was \nconducted without the benefit of working level political officials in \nplace with responsibility for export control issues, I am confident the \nadministration did the best it could given the timeframes and the \npeople with whom they had to do the job.\n  Based on this review, the administration came up with a series of \nlegislative changes that the Banking Committee included in its bill. \nThis was a positive step, and I commend them. I support it, although I \nwould have preferred this review take place with the benefit of the \nfull administration package; that is, these amendments that have been \nadopted, together with other commitments that they have made to \nCongress on other issues.\n  More remains to be done. We have not received specific comments or \nrecommendations from the Department of Defense. That input, in my \njudgment, is critical. The Banking Committee's bill, including the \nchanges made to the bill at the request of the administration, provides \nfor even less protection for national security than changes proposed to \nus by the last administration.\n\n  When the National Security Committee chairmen of the Senate were \nbriefed on the results of the administration review, we were informed \nat that time that an interagency agreement had been reached on how the \nadministration would enhance national security controls during \nimplementation of the bill. We were then informed that the national \nsecurity protections that we have sought would be included in an \nExecutive order that would implement S. 149.\n  Despite several inquiries on the part of my staff and others to get \nthe information that we sought, we have not been able to get any \nspecifics on what is in this interagency agreement or what might be in \nthe Executive order.\n  This information is critical in helping this Senator, and I think to \nnot only the team we have put together, but many others, in order to \nmake an informed judgment on this important piece of legislation.\n  Therefore, I most respectfully urge our majority leader and sponsors \nof the bill to wait until we have more information from the \nadministration about how it intends to implement the national security \nprotections.\n  Many of my concerns, as well as those of my colleagues, may be \nalleviated by the details of the administration's implementation plan.\n  If, however, we do not get an answer from the administration in a \nreasonable amount of time, I urge the majority leader to chair a \nworking group of interested members to work to clear as many amendments \nas possible prior to taking the legislation up on the floor, so as not \nto waste a great deal of time.\n  At this time, in the absence of additional information from the \nadministration, I have fundamental concerns with this bill. This bill \ncontinues the trend of dismantling our export control structure. During \nthe height of the cold war, this Nation had a carefully formulated and \ncarefully crafted export control process. There was a consensus--both \nhere at home and with our allies--that we needed to protect our \nNation's technology. The bottom line: It must never be used against us.\n  This consensus has broken down with the end of the cold war. \nTechnology is proliferating, and this bill will continue that trend. If \nour pilots are shot down over Iraq or put in harms' way due to enhanced \ncommunications and computing technologies that enhance Iraqi air \ndefense capabilities, we need look no further than to the lack of will \nand leadership over the last decade to control this technology. While \nthis proliferation of technology may be inevitable, we need to \nunderstand the implications of any decision that leads to freer trade \nin advance technology. With that understanding, we then must do \nwhatever it takes to protect our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines \nas they face these new threats.\n  Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, we have witnessed a slow demise of \nthe cold war consensus on export controls. I make three observations:\n  First, we have seen a dramatic liberalization--primarily through \nExecutive orders of successive Presidents--of export controls. We are \nonly controlling about 6 percent of what we controlled during the \nheight of the cold war.\n  Second, because of the decline in defense R, technology innovation \nis primarily advancing in the commercial rather than the defense \nsector. This makes dual use export controls covered by the EAA even \nmore critical in protecting our national security.\n  Finally, as a result of both of these developments, we are witnessing \nthe global spread of advanced technology that was once solely in the \nmilitary realm. This threat will require a significant investment in \ndefense capability to counter.\n  Simply put, our export control policy has gotten out of balance. The \nExport Administration Act before the Senate, as currently drafted, tips \nthe balance even further toward meeting commercial needs versus \nnational security needs. There is a predominant emphasis in this bill \non export decontrol, without, in my judgment, an adequate assessment of \nthe national security impact of that decontrol. The bill now gives the \nCommerce Department the predominant role. I believe that this must be \nbrought back into balance with enhanced DOD authorities and \ndiscretion. As now drawn, this bill also unnecessarily limits the \nPresident's discretion to control items for legitimate national \nsecurity reasons.\n\n  At a minimum, we must address in this bill:\n  No. 1, the need to protect militarily sensitive technology. DOD and \nthe intelligence community need to be able to protect sensitive \ntechnology from falling into the hands of potential adversaries. \nTechnologies which, if proliferated, would undermine U.S. military \nsuperiority must be controlled. The national security agencies must be \nable to block any decontrol or export that might harm national security \nnow or in the future. For example, hot section engine technology and \nother technologies that DOD and the intelligence community consider \ncritical need to be protected.\n  No. 2, the need to enhance the role of the Secretary of Defense and \nthe intelligence community in the export control process, given the \nlimited amount of items we are now controlling, and provide for a \nworkable national security waiver for the President. At a minimum, the \nconcurrence of the Secretary of Defense should be required in matters \nrelating to which products should be controlled, the process for \nreviewing export licenses, the rules for any interagency dispute \nprocess, and regulations implementing dual use export controls; and\n  No. 3, the need to ensure that the national security impacts of any \nproposed decontrol are well understood and articulated before \ndecontrols are allowed to proceed. This assessment should be based on \nhow this technology can be used as part of, or to develop, a foreign \nmilitary or intelligence system or capability. Ongoing assessments need \nto be made to assess the cumulative impact of decontrols and the \nproliferation of technology.\n  This last point is critical. Congress needs to look at the impact on \nnational security of export decontrol and the global diffusion of \ntechnology. We need to assess the degree of technology proliferation \nthat is occurring and the risk that our adversaries will use this \ntechnology to gain some type of asymmetric advantage over our forces. \nGlobal technology proliferation could put at risk our military \nsuperiority. Future historians may look back on the rapid decontrol and \nleakage of western technology as the biggest national security lapse of \nthe post-cold-war period.\n  I also want to ensure that unnecessary restraints on the ability of \nthe private sector to compete in the global marketplace are removed. It \nis in our interest that U.S. businesses are able to maintain their \ncommercial and technological edge over foreign competitors. However, \nwhen hard decisions must be made, national security must always be the \nparamount consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SMITH of Oregon). The Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I came to speak on an education matter, but \nI\n\n[[Page S3966]]\n\nhave enjoyed the last 45 minutes. I thank my colleagues from Tennessee, \nVirginia, and Arizona. I serve on the Banking Committee and have great \nrespect for my colleague from Wyoming who chairs the subcommittee that \ndeals with these issues.\n  The committee had extensive hearings going back into last year. The \nSenator from Wyoming deserves a great deal of credit--I know my \ncolleagues share these views--for his tireless efforts to bring forth a \nbill that reflects not only the desires of exporters, but also takes \ninto consideration the very important national security issues that our \ncolleagues from Virginia, Tennessee, and Arizona have raised this \nafternoon.\n  The committee sent out this bill in March after seven different \nhearings with extensive testimony. I have been supportive of this \neffort.\n  I say to my colleague from Virginia, that he raises some very good \npoints. This is not a debate that is going to attract nightly news \nattention. It can get rather detailed, as the Senator from Tennessee \npointed out when he started talking about various provisions and what \nis intended by them.\n  As I listened, I clearly heard the spirit with which my colleagues \nraised these concerns, and they are concerns to which we should all pay \nattention. I know my colleague from Wyoming does. I, for one, thank \nthem. I do not know what is going to happen with the debate. I hope my \ncolleagues can address some of these concerns. Some amendments may be \nnecessary. I suspect they will get broad-based support.\n  So, I came over to give a speech about education and I got educated, \nmyself. I thank my colleagues, and I appreciate the points they raise. \nThey are very valuable. The point raised about China is worthy of \nvaluable note.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his courtesies as \nalways. It is a very simple equation. The bill got the attention of the \nadministration. It is a new administration. Secretary Rumsfeld, for \nexample, has in place today only three persons who have reached the \nfull confirmation process and are now sworn into office. Six more have \nbeen processed by the advise-and-consent procedures of my committee and \nwill come before the full Senate next week.\n  The administration is struggling to put together this highly \ntechnical response. I think they should be given a reasonable period of \ntime before we plow into a legislative process in this Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to take much time. I see my good friend \nfrom West Virginia who always has worthwhile information to share with \nthis body. I see my colleague from Louisiana is here as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3966-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3966-S3968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am here to continue to raise my voice and \nexpress concerns about the forthcoming debate regarding elementary and \nsecondary education.\n  During almost my entire service in the Senate, I have been fortunate \nto serve on what now is called the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee.\n  I have had the privilege of serving with many wonderful Members, \nDemocrats and Republicans, over the years, who have dedicated \nthemselves to improving the quality of public education in America: \nSenator Pell, Senator Stafford, Senator Kennedy, the present ranking \nmember, Senator Jeffords, the present chairperson of the committee. \nEach of them deeply committed to seeing to it that this Nation provides \nour children the best educational opportunities possible. I believe \nthat the Members of the Committee, today, are anxious to continue that \ntradition.\n  I do not know exactly when this matter will come before the Senate \nfor consideration, but I am troubled that during the process of \nnegotiation, while we are trying to work out our differences, not all \nthe issues are on the table for discussion.\n  It has been most worthwhile for us to deal with the issues of \naccountability. Our colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, has \nfor years championed the cause of the accountability of our schools \nacross America, both as a Member of this body, and earlier as a Member \nof the other body. He brings to this debate years of experience and \nknowledge and I am particularly grateful to him for his help.\n  Over the years, we typically have passed education bills that enjoyed \nbroad support, 90 or 95 votes, to support our elementary and secondary \nschools. I enjoyed being part of those truly bipartisan efforts.\n  Every day, about 50 million children attend public schools in the \nUnited States. Many of them, through Title I of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, depend on Congress to provide them with \nresources that they need to help them get the education they need and \ndeserve. Yet, we spend only about 2 cents of every Federal dollar on \npublic education. In my view, we have not been a very good partner with \nour local communities in helping to improve the quality of education. \nAnother--probably surprising--fact is that the Federal government \ncontributes only about 7 cents to every dollar spent on education. Our \nsmall towns, cities, counties, and States provide the other 93 cents \neducation.\n  So, for all we talk about what needs to be done about public \neducation, we really haven't put our money--your money --where our \nmouth is. A couple weeks ago, we debated the budget of our country. The \ngreat debate was over the size of the tax cut that the President has \nproposed. Virtually every Member, in fact, virtually everyone I know, \nbelieves that a tax cut makes sense given the budget surpluses \nprojected.\n  But how much of a tax cut? The President wants $1.6 trillion, based \non ten-year economic projections. I don't know of a single economist \nworth his or her salt who believes that we can project with any degree \nof certainty what America's and the world's economic situation will be \na decade from now. Yet the President of the United States and those who \nsupport him on this matter want to spend $1.6 trillion of this budget \nover the next 10 years on a tax cut. And, Mr. President, $680 billion \nof that $1.6 trillion, will go to individuals who presently earn more \nthan $300,000 a year. Over that same period, the President would \nincrease spending on education by $42 billion, or about one-sixteenth \nof what he would spend on tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  I think in that context that we really ought to do better than \nspending only 2 percent of our budget to support America's educational. \nThe administration and others say that full funding for title I of \nESEA, which provides Federal dollars to the most needy school districts \nin America, is just too costly; that full funding for special education \nis just too costly; that we just can't afford it. But, we can afford \n$680 billion for a tax cut for people who make more than $300,000 a \nyear which by the way is about twice as much as the Federal, State, and \nlocal governments combined spend on education in this country.\n  I represent the most affluent State in America on a per capita income \nbasis. Some of my constituents want a tax cut. I have represented my \nState for more than two decades in the U.S. Congress. I am home almost \nevery weekend. I have a fairly good idea of how people in Connecticut \nfeel on issues.\n  On this issue, the overwhelming majority of my constituents, \nincluding those from the most affluent communities, tell me that we \ndon't need this size tax cut, in light of the economic forecast and the \nmany needs that America has. And, these are the people who would be the \ndirect beneficiaries of the proposal the President is advocating.\n  This tax cut threatens to throw us back into the situation I \nencountered when I arrived in this body 20 years ago. I had been here a \nyear, I say to my colleague from West Virginia, when I was asked to \nvote on a tax cut proposal that I thought was dangerous then. I wasn't \nsure. I was a new Member.\n  I was one of 11 people who voted against the tax cut proposal, and as \nI look back over 20 years of public service in this body, I don't think \nI ever cast a better vote. And I don't know many Members who were here \nthat day who wouldn't like to have that vote back because of the great \nharm it did\n\n[[Page S3967]]\n\nto our country, throwing us into a deficit that took our national debt \nfrom $900 billion to almost $5 trillion in a little less than a decade.\n  Today, we have come out of that situation for a lot of reasons which \nI will not go into this afternoon. We have been given a second chance \nnot to make the same mistake we did two decades ago. In the midst of \nthis, we are going to have a debate about educational needs. The \nPresident has said many times that this is his No. 1 priority. How many \ntimes during the past year did we see the President campaigning in from \nof a banner that said ``Leave No Child Behind.''\n\n  I supported Al Gore for the Presidency, but I liked that the \nPresident said he was committed to leaving no child behind. And, part \nof me said that maybe he would take the right track. But, I am sad to \nreport after 100 days that the ``Leave No Child Behind\" administration \nwill do just that, if we adopt their education program that imposes \nstrict new mandates on local communities--that they can't afford on \ntheir own--but won't commit the resources to match.\n  Unlike the defense authorization or the agriculture bill, which we \nconsider every year, we won't consider the elementary and secondary \neducation bill again for seven years. This is our one chance to \nestablish our educational priorities as we start the new global \nmillennium.\n  A child entering an elementary school in Connecticut today is not \ncompeting with a child from Louisiana or West Virginia or Oregon. They \nare competing with children from Beijing, Moscow, Australia, South \nAfrica, and Europe. We are in a global economy. We have to produce the \nbest educated, best prepared generation America has ever produced. And \nin no small measure what we do in the next few weeks will determine \nwhether or not we are successful in that endeavor.\n  We talk about testing teachers and testing students. Well, we are \nabout to take a test, ourselves. The test is whether we can get beyond \npolitics in discussing an education bill, as we used to do around here. \nIt is an embarrassment that we spend only two cents of each dollar of \nthe national budget on education, when the President says that \neducation ought to be our top priority. I agree with the President on \nthat, but not on the resources he is willing to devote to education.\n  I am very worried that, during the ongoing negotiations, as we talk \nabout testing and accountability, which I agree have and merit, we have \nnot reached a consensus about how we will support real improvements in \nthe schools. Tests are measurements, not reforms. We also need to \nsupport the real reforms that the tests will measure.\n  An educator in my home State of Connecticut said the other day: \nTaking someone's temperature three times an hour does not improve their \nhealth, medicine does. Or, as my good friend and colleague from \nLouisiana, Senator Landrieu, said the other day: Resources without \nreform are a waste of money. But reform without resources is a waste of \ntime.\n  That is about as good a statement I have heard in this debate over \nthe last number of weeks. She is exactly right.\n  I would like to place on the table, in addition to accountability and \ntesting and the other things we are discussing, the principle that we \nought to have resources committed to school construction, and other \nissues. It is a disgrace that the average American child goes to school \nin a building built in the 1950s. And, we need to help schools get \nclass sizes down to a level where teachers can teach and kids can \nlearn. That ought to be a part of this negotiation.\n\n  Teachers do a magnificent job every day. I am somewhat biased in \nthis. My oldest sister has been a teacher for about 30 years in the \npublic schools of my State. She taught in the private schools; in the \nMontessori system of teaching before that. I have a brother who taught \n25 years at the university level and my father's three sisters taught \nfor 40 years apiece in the public school system in my State. All three \nare now gone, but they prided themselves on that and dedicated \nthemselves as teachers. One of them was a Fulbright scholar. She taught \nin the Hartford Public High Schools. So I come to this debate and \ndiscussion, I suppose, with somewhat of a bias in that I have grown up \nwith two generations of my family dedicated to teaching young people.\n  Nothing makes me more angry than when I hear people suggest that \nteachers do not care. Maybe there are some, but I have never met one. \nThe ones I have met, the ones I know, could have chosen other career \npaths in their lives and been financially rewarded to a far greater \nextent than they were as teachers. But they were dedicated to improving \nthe educational quality of their pupils.\n  This Nation is built on a number of great things. One of the best is \na commitment to education by a group of people who educate succeeding \ngenerations of Americans. Those teachers embrace the values \nincorporated in our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution. \nWe ought to applaud them every single day and thank them.\n  I listen to teachers talk about what needs to be done. We all ought \nto pay attention to that. We ought to listen to our PTAs and school \nboards, people who work every day with these issues. When I talk about \nclass size, school construction, afterschool programs, teacher \nquality--these are not my ideas; these are not issues the Senator from \nLouisiana or the Senator from West Virginia or the Senator from Oregon \nthought up on our own. We were back listening to the folks at home who \ntold us this is what is needed to make the system work better.\n  In the remaining hours and days here, before we begin a debate on \nthis subject matter, let us not be co-architects of a plan we will come \nto regret. There are those who are anxious to see the public \neducational system of this country disappear. I know that sounds like a \nradical thought, but there are those who believe it. I believe we may \nbe setting up a system that will have a self-fulfilling prophecy \ningrained in it, to produce the result that schools do not work and \nthat we have to come up with alternatives to those to educate people in \nthis country.\n  That is not an answer. Mr. President, 55 million children went to \nschool today: 50 million went to a public school, 5 million went to a \nprivate or parochial school, 5 million. There is no way in the world we \nare going to create a private or parochial school system to accommodate \nthe educational needs of generations of Americans for the 21st century \nand beyond. We have an obligation, every one of us here and at home, to \nweigh in and to make our schools better. We need national leadership \nthat is going to put their shoulders behind that effort. And you cannot \ndo it on the cheap. You cannot go around the country and talk about it \nevery day and show up in classrooms for photo opportunities and come \nback here and say: We just cannot afford to do this, but we can afford \nto spend $1.6 trillion on a tax cut, nearly half of which goes to the \nmost affluent.\n  I hope my colleagues in the coming days will find that common ground \nand put these items on the table. Let's negotiate these items as well \nbefore we come to the floor with an education bill that runs the risk \nof testing kids and holding schools accountable but not providing the \nresources that our most needy schools require to implement reforms.\n  I apologize to my colleagues for taking a bit more time than I \nthought I would, but I thank you for your attention, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague on his speech \nthis afternoon. I share his thoughts, so beautifully and so eloquently \nexpressed on this Senate floor. I salute him, and I will be working \nshoulder to shoulder with him to advance the education of our children.\n  During a recent break, I read a book by Sir Francis Bacon. The book \nis entitled, ``The Advancement Of Learning.'' He was talking about some \nof the same things we are talking about today: the need for equipment \nin our educational institutions; the need to pay, the need to \nremunerate the people who teach in these schools. So I think we are--I \nwas about to say ``walking in good footsteps.'' I hesitated because Sir \nFrancis Bacon was impeached and went to the tower for a while. But \nanyway, I congratulate my friend.\n  Mr. President, I understand my friend and colleague from Louisiana is \nalso interested in speaking. May I ask her how much time she would \nneed?\n\n[[Page S3968]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I could probably use 5 minutes, if the Senator could be \nso gracious to allow that, for comments on education.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have three speeches. I am not noted for brevity in my \nspeeches, but I do not worry about that too much because Cicero was \nonce asked which of Demosthenes' speeches, he, Cicero, liked the best.\n  Cicero's answer was, ``the longest.'' He liked the longest of \nDemosthenes' speeches the best. Of course his speech ``On the Crown'' \nwas probably the greatest speech ever made.\n  I wonder if the distinguished Senator will let me do my first speech, \nwhich will require less than 10 minutes. Then I ask unanimous consent \nthat I may yield to the Senator for her remarks, and that I retain the \nfloor so I might complete my other two speeches.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3968-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATOR STROM THURMOND\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this morning's Washington Post contained a \nfront page story on our distinguished colleague, Senator Strom \nThurmond.\n  I am the Senator in this body who has served longest with Senator \nThurmond. I served with Senator Thurmond when Senator Thurmond was a \nmember of the party on this side of the aisle. So, having served with \nSenator Thurmond all of these long years, I began reading the story, \nthinking how nice it was that the paper would devote time and space to \ntake notice of the longest serving U.S. Senator in American history, \nSenator Thurmond, who has cast more than 15,800 votes. He is a man who \nloved his country so much that he gave up his draft exemption status \nduring World War II in order to enlist in the U.S. military and take \npart in the invasion of Normandy and the liberation of Europe. I salute \nSenator Thurmond for his patriotism. He didn't have to do that, but he \ndid it.\n  As I read the story, I was filled with dismay, then revulsion. \nContrary to my expectation, what I was reading was a demeaning drivel \nfilled with denigrating language and insensitive images.\n  As I read, I kept asking myself, what is the point of this story? Is \nthere any purpose to be served by it?\n  This is certainly not a news story. Yet, it is on the front page of a \nmajor national newspaper--a newspaper that is read around the world \neveryday, a newspaper that is a great newspaper.\n  I can see neither a point nor a purpose to the story other than a \npathetic attempt to demean an outstanding man and a long serving, \ndistinguished federal lawmaker.\n  Every senior citizen in America ought to be offended by this orgy of \npejorative blather which aims only to viciously exploit something as \nnormal as the human aging process.\n  We are all going to be old one day, if we live long enough. We ought \nto be conscious of that fact. We should be conscious of it every day \nregardless of what pursuit we follow in life.\n  Is there no decency anymore?\n  Is there no respect for anything anymore?\n  The people of South Carolina continue to place their confidence and \ntheir trust in Senator Thurmond. They elected Senator Thurmond to \nrepresent their State in the U.S. Senate. And they have elected him and \nreelected him many times. That is their judgment to make, and I respect \ntheir judgment, and so should everybody else.\n  The Senate is a collective body of 100 men and women who have been \nelected by the people of their various States to make the Nation's \nlaws. We are a unique body. One-thousand, eight hundred and sixty-four \nmen and women have served in the Senate since the first day it met in \n1789.\n  We are a special body. While we may have our disagreements on this \nfloor, I believe that the Members of this body for the most part \nrespect each other off the Senate floor as well as on the Senate floor.\n  However, midway through the story, the Post journalist quotes a \nSenator who ``agreed to speak candidly only if he was granted \nanonymity.''\n  I am speaking candidly today, and I don't do so with anonymity.\n  At any rate, the story quotes the unnamed Senator as saying, in \ntalking about Senator Thurmond, ``At what point do you draw the line?''\n  That is the question I kept asking myself as I read this \ninappropriate, tasteless, cheap-shot piece of journalism: At what point \ndo you draw the line?\n  That is the very question the Washington Post should have been asking \nbefore they chose to print their tabloid tripe: At what point do you \ndraw the line?\n  May I suggest that the real story here is not Senator Thurmond's age. \nThe real story should be that he loves this institution so much and \nloves serving the people of South Carolina so much that he, at the age \nof 98, continues to serve and have the courage to carry on, and that he \nloves his country so much that he was willing to set aside his exempt \nstatus in World War II and participate in that dreadful landing on the \nbeaches of Normandy and risk his life, as so many others risked \ntheir lives. And many of them never returned. Senator Thurmond \ncontinues to serve and have the courage to carry on, in spite of non-\nnews, deeply offensive stories such as the one in today's Washington \nPost.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3968-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3968-S3969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his heartfelt and wonderful remarks. I thank him for yielding just \na few minutes this afternoon to me to speak about the subject of \neducation to follow up on many of the things our colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, said so eloquently just a few minutes ago. I \nappreciate the Senator from West Virginia yielding.\n  I could actually spend over an hour speaking about this subject \nbecause it is so important to our Nation, and it is so important to the \nState I represent, Louisiana. I will come back often during this debate \nto try to help focus our attention on some of the aspects of this \neducational debate that is so important.\n  Let me begin by simply saying that we are spending a good amount of \nmoney on education today. We are spending about $18 billion. That is a \nlot of money. It is a lot of money to the people of Louisiana. And \ntitle I is $8.6 billion with a ``b''--not a million but a billion. That \nis a huge amount of money, but, unfortunately, I am here to say today \nthat it is not enough to do the things we know we need to do to help \nreform and improve our schools and to truly give every child in this \ncountry a chance to succeed.\n  As the Senator from West Virginia knows, there are no guarantees in \nthis life. The Government cannot guarantee every citizen a good life. \nBut our Constitution, the formation of this country, and the reason we \ncome to work I think every day as Senators and Members of this body is \nto try to provide at least equal opportunity and an equal chance to \nsucceed, to be a part of this great Nation.\n  There are many ways we can try to do that. But one fundamental way is \nthrough the process of formal education--providing excellence in \neducation to every child, whether they be born into a wealthy family, \nor a poor family, a black family, or a white family, whether they are \nborn in California or New York or Louisiana or Minnesota.\n\n  Today, as a nation, we believe we have an obligation. We did not \nalways believe that because prior to 1965 education was a very local \nenterprise. But since 1965, this Government has recognized that the \nFederal Government does, in fact, have a role to play, not only in \nhelping States with dollars but, hopefully, now helping them with \ndirection, and moving them to reforms into excellence because while \nsome of our public schools are working, too many of them are failing.\n  So as we speak about this education debate, yes, we are spending a \nsignificant amount of money, but it is not nearly enough. In fact, you \ncan look at how our money has really not increased.\n  For the record, let me share with you that the title I portion, which \nis $8.6 billion of the $18 billion total, since 1965, has barely kept \npace with inflation. So while every year we come to Washington and say \neducation is our No. 1 priority--the polls most certainly indicate that \non the Republican side\n\n[[Page S3969]]\n\nand Democratic side--our budgets have not reflected that because when \nitems are a No. 1 priority, they get greater than an inflationary \nincrease. They get significant increases in the budget to reflect that \nNo. 1 status. That is simply not happening in the area of education, \nparticularly in title I.\n  So we want to fight for reform. We want to fight for accountability. \nBut we must have those investments to make those reforms real or it is \nan empty promise and we are going to be leaving many children behind--\nmillions of children, as Senator Dodd said.\n  Let me just share with you, first, a chart that shows that money does \nmatter. There have been hundreds of studies done, but let me just share \none with you. This is a New York study that was recently done that \nlinks the rises in school financing to test scores.\n  In New York, 39 low-performing schools were targeted. These are \nschools that were failing to meet academic standards. These schools \nwere targeted, and they were given a set of reforms: higher standards, \ntesting, all of the things that we want to do; and, in addition, money, \nanywhere from $500,000 to $1 million was invested, for smaller class \nsizes, longer school days, and teacher training.\n  Do you know what happened. Children began to learn because the \nreforms were matched with the dollars. In this particular study, we saw \nan increase of 7 percent in reading, and 3.5 percent in math, based on \nthe reforms and the investment.\n  I could share with you hundreds of studies and case examples in \nLouisiana, New York, and California where it proves the point that \nmoney matters. Will money correct the problem by itself? Absolutely \nnot. We could triple the amount of money in education under the current \nsystem, and we probably would not see much in the way of results. But \nwe are on the threshold of mandating rigorous tests, very high \nstandards, and real consequences for failure.\n  I believe passionately that if we do not match that historic \ncommitment to excellence and accountability with an historic increase \nin funding, we are going to leave many millions of our children behind, \ndisappoint communities around this Nation, with unfunded mandates and \nbroken hearts and broken promises. We simply cannot do that. We need to \nincrease funding substantially.\n  Let me share another number for the record. The proposed tax cut will \nreturn $69 billion this year. The current education budget provides \nonly $2 billion extra. Mr. President, with $69 billion for investments \nin tax cuts, $2 billion for investments in education, it is not nearly \nenough.\n\n  The three R's bill that I have been supporting and promoting asks for \nan $8 billion increase in education. That would be a significant \nstart--more than the rate of inflation. Not only would the increase \nhelp to match our commitment to reform and accountability, but the \ntargeting aspect is also important.\n  Let me share one other chart today.\n  One of the problems, as I have tried to outline, is the lack of \nadequate funding and the real need to match these new accountability \nstandards--new testing standards and new standards of excellence--with \nreal dollars to help our schools to meet these new targets. But equally \nimportant as the amount of the funding is the way the funding is \ndistributed.\n  Right now, we are missing the mark. We are missing our targets. The \nFederal Government provides a portion of education dollars to the \nState, and all of us agree--Republicans and Democrats alike--that the \nprimary role of the Federal Government is to help level the playing \nfield so that whether you are in a poor community or a poor State, you \nhave an equal opportunity for an excellent education. Regardless of the \nfact that he or she might live in a district where there is no capacity \nfor raising taxes, that student should still have a chance for a good \neducation.\n  Our targets are missing the mark. Depicted in the center of this \nchart are the schools that are up to 100 percent of poverty. After 35 \nyears, we are still not funding 100 percent of the poorest children in \nour Nation. We have not reached them. We have tried for 35 years, but \nwe are not reaching the target. When you move out to those schools that \nare between 50 and 75 percent of poverty, we are only reaching 80 \npercent of our children. When you move out further, to those schools \nthat are between 35 to 50 percent of poverty, we are reaching less than \n50 percent of our children. We need 100 percent for the poorest of our \nchildren. We need 100 percent for those schools between 50 and 75 \npercent of poverty. And we need at least 75 to 100 percent for those \nschools at 35 to 50 percent of poverty. If we do not, the promise that \nwe make to help the poor children in this country, many of whom live in \nStates such as Louisiana, West Virginia, California, and New York--and \nthey exist in every part of this Nation--will simply be empty. It is \nnot fair.\n  As I conclude, let me just say that not only is it not fair; it is \nnot smart because our Nation will not function at its highest capacity. \nWe cannot remain the supereconomic power that we are. We cannot provide \nour industries with workers who have had skilled training if we do not \nmake a commitment at the national level to not only increase the amount \nof funding for education significantly, over and above the inflation \nrate, but that we also target those extra dollars to the communities \nthat need the most help, hoping that wealthier communities and affluent \ncommunities could step up to the plate and do the job, but communities \nthat are poor and disadvantaged, the Federal Government would help.\n  In conclusion, let me be clear that we want to help every child in \nevery district in every State. In our formula that we are \nrecommending--and I am going to be offering an amendment that will \ncertainly do that--every child, every community, and every school \ndistrict will get help from the Federal Government. But we will give \nspecial help to those districts that need it the most. This is not just \nabout taking temperatures; it is about having the medicine to give to \nour children to help get them well and to give to our schools to help \nmake them excellent. If we raise the standards and do not help our \nchildren meet the standards, we are going to have a high level of \nfrustration, anxiety, and pain across this Nation.\n  So I commend the President for wanting to move to a system of greater \naccountability. I have supported that. My State of Louisiana is leading \nthat effort. But if we do not couple that new accountability with \nincreased targeting and increased investment, we will be making a very \nbad mistake that our Nation will pay for dearly in the decades ahead.\n  Let us start this new century with a renewed commitment, with renewed \nvigor, with a commonsense approach; yes, with more accountability and \nreform, with real dollars to match, targeted in a way that will really \nbring the promise of this great Nation to each child, whether they live \nin West Virginia or Louisiana. We can do it. We have the money to do \nit. The question is, Do we have the will? I believe we do. With the \nPresident's leadership, with bipartisan support, we can find the will \nto do right by our children in their schools and in their communities.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana. I share \nher enthusiasm for education. I am grateful that she is a Senator who \nis using her foresight and vision and talents to advance the cause of \neducation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3969-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3969-S3970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER TO WORK DAY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to discuss an \nissue that I have addressed several times before on this floor--that \nis, the role of television in the lives of the American people. Today's \ntelevision would have you believe that the television program ``How to \nMarry a Millionaire'' is a guide on how to find the perfect mate; that \n``Temptation Island'' is a guide to stable relationships; that Al Bundy \nis a paragon of parental nurturing, while his wife, Peg Bundy is \nreflective of virtuous American womanhood; that ``Who Wants To Be a \nMillionaire?'' is educational television.\n  I am ashamed and embarrassed that according to a survey by the \nAnnenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, 70 \npercent of the parents surveyed regard ``Who Wants To Be a \nMillionaire?'' as educational television.\n  I regret to say that the sorry state of television is becoming the \nsorry state of America: 59 percent of Americans can name the three \nStooges, but only 17 percent of the American people can name three \nSupreme Court Justices; only about 50 percent of the American people \ncould identify the Vice President of the United States, but 95 percent \ncould identify Homer, Bart, and Marge Simpson.\n  Three years ago, I came to this floor to express my shock and utter \namazement at the details of a story in Time magazine entitled, \n``Everything Your Children Already Know About Sex.'' The story told how \nour children are learning their sexual values from television programs \nlike ``Dawson's Creek,'' which boasted of a character who lost her \nvirginity at the age of 12 while drunk. There was ``Buffy the Vampire \nSlayer'' in which a male vampire turned bad after having sex with 17-\nyear-old Buffy.\n  ``Why are we letting our kids watch this morally degrading, \nthoroughly demeaning, junk on the airwaves?'' I asked.\n  But from that low point, television has only continued to degenerate. \nIt seems that many television programs are busily intent on answering \nthe question, ``how low can you go?'' with the fare that they put \nbefore us.\n  The land, the society, the country that once produced the works of \nJames Fenimore Cooper, Herman Melville, and Nathaniel Hawthorne, now \ngives us the works of Howard Stern and Jerry Springer. No wonder the \nlate Steve Allen, a pioneer in the television industry, complained that \ntelevision had become a ``moral sewer.''\n  When I think of television today, I seriously wonder whether Charles \nDarwin's theory of evolution is being stood on its head by popular \nculture. Evolution implies progress. Going from the musical \naccomplishments of Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart to the groans and moans \nof HBO's ``Sex in the City'' is anything but progress.\n  By the age of 18, the average American child will have viewed about \n200,000 acts of violence on television. Before that child leaves \nelementary school, that child will have watched, on the average, about \n20,000 murders and more than 80,000 other assaults. This means that \nduring their most formative years, our children will witness \napproximately 100,000 acts of violence.\n  But the problem with television is more than the content of the \nprograms alone. It is the nature of the beast--or should I say, the \nnature of the boob tube. There are 102 million TV homes in the USA; 42 \npercent of them have three or more sets. The average American spends \nfour hours of each day--that amounts to two full months of each year--\nstaring at the boob tube. Forty percent of the American people stare at \nthe boob tube even while eating.\n\n  The negative impact of too much television is becoming more and more \napparent as more and more studies have demonstrated: the link between \ntelevision violence and real violence; the link between television and \nincreasing obesity among young people; the link between television and \ndeclining interest in the fine arts; the link between television \nviewing and low academic performance. To put it bluntly, Mr. President, \ntelevision is helping to create a morally irresponsible, overweight, \nlazy, violent, and ill-informed society.\n  Mr. President, this week, April 23-29, is national ``TV Turnoff \nWeek.'' Turn it off! Let's have more turnoff weeks; make it 52 weeks of \nthe year, national ``TV Turnoff Week.'' This is an effort sponsored by \nthe TV-Turnoff Network, a grass-roots organization that has organized \nthousands of schools, clubs, community organizations, and religious \ngroups to get the American people to turn off or limit their television \nviewing for one week to discover that there is actually life beyond the \nboob tube. The group has won the support and endorsements of dozens of \npowerful organizations, such as the American Medical Association. They \nhave certainly won my support and my hearty endorsement. Hallelujah! \nTurn off that TV.\n  The organization's motto is, ``Turn off TV. Turn on life.'' Their \npoint is well taken. Life should be more rewarding and interesting than \nsitting in front of a box and becoming mesmerized with morally \ndegrading, mind-numbing nonsense. That is what it is.\n  Instead of sitting in front of the television for 4 hours a day, get \nsome exercise! Get out-of-doors. Go for a walk, a hike, a bike ride, or \nswim. It will be far better for your health.\n  Instead of sitting in front of the television for 4 hours a day, read \na good book! Read Emerson's Essays, Carlyle's ``History of the French \nRevolution,'' read history, read the Bible, read Milton's ``Paradise \nLost, Paradise Regained.'' Read ``Robinson Crusoe.'' Read something \nthat is worth reading. I ask, which will make one a better person, \nspending hours watching ``Survivor,'' ``Big Brother,'' and ``The \nWeakest Link,'' or using the time to read a great literary work by \nShakespeare, Dickens, or Goethe. Groucho Marx said that he found \ntelevision to be very educational because, ``Every time somebody turns \non a set, I go into the other room and read a book.'' I like that. I \nsay, ``be like Groucho.'' Let's have more Groucho's. Simply turn off \nthe television set and read a good book.\n  Instead of sitting in front of the television for 4 hours a day, \nspend some time with the family. Family members can use the opportunity \nto take a trip together to the local museum or art gallery, or simply \ntalk to each other during dinner. Make your family the center of home \nlife, not the television set. Studies by professor Barbara Brock at \nEastern Washington University found that in TV-free families, parents \nhave about an hour of meaningful conversation with their children every \nday, compared with the national average of 38 minutes a week. Here \nwould be an opportunity for parents to emphasize their values--not \nHollywood's--to their most precious asset--their children.\n  I don't want to leave the impression that all television is bad. I \nhave seen some very educational, very informative, very uplifting, very \ngood pictures, shows, and plays on television. There is much \nprogramming that is truly educational. I have been to one movie since I \nhave been in Washington. I have been in Washington now 49 years. I have \nbeen to one movie. I left that movie. I didn't stay and watch it \nthrough. I became bored and I walked out. Yul Brynner was, I think, the \nmain player in that movie. I walked out. But just within the last few \nweeks, I watched a picture in which Yul Brynner played. I believe it \nwas--I am trying to remember now. I have watched some good pictures \nrecently. I watched ``The Ten Commandments,'' which was a good picture. \nThat may have been it. Yul Brynner plays in it and I liked him in it. \nHe played well. So I don't want to leave the impression that all \ntelevision is bad. I think that C-Span, PBS, and the History Channel\n\n[[Page S3971]]\n\nprovide worthwhile viewing to the audience. I also believe that \nprogramming like Ken Burns's series on the Civil War is quality \nprogramming that expands our knowledge and deepens understanding.\n\n  But I do want to emphatically stress that there is much more to life \nthan the boring, degrading, demeaning fare on the boob tube. I urge the \nAmerican people to use this week to break your addiction to television. \nJust say no! As the TV-Turnoff Network urges, ``turn off TV, turn on \nlife.''\n  In addition to becoming healthier, both mentally and physically, one \nmight be able to name three Justices on the Supreme Court.\n  One might even be able to name the Vice President of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of the TV-Turnoff Network and \nurge them to keep up the good work. And I urge my colleagues and the \nAmerican people to participate in national ``TV Turnoff Week.''\n  Mr. President, I have another statement I want to make. But I am very \nconscious of the fact that my favorite U.S. Senator on this side of the \naisle has been on the floor waiting. I am very willing to set aside my \nspeech and listen to my colleague before I proceed further.\n  (Mr. ENZI assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield, I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia, who is typically courteous, as always. I am very grateful for \nhis thoughtfulness. I welcome the opportunity to continue to listen to \nhis very fine statements. There are many important things that are \nhappening in the Nation's Capitol and around this country today, but I \nthink if the American people will pause and listen to the good advice \nof my friend and colleague about the importance of reading as opposed \nto television, in his excellent presentation, I think this would be a \nwiser and more thoughtful country. I commend the Senator for his \nstatement and the subject matter. I look forward to continue listening.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. But I want to give him \na second chance. I want to give my friend a second chance. I want to \nwarn him that this is poetry month. I am all ready to talk about \npoetry, and I am ready to at least render my memorization of at least 8 \nor 10 or 12 poems. So I will give my colleague one more chance. If he \nwould like to make his speech now before I start, I would be happy to \nyield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator may be even more reluctant to interfere. We \nhave a good prospect of listening to him quote poetry. All of us are \nenormously impressed that when the Senator travels back to West \nVirginia, he takes time to learn and to memorize poems. As a result of \nthat experience, and a very long and distinguished career in the \nSenate, he has an enormous reservoir of knowledge of poetry and an \nincredible encyclopedic memory for poetry that always seems to be right \nfor every special occasion. I look forward to hearing some of those \nthis afternoon.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy. I really have \nenjoyed my long service with the distinguished senior Senator from \nMassachusetts. I have learned a great deal from him, and I prize that \nfriendship.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield, does the Senator intend to \nmention that wonderful poem about the ambulance in the valley? That was \nalways one of my favorites. I don't know whether the Senator planned to \ninclude that.\n  Mr. BYRD. I did not plan to include it, but I will be happy to try to \ndo that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. That is very thoughtful of him and \nvery good of him. I appreciate his interest in that particular poem, \namong others. Let's do it this way. I will make my speech and do the \npoems that I have included, and then I will give the Senator a chance \nto make his speech, and if he is still interested in my giving that \npoem, I will be happy to, or I will be happy to wait until another day.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3971-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3971-S3973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A CELEBRATION OF POETRY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this is entitled ``Looking Up At Him'':\n\n       I asked the robin, as he sprang\n       From branch to branch and sweetly sang,\n       What made his breast so round and red;\n       Twas ``looking at the sun,'' he said;\n       I asked the violets, sweet and blue,\n       Sparkling in the morning dew,\n       Whence came their colors, then so shy;\n       They answered, ``looking to the sky'';\n       I saw the roses, one by one,\n       Unfold their petals to the sun,\n       I asked them what made their tints so bright,\n       They answered, ``looking to the light'';\n       I asked the thrush, whose silvery note\n       Came like a song from angel's throat,\n       Why he sang in the twilight dim;\n       He answered, ``looking up at Him.''\n\n  Mr. President, this month, our nation recognizes National Poetry \nMonth, a celebration of poetry and its place in American society. Like \nspring, poetry offers man a rebirth of his inner spirit. Poetry \nexpresses our humanity, and, through meter, makes music of the spoken \nworld as it rhythmically sways and floats through our imaginations. It \nis the laughter of children, the gentle rustle of an autumn breeze, and \nthe pitter-patter of a sun shower. Poetry, simply put, is beauty \ndefined.\n\n     Man comes a pilgrim of the universe,\n     Out of the mystery that was before\n     The world, out of the wonder of old stars.\n     Far roads have felt his feet, forgotten wells\n     Have glassed his beauty bending down to drink.\n     At altar-fires anterior to Earth\n     His soul was lighted, and it will burn on\n     After the suns have wasted on the void.\n     His feet have felt the pressure of old worlds,\n     And are to tread on others yet unnamed--\n     Worlds sleeping yet in some new dream of God.\n\n  Whether constructed with long cadenced lines or intricate stanzas, \nconventional or openhanded sonnetry, light quatrains or heavy ballads, \nor the age-old epic yarns of Homer and Virgil, the power of poetry \nsurrounds us. It tells of love, of death, of things temporal or \nspiritual, and of the hereafter. It speaks of the most common of \noccurrences and the most revealing of emotions, and it flows like a \nsymphony, its meter enhancing the expressiveness of its words. These \nvirtues can be seen in Alfred Tennyson's ``Crossing the Bar'':\n\n     Sunset and evening star,\n     And one clear call for me!\n     And my there be no moaning of the bar,\n     When I put out to sea,\n     But such a tide as moving seems asleep,\n     Too full for sound and foam,\n     When that which drew from out the boundless deep\n     Turns again home.\n     Twilight and evening bell,\n     And after that the dark!\n     And may there be no sadness of farewell,\n     When I embark;\n     For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place\n     The flood may bear me far,\n     I hope to see my Pilot face to face\n     When I have crost the bar.\n\n  I have often found that a good poet helps me to examine my inner self \nthrough the poet's use of words, meter, and rhyme. Such poets enable \ntheir readers to look within and to confront their own vexations and \nperplexities, and then sort out the wheat from the chaff and deal with \nthe inevitable dilemmas of life. An example of this can be seen in \nRobert Frost's ageless masterpiece, ``The Road Not Taken:''\n\n     Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\n     And sorry I could not travel both\n     And be one traveler, long I stood\n     And looked down one as far as I could\n     To where it bent in the undergrowth;\n\n     Then took the other, as just as fair,\n     And having perhaps the better claim,\n     Because it was grassy and wanted wear;\n     Though as for that, the passing there\n     Had worn them really about the same,\n\n     And both that morning equally lay\n     In leaves no step had trodden black.\n     Oh, I kept the first for another day!\n     Yet knowing how way leads on to way,\n     I doubted if I should ever come back.\n\n     I shall be telling this with a sigh\n     Somewhere ages and ages hence:\n     Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--\n     I took the one less traveled by,\n     And that has made all the difference.\n\n  Frost's words sing, and at the same time, as I reflect on his deft \nmetaphor for the choices we all make in our lives, they burn in my \nmind. For 83 years I have encountered diverging roads, some in the \nbeautiful woods of West Virginia and many here in this Chamber. The \nchoices that I have made at these crossroads have, in fact, made all \nthe difference.\n  Speaking of roads, there are many bridges also that we have to cross \nin this great country of ours. It brings to my mind a poem by Will \nDromgoole. One might think this is a man who wrote this poem--Will \nDromgoole, but it is a female author:\n\n     An old man going a lone highway\n     Came at the evening, cold and gray,\n     To a chasm vast and wide and steep,\n\n[[Page S3972]]\n\n     With waters rolling cold and deep.\n     The old man crossed in the twilight dim,\n     The sullen stream had no fears for him;\n     But he turned when safe on the other side,\n     And built a bridge to span the tide.\n\n     ``Old man,'' said a fellow pilgrim near,\n     ``You are wasting your strength with building here.\n     Your journey will end with the ending day,\n     You never again will pass this way.\n     You've crossed the chasm, deep and wide,\n     Why build you this bridge at eventide?''\n\n     The builder lifted his old gray head.\n     ``Good friend, in the path I have come,'' he said,\n     ``There followeth after me today\n     A youth whose feet must pass this way.\n     The chasm that was as nought to me\n     To that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be;\n     He, too, must cross in the twilight dim--\n     Good friend, I am building this bridge for him.''\n\n  The lines of a poem contain the timeless power of concentrated \nthought. Whether a poem is as ancient as the ``Aeneid'' by Virgil or as \nstraightforward as the verses of Emily Dickinson or Ella Wheeler Cox, \npoetry can evoke the full range of human emotions from joy to sadness. \nPoems are, as William Butler Yeats once said, ``monuments of unaging \nintellect.'' Poems may also be monuments to historical eras--speaking \nfor every man and woman of the time. One such poem, ``The Right to \nLabor in Joy,'' by Edwin Markham, captures the discord and tension of \nthe era when the grasp of European despotism began to weaken:\n\n     Out on the roads they have gathered, a hundred-thousand men,\n     To ask for a hold on life as sure as the wolf's hold in his \n           den.\n     Their need lies close to the quick of life as rain to the \n           furrow sown:\n     It is as meat to the slender rib, as marrow to the bone.\n\n     They ask but the leave to labor for a taste of life's \n           delight,\n     For a little salt to savor their bread, for houses water-\n           tight.\n     They ask but the right to labor, and to live by the strength \n           of their hands--\n     They who have bodies like knotted oaks, and patience like \n           sea-sands.\n\n     And the right of a man to labor and his right to labor in \n           joy--\n     Not all your laws can strangle that right, nor the gates of \n           hell destroy.\n     For it came with the making of man and was kneaded into his \n           bones,\n     And it will stand at the last of things on the dust of \n           crumbled thrones.\n\n  Whether introspective, political, or pastoral, all poetry is intended \nto elicit an emotional response. Some poems use free-flowing meter and \ncleverly crafted verse to bring a smile to the reader's face. But, very \noften such verses also embody simply universal truths which make us nod \nour heads in agreement. One such example is the poem, ``Trees,'' \nwritten by Joyce Kilmer.\n\n     I think that I shall never see\n     A poem lovely as a tree\n\n     A tree whose hungry mouth is prest\n     Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;\n\n     A tree that looks at God all day,\n     And lifts her leafy arms to pray;\n\n     A tree that may in Summer wear\n     A nest of robins in her hair;\n\n     Upon whose bosom snow has lain;\n     who intimately lives with rain.\n\n     Poems are made by fools like me,\n     But only God can make a tree.\n\n  Other poems delve into more complex and profound regions of the human \nexperience. These poems resonate deeply and touch the deep chords of \nour senses, echoing through our imaginations over and over again. \nThomas Moore's ``The Scent of the Roses,'' comments on love, death, and \npoignant memories.\n\n     Let fate do her worst, there are relics of joy,\n     Bright dreams of the past that she cannot destroy,\n     That come in the night-time of sorrow and care,\n     And bring back the features that joy used to wear.\n\n     Long, long be my heart with such memories filled,\n     Like the vase in which roses have once been distilled,\n     You may break, you may shatter the base if you will,\n     But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.\n\n  Nothing has the capacity of poetry to condense the pain and the \nbeauty of living and to reach the spiritual side of our natures. A \ntalented poet can elicit tears with only a few lines of verse, while \nthe novelist must reach for plot twists and character development to \ngarner a similar response. In no form of expression is the choice of \neach word so important. Listen to William Earnest Henley's ``Invictus'' \nand its description of the author's triumph over an infection that \nalmost cost him his only leg and threatened his life.\n\n     Out of the night that covers me\n     Black as the Pit from pole to pole,\n     I thank whatever gods may be\n     For my unconquerable soul.\n\n     In the fell clutch of circumstance\n     I have not winced nor cried aloud;\n     Under the bludgeonings of chance\n     My head is bloody, but unbowed.\n\n     Beyond this place of wrath and tears\n     Looms but the Horror of the Shade,\n     And Yet the menace of the years\n     Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.\n\n     It matters not how strait the gate,\n     How charged with punishments the scroll,\n     I am the master of my fate;\n     I am the captain of my soul.\n\n  In plain and simple words, William Earnest Henley draws from courage \nand the depths of his soul a supreme strength of human will, while in \nthe crucible of excruciating pain and under the shadow of death.\n  Poetry has always been a passion of mine, and a form of art which I \nhold dear to my heart. Consequently, I have sought to discipline my \nmind through the memorization of lines and verses of poetry. Many \npeople jog today in the exercising of their bodies. I do little of \nthat. But I mostly try to jog my mind, jog my memory, give it exercise, \nkeep it busy. I have memorized poem after poem, trying to capture the \nbeauty and wisdom of each one. Poetry has been my consummate companion \nover the years, and the verses that I have committed to memory are not \nonly a delight to my ears, but a balm to my soul as well. I try to be \nselective in the poems I memorize. It does take time. It takes effort. \nIt takes energy. It takes determination. It takes discipline to \nmemorize poetry. I frequently make use of these poems in my speeches, \ncarefully choosing a verse that captures the essence of my message, \nalways assured that its beauty will deliver in the keenest sense what I \ntry to convey. One such poem which has served me well is by Henry \nWadsworth Longfellow: ``The Building of The Ship.''\n\n     Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!\n     Sail on, O Union, strong and great!\n     Humanity with all its fears,\n     With all the hopes of future years,\n     Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\n     We know what Master laid thy keel,\n     What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,\n     Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,\n     What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\n     In what a forge and what a heat\n     Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!\n     Fear not each sudden sound and shock,\n     `Tis of the wave and not the rock;\n     `Tis but the flapping of the sail,\n     And not a rent made by the gale!\n     In spite of rock and tempest's roar,\n     In spite of false lights on the shore,\n     Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!\n     Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,\n     Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears.\n     Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,\n     Are all with thee, are all with thee!\n\n  Can one think of a more beautiful description of the promise of \nAmerica, and of what we as Senators have a duty to protect? We have \nnothing less than the hopes of mankind in our charge!\n  Poetry is man's attempt to reach up and out of his human skin, and \nconnect, just for a moment, with something perfect and eternal.\n  Edwin Markham's, ``A Workman To The Gods,'' could be seen as a \ntribute to the perfection sought by the poet.\n\n     Once Phidias stood, with hammer in his hand,\n     Carving Minerva from the breathing stone,\n     Tracing with love the winding of a hair,\n     A single hair upon her head,\n     Whereon a youth of Athens cried,\n     ``O Phidias, why do you dally on a hidden hair?\n     When she is lifted to the lofty front\n     Of the Parthenon, no human eye will see.''\n     And Phidias thundered on him:\n     ``Silence, slave: Men will not see, but the Immortals will!''\n\n  Like the carving of Minerva that Phidias so carefully chiseled into \nthe relief of the Parthenon, a well crafted poem lifts all of humanity \nand is an undeniable testimony to the immortal nature and exceptional \nbeauty of the human soul.\n  A poem is a symphony of words just waiting to be played, and, like \nany good piece of music, it only improves with the playing. My own \nrepertoire of poems has provided me with great spiritual enrichment and \nthe special comfort of finding meaning in my own experiences which I \nmight not otherwise have easily discerned. I applaud the efforts of the \nAcademy of American Poets and the programs that they have organized for \nthe sixth annual National\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\nPoetry Month. Through celebrations such as this, I hope that poetry \nwill come to be appreciated by a new generation of Americans so that \nthey might enjoy the deep spiritual enrichment that poetry has provided \nto so many. I should mention that great English novelist and poet, \nRudyard Kipling, who received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1907 \nand about whom I was reading when I was yet in high school in the early \n1930's\n  In his ``Recessional'' and similar pieces, Kipling addressed himself \nto his fellow countryman in times of crises. Today I shall only quote \nfrom Kipling's ``The Heritage'':\n\n     Our fathers in a wondrous age,\n     Ere yet the earth was small,\n     Ensured to us a heritage,\n     And doubted not at all,\n     That we, the children of their heart,\n     Which then did beat so high,\n     In later time should play like part\n     For our posterity\n\n     Then, fretful, murmur not they gave\n     So great a charge to keep,\n     Nor dream that awestruck time shall save\n     Their labor while we sleep.\n     Dear-bought and clear, a thousand year\n     Our father's title runs.\n     Make we likewise their sacrifice,\n     Defrauding not our sons.\n\n  I shall close with one of the poems by Henry Van Dyke, another poet \nand essayist popular in the closing days of the 19th century and the \nearly decades of the 20th century. This poem, ``America For Me,'' has \nbeen very popular with my own constituents for whom I have quoted it so \nmany, many times during my travels in the West Virginia hills.\n\n     Tis fine to see the Old World, and travel up and down\n     Among the famous palaces and cities of renown,\n     To admire the crumply castles and the statues of the kings,\n     But now I think I've had enough of antiquated things.\n\n     So it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n     My heart is turning home again, and there I long to be,\n     In the land of youth and freedom beyond the ocean bars,\n     Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n           stars.\n\n     Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air;\n     And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair;\n     And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study in \n           Rome\n     But when it comes to living there is just no place like home.\n\n     I like the German fir-woods, in green battalions drilled,\n     I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing fountains \n           filled;\n     But, oh, to take your hand, my dear, and ramble for a day\n     In the friendly western woodland where Nature has her way!\n\n     I know that Europe's wonderful, yet something seems to lack:\n     The Past is too much with her, and the people looking back.\n     But the glory of the Present is to make the Future free,\n     We love our land for what she is and what she is to be.\n\n     Oh, its's home again, and home again, America for me!\n     I want a ship that's westward bound to plough the rolling \n           sea,\n     To the blessed Land of Room Enough beyond the ocean bars,\n     Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n           stars.\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Kennedy was planning to speak. While we are \nwaiting for Senator Kennedy, I shall quote another poem:\n\n     I saw them tearing a building down,\n     A group of men in a busy town;\n     With a ``Ho, heave, ho'' and a lusty yell.\n     They swung a beam and the sidewall fell.\n\n     I said to the foreman, ``Are these men skilled\n     The type you'd hire if you had to build?''\n     He laughed, and then he said, ``No, indeed,\n     Just common labor is all I need;\n     I can easily wreck in a day or two,\n     That which takes builders years to do.''\n\n     I said to myself as I walked away,\n     ``Which of these roles am I trying to play?\n     Am I a builder who works with care,\n     Building my life by the rule and square?\n     Am I shaping my deeds by a well-laid plan,\n     Patiently building the best I can?\n     Or am I a fellow who walks the town,\n     Content with the labor of tearing down?''\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3973-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3973-S3974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM ENGLISH\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to honor a very \nspecial person. His name is Jim English. He is the Democratic staff \ndirector of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. In the course of \nthe 30 years he has worked in the Federal Government, 23 of which were \nright here in the Senate, Jim has served the Senate and the American \npeople with great distinction.\n  I have had the privilege of working with and getting to know Jim well \nas he carried out his responsibilities on one of the most important \ncommittees of the U.S. Senate, the Senate Appropriations Committee. \nVery few people I have encountered in my time in the Senate--be they \nmembers or staff--have made as big a difference in the lives of \neveryday working people. Throughout his Senate career, Jim has \nconstantly and consistently done what is best for the American public, \nregardless of their political persuasion and social status.\n  Although he worked directly for our colleague, Senator Byrd, Jim has \nalways had time to listen to and help deal with the needs and requests \nof any Senator who came to him seeking assistance. I have seen first \nhand his patience, his expertise, and his willingness to lend his \nconsiderable talents to help Member after Member do right by their \nconstituencies. Perhaps the greatest tribute one can pay to Jim's \nprofessionalism and expertise is that he has managed to attain the \nabsolute trust and confidence of Senator Byrd. Suffice it to say that \nsuch a feat is as major as it is rare.\n  During his time in the Senate, Jim has set a standard of conduct and \naccomplishment that will be exceedingly difficult to match. In my mind, \nJim has come to symbolize what we mean when we use the term public \nservant. I thank him for choosing to spend part of his life with us. We \nare all better off as a result.\n  I wish him well in whatever he chooses to pursue in the next stage of \nhis life and hope that others who follow in his footsteps remember the \nlofty standards he established.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I came to the floor and I heard Senator \nByrd and Senator Daschle speak about Jim English. The only thing I can \nsay about Jim English--not nearly as well as the two of them have \nspoken about him--is, No. 1, he has worked for and with the master, \nSenator Byrd. I think he knows almost as much as Senator Byrd does \nabout the appropriations process--maybe not quite as much. But I can \ntell Senator Byrd that I think Jim is a lot like Mike Epstein, my \nformer deputy. I came here and I knew so little. Maybe I now know a \nlittle more. I still have a lot to learn.\n  Jim is just so gracious and so willing, when people are just rushing \nand rushing, to take time and mentor you and to be your teacher. Jim \nworked for Senator Byrd, but in a way I believe he was there to work \nfor all of us. He certainly helped me a lot. At the beginning I \nhesitated to ask him. I knew of his expertise. When he was so gracious \nand so obliging and never made me feel as if I was a fool, then I \nbelieved he was a great teacher, willing to answer more questions. I \nhave asked him many, many questions. He has answered those questions. \nHe has helped me. He has helped a lot of Senators.\n  He truly represents the very best of public service. We are going to \nlose a great man. The country is going to lose a great man. There is no \nquestion about it.\n  I thank you, Jim.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am delighted to have the opportunity to \njoin my colleagues in this well-deserved tribute to Jim English, who is \nretiring from the Senate after 30 years of outstanding service. Jim has \ndone a brilliant job over the years as both a majority staff director \nand a minority staff director on the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nand we will all miss him very much.\n  Jim was talented and always helpful, and he was an enormous source of \nadvice and counsel for all of us on so many aspects of the \nappropriations process. Whatever the issue, and however complex the \nprocess, especially as the annual deadline neared, Jim was always a \nsteady hand and a remarkable source of inspiration and wise counsel.\n  Jim's name may not be well known to the citizens of our states, but \nover the years, the people of all 50 states have benefitted immensely \nfrom Jim's skillful work.\n\n[[Page S3974]]\n\n  It is a tribute as well to our distinguished colleague, Senator Byrd, \nthat he has had the remarkable service of such an outstanding member of \nhis staff over the years. We will all miss Jim very much. We thank him \nfor his extraordinary services to the Senate and the nation, and we \nextend our best wishes to Jim and his family for a long and happy \nretirement in the years ahead.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3974-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think it is essential that we go forward \nwith our education reform package. A lot of good work has been done in \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Senators on both \nsides of the aisle--Republican and Democrat--have worked hard. They \nreported out a bill overwhelmingly from the committee. A great deal of \nnegotiation has gone on since then between members of the committee, \nthe House and Senate, both parties, and the administration. A lot of \nthe reform language has been agreed to, with a lot of understanding \nabout the amount of funds that will be necessary to implement this \nlegislation.\n  But the important thing is that we go forward. I do not think you \ncould ever get every detail worked out and agreed to in advance. It is \ncalled the legislative process. You go to the Chamber, you have debate, \nyou have amendments, you have votes, you get a result, and you pass the \nbill.\n  Over the past couple years, I have quite often been criticized that I \nwould not let the Senate work its will. And now, for a week, the \nDemocrats have been blocking going to the bill, blocking the motion to \nproceed to the education bill.\n  This is the highest priority for this President, I believe for the \nCongress, both parties, and for the children.\n  I believe that if we go forward and have a good debate and have \namendments that we will get a result that will be good in improving the \nquality of education in America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 23, S. 1, the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, I say to the majority \nleader that where I would dissent from his remarks is that actually \nthere is a lot of negotiation going on. I think Senators on our side \nhave made some very basic points. One is, it is important what is in \nthe bill before it comes to the floor. Two, I think we are quite far \napart, although hopefully we at some time will be together about \nwhether or not, in fact, there will be the investment in children, to \nmake sure that the children and the teachers and the schools have the \ntools to succeed. This is really a choice between whether or not you \nwant to put so much into, I say to the majority leader, Robin-Hood-in-\nreverse tax cuts, with over 40 percent of the benefits going to the top \n1 percent of the population, or you are willing to make the investment \nin education and children.\n  I am so pleased the President has announced the goal of leaving no \nchild behind. But it cannot be done on a tin cup budget. We are looking \nat the whole issue of kids with special needs, the IDEA program, the \ntitle I program, afterschool programs, teacher recruitment, smaller \nclass size, and doing something about these dilapidated buildings.\n  So my hope is we will be able to resolve what I think are important \nquestions. But I think the Democrats are very committed to this \ndiscussion about education, very committed to doing it right. If, in \nfact, we are going to call this piece of legislation, as the President \nhas, the BEST, then we ought to be doing our best for children. I have \nno doubt that the people in Minnesota and the people across this \ncountry are looking for a real commitment of resources and the Federal \nGovernment living up to its obligation. We should be accountable. Just \nas we call for the teachers and the children to be accountable, we \nshould be accountable as well. That is what we are going to be strong \non.\n  I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. To clarify, does the Senator object to bringing up and \ngoing forward with the education bill?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I said I object to going forward with the education \nbill while we are in negotiation, while we do not know what is in the \nbill, while we do not have a commitment yet on the investment of \nresources and the Federal Government and the Senate and the House \nliving up to our commitment to children and education in the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I now withdraw the pending motion to proceed \nto S. 149.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The motion is \nwithdrawn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3974-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3974-S3975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   BETTER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I now move to proceed to S. 1, the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  I say to the Senator from Minnesota, there have been many days of \nnegotiation. A lot of progress has been made. Everybody acknowledges \nthat. But this bill should have been taken up in March. Now here we are \nalmost in May and we are still negotiating. If we are going to have \neverything wrapped up before it ever comes to the floor of the Senate, \nthere would not be much for the Senate to do around here.\n  Ordinarily, you get as much of an agreement as you can, get a bill \nreported out, and bring it to the floor. Negotiations are not going to \nend. They are going to continue. But on some of them we are not going \nto be able to reach an agreement.\n  I say to my colleague, in a State that is trying to improve \neducation, and, again, as a son of a schoolteacher, if just money would \nsolve the problem, we would have a higher quality of education in \nAmerica than we do today.\n  We have spent well over $130 billion over the past several years for \nthe title I program. I don't want to demean that program. It has done \nsome good and can do more good, if we give a little more flexibility at \nthe local level where the money can be used, where it may be used \ndifferently in Minnesota than it would be in Texas, give a little \nflexibility to make sure you are addressing the needs of those title I \nchildren in an appropriate way.\n  But just money is not enough. We have to have some real reforms. \nMoney is part of it. I admit that. The President has asked for more \nmoney for the reading program. The President has indicated he supports \nmore funding for title I and for IDEA and for bilingual education.\n  We are making progress. He is moving in the right direction. But I \ndon't know if we can ever come up with enough money in this area or a \nlot of the other areas to suit every Senator. They can always find some \nway--it is easy--to say ``give me more.''\n  One of the reasons we ought to have tax relief is to let the people \nkeep a little bit more of their money to help the children with their \nneeds. That is why I think we ought to double the child tax credit; let \nthe parents get more of the benefit of their money to help their \nchildren with their needs. Let them decide if they need a little \ntutoring, if they need a computer, whatever it may be.\n  One of the reasons parents can't always do what they need for their \nown children is that they don't get to keep enough of the money they \nearn. Why in the world would we take from the mouths of labor the bread \nthat they have earned? That is a quote from Thomas Jefferson--a great \nline.\n  At any rate, some Senators are adamant about objecting to proceeding \nto the education bill. I think that is a mistake. I think we ought to \nmove forward. I suspect that some of the amendments that would be \noffered--and maybe the Senator from Minnesota would support and I would \noppose--probably will pass. What are they worried about? We can bring \nthis to a satisfactory conclusion that would be\n\n[[Page S3975]]\n\ngood for everybody. This is a win-win-win opportunity. Let's not blow \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3975-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I want to make a statement on a recent \ntrip I have made to the Mideast. I want to alert my colleagues to the \nfact that beyond what is available in the news media, the situation in \nthe Mideast is so serious it is really hard to describe. The concern I \nhave is that the violence is likely to move beyond the borders of \nIsrael where Hamas and Islamic Jihad may be targeting other \ninstallations, perhaps even U.S. installations.\n  I had an opportunity to talk with the Israeli leaders, including \nPrime Minister Sharon, who has the understandable position that he is \nnot going to negotiate for peace until the violence has ended.\n  I had an opportunity to talk with Palestinian Authority Chairman \nYasser Arafat, who makes representations which simply are not true. \nArafat makes the contention that he has issued an unequivocal edict for \nthe Palestinians to cease the violence, citing as an example a speech \nhe made at the Arab summit. When that speech is examined, it is so \nconditional as to be meaningless.\n  We had an opportunity to travel as well to Damascus where \nconversations were held with Foreign Minister al-Shara.\n  The situation between Israel and Syria is very tense. Israel \nretaliated against a Syrian radar installation because of the Hezbollah \nattacks against Israel from southern Lebanon Hezbollah being backed by \nIran with the concurrence of Syria.\n  The trip I made occurred during the past Easter recess, and I will \ndescribe it in some detail in the course of this floor statement.\n  Upon coming back to the United States, I have written to the \nPresident urging him to appoint a special representative in the \nMideast, just as that had been the practice going back to the days when \nHenry Kissinger shuttled for President Nixon, special envoys being \nappointed by President Jimmy Carter, President Ronald Reagan, President \nGeorge H. W. Bush, and President Bill Clinton.\n  Mr. President, from April 7 to April 21, we traveled from New York \nCity to London, Florence, Ashkelon, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Cairo, \nDamascus, Beruit, Souda Bay, Crete, and Rome en route to Philadelphia.\n  In London, we met at the British Ministry of Defense with Ian Lee, \nthe Director of the NATO and European Security Policy Department, and \nDeputy Director, A. D. Richards. The meeting touched on a range of \nissues. Among those were President Bush's position on missile defense, \nthe British outreach to rogue nations, the viability of NATO absent a \nSoviet threat, plans for the proposed European defense force, and the \nBritish thoughts on the War Crimes Tribunal and the International \nCourt.\n  Mr. Lee stated that the British reaction to President Bush's position \non Missile Defense and its effect on the ABM Treaty was one of general \nsupport. They have an appreciation for the risks and agree with the \nUnited States on the threats. However, they are waiting to see what the \nactual proposal would be.\n  Mr. Lee stated that the United Kingdom was at a different stage than \nthe United States in regards to its relation with several rogue \nnations. Its mission in Iran is moving toward having an ambassador, \nwhile it continues an effort to establish diplomatic ties to Libya.\n  I next met with Mr. Emry Jones Parry, the Political Director and \nDeputy Undersecretary of State for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. \nAlso attending was Mr. Jonathan Darby, the U.S. Desk Officer, Foreign \nand Commonwealth Office, and Mr. Mort Dworken, the Charge d' Affairs at \nthe American Embassy.\n  When questioned about the proposed European Defense Force, Mr. Parry \noffered insight as to why Mr. Blair, who is a strong supporter of NATO, \nhad come out in favor of an European defense force. According to Mr. \nParry, Mr. Blair apparently believes that by putting a European flag on \nthe force structure, European nations will be more likely to put money \ninto it as well as spend the money on what they should in a NATO \ncontext.\n  Mr. Parry noted the idea of a European defense force has been around \nsince 1952. He said it is not designed to remove the U.S. from the \ntheater, but make it more likely to have the U.S. there because the \nEuropeans would be pulling more of their own weight.\n  On the issue of the International Criminal Court, Mr. Parry stated \nthat the U.K. is generally in favor of it. It believes there is a need \nfor a forum to hold those accountable who would otherwise escape \njustice because of a lack of interest in their home jurisdiction. He \nwas surprised when I told him that War Crimes Tribunal Prosecutor Carla \nDel Ponte was thinking of indicting General Wesley Clarke and other \nNATO officers for targeting civilians and for recklessly endangering \nthem in targeting military objectives. Mr. Parry said it was his \nunderstanding that that British troops could not come under indictment \nbecause of provisions that the United Kingdom would take care of its \nown.\n  When I asked why we are putting so much into NATO in light of the \nloss of the Soviet threat, Mr. Parry replied that NATO's actions in \nKosovo show that it is still necessary.\n  Our conversation then turned to the U.K.'s actions with Iran and \nIraq. Mr. Parry noted that Britain was looking to keep a relationship \nopen with the nations, and then if firm action was later required, the \nrelationship could be adjusted accordingly.\n  I then asked Mr. Parry if the Europeans might eventually be on board \nthe idea of missile defense. He responded that the assumption in \nBritain was the United States would go ahead and deploy a missile \ndefense system, if it would work. The British position is that they \nwill do what is necessary to ensure its success, but would like it to \nbe ``arranged in such a manner as to generate greater solidarity on the \nissue.''\n  We then had substantive discussions in a working tea with the \nBaroness Scotland of Asthal QC, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of \nState for Foreign & Commonwealth Affairs with ministerial duties \nincluding North America. Over tea at the House of Lords, we discussed \nthe American/British relationship. She also described her background \nand how she came to be in the House of Lords.\n\n[[Page S3976]]\n\n  After having tea in the House of Lords, we then walked across \nParliament to the House of Commons Central Lobby, where I was met by \nthe Rt. Hon. Geoffrey Johnson Smith, MP, with whom I had a wide ranging \ndiscussion of issues. Smith and I had debated in November 1949 when he \nrepresented Oxford and I was on the Penn team.\n  Later that same day, we met with the country team headed by Mort \nDworken, Charge d' Affairs, who briefed us on the latest information \nregarding foot and mouth disease, fallout from the Administration's \nposition on the Kyoto Accords, European security policy and the status \nof US/British relations.\n  In attendance were Mort Dworken, Charge d' Affairs; Tom Hamby, \nForeign Agriculture Minister-Counselor with the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture; Ed Kaska, Economic Affairs Officer; Captain Stu Barnett, \nUSN, Defense Attache; and Sonya Tsiros, Political Officer.\n  We initially asked about the current status of the foot and mouth \nepidemic and were told the disease was still not under control. The \nBritish Government was undertaking a massive control program to try and \nisolate the virus. This included the slaughter of over 1 million head \nof livestock with another half million yet to be killed. In addition, \nthe government was restricting movement in the countryside including \nthe closure of such historic sites as Stonehenge.\n\n  Tom Hamby, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, noted that the \nU.S. currently has sixty veterinarians in the country both to help as \nwell as become educated on successful ways to combat the disease. He \ndescribed the effort much like a military campaign so that if the virus \ngets to the U.S., we will have people trained and on the ground to \nfight it.\n  We inquired into the political and economic effect of the disease and \nfound that both had been affected. Prime Minister Blair postponed the \nnational elections until June 27th due to the severity of the disease. \nEconomically, the disease had yet to show its full weight. Although the \nU.K has less than 2% of its Gross Domestic Product in agriculture, the \nclosure of the English countryside had a clear economic affect in \nregards to tourism. At the time, there was no definitive number on the \neconomic impact.\n  Early the next morning, we traveled to Florence, Italy where our \nfirst meeting was with a trio of lawyers with the famed Ferragamo \nfamily businesses to discuss trademark protection. During the meeting, \nwe were told that the majority of Ferragamo products which are \nillegally copied originate in Asia. We asked how counterfeiting was \ndetected, and whether there were any trouble in distinguishing the \nquality between counterfeit and non-counterfeit goods. The answer was \nyes, there often is a difference in the quality of the leather and \naccessories. But that is not always the case. Now counterfeits can \noften be of a very good quality, and be very difficult to \ndifferentiate.\n  We were surprised that the Italian government doesn't do more to stop \nthis form of theft, especially since so many of the top designers are \nfrom Italy, and asked how much litigation they are involved in to \nprotect the Ferragamo name. Most litigation, it turns out, is of a \ncivil nature and is injunctive in nature. Even though most actions are \ncivil, it is very difficult to get damages based upon the design of \nItalian law.\n  As for criminal actions, it is recognized as a form of larceny, but \nthe criminal courts consider it to be of nominal value and not as \nimportant as other crimes. We were told that in one case often cited by \nthe courts, a customer went to buy a ``Ferragamo'' purse and paid a low \nprice for it. The court reasoned that since the price was so low, the \npurchaser had to know it wasn't a real Ferragamo purse and therefore, \nno fraud occurred. I commented that by prosecuting a few white-collar \ncrimes, a real deterrent effect could be achieved.\n  Later that day, we discussed a wide range of US/Italian/European \nissues over lunch with Consul General Hilarion Martinez at his home \nabove the American Consulate. During the course of our discussion, he \nstated that although American students widely participate in education \nprograms in Florence and all throughout Italy, it was difficult to get \nItalian students to come to the U.S. because Italian Universities often \ndo not recognize the credit hours bestowed by American Universities, \nabsent a one on one agreement between the institutions.\n  Early the next day, we set out to visit the Georgetown campus in the \nhills above Florence. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Ms. Heidi \nFlores, the Director of the Georgetown program. The campus is located \non a beautiful villa overlooking the whole of Florence, and was \nestablished in 1981 when the facility was donated to the university. It \nhas 27 students currently enrolled and 6 faculty. Other similar \nprograms in the area include New York University, Syracuse, Smith \nCollege, California State, Florida State, Stanford, and the \nUniversities of Michigan and Wisconsin.\n  We asked them who it was that we could talk to about producing a \nreciprocal agreement between the U.S. and Italy which would seek to \nrecognize credits equally. The Minister of Universities was identified \nas the appropriate individual. He could give substantial background \ninformation regarding the problem.\n  During my visit at the Georgetown campus, we met Cuffe Owens a \nstudent and a nephew of my colleague Senator Joe Biden.\n  After returning to the city, we met with Mr. Patrick McCormick, the \nDirector of Communications for the UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre on \nPiazza SS. Annunziata. Mr. McCormick gave me a brief on the activities \nof his center which was founded in 1988 ``to strengthen the research \ncapability of the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, and to \nsupport its advocacy for children worldwide.'' We touched on several \nareas including an on-going study in West Africa on trafficking in \nchildren, religious persecution in the Sudan and child protection. His \nfirst hand accounts of children as young as five being used as soldiers \nand camp slaves in Sierra Leon were quite troubling. His organization \ncontinues to push for the education of young children which they see \n``as central to poor countries economic well-being.''\n  After leaving UNICEF's Research Center, we participated in a press \nconference at the Florence City Hall, Palazzo Vecchio regarding a joint \neffort between Italian Police and Microsoft in Livorno, Italy in which \na large counterfeiting operation was uncovered. Attending were \nrepresentatives of Microsoft, and local government officials.\n  At the news conference, the Microsoft representatives stated that \ncounterfeiting was most prevalent in Tuscany so they had started a law \nenforcement action in Florence. They said that the reproduction or \ncloning was so good that it took Microsoft experts some 15 minutes to \ntell the difference between a counterfeit product and a genuine \nproduct. They also stated that they had located in the past year in \nEurope some 25 million Microsoft counterfeit products on the market at \na loss of 1.7 billion dollars.\n\n  According to Microsoft, the national (Italy) rate for illegal/\ncounterfeit Microsoft sales was in the 31-37 percent category. In \nBrescia, the illegal reproduction was 65 percent before passage of the \ncopyright law in 1999, and have since been reduced to 29 percent. The \nlaw provides for fines and a jail sentence and also has provisions for \nsearch and entry. There have been some efforts to apply the copyright \ninfringements to internet apparently to online sales.\n  We had an opportunity to discuss with the attorneys whether there had \nbeen any criminal prosecutions brought under the new law. They \nresponded with a lengthy description of the process. Apparently, there \nhad been no criminal prosecutions. We then asked if there had been a \nuse of the search and entry law, and he said that they had one such \ncase where counterfeit products had been transported from Singapore to \nHolland to Milan. The Microsoft experts aided the police in the search \nand entry, helping to identify counterfeit products.\n  In Israel, we met with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, former Prime \nMinister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. Our first \nmeeting was with Mr. Peres whom I first met in Tel Aviv in 1980 and \nhave seen him on many occasions since, both in the United States and in \nIsrael.\n\n[[Page S3977]]\n\n  Minister Peres was in good spirits, displayed his great sense of \nhumor, proceeded to give a comprehensive discourse on the state of \naffairs in the Mid-East, and to respond to our questions. Minister \nPeres started our conversation by saying that terrorism was as un-\nAmerican as communism used to be. The topic of conversation on our \nminds was the escalating violence on the border with Gaza, and the \nnorthern border with Lebanon. Peres was firm in his conviction that \nwhen the time to negotiate comes, everything must be on the table, no \nimpositions on the Israelis, and no impositions on the Palestinians.\n  Peres then asked me to explain to Palestinian Authority Chairman \nArafat whom I was scheduled to meet later in the trip, that some of \nSharon's words are very tough, but that the Israelis have several \nguiding principles. They will respect signed agreements as long as both \nsides respect them. Israel, he said, is ready to make painful \ncompromises for peace, including reemployment in the territories. He \nalso added that the final proposal offered under former President \nClinton is dead since he left office. He stated that he thought it was \na big mistake on Arafat's part not to accept that deal.\n  Peres stated that it is currently very hard to negotiate because of \nall the anger. Arafat's delivering of ``impossible\" speeches only makes \nit more difficult as well. His view is that the Palestinians think \nIsraelis are militarily harsh in the territories, and that in order to \nmove forward, a different climate must be created there. The best thing \nthat could happen is to change the conditions there. The answer for the \nPalestinians is not the battlefield, but the bargaining table-as it has \nhistorically been.\n  I asked Minister Peres whether Arafat could control terrorism. He \nreplied he could do a lot by making a strong and unambiguous \ndeclaration against it, and prevent the police force participation in \nthe violence. Minister Peres stated that the current situation was not \none of absolutes, except that the Israelis seek absolute effort. The \nfirst expression of that effort is an unambiguous, unconditional and \nstrong statement rejecting violence delivered in Arabic.\n  Following our meeting with Foreign Minister Peres, we walked a block \nto a meeting with former Prime Minister Ehud Barak. I had first met the \nformer Prime Minister when he was just out of the army, and starting to \nbecome active in labor politics, perhaps five or six years ago. I have \nmet him on several occasions subsequently, including his visit to the \nWhite House in July 2000 where President and Mrs. Clinton hosted a \nlarge dinner in his office in his honor, in a big tent on the South \nLawn.\n  Mr. Barak was also in good spirits considering the strenuous \ncampaign, his recent election defeat, and the difficult negotiations \nand tenure as Prime Minister. The former Prime Minister spoke at length \nabout his extensive three-way discussions involving President Clinton, \nArafat and himself. He spoke about, as he put it, his ``contemplation'' \nas to what might have been encompassed in a settlement, but emphasized \nthat none of the discussions about Jerusalem or the concessions on land \nwere final offers until the entire deal was complete.\n  I told him that I had met in Washington several weeks ago with the \nEgyptian Foreign Minister who said he knew I had a trip planned to the \nMid-East and urged me to meet with Arafat. I told him I would consider \nit. When President Mubarak was in Washington in early April, he also \nurged me to meet with Arafat and I agreed to do so providing the \nmeeting took place in Cairo. In my discussions with President Mubarak, \nI had anticipated his being present during my meeting with Arafat. As \nit worked out, Mubarak was not in Cairo for my scheduled meeting with \nArafat. His deputy Osama El-Baz joined me in the meeting.\n  The former Prime Minister stated that he thought it would be very \nuseful for me to meet with Arafat, so Arafat would understand the \nthinking of a member of the Senate. I asked Mr. Barak about the \nprospects for the peace process from this point forward and he said he \nthought it would be very difficult for the immediate future. He \nemphasized that he had great admiration, respect and friendship for \nPrime Minister Sharon whom he has known for decades, and emphasized he \nwould do anything in his power to help the new Prime Minister.\n\n  Mr. Barak asked me about Israel's standing in the United States. I \nreplied that U.S. Congressional support for Israel was continuing, and \nI thought that the new Bush Administration would similarly be very \nfavorably disposed. We talked about the evenly divided Senate, and he \nwas very interested to know about our recent budget battle and the \nsignificant role played by Vice President Cheney. He asked about the \neconomy which we then discussed at some length.\n  Upon leaving my discussion with former Prime Minister Barak, I met \nwith Ambassador Uri Lubrani, the Lebanon Coordinator for the government \nof Israel at the Ministry of Defense Headquarters. Joining us was the \nformer Foreign Minister to Iran, Zidma Divon, Deputy Director General \nof the Foreign Ministry, and John Scott, Counselor for Political \nAffairs at the American Embassy. They expressed real concern with \nIran's backing of the Hezbollah movement in South Lebanon. During the \ncourse of our discussion about Iran, Ambassador Lubrani showed me a \nquote from a report of a British Ambassador to Tehran in the sixties, \nat the end of his tour of duty: ``The Iranians are people who say the \nopposite of what they think and do the opposite of what they say. That \ndoes not necessarily mean that what they do does not confirm to what \nthey think.''\n  After our meeting with Ambassador Lubrani, we drove from Tel Aviv to \nJerusalem where we met the next morning with Prime Minister Ariel \nSharon. Also in attendance was Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, the Minister of \nDefense, and Daniel Ayalon, the Foreign Policy Advisor to the Prime \nMinister.\n  Our meeting was conducted with a backdrop of an escalating conflict. \nDuring the previous evening, Israeli planes had bombed a Syrian radar \ninstallation in Lebanon in retaliation for the actions of Hezbollah in \nsouth Lebanon. I started my conversation with the Prime Minister by \nnoting that the Egyptian Foreign Minister had asked me to talk to \nChairman Arafat. Prime Minister Sharon wasted no time in delivering his \nmessage. The policy of the Israeli government would be to draw a \ndistinction between the civilian population and terrorists, supporters \nof terrorists and instigators. He stated that he plans to ease the \nconditions in the territories. And at the time, stated he was ready to \nshow flexibility except in one area, under no circumstances will he be \nflexible with the security of the Israeli citizens.\n  Although Sharon did express some willingness to negotiate, it was \nclear that in his eyes the plan pushed by President Clinton in his \nwaning days in office, is dead. ``Peace is more painful than war,'' he \nsaid, ``because you have to make concessions for peace.'' ``I have a \ntrue desire to move the process forward, not the process that has \nalready failed.'' No negotiations would occur, Sharon assured me, under \nthe ``threats of terror.'' The violence must stop. The Prime Minister \nnoted the violence occurring in Gaza, and stated that the violence \ncould not continue. The Israelis wouldn't accept it. ``We are very much \ninterested in stability in the Middle East, but we are not going to pay \nfor it. We have the natural right to exist and defend ourselves.''\n  I told Sharon that we were planning on driving from Damascus to \nBeruit as part of our trip. He said the current situation that exists \nin south Lebanon, is not what was contemplated by the withdrawal \nagreement. Hezbollah wasn't supposed to occupy the positions they \ncurrently hold.\n  Sharon then stated that Iranian influence continued to grow in the \narea, with the approval of Syria. ``Iran is building an independent \ncenter of international terror, which could not have been done without \nthe support of Syria. Syria could have stopped them.''\n  Sharon then noted that the actions of the previous evening in bombing \nthe Syrian facility was a warning to Syria. He wanted to send a signal \nthat Israel would not accept the possibility of Israeli soldiers being \nkilled in Israel. Negotiations do not currently exist with Syria. First \nmust come the Palestinian question. ``Israel can't negotiate on two \nfronts when peace requires painful concessions.''\n  Out talk concluded with Prime Minister Sharon noting that the \nimmediate threat to stability in the region\n\n[[Page S3978]]\n\nremained Tehran, and that only the United States could lead the anti-\nterror struggle in the free world.\n  After our meeting with Sharon, we flew to Cairo, Egypt and at \napproximately 6 p.m., had a meeting with Dr. Osama el-Baz, advisor to \nPresident Mubarak. Dr. el-Baz and I talked at some length about the \ncurrent situation in the Middle-East, the U.S. role, and about my \nmeeting with Chairman Arafat later that evening. During that meeting, \nsome issues arose as to U.S. intelligence questions, so I called CIA \nDirector George Tenant in Washington to get the current status report.\n  Dr. el-Baz arranged a boat ride and dinner for us on the Nile river \nwhere we met with a variety of Cairo's leading citizens including \njournalists, professionals, businessmen and industrialists. I was \nquestioned about why the U.S. continued to support Israel when Israel \nhas responded with disproportionate force to the actions of the \nPalestinians. I responded that the U.S. was trying to carry out the \nCamp David Accords in which their great President Anwar Sadat had \ninvested so much time and effort, and that Israel had agreed to discuss \npeace once the violence had stopped.\n\n  Shortly before 10:30 p.m., we arrived at Chairman Arafat's guest \nhouse. After meeting quite a number of his colleagues Dr. el-Baz, \nChairman Arafat and Arafat's chief deputy, Saeb Erakat and I went \nupstairs to a private room so we could have, as Osama el-Baz said, a \ntete-e'-tete. Arafat and Erakat were visibly disturbed about the status \nof the violence between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. They were \nespecially distressed because, as they told us immediately upon our \narrival, Israel was taking forceful military action against Gaza as we \nspoke.\n  During the course of our discussion which lasted more than an hour, \nwe were interrupted six or eight times by Arafat's men who came in and \nhanded Arafat written messages. Arafat spoke in Arabic which was \ninterpreted by Erakat on detailing the action being taken by Israeli \nmilitary with helicopters and missiles.\n  Arafat and Erakat described the situation as very serious recounting \nthe number of Arabs who had been killed and wounded and then reciting \nthe number of Israeli casualties which showed a much larger number of \nArab casualties. Erakat was especially feverent in pleading for some \nhelp as to a way to break the impasse.\n  After a considerable discussion, I said that I would venture a \npossible approach which was not a recommendation because I thought that \nwould not be appropriate. I then said that one approach might be for \nArafat to make a public statement that the cycle of violence was \nuntenable, and that while he would much prefer to have a joint \nstatement made by Sharon and himself with a schedule on a comprehensive \napproach, he would make a unilateral statement directing all \nPalestinians to stop any acts of violence. I said to Arafat that the \ninstruction to stop any acts of violence would be in accordance with \nhis famous letter of September 9, 1993 which was the inducement for \nPrime Minister Rabin and Peres to meet with Arafat at the White House \non September 13, 1993. In that letter Arafat renounced the use of \nviolence and said he would take disciplinary action against any of his \npeople who violated his direction.\n  Arafat then said that he had said all the things that I had \nmentioned. Erakat then said that not only had Arafat made these \nstatements in a speech at the Arab summit, but that Shimon Peres had \nasked Arafat to make these statements from his own lips, and that \nArafat had done so.\n  Dr. Osama el-Baz and I both stated that we had not heard any such \nstatement. If any such statement was ever made, it was doubtless in a \nlong speech and was followed or preceded by many conditions.\n  I told Arafat that there was considerable anti-Palestinian Authority \nsentiment in the Congress with some 87 members of the Senate and over \n200 members of the House writing a letter urging action that the \nPalestinian Authority be ousted from its Washington office.\n  At one point I asked Arafat why he had not accepted the very generous \noffer from Barak on territorial concessions on the West Bank and \nsignificant concessions on Jerusalem. Arafat replied that he had \naccepted that offer on a number of occasions including his meeting with \nPresident Clinton at the White House. Again, Arafat's statement did not \ncomport with the facts since he had imposed so many conditions.\n  I said that my staff and I had met with Prime Minister Sharon earlier \nthat day and that Sharon had said, among other things, that peace was \nmore painful than war because in peace you had to make concessions. I \nthought from that, it was apparent that Sharon was interested in peace \ntalks.\n  Erakat commented that he had expected a call from an Israeli contact. \nI told Erakat that I would call the contact which I did the next day. \nWhen I telephoned Erakat later in the day, he confirmed that the \nIsraeli contact had called him.\n  I further told Arafat that Sharon had told me earlier in the day that \nhe was prepared to allow Palestinians to come into Israel for work \nproviding there was no security risks. Sharon had specified that he was \nnot doing this in exchange for anything from the Palestinian Authority \nbecause he did not want it viewed that Israel was making concession or \nbuying peace in any way.\n  I asked Arafat if there was any substance to the contention that the \nPalestinians had been firing out of Gaza into Israel. Arafat replied \nthat he did have a report of three such mortar shots; but that as soon \nas Arafat found out about it, he had ordered it stopped with the people \ndoing the shooting to be arrested. In the course of the next several \ndays there was repeated mortar shelling into Israel by Palestinians. \nContrary to Arafat's assertions, our intelligence sources advised he \nhad authorized the shelling.\n  From Cairo, we departed for Beirut by way of Damascus. Climbing up \nthe mountains on the way to Beirut, we passed the location of the \nSyrian Radar site that Israeli forces destroyed in a raid just a few \ndays earlier. The U.S. Embassy compound in Beirut is the most heavily \nfortified embassy in the world. Standing in the middle of the compound, \nas a stark reminder, are the remains of the prior Embassy that was \ndestroyed by a bomb.\n  While remaining in the compound overnight, we received an in depth \nbriefing on the current situation in Beirut and Lebanon, with insight \nprovided by Ambassador David Satterfield, and his Deputy Chief of \nMission David Hale. As Ambassador Satterfield pointed out, Lebanon was \nvery badly divided because of its charter (its form of a constitution) \nwhich divided authority between three Lebanese factions. He commented \nabout how Beirut had the potential to regain its status as ``Paris of \nthe Mid-East,'' but that there would have to be major economic reforms. \nHe also commented that the Prime Minister Rafik Hariri had been \ndiscussing with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund about \nways to get financing which could lead to a revitalization of Beirut. \nSatterfield also noted that Hezbollah was a very strong force in \nSouthern Lebanon, with only a few hundred fighters.\n\n  Beirut still shows the scars of its savage civil war with its once \nbeautiful hotels reduced to shells. There is a rebuilding effort, \nhowever, and its central business district has been rebuilt to some \nextent.\n  We drove back from Beirut to Damascus. Ambassador Ryan Crocker hosted \na dinner for visiting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern \nAffairs Edward Walker and our party. We had a wide ranging conversation \nabout the current state of affairs in the Mid-East. I reported on our \ntrip to Beirut, which Ambassador Ryan noted with some interest as he \nwas the Ambassador to Beirut when our embassy was last bombed.\n  The next morning we met with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shara \nand Deputy Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'allim. At the start of our \nmeeting we discussed my last visit to Syria, which was for President \nAssad's funeral. I told FM al-Shara that my fellow Senators were very \ninterested in Syria, and then mentioned that I had just been to see \nChairman Arafat in Egypt. I discussed my recent travels in the area, \nand related that everyone would like the violence to stop. The Foreign \nMinister asked me what Israel was seeking, and I told him of my \ndiscussions with Prime Minister Sharon,\n\n[[Page S3979]]\n\nwho stated that he is determined to avoid Israeli loss of life and will \nact accordingly. I also told him that the Israelis intended to ease up \non the borders as long as there were no threats to security; the \nIsraeli government position was that all the violence must stop prior \nto any talks taking place. I then encouraged him to talk to the \nIsraelis.\n  Foreign Minister Shara said I had persuaded Syria, or perhaps, more \naccurately been a factor, to enter into negotiations with Israel in my \nnumerous discussions with former President Hafaz El-Assad during the \n1980's and 1990's. I had first visited Damascus in 1984 and had met \nwith President Assad almost every year from 1988 to 1998. Minister \nShara stated that only after beginning discussions with the Israelis \ndid it become apparent that they didn't want peace. I reminded him that \nboth sides came very close on the Golan and that a dialogue must \ncontinue.\n  Our attention then turned to Iraq, China and recent American politics \nas well as efforts to exchange Parliamentarians with Iran.\n  We left Damascus and flew into Souda Bay, Crete, which houses the \nU.S. Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, and Fleet Air Reconnaissance \nSquadron Two, VQ-2, a unit responsible for reconnaissance missions for \nthe Mediterranean, and which is the counterpart to the unit that was \ninvolved in the recent mishap with a Chinese pilot in international \nwaters off the coast of China.\n  I was met by Captain Steve Hoefel, the Base Commanding Officer and \nwas set up in quarters for the night. That night, Rear Admiral Steve \nTomaszeski, the Commander of the Mediterranean Air Fleet, flew in for a \nbrief to be held the next morning.\n  On Friday, April 20, we received a classified brief on the mission of \nthe base and its reconnaissance aircraft. The base's main \nresponsibility is to support and resupply the forward-deployed Navy and \nMarine Corps forces. It has the largest fuel storage facility, largest \nammo storage facility and the deepest port in the Mediterranean, and is \nstrategically located near the Mid-East.\n  We toured the base, and the port facility located nearby. A large \namount of construction was occurring on the dock with the installation \nof new facilities designed to give sailors and Marines all the \namenities of home when they dock. I was pleased to find two \nPennsylvanians among the many Navy Construction Battalion sailors \nworking on the structures.\n  We also had the opportunity to tour an EP-3 aircraft similar to that \nwhich remains in China, and were briefed on the various station's \nresponsibilities during flight operations, as well as talk to several \nof the crew members. We also had the opportunity to see an E3 AWACS on \nthe runway.\n  From Crete we flew to Rome where we received a brief by the Charge \nd'Affairs William Pope, and Margaret Dean, Minister-Counselor for \nEconomic Affairs. We discussed the effect of the European Union on \nNATO, reviewed the current areas of work for the embassy, and the \neffect of the strong U.S. dollar on tourism. In addition, I briefed \nthem on parts of my visit to Florence including our meeting with the \nattorneys for Ferragamo, and our visit to the Georgetown campus.\n  Margaret Dean was familiar with the case that the Ferragamo attorneys \nhad told us about in which a person purchased counterfeit goods at such \na low price that the judiciary reasoned the purchaser could not have \nbelieved the goods to be authentic, and therefore found no fraud in the \nsale. She stated that often, because of that case, sellers of \ncounterfeit goods often go so far to label the goods as ``fake'' to \navoid prosecution.\n  The Embassy reported that it doesn't have any one overriding area \nthat it concentrates on. It has several areas of concentration which \ninclude tourism, trade disputes, military issues, and the Mid-East \nsituation. Charge d'Affairs Pope reported that Italy had changed a lot \nand had become a fairly different place in the last decade. He reported \na recent high-tech emphasis that has helped propel the country's \neconomy to the 6th largest in the world. The country has also \nbenefitted from the increase in tourism generated by the strong \nAmerican dollar.\n  On April 21, we flew from Rome to Philadelphia.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3979-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN APPRECIATION OF ALYCE AND JACK BERGGREN\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity today to \nhonor two very special people from my hometown of Aberdeen, SD. Alyce \nand Jack Berggren have contributed tirelessly to the arts of South \nDakota, and I am blessed to call Alyce and Jack my long-time friends.\n  Alyce Bedrosian grew up in Chicago in an Armenian family. After \nearning a masters degree in piano from Northwestern University, she was \nhired by Northern State Teachers College in 1947. Though she carried a \nreturn train ticket from her concerned father, Alyce decided to remain \nin South Dakota. She never used the ticket.\n  Jack Berggren's boyhood was spent a world away in Scottsbluff, a \nsmall town in western Nebraska. He studied voice at Hastings College in \nHastings, NE, and came to Northern State University in Aberdeen in \n1949. There, he met Alyce, and they began performing together. In \nJack's own words, he married his ``accompanist'' in 1950.\n  For almost half a century, the Berggrens have touched the lives of \ncountless NSU students and music lovers of the northern plains. ``Dr. \nB.,'' as his students affectionately call him, taught voice, directed \nchoirs and served as the NSU Dean of Fine Arts. His annual Messiah \nperformances rekindle fond memories among many Aberdonians. Alyce \ncontinues to define excellence in piano performance and teaching, \nregularly accompanying students to this day.\n  Over two decades ago, friends, faculty, alumni and students surprised \nthe Berggrens with a musical thank you. In 1978, to honor both Jack and \nAlyce, their community sponsored ``The Gala Concert for the benefit of \nthe Northern State College Music Department.'' In addition to NSU music \nstudents and faculty, the concert included the Aberdeen Barbershop \nChorus and the Elks Chorus.\n  Gala II was held in 1989, and this year, May 5, marks the third Gala \nconcert. I am pleased to know that the Johnson Fine Arts Center will \nonce again display the talents of those touched by the Berggrens. I \nonly regret that I cannot be there in person to enjoy the event and the \ncompany of Jack and Alyce. Instead, I hope this statement will serve as \nmy small contribution and a symbol of immense gratitude to Jack and \nAlyce for their contributions to the musical arts in South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3979-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3979-S3980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KATHRYN COLE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my gratitude to a very special person in South Dakota who has \ndedicated many years to the Northern Black Hills' Retired Seniors \nVolunteer Program.\n  Today, the directors and volunteers of this RSVP program will gather \nat their annual recognition banquet to celebrate the dedication and \nhard work of Kathryn Cole, who is retiring from this RSVP community \nafter 21 years of service. In fact, for 20 of those years, Kathryn \nserved as the director of this important program.\n  The generous gift of Kathryn Cole's time and experience has \nbenefitted those around her in countless ways, and I truly applaud her \n``can-do'' spirit, her determination, and her dedication to the \nbetterment of the communities of the Northern Black Hills area. From \nSpearfish to Belle Fouche to Lead, Kathryn has sent hundreds of \nvolunteers to serve and support local communities. With her warm \nspirit, she has always made a special effort to ensure that volunteers \nhave the opportunity to participate in the activities that both \ninterest and inspire them. From tutoring at local schools to delivering \nMeals on Wheels to offering services to the High Plains Heritage Museum \nand the Mathews Opera House, Kathryn has made an immeasurable \ncontribution to the Northern Black Hills.\n  There is a special feeling of satisfaction that comes only from \nvolunteering. Through her tremendous leadership, Kathryn Cole has \nhelped seniors experience that satisfaction with service to their \ncommunities. I know my\n\n[[Page S3980]]\n\ncolleagues will join me in honoring her dedication to improving the \nquality of life for area residents. We all owe an enormous debt of \ngratitude to Kathryn for such an invaluable contribution to the \nNorthern Black Hills and the entire State of South Dakota.

Mr. President, today I want to take a moment to share \nsome thoughts on the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \nRestoration Act. I believe that this act is important and can do \npositive things in communities across America.\n  Laws related to brownfields were the result of a much broader Act, \nwhich we commonly refer to as Superfund. Superfund was intended to \nbring about the clean up of some of the most contaminated sites in our \nnation. As Superfund has been implemented in our society we have found \nthat it is often too cumbersome to bring about clean up and restoration \nof many brownfield sites. When we talk about brownfields we are not \ntalking about the most contaminated sites in our communities, but about \nsites that are less contaminated and could realistically be bought, \ncleaned up, and developed thus bringing economic and other benefits to \nAmerican citizens. Therefore, I share the thoughts of many of my \ncolleagues and support removing the barriers to brownfields \nredevelopment.\n  When the average person wishes to invest in something such as an \nabandoned gas station, they are often discouraged from doing so for \nfear of the strict liabilities that could be imposed on them by \nSuperfund. Attempting to relax the daunting liability provisions for \nthose willing to buy brownfields sites for the purpose of cleaning and \nupgrading them is a huge step in the right direction.\n  I believe that enactment of this brownfields legislation, will \nprovide a significant foundation for rebuilding many of our \ncommunities. Many of these sites are located in downtown areas and \noften serve as the breeding grounds for crime, drug trafficking and \ncontamination. I am hopeful that passing this legislation will help \nrestore downtown communities making them once again attractive to \nbusiness, industry and prospective residents.\n  Many of us have watched these downtown areas slowly die. I know that \nin Albuquerque, NM, the largest city in the State, we have seen a huge \nshift away from the downtown area. Local businesses that once thrived \nwere forced to close and slowly, what was once the metropolis of \nAlbuquerque, began to seem like a ghost town.\n  I support this legislation because of the potential it brings to \nrestoring places like downtown Albuquerque. As I briefly touched on, \nsome of the most important benefits of the bill are its liability and \nfinality provisions. The bill specifies that prospective purchasers, \ninnocent landowners, and contiguous property owners, who exercise due \ndiligence in purchases, are not responsible for paying cleanup costs. \nThe stringent liability scheme under Superfund hinders those who want \nto invest in these sites for fear of liability. These barriers are \nunnecessary and do not foster development and growth in our inner \ncities. Additionally, the bill precludes EPA from taking action on a \nsite that a State has already placed in a cleanup program, unless there \nis an imminent and substantial endangerment to the environment or \npublic health, and some additional work must be completed.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes $150 million per year to help State and \nlocal governments perform assessments and cleanup at brownfields sites. \nFurther, $50 million per year is also authorized to establish and \nenhance brownfields programs, more than double the current level of \nfunds available through the current EPA program.\n  Pumping federal tax dollars back into localities and fostering \npartnerships with States and their local communities can help rid our \ncommunities of the negatives such as crime and contamination while \nrejuvenating downtown economies.\n  Economics and Environmental health are not mutually exclusive. This \nbill would allow these types of areas to be cleaned up, thus providing \nboth economic and environmental benefits. It is a win-win for \neveryone--cities and citizens alike.\n  I am hopeful that New Mexico, as well as many other communities \nacross the nation, will see great benefits as a result of this \nlegislation. I hope that we are successful at reviving the ghost towns \nthat currently exist in many downtown areas and that they will once \nagain come alive with prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3980-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CRIME VICTIMS' ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, victims of crime deserve to have their \nvoices heard and to be notified of important events in the criminal \njustice system relating to their cases, and they deserve enforceable \nrights under the law.\n  Today, this is why my colleagues and I are re-introducing the Crime \nVictims Assistance Act. It is especially appropriate that we do so this \nweek, which is National Crime Victims' Rights Week. Our bill defines \nthe rights of victims and establishes an effective means to implement \nand enforce these rights. Equally important, it does so without taking \nthe drastic, unnecessary, and time-consuming step of amending the \nConstitution.\n  Our bill provides enhanced protections to victims of both violent and \nnon-violent federal crimes. It assures victims a greater voice in the \nprosecution of the criminals who injured them and their families. It \ngives victims the right to be notified and consulted on detention and \nplea agreements; the right to be heard at sentencing; the right to be \nnotified of the escape or release of a criminal from prison or a grant \nof executive clemency; and the right to a speedy trial and prompt \ndisposition, free from unreasonable delay.\n  The rights established by this bill will fill existing gaps in \nfederal criminal law and will be a major step toward guaranteeing that \nvictims of crime receive fair treatment. Our bill achieves these goals \nin a way that does not interfere with the efforts of the States to \nprotect victims in ways appropriate to each State's unique needs.\n  Rather than mandating that States modify their criminal justice \nprocedures in particular ways, our bill authorizes the use of federal \nfunds to establish effective pilot programs to promote victim-rights \ncompliance. It increases resources for the development of state-of-the-\nart systems for notifying victims of important dates and developments \nin their cases. It provides funds for the development of community-\nbased justice programs relating to those rights. Finally, it creates \nand funds additional personnel in federal law enforcement agencies to \nassist victims in obtaining their rights. These initiatives will \nprovide victims with the counseling, information, and assistance they \nneed in order to participate in the criminal justice process to the \nmaximum extent possible.\n  There is no need to amend the Constitution to achieve these important \ngoals. The Constitution is the foundation of our democracy. It reflects \nthe enduring principles of our country. The framers deliberately made \nthe Constitution difficult to amend, because it was never intended to \nbe used for normal legislative purposes. If it is not necessary to \namend the Constitution to achieve particular goals, it is necessary not \nto amend it. Our legislation is well-designed to establish effective \nand enforceable rights for victims of crime, and I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3980-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3980-S3981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH or Oregon.

A week before the assault, the perpetrator told friends \nhe hated gay people and thought they should be beaten up.\n\n[[Page S3981]]\n\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate.

Mr. President, as we were reminded yesterday, words matter \nin diplomacy. Wednesday morning, the President of the United States \nappeared on national television in an interview taped Tuesday night \nwith Charles Gibson of ABC News. In that interview, the President was \nasked if the United States had an obligation to defend Taiwan if it was \nattacked by China.\n  President Bush replied, ``Yes, we do, and the Chinese must understand \nthat. Yes, I would.''\n  The interviewer pressed further, asking, ``With the full force of the \nAmerican military?''\n  President Bush replied, ``Whatever it took to help Taiwan defend \nitself.'' He did not elaborate at that time.\n  A few hours later, the President appeared to back off this startling \nnew commitment, stressing in an interview on CNN that the United States \nwould continue to abide by the Taiwan Relations Act and the One China \npolicy followed by each of the past five Presidential Administrations.\n  I want to make clear that I believe the security of Taiwan to be a \nvital interest of the United States.\n  Senator Helms and I are among a handful of current members of the \nU.S. Senate who were around to vote for the Taiwan Relations Act when \nit was introduced 22 years ago.\n  And I remain as committed today as I was then to the peaceful \nresolution of the Taiwan question.\n  And because of my strong support for Taiwan, I was inclined to \nbelieve that the President had made an honest, and mostly harmless, \nmistake yesterday, especially when the State Department issued a \nclarification stressing that U.S. policy remained unchanged. State \nDepartment spokesman Phil Reeker said, ``Our policy hasn't changed \ntoday, it didn't change yesterday, and it didn't change last year, it \nhasn't changed in terms of what we have followed since 1979 with the \npassage of the Taiwan Relations Act.''\n  But by the end of the day, senior national security officials at the \nWhite House were singing a different tune, insisting that the President \nmeant what he said in the morning interview.\n  The President's National Security Adviser claimed that, ``the Taiwan \nRelations act makes very clear that the U.S. has an obligation that \nTaiwan's peaceful way of life is not upset by force.'' And a White \nHouse Aide said, ``Nothing in the act precludes the President from \nsaying that the U.S. would do whatever it took to help Taiwan defend \nherself.''\n  As my colleagues may know, the Taiwan Relations Act obligates the \nUnited States to provide Taiwan ``with such defense articles and \ndefense services . . . as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain \na sufficient self-defense capability.''\n  It also states that any attempt to determine the future of Taiwan by \nother than peaceful means would constitute a ``threat to the peace and \nsecurity of the Western Pacific area'' and would be, ``of grave concern \nto the United States.''\n  Finally, it mandates that in the event of, ``any threat to the \nsecurity or the social or economic system of the people on Taiwan and \nany danger to the interests of the United States arising therefrom, the \nPresident and the Congress shall determine, in accordance with \nconstitutional processes, appropriate action by the United States in \nresponse to any such danger.''\n  Contrary to the President's statement to Charles Gibson, the United \nStates is not obligated to defend Taiwan, ``With the full force of the \nAmerican military,'' and hasn't been since we abrogated the 1954 Mutual \nDefense Treaty signed by President Eisenhower and ratified by the \nUnited States Senate.\n  And contrary to the White House spokesman's comments, the President \ndoes not have the authority unilaterally to commit U.S. forces to the \ndefense of Taiwan. Under the Constitution, as well as the provisions of \nthe Taiwan Relations Act, that is a matter which the President must \nbring to the American people and to the Congress of the United States.\n  During the campaign, President Bush implicity criticized the policy \nof ``strategic ambiguity'' which has governed the use of American \nforces to defend Taiwan in the event of a conflict with China for more \nthan 20 years since the United States abrogated the 1954 Mutual Defense \nTreaty with Taiwan and normalized diplomatic relations with China.\n  The point of that policy, which I support, was to retain the right to \nuse force to defend Taiwan, while reserving to the United States all \nthe decision-making authority about the circumstances in which we \nmight, or might not, commit U.S. forces.\n  Otherwise, the United States might find itself dragged into a \nconflict between China and Taiwan even in the event of a unilateral \nTaiwanese declaration of independence, something the President said \nyesterday he would not support.\n  This policy of strategic ambiguity was consistent with our One China \npolicy and also with our desire that the Taiwan question be resolved \nonly through peaceful means.\n  Well, today I guess we have a new policy, and I am calling it the \npolicy of ``ambiguous strategic ambiguity.''\n  What worries me is not just what the President said, but the utter \ndisregard for the role of Congress and the vital interest of our key \nPacific Allies, specifically Japan.\n  Perhaps the President is unaware that without using U.S. bases in \nJapan, we would be hard-pressed to make good on his commitment to use \nU.S. forces to defend Taiwan in the event of a conflict with China.\n  Perhaps he is unaware of how sensitive an issue this is for the \nJapanese government, which has taken great pains to avoid explicitly \nextending the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance to a Taiwan contingency.\n  I was quick to praise the President's deft handling of the dispute \nwith China over the fate of the downed U.S. surveillance aircraft.\n  But in this case, as in his rocky summit meeting with South Korean \nPresident Kim Daejung, the President has damaged U.S. credibility with \nour allies and sewn confusion throughout the Pacific Rim.\n  Words matter. Nuance matters.\n  Other events, the challenge of engaging North Korea, the emergence of \na reformist prime minister in Japan, and the threat of political \ninstability in Indonesia, will surely test America's resolve and \ndiplomatic agility in the Pacific during the months ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3981-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3981-S3982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DAY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today \nto pay tribute to the first celebration of ``World Intellectual \nProperty Day.''\n  Last fall, the World Intellectual Property Organization dedicated \nApril 26th as ``World Intellectual Property Day'' with the objective of \nhighlighting the valuable contributions intellectual property makes to \neconomic, cultural and social development and to raise public awareness \nof just what intellectual property is all about.\n  Intellectual property, which includes patents, trademarks and \ncopyright protections, is hardly a household phrase, but its \nsignificance to all Americans should not be underestimated. \nIntellectual property is really about creativity and innovation; it is \nabout ideas that start out as just a dream, but then go on to become \nthe creations and products that enrich our daily lives and improve our \nstandard of living.\n  Included among our Founding Fathers' many accomplishments were the \nexpress intellectual property protections of Article 1, Section 8 of \nour Constitution. This section is so seemingly simple, ``to promote the \nprogress of science and the useful arts by securing for limited times \nto authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective \nwritings and discoveries'', but it has done more to shape our Nation's \neconomic growth than almost any other provision in the Constitution.\n  Indeed, one of the most significant results of this constitutional \nprovision was the creation of the U.S. patent system. Today, more than \nsix million patents have been issued, for inventions\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\nranging from Farnsworth's cathode ray tube to the airplane to life-\nsaving pharmaceuticals. The value of our patent system was perhaps best \nsummarized by President Abraham Lincoln, himself a patent holder, when \nhe noted that it ``adds the fuel of interest to the spark of genius.''\n  We also are world leaders in copyrighted works. Books, movies, music, \nand other examples of American creativity entertain and enlighten the \nworld, and make a generous contribution to our balance of trade.\n  Our country's technological prowess and our high standard of living \nstem from the creativity, determination, and entrepreneurial drive of \nour citizens and the protection we provide for their creations. So, \ntoday, as nations around the world mark ``World Intellectual Property \nDay,'' let us take pride in the fact that our intellectual property \nsystem is recognized as the most effective in the world. As we look to \nthe future, let us also pledge ourselves to ensuring that the United \nStates remains the world's pre-eminent provider and protector of \nintellectual property.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3982-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CHRONIC INFECTIOUS CHILDHOOD DISEASES\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr President, I rise today to bring attention to the \nsingle most common chronic infectious childhood disease, namely dental \ndecay. In fact, it is five times more common than asthma and seven \ntimes more common than hay fever. Young children with severe decay, \naffecting multiple teeth, may need to be treated in a hospital under \ngeneral anesthesia. This level of treatment is unnecessarily costly. An \nestimated $100 million each year is spent for operating room charges \nassociated with treating severe decay in very young children.\n  One of the most cost effective ways to reduce the burden of tooth \ndecay, before it starts, is community water fluoridation. Since 1945, \nwater fluoridation has been the cornerstone of the nation's oral \nhealth, by safely, inexpensively and effectively preventing tooth decay \nregardless of an individuals' socioeconomic status or ability to obtain \ndental care. Today, close to 144 million Americans receive this benefit \nthrough fluoridated water. Unfortunately, more than 100 million others \ndo not.\n  This is especially disturbing, because water fluoridation remains the \nmost equitable and cost-effective method of delivering fluoride. The \naverage life-time cost of fluoridation per person is less than the \napproximate cost of one dental filling.\n  In my home State of Vermont, three communities with over 7,000 \nresidents, do not benefit from community water fluoridation. According \nto the Vermont Department of Health, high school students in one of \nthese communities have the worse dental health in the State, by a \nsignificant margin. Because of the high disease rate in these three \ncommunities, they have responded by developing dental clinics to serve \nlow-income residents. Although we applaud these communities for \nresponding accordingly, the old adage holds true here, an ounce of \nprevention is worth a pound of cure.\n  Dental sealants have also proven to be an effective method of \npreventing tooth decay. Studies have shown that sealants can reduce \ntooth decay by over 70 percent. Despite the proven effectiveness of \nthis method, only three percent of low-income children have had \nsealants applied to their teeth.\n  The inequities in oral health care are especially apparent in \nMedicaid patients. In 1993, only 1 in 5 children and adolescents \ncovered by Medicaid received preventive dental service such as \napplication of fluoride or sealants. Alarmed by these statistics, \nSenator Russ Feingold and I, along with 26 of our colleagues, wrote to \nthe Health Care Financing Administration asking that they explore what \nMedicaid could do to improve access to comprehensive dental services \nfor underserved children.\n  Oral health is a key determinate of overall health. It is essential \nthat we continue to pursue these low-cost and effective measures to \nensure that all children in this country, regardless of income and \ngeography, are free of dental disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3982-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3982-S3983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBALLY CONTROLLED POSTSECONDARY VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL INSTITUTIONS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chair of the \nHELP Committee in a colloquy regarding eligibility for Section 117 of \nthe Carl Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. \nSection 117 authorizes funding for Tribally Controlled Postsecondary \nVocational and Technical Institutions. The funds have been awarded \nannually to the two existing tribally controlled postsecondary \nvocational institutions that are devoted to providing vocational and \ntechnical education, United Tribes Technical College and Crownpoint \nInstitute of Technology. Historically, these two institutions have not \nreceived assistance under the Tribally Controlled College and \nUniversity Assistance Act, so the Perkins funds are key to their \nexistence.\n  On March 28, 2001, the Department of Education issued a Request for \nProposals, RFP for funding under Section 117 that would open up funding \nfor this program to the tribal colleges. The Department is operating \nunder the mistaken view that the 1998 Perkins Amendments changed the \nprevious Perkins law with regard to eligibility for these funds. In \nfact, it was not the intent of Congress to in any way alter eligibility \nfor Section 117 funding when it enacted the 1998 Perkins Amendments. \nThe members of the North Dakota and New Mexico delegations disagree \nwith the Department and have written to Secretary Paige stating our \nview that the 1998 Perkins amendments did not change the eligibility \nfor what is now the Section 117 program. Do the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the HELP Committee agree with our view?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes, I agree with the view of the North Dakota and New \nMexico delegations. The 1998 amendments to the Perkins Act made no \nsubstantive changes to the Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Vocational \nInstitutions section of the law concerning eligibility. The section \nthat authorizes the grants retained the purpose of providing assistance \nsolely to institutions whose focus is vocational and technical \neducation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Crownpoint Institute of Technology and United \nTribes Technical College depend on Perkins funding for their core \noperational funds, and the Department should not make radical changes \nin eligibility simply by issuing a new grant announcement. The 1992 \nregulations for the Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Vocational \nInstitutions Program state, at 34 CFR 440.5, that tribal colleges are \nnot eligible for these funds. The regulations have not been changed. \nWould the Ranking Member of the HELP Committee comment on this?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The senior Senator from New Mexico is correct. The 1992 \nregulations have not been changed, nor has there been a need to change \nthem because the 1998 Perkins Amendments made no changes concerning \nwhich institutions are eligible for the Tribally Controlled \nPostsecondary Vocational Institutions funding.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would like to inquire of the junior Senator from New \nMexico and a member of the HELP Committee, what difference, if any, was \nmade in the eligibility for the Tribally Controlled Postsecondary \nVocational Institutions funding in 1998?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. No change was made. We included a parenthetical \nreference to the definition of ``institution of higher education,'' \nthis has no practical effect as both the 1990 and 1998 Perkins laws \nrequire that a grant recipient be an institution of higher education. \nThe Department should continue providing grants for Section 117 under \nthe current regulations unless and until new regulations are issued \npursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act. Crownpoint Institute of \nTechnology and United Tribes Technical College were intended to be the \nonly beneficiaries of this section.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Thank you. I would like to include for the Record a copy \nof the letter from the North Dakota and New Mexico delegations to \nSecretary Paige on this matter. I would also like included in the \nRecord a letter from Dr. Jim Shanley, President of the American Indian \nHigher Education Consortium, objecting to the Department's RFP that \nwould open up the Section 117 program to the tribal colleges. Dr. \nShanley notes that such an\n\n[[Page S3983]]\n\naction would likely result in the closing of the doors of the tribally \ncontrolled postsecondary vocational institutions.\n  The letters follow:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                   March 27, 2001.\n     Hon. Rod Paige,\n     Secretary of Education, U.S. Department of Education, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Paige: We write to express serious concerns \n     about the process used by the Department of Education in \n     issuing the March 23, 2001, Federal Register grant \n     announcement for Section 117 of the Carl Perkins Vocational \n     and Technical Education Act. Section 117 is specific to \n     tribally controlled postsecondary vocational institutions, of \n     which there are two: United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) \n     and Crowpoint Institute of Technology (CIT).\n       We understand that the March 23 notice has been withdrawn \n     for technical reasons but that the Department intends to \n     reissue the notice shortly. The March 23 notice makes drastic \n     changes in Section 117 eligibility and uses of funds that are \n     inconsistent with the existing program regulations in 34 CFR \n     Part 410. The eligible applicant pool would be expanded to \n     include tribally-controlled community colleges for the first \n     time and the uses of the funds would be restricted.\n       If put into place, these changes could result in closure of \n     the two institutions that have depended on this funding for \n     their core operations. The Perkins funds support the ongoing \n     operations of UTTC and CIT, just as funding under the \n     Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities Act supports \n     the ongoing operations of tribal colleges. We ask that you \n     not reissue the notice regarding Section 117 but rather \n     engage in a formal rulemaking process. Pending that, the FY \n     2001 Perkins funds should be issued under the current \n     regulations.\n       We view the March 23 notice as an end-run around the \n     regulatory process; it is, in effect, a set of new \n     regulations without the benefit of any formal process or \n     consultation with the affected parties. The 1998 amendments \n     to the Perkins Act were signed into law on October 31, 1998--\n     almost two-and-a-half years ago--and no regulations have been \n     issued. Now the Department asserts that the 1998 amendments \n     ``substantially revised'' the tribally controlled \n     postsecondary institutions program and wants to waive the \n     regulatory process on the grounds that there is no time to \n     issue regulations if the awards under Section 117 are to be \n     made in a timely manner. This is disingenuous and certainly \n     not in keeping with the federal government's policy of \n     working with tribes on a government-to-government basis, \n     including consultation with tribes and tribal organizations \n     on policy matters that will affect them.\n       Again, we urge you to direct that the March 23 grant \n     announcement not be reissued but rather use the existing \n     regulations for Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Vocational \n     Institutions for this grant period. If the Department feels \n     that new regulations are warranted for the 1998 Perkins Act \n     Amendments, such regulations should be issued through the \n     Administrative Procedures Act in consultation with the \n     affected tribal parties.\n       We appreciate your attention to this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kent Conrad,\n     Pete Domenici,\n     Byron L. Dorgan,\n     Jeff Bingaman,\n                                                      U.S. Senate.\n\n     Earl Pomeroy,\n     Tom Udall,\n     U.S. House of Representatives.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   American Indian\n\n\n                                  Higher Education Consortium,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 27, 2001.\n     Mr. Robert Muller,\n     Deputy Assistant Secretary (Acting), Office of Vocational and \n         Adult Education, Department of Education, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Muller: On behalf of the 32 Tribal Colleges and \n     Universities, I am writing to request your assistance with a \n     serious matter involving our two tribally-controlled \n     postsecondary vocational institutions, United Tribes \n     Technical College (UTTC) and Crownpoint Institute of \n     Technology (CIT). It has come to my attention that your \n     office is about to publish a solicitation opening up \n     eligibility requirements for Title I, Sec. 117; therefore, \n     significantly changing the intent of the program. It is of \n     great concern that no consultation has been done with our \n     institutions on this matter. To make this change would \n     seriously jeopardize the funding for UTTC and CIT's core \n     operations and force their closure.\n       Because of the immense ramifications of this action, we \n     strongly urge you to hold the solicitation to be published \n     March 28, 2002. We also request that appropriate consultation \n     occur with AIHEC, UTTC, and CIT as soon as possible so that \n     this matter can be resolved constructively and expeditiously.\n       It is important to note the value of these two institutions \n     and their historic role in providing vocational education \n     opportunities to American Indian students. UTTC and CIT were \n     founded because of limited access to opportunities in \n     vocational education in serving their respective tribal \n     communities. However, because these two institutions are \n     vocational in nature and did not meet the eligibility \n     requirements of the Tribally Controlled College Assistance \n     Act for core operational support, Sec. 117 was created by \n     AIHEC's advocacy efforts on their behalf.\n       Thank you for your immediate attention and consideration. \n     We look forward to your response. I can be reached at 703-\n     980-4456/cell or 505-982-4411 until March 29th.\n           Respectively,\n                                                Dr. James Shanley,\n     President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3983-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GUN SHOW BACKGROUND CHECK ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week I joined Senator Reed and a \nnumber of my colleagues in introducing the Gun Show Background Check \nAct, which would close the gun show loophole. If enacted, prospective \nbuyers at gun shows would be required to undergo Brady background \nchecks to ensure that they are not felons, fugitives, domestic abusers, \nor other persons prohibited from purchasing firearms.\n  It is incredible to me that more than two years after Columbine, \nlawmakers have not yet acted to reduce the availability of guns to \ncriminals and other prohibited persons by closing this loophole in our \nfederal firearm laws. Just a few days ago, America memorialized the \nworst school shooting in our nation's history. On April 20, two years \nago, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold brought terror to Columbine High \nSchool. Of the four guns used by the two Columbine shooters, three were \nacquired at a gun show. The teenage shooters took full advantage of the \ngun show loophole, which allowed their friend, Robyn Anderson, to buy \nthem two rifles and a shotgun without ever submitting to a background \ncheck. Later, Robyn Anderson testified about her experience to the \nColorado Legislature. She said:\n\n       While we were walking around [at the gun show], Eric and \n     Dylan kept asking sellers if they were private or licensed. \n     They wanted to buy their guns from someone who was private--\n     and not licensed--because there would be no paperwork or \n     background check.\n       I was not asked any questions at all. There was no \n     background check . . . I would not have bought a gun for Eric \n     and Dylan if I had had to give any personal information or \n     submit any kind of check at all.\n       I wish a law requiring background checks had been in effect \n     at the time . . . It was too easy. I wish it had been more \n     difficult. I wouldn't have helped them buy the guns if I had \n     faced a background check.\n\n  Of all the testimony that came out of Columbine, Robyn Anderson's is \namong the most memorable. The citizens of Colorado and Oregon, States \nwith high rates of gun ownership, reacted by supporting referenda to \nclose the gun show loopholes in their States. Now, Congress should do \nthe same and enact legislation to close the gun show loophole \nnationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3983-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3983-S3984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CAMPAIGN FINANCE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to call my colleagues' attention to \nan article by the distinguished First Amendment scholar, Ronald \nDworkin, ``Free Speech And The Dimensions Of Democracy.'' The article \nappears in If Buckley Fell: A First Amendment Blueprint for Regulating \nMoney in Politics, sponsored by the Brennan Center for Justice at New \nYork University's School of Law.\n  Professor Dworkin's work illustrates a point some of us made during \nthe recent debate on campaign finance reform: the shocking state of our \ncurrent political life is a perversion of the public discourse \nenvisioned by the Founding Fathers, a perversion directly rooted in the \nmistaken understanding of the First Amendment underlying the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976).\n  As Professor Dworkin puts it, ``[o]ur politics are a disgrace and \nmoney is the root of the problem.''\n  There is no need to detail the disgraceful state of our political \nlife brought about by politicians' need to chase dollars. Members of \nthis body, myself included, described the current state of affairs in \nall its painful and embarrassing detail during the recently concluded \ndebate on campaign finance reform.\n  Professor Dworkin's article makes explicit what many of us have \nargued in supporting Senator Hollings' proposal to amend the \nConstitution so that reasonable limits can be placed on campaign \nexpenditures: Senator Hollings' Amendment is not an affront to the \nFirst Amendment, as some have\n\n[[Page S3984]]\n\nportrayed it; it is an affront to Buckley, which was wrongly decided. \nSenator Hollings' Amendment is restorative: it returns First Amendment \njurisprudence to what it was before the ill-conceived Buckley decision.\n  In holding that limitations on campaign expenditures violate the \nFirst Amendment, Buckley mistakenly equates money and speech. But, as \nJustice Stevens pointed out recently in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri \nGovernment PAC, 528 U.S. 377 (2000), money is not speech; money is \nproperty.\n  Professor Dworkin's article shows that the mistaken factual premise \nin Buckley is rooted in a fundamental misconception of First Amendment \njurisprudence. Senator Hollings' effort to make clear that reasonable \nlimits can be imposed constitutionally on campaign expenditures would \nrestore that jurisprudence by overturning Buckley.\n  The First Amendment and most of the important decisions interpreting \nit presuppose a democracy in which citizens are politically equal, not \nonly as judges of the political process through voting, but also as \nparticipants in that process through informed political discourse. \nReasonable regulations on campaign expenditures would enhance speech \nand contribute to a more rational political discourse. Professor \nDworkin illustrates this point through a historical and philosophical \nanalysis of First Amendment precedent and the threat that unrestricted \ncampaign expenditures pose to the values underlying the First \nAmendment. Treating money as speech debases genuine democratic \ndialogue.\n  Justice Brandeis made this point in another way in his justly famous \ndissent in Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 375 (1927):\n\n       Those who won our independence believed that the final end \n     of the state was to make men free to develop their faculties, \n     and that in its government the deliberative forces should \n     prevail over the arbitrary. They valued liberty both as an \n     end and as a means. They believed liberty to be the secret of \n     happiness and courage to be the secret of liberty; . . . \n     [They believed] that the greatest menace to freedom is an \n     inert people; that public discourse is a political duty; and \n     that this should be a fundamental principle of the American \n     government.\n\n  The damage that unrestricted campaign expenditures has done to our \npublic discourse is clear. If money is speech, then inevitably one will \nneed money, and large amounts of it, to speak politically. The result, \nin Professor Dworkin's words, is that our last two presidential \ncampaigns were ``as much a parody of democracy as democracy itself.''\n  I will not repeat Professor Dworkin's analysis of the legal \nprecedents interpreting the First Amendment and Buckley's distortion of \nthem, except to point to the oddity that Buckley at times recognizes \nthe constitutional jurisprudence it undermines. It does so in holding \nthat, in contrast to campaign expenditures where any limit purportedly \nviolates the First Amendment, Congress may constitutionally place \nlimits on campaign contributions. The latter holding, as Professor \nDworkin points out, is premised on a principle deeply rooted in First \nAmendment jurisprudence: reasonable restrictions on activity in the \npolitical realm, like contributing money, may be erected to protect \ncore First Amendment values, like equality of political discourse. That \nis all that most proponents of campaign reform want to do, and that is \nall that the Hollings Amendment will do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3984-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3984-S3985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AMERICAN PRISONERS OF THE HOLOCAUST\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in September of 1944, the 106th Infantry \nDivision embarked for Europe and soon joined heavy fighting at the \nBattle of the Bulge. But one member of the division, the Academy Award-\nwinning filmmaker Charles Guggenheim, was left behind in Indiana due to \na minor illness. His connection with this brave group and the 350 \nAmerican soldiers taken prisoner after the battle and sent to a Nazi \ncamp in Berga, Germany led Mr. Guggenheim to undertake a new \ndocumentary, which is the subject of an excellent New York Times \narticle by Roger Cohen. So that more Americans can be educated about \nthe events leading up to the Holocaust and the unspeakable horrors \ninflicted upon Americans as well as Europeans, I ask that Mr. Cohen's \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 17, 2001]\n\nWhere G.I.'s Were Consumed by the Holocaust's Terror; a Filmmaker Helps \n                     Thaw Memories of Wartime Guilt\n\n                            (By Roger Cohen)\n\n       Berga, Germany. Four plain wooden crosses stand in the \n     cemetery above this quiet town in eastern Germany. One of \n     them is inscribed ``Unknown Allied Soldier.'' He is unlikely \n     to be an American, because the G.I.'s who died here were \n     exhumed after World War II and taken home. But the mystery of \n     this soldier's identity is only one of many hanging over \n     Berga and its former Nazi camp.\n       On a cold, late March day, with snow falling on the graves, \n     a thin, soft-spoken American stands filming in the cemetery. \n     He has hired some local volunteers, one of whom is portraying \n     a Nazi guard, as two others turn the earth in preparation for \n     the burial of the simulated corpses whose limp feet dangle \n     out of sacks. The scene has an eerie luminosity in the \n     silence of the snow.\n       The weather is cinematographically perfect. It is also \n     unseasonably cold and infernally damp. The American, Charles \n     Guggenheim, shivers as he says: ``This is a slow business, \n     filming something like this. Sort of like watching grass \n     grow.''\n       But for him the fate of the American soldiers imprisoned \n     and worked to death more than a half-century ago in Berga has \n     become something of an obsession.\n       Time may be needed for an obsession to take hold, time for \n     the half-thoughts, nagging regrets and suppressed memories to \n     coalesce into a determination to act. Mr. Guggenheim, a \n     documentary filmmaker who has won four Academy Awards, waited \n     a long time to embark on this movie. His daughter, Grace \n     Guggenheim, has a theory as to why. ``This is sort of a \n     survivor's guilt story,'' she said.\n       In September 1944 Mr. Guggenheim, now 77, was with the \n     American 106th Infantry Division, preparing to go to Europe. \n     But when the other soldiers embarked, he was immobilized with \n     a foot infection. He remained in Indiana while his fellow \n     infantrymen were plunged, within weeks, into the Battle of \n     the Bulge; two regiments were lost. Thousands of American \n     soldiers were captured, and several hundred who were Jewish \n     or who ``looked'' Jewish ended up in Berga. Up to now their \n     fate has received relatively little attention, partly because \n     the surviving soldiers long tended to repress the trauma.\n       ``I could have been among the captured or the killed,'' Mr. \n     Guggenheim mused. ``I never wished I had come to Europe. \n     Anyone in the infantry who wishes for war has something wrong \n     with them. But I've thought a lot: why in the hell am I here \n     and they not? Perhaps in the next life they'll get even. I'm \n     trying not to believe in a next life.''\n       Even this life seems incredible enough when gazing at \n     little Berga, a place outside time. It was exploited by the \n     Nazis before being taken over by the Russians, who mined \n     uranium in the area. In 1990 it was made part of a united \n     Germany.\n       Unemployment here stands at about 24 percent, so Mr. \n     Guggenheim had no problem finding volunteers for his film. To \n     conjure an atmosphere of desolation was not difficult either: \n     beside the unused red-brick textile factory of a vanished \n     Jewish family (named Englander), stray cats wander through \n     junkyards, watched by old men standing huddled against the \n     cold. Germany's ghosts, its myriad secrets, are almost \n     palpable in a place like this.\n       Among the onlookers near the cemetery is Sabine Knuppel, a \n     municipal worker. She says she has photographs of the ``old \n     days'' in Berga: a lighted swastika glowing among trees heavy \n     with snow. None of the old people in town like to talk about \n     those days, she says, when the Nazis set up a satellite camp \n     to Buchenwald in the middle of town and used the slave \n     laborers imprisoned there to dig tunnels into the rock cliffs \n     bordering the Elster River.\n       All that, she continues, constitutes a ``lost world.'' But \n     once there were perhaps 1,000 prisoners working in the \n     tunnels, where the Nazis planned to install a factory \n     producing synthetic fuel. But until now, nobody in the town \n     knew there were Americans among the prisoners, Ms. Knuppel \n     says.\n       After the war the Russians blew up many of the tunnels. In \n     their vestiges bats established a vast colony now officially \n     designated as a German nature reserve. Along the wooded banks \n     of the Elster, a dozen entrances to the tunnels may still be \n     seen; they are barred with steel doors.\n       Layer upon layer of German secrets: more tangible in a \n     place like Berga than in the west of the country, where \n     postwar prosperity wiped away most traces of tragedy. Mr. \n     Guggenheim, whose award-winning documentaries include ``J. F. \n     K. Remembered'' and an account of the civil rights movement \n     called ``A Time for Justice,'' has been digging into the \n     secrets for two years now. He has interviewed 40 American \n     survivors of Berga for a documentary tentatively titled \n     ``G.I. Holocaust.''\n       The film, a co-production of Mr. Guggenheim's company and \n     WNET, the public-television station in New York, centers on \n     what happened to a group of American soldiers captured by the \n     Germans after the Battle of the Bulge (which began on Dec. \n     16, 1944) and later transported to Berga.\n\n[[Page S3985]]\n\n       This group of about 350 men was selected from among the \n     more than 2,000 American prisoners initially taken to the \n     Stalag 9B prisoner of war camp at Bad Orb, 50 miles north of \n     Frankfurt. Among them was William Shapiro, now a retired \n     doctor living in Florida. A medic attached to the 28th \n     Infantry Division, he was captured on Dec. 17, 1944, the day \n     after the battle began.\n       ``On arrival at the prisoner of war camp, we were \n     interrogated,'' Dr. Shapiro said in a telephone interview. \n     ``With a name like Shapiro, it was quite evident I was \n     Jewish. I was then pushed into a particular barracks, mostly \n     for Jews and other undesirables. Our job was to clean the \n     latrines. We were guarded by the SS with dogs, rather than \n     the Wehrmacht. I'd never even trained with a gun. I thought \n     the Geneva Convention would protect me as a medic. At that \n     time I knew nothing of Auschwitz or the planned extermination \n     of European Jewry, although of course I knew of Hitler's \n     hostility to Jews.''\n       In the special barracks he was eventually joined by the \n     other 350 Americans who would go to Berga. Their identities \n     had not been as immediately obvious. Many were selected in a \n     grim process recalled to Mr. Guggenheim by several soldiers \n     of his own 106th Division.\n       They described how prisoners were ordered to stand at \n     attention in the parade ground. The commandant then gave the \n     order for all Jews to step forward. ``Nobody moved,'' said \n     Joseph Littell, one of the survivors. ``He said it again. \n     Nobody moved. He grabbed a rifle butt and hit Hans Kasten, \n     our leader, with a blow you couldn't believe. Hans got up. He \n     hit him again. The commandant said he would kill 10 men every \n     hour until the Jews were identified.''\n       The group of 350 was eventually assembled of some Jews who \n     identified themselves under pressure; some soldiers, like Mr. \n     Kasten, who volunteered; and some who were picked by the \n     Germans as resembling Jews. Mr. Kasten, an American of German \n     descent, suffered repeated taunts, being told that the thing \n     worse than a Jew was a German who turns against his country. \n     After several weeks the group was loaded into boxcars without \n     food or water, arriving at Berga on Feb. 13, 1945.\n       The Nazis had a policy, ``annihilation through work,'' and \n     these Americans learned what this meant. Housed in a barracks \n     beside the prison camp, fed only on bread and thin soup, \n     sleeping two to a bed in three-level bunks, deprived of water \n     to wash, urinating and defecating into a hole in the floor, \n     regularly beaten, the soldiers were herded out to work 12 \n     hours a day in the dusty tunnels.\n       ``The purpose was to kill you but to get as much of you \n     before they killed you,'' Milton Stolon of the 106th Division \n     told Mr. Guggenheim. Gangrene, dysentery, pneumonia, \n     diphtheria did their work. In the space of nine weeks about \n     35 soldiers died.\n       The persecution of American prisoners at Berga has remained \n     little-known because many of the victims, like Dr. Shapiro, \n     chose not to speak of it for a half-century after the war. \n     With the cold war to fight and West Germany a postwar ally, \n     the United States government had little interest in opening \n     its archives and inflaming conflict between Americans and \n     Germans.\n       In recent years, however, the research of an Army officer, \n     Mack O'Quinn, who investigated the events at Berga for a \n     master's degree thesis, and a 1994 book by Mitchell Bard, \n     ``Forgotten Victims'' (Westview Press), have thrown light on \n     the treatment of the G.I.'s. Still, many of the soldiers said \n     they spoke about their experiences for the first time to Mr. \n     Guggenheim; the notion that American prisoners of war were \n     persecuted as Jews or Jewish sympathizers has not received \n     broad attention.\n       Mr. Guggenheim said it was still a shock that this happened \n     to Americans, bringing home the realization that if the Nazis \n     had won the war, ``they would have gotten us, too.''\n       A descendant of German Jews, he grapples with ambivalent \n     feelings about the country, unable to forget what a \n     ``civilized nation'' did to its Jews even as he is surprised \n     by how civil postwar German society is.\n       He also grapples with how to find an appropriate treatment \n     of a Holocaust movie, troubled by what he sees as the \n     frequent trivialization of the Holocaust in film. Too often, \n     he said, Hitler's crimes have become a ``quick fix for \n     involvement'' and a good fix for raising money from Jewish \n     families. Like sex and violence, the Holocaust ``demands \n     people's attention, even if they do not feel good about it.''\n       His answer to the ethical dilemma is the sobriety of his \n     research and treatment: painstaking interviews, careful \n     reconstruction of a little-known chapter in the war, \n     attention to detail. The scenes filmed in Berga will \n     supplement a core of archival film, photography and \n     interviews. ``What is most moving to me is the way the \n     survivors have talked about themselves and about each other, \n     often for the first time,'' he said. ``In many instances they \n     had never talked about this before.''\n       Dr. Shapiro was among those who suppressed his memories. \n     ``It took 50 years for all of us to begin to come to terms \n     with this,'' he said. In early April 1945, with the American \n     and Soviet armies closing in, the camp at Berga was ordered \n     evacuated, and a death march began for hundreds of prisoners. \n     At least another 50 Americans died in the ensuing days before \n     advance units of the American 11th Armored Division liberated \n     the prisoners on April 22, 1945, near Cham in southeastern \n     Germany.\n       The rate of attrition--more than 70 American dead in just \n     over two months after arrival at Berga--was among the highest \n     for any group of G.I.'s taken prisoner in Europe. Dr. Shapiro \n     weighed 98 pounds on his liberation; he cannot recall the \n     last days of the forced march despite repeated efforts to do \n     so. ``I had become a zombie,'' he said.\n       Time has passed, but Dr. Shapiro's voice still cracks a \n     little as he thinks back. Periodic nightmares trouble him. \n     ``I traveled the same road as an American prisoner of war as \n     the Jews of Europe,'' he continued. ``I was put in a boxcar, \n     starved, put on a death march. It was a genocidal type of \n     approach.''\n       That road might also have been Mr. Guggenheim's. After the \n     war he asked a returning member of the 106th Division about a \n     Jewish soldier he had known and was told the man had died in \n     a German mine. But where, how, why?\n       The questions lingered in his mind for more than a half-\n     century before taking him where an infected foot prevented \n     him from going in 1944: to a remote town in Germany where the \n     bat-filled tunnels are now sealed and snow falls on a \n     cemetery where an ``Allied Soldier'' lies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3985-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3985-S3986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBAL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Senior Senator \nfrom Iowa in a colloquy about funding for the Nation's 32 tribal \ncolleges and universities.\n  These schools, located in 12 States, serve more than 250 federally \nrecognized tribes nationwide. The colleges serve students older than \nthe traditional college age who are seeking another chance at a \nproductive life. The vast majority of tribal college students are \nfirst-generation college students.\n  However, the States provide little, if any, funding to the tribal \ncolleges and universities because the vast majority of tribal colleges \nare located on federal trust lands. Additionally, non-Indians account \nfor about 20 percent of tribal college enrollments, although the States \ndo not provide financial support for these students.\n  Does the Senator from Iowa agree that the Federal Government needs to \nplay a significant role in funding these schools?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I agree with the Senator from North Dakota. The \nFederal Government provides the core operating funds for the tribal \ncolleges and universities. Without this funding, many of them would \nhave to close their doors.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And is it the view of the Senator from Iowa that this \nfunding has not reached the level authorized by the Tribally Controlled \nColleges and Universities Assistance Act?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from North Dakota is correct. Although annual \nappropriations for tribal colleges have increased in recent years, the \nper Indian student funding is still less than two-thirds the level \nauthorized by law and significantly lower than the public support given \nto mainstream community students.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. I would also like to note that the \nneed for federal funding is especially critical for these schools \nbecause most tribal colleges and universities were founded less than 25 \nyears ago and are located in rural and impoverished areas, and they do \nnot have access to alumni-based funding sources and local financial \nsupport.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Given the circumstances described by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and my own knowledge of the five tribal colleges in my own \nState, I ask that every effort be made in Fiscal Year 2002 and beyond \nto fund the colleges at the level at which they are authorized in the \nTribally Controlled College and University Assistance Act. Would the \nSenator from Iowa agree that with respect to the education funding \namendment adopted by the Senate that this will be a priority?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I agree with the Senator from North Dakota that a \nportion of the funding provided by my amendment should be used to help \nclose the gap between the level of funding authorized by the Tribally \nControlled College and University Assistance Act and the level of \nfunding the colleges are currently receiving. I believe the funding in \nmy amendment is sufficient to meet the needs of the tribal colleges and \nuniversities as well as the other educational needs throughout the \ncountry.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator for his remarks. I am pleased that \nthe Senator from Iowa, who is a champion\n\n[[Page S3986]]\n\nof education, shares my strongly-held view that Congress must continue \nwork toward current statutory federal funding goals for the tribal \ncolleges. I look forward to continuing to work with him on this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3986-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JENNINGS RANDOLPH AND HIS FIGHT FOR THE 26TH \n                               AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nSenator Jennings Randolph on the anniversary of the passage of the 26th \nAmendment. In 1971, a young West Virginian named Debbie Phillips \nskipped a day of high school. Skipping school is usually frowned upon \nby parents and teachers, but Debbie, then 18, was anything but another \nstudent trying to ditch chemistry, algebra, and history. In fact, \nDebbie was missing school in order to make history: that day, she \nregistered to vote under the newly-ratified 26th Amendment to the \nConstitution at the Kanawha County Court House in Charleston, WV. A \nyear later, the 26th Amendment also allowed Debbie to seek an \nappointment as a delegate at a national convention, making her the \nfirst West Virginian under 21 years of age to file for public office.\n  I was the Secretary of State in West Virginia at the time, so Debbie \ncame to my office to register. Her actions, and those of millions of \nother young Americans who have accepted the 26th Amendment's invitation \nto participate in the political process, show how critical young people \nare to our democracy.\n  These extraordinary developments were made possible by a great man \nand a friend of mine--Senator Jennings Randolph, my predecessor as \nSenator form West Virginia and the ``Father of the 26th Amendment.'' \nSenator Randolph drafted the amendment and worked tirelessly for its \npassage, based on his belief that America's youth had a right to be \npart of our political process. The ratification of the amendment marked \na great moment in our country's history. It has allowed young adults to \nspeak for themselves and have their voices heard in the greatest \ndemocratic society in the world.\n  Thirty years ago Saturday, the State of West Virginia ratified the \n26th Amendment. This action came in the midst of the Vietnam War, in \nwhich nearly half of all the soldiers that America lost were younger \nthan 21. Despite making the ultimate sacrifice for their country, those \nyoung soldiers had been unable to vote for the President that was \nsending them to war. In addition, they were paying taxes and \nparticipating in society in every other way; yet they were unable to \nvote. Senator Randolph changed that forever.\n  Tomorrow, West Virginia Secretary of State Joe Manchin is holding an \nevent at our State Capitol encouraging schools to register voters under \nhis West Virginia SHARES program--Saving History and Reaching Every \nStudent. It is so important that young people realize what an awesome \npower Senator Randolph's crusade brought them. Young Americans were \nexcited to have the right to vote in the early 1970s, but today many \n18- to 21-year-olds do not even bother to register. With the exception \nof 1996, voter participation among citizens between the ages of 18 and \n24 has decreased in each Presidential election.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on a report issued \nyesterday by the Joint Committee on Taxation and hearings that are \nbeing conducted today in the Finance Committee on the subject of tax \nsimplification.\n  Last week, on April 16, millions of Americans mailed their tax \nreturns, completing the last step in a process that many found arduous, \nburdensome, and needlessly confusing. The tax code has become \nincreasingly complex since its last major reform in 1986. Taxpayers \ngrow increasingly frustrated filling out their returns or are forced to \npay others to prepare their tax returns for them. The government has \nthus imposed a kind of tax on paying taxes.\n  In response to this complexity, most people have apparently thrown up \ntheir hands and paid others to fill out their returns. The Internal \nRevenue Service recently estimated that through the first week of \nApril, about 57 percent of all individual income-tax filers used paid \npreparers. That rate was up from 56 percent last year.\n  Paid tax preparers report that they did a booming business this year. \nThrough March 30, H Block's revenue for tax preparation services rose \nby more than 10 percent over last year, to $1.5 billion. Its average \nfee rose to about $109.\n  Aside from using paid preparers, to avoid tax complexity, many \nAmericans forgo tax benefits to which they are legally entitled. For \nexample, many people use the standard deduction, even though they would \nsave money by itemizing their deductions. The General Accounting Office \nrecently estimated that on more than half a million returns for 1998, \ntaxpayers did not itemize, even though mortgage interest payments alone \nwould have reduced their taxes or increased their refunds. GAO \nestimated that the resulting overpayments may have totaled $311 \nmillion, or $610 per tax return.\n  Earlier this year, the IRS's acting national taxpayer advocate issued \na report to Congress in which he summed up: Complexity ``remains the \nNo. 1 problem facing taxpayers, and is the root cause of many of the \nother problems on the Top 20 list.''\n  All this complexity comes with substantial costs to our economy. \nTreasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said recently: ``The [tax] code today \nencompasses 9,500 pages of very small print. While every word in the \ncode has some justification, in its entirety it is an abomination. It \nimposes $150 billion or more of annual cost on our society with no \nvalue creation.''\n  The difficulty of filling out the income tax form is undermining \nAmericans' confidence in the system. When people's interaction with the \nFederal Government is dominated by complex and burdensome tax forms, it \ncan impair the people's trust in government generally.\n  We need tax reform and simplification. And now is the perfect time to \ndo something about it.\n  In a fine Brookings Institution Policy Brief issued this month, \nscholars Len Burman and Bill Gale write:\n\n       Tax complexity is like the weather: everyone talks about it \n     but nobody does anything about it. . . . Unlike the weather, \n     though, policymakers can do something about complexity. And \n     if they do not simplify the tax system now, when there are \n     surplus funds to pay for simplification, they will have lost \n     a golden opportunity.\n\n  Burman and Gale are right. Tax simplification needs to be an \nimportant part of this year's tax policy debate.\n  If Congress is to enact a greatly simplified tax code, it needs to \nhave a thorough understanding of the problem as well as specific \nproposals to consider. Comprehensive studies of the issue can provide a \nneeded impetus. The Report of Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan, \nfor example, laid the groundwork in substantial part for the 1986 \nreform.\n  I chaired the Taxation Committee of the State Senate in Wisconsin \nwhen we reformed the tax code in the mid-1980s. Democrats controlled \nboth houses of the Legislature, and we had a Democratic Governor, but \nwe used the Regan tax reform proposal as the basis for much of our own \ntax reform. The result was a greatly simplified tax system.\n  Following on that model, in last year's budget resolution, I offered \nan amendment calling for the Joint Committee on Taxation to conduct a \nstudy of means by which we might simplify taxes. The Senate Budget \nCommittee adopted the amendment unanimously. And the budget resolution \nthat Congress adopted on April 13 of last year included it as section \n336. That section said, in relevant part: ``It is the sense of the \nSenate that . . . the Joint Committee on Taxation shall develop a \nreport and alternative proposals on tax simplification by the end of \nthe year. . . .''\n  The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, under the direction of \nChief of Staff Lindy Paull, took this and other requests along these \nlines seriously. They consulted with academics,\n\n[[Page S3987]]\n\nformer chiefs of staff of the Committee, and former Commissioners of \nthe IRS. Staff reviewed proposals that have been made, and considered \nparticular issue areas. The resulting report, released yesterday, \nsuggests ways to accomplish the same policy goals that underlie the \ncurrent income tax code, but in less duplicative or less convoluted \nways.\n  I am glad to see that the Joint Committee has released its report. \nSimilarly, I am gratified that Finance Committee Chairman Chuck \nGrassley is holding a hearing today to receive the report and discuss \nthis important subject.\n  Although I do not agree with every suggestion put forth in the \nreport, I am convinced that this report and these hearings are exactly \nthe kind of institutional step that we need to take if we are to reform \nthe tax code.\n  Here are a just a few examples of areas where Congress could well \nsimplify the tax code:\n  The AMT: The complicated Alternative Minimum Tax is beginning to \naffect more and more middle-income taxpayers. It needs reform.\n  Capital Gains: Ever since the 1997 law created differing capital \ngains rates for differing holding periods, the capital gains form has \nbecome very complicated. Some have proposed an exclusion from capital \ngains income for the first several hundred dollars of capital gains \nincome, so that modest investors in mutual funds would not be subjected \nto filling out the capital gains schedule.\n  The Earned Income Tax Credit: At the Finance Committee hearing today, \nRichard Lipton, head of the American Bar Association tax section, \nargues for simplifying the earned-income tax credit, designed to help \nlow-income working families. In Mr. Lipton's words, ``In effect, \nCongress has given the poor a tax break with one hand and then taken it \naway with the other by making it too complex to understand.''\n  Child Credits: Robert Cherry and Max Sawicky of the Economic Policy \nInstitute have proposed a universal unified child credit that combines \nthe dependent care credit, the earned income tax credit, the child \ncredit, and the additional child credit. Similar work has been advanced \nby David Ellwood and Jeff Liebman of Harvard University's John F. \nKennedy School of Government. Congress could well examine combining \nvarious child credits to make them fairer and easier to use.\n  The Standard Deduction: We could expand the standard deduction so \nthat fewer taxpayers needed to itemize their deductions.\n  The Personal and Dependent Exemptions: Alternatively, we could expand \nthe personal and dependent exemptions.\n  The Nanny Tax: Congress has simplified the law by raising the \nthreshold of wages paid for filing employer taxes and by incorporating \nthe filing into the form 1040. The threshold could be further raised.\n  Education Incentives: Today's code contains several different \neducation incentive provisions, including tuition credits, like \nLifetime Learning or the Hope Credit, Education IRAs, State deductible \ntuition programs, limited interest deductions, and employer provided \nassistance. These provisions contain numerous and differing eligibility \nrequirements. Congress might work to harmonize these programs.\n  A simplified tax code makes good economic policy sense. We would \nimprove the economy's efficiency if we could minimize the impact of the \ntax code on the economic decisions of businesses and individuals.\n  The tax code's complexity frustrates average households. This is a \nreal issue with many people of fairly modest means. I hold listening \nsessions in each of Wisconsin's 72 counties every year, and I \nfrequently hear of people's frustrations with the tax code's \ncomplexity.\n  I am gratified to see that the Joint Committee on Taxation has \naddressed the budget resolution's request seriously, and has produced \nits extensive product. I commend the Joint Committee's efforts.\n  We need to advance the process of simplification further. I look \nforward to working with colleagues in the Finance Committee and the \nSenate on ways to reform and simplify the tax code.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3987-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INFORMATION BROKERS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the Washington Post reported \nthis morning that several prominent banks, insurance companies and law \nfirms regularly purchased consumers' confidential financial information \nfrom an information broker that illegally gathered the data using \n``pretext'' calling. This despicable practice involves a caller who \ncontacts a business or government entity and uses a person's social \nsecurity number or other personal identifier to trick an unsuspecting \nclerk to provide confidential information about everything from a \nperson's checking account balance to her investment portfolio.\n  The prohibition against this fraudulent practice was recently \nstrengthened by Congress through the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, but \nreports of abuse have continued. Information brokers with little regard \nfor people's privacy are doing the dirty work for organizations that \notherwise portray themselves as privacy proponents. These so-called \ninformation brokers allow companies seeking such information to cut \ncorners at the expense of consumers.\n  And the apparent willingness of some in the financial industry to \npurchase such information calls into question the industry's commitment \nto protecting consumers' privacy. Further, if companies buy information \nfrom suspect sources, there are limited prohibitions on redistributing \nit.\n  If a company isn't required to get a customer's express consent prior \nto selling, sharing or disclosing his information, then the customer \nhas little opportunity to stop the spread of inaccurate information.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced legislation that, if passed, would \nhelp minimize the collateral damage that can occur when financial \ninstitutions purchase information from these suspect firms. My bill \nwould require a consumer's express consent before a financial company \ncan share personally identifiable financial information with its \naffiliates and express written consent before it can transfer \npersonally identifiable medical information. I want to put the \nconsumers in control. Consumer control ensures that personally \nidentifiable information is only used for the purpose it was gathered \nfor and protects consumers from the further spread of inaccurate \ninformation.\n  Too often these days, personally identifiable medical and financial \ninformation is being shared, bought, or sold; and, it's being done \nwithout the consent of the consumer. This practice must stop. And it is \nour job to pass legislation that will stop it.\n  I call on my colleagues in the Banking committee to move forward with \nthis legislation as soon as possible, so that it can be considered by \nthe full Senate. Now is the time to close the financial privacy \nloophole so that we prevent a further erosion of our privacy rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3987-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor South \nDakota's native\n\n[[Page S3988]]\n\nson, Lt. Shane Osborn, the Navy pilot whose leadership and piloting \nskills saved the lives of the crew detained in China for the first part \nof April.\n  Even at three years of age, Shane exhibited a fascination with \nplanes. Shane's family lived on a farm near Rapid City, South Dakota, \nwhere the farmer owned a small, two-seat aircraft. The hangar wasn't \nfar from the house, and Shane would often climb into the plane and \npretend to take to the skies in flight. This lifelong interest led \nShane to the Navy where he trained as a pilot and was commissioned an \nofficer in 1996.\n  Shane eventually was transferred to Whidbey Island Naval Station in \nWashington where he was trained to fly naval reconnaissance. As his \nNavy EP-3E plane recently flew a routine mission near the Chinese \ncoast, it is reported that a Chinese F-8 fighter plane made two passes \nnear the American aircraft, flying within three to five feet of the \nplane. On the third pass, the Chinese pilot apparently ran into the \nAmerican plane's propeller, sending Shane and his crew into a steep \ndive.\n  With two of the four propellers out of commission, a smashed nose \ncone, and destroyed navigational instruments, the American plane \ndropped nearly 7,500 feet toward the China Sea. With sheer will and \nbrute force, Shane managed to bring the plane under control and land \nsafely on the Chinese island of Hainan.\n  During the ensuing days as Shane and his crew were held by Chinese \nofficials, I spoke with the Chinese Ambassador and urged his government \nto release the American crew as quickly as possible. I also passed \nalong to the Ambassador an email message Shane's father, Doug, wrote to \nhis son. As the parent of a son in the military, I understood the fear \nand uncertainty one feels when their child is suddenly placed in harm's \nway. However, when I spoke with Doug Osborn, I was reminded also of the \nimmense pride and love that a parent feels for their son or daughter in \nthe military.\n  I commend Lt. Shane Osborn for his heroism in safely landing the \ndisabled American plane and his leadership as mission commander during \nthe 11 days the American crew was detained in China. Shane symbolizes \nthe very best that we have come to expect from the men and women in our \nmilitary. I will continue to be an advocate on military issues in \nCongress and make sure that military personnel like Shane receive the \n``quality of life'' benefits they and their families deserve. After the \nnumerous sacrifices the men and women in our military make for our \ncountry, we in Congress can be expected to do no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3988-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING CADET CHIEF PETTY OFFICER THEA I.

Mr. President, I would like to extend my most \nsincere congratulations to Cadet Chief Petty Officer Thea I. Peck. On \nApril 28, 2001, she will be awarded the Willis E. Reed Cadet of the \nYear Award, which recognizes the Naval Sea Cadet who has excelled in \nall areas of Naval Sea Cadet Corps, NSCC, training. She was initially \nselected as Mid-Atlantic Cadet of the Year for 2000 out of six states \nincluding Pennsylvania, which then lead to her selection as the \nprogram-wide Cadet of the Year. This recognition is outstanding as it \nexemplifies Cadet CPO Peck's leadership, maturity, dedication, and \npatriotism.\n  The NSCC was established in 1958 in part of the Department of the \nNavy to develop an appreciation for the United States' naval history, \ncustoms, traditions, and its significant role in national defense. Its \npurpose is also to develop patriotism, confidence, and pride in our \nnation's youth and help them to develop strong moral character and good \ncitizenship. It also gives participants a real-life look at military \nopportunities.\n  Cadet CPO Peck has been a member of the Naval Sea Cadet Corps Program \nfor over five years. She has completed several training courses over \nher tenure in the program including time spent at the Foreign Exchange \nProgram with the United Kingdom and Medical Staff Training at Bethesda \nNaval Hospital. In all of her training periods, Cadet CPO Peck earned \nthe highest performance marks illustrating her dedication to the \nprogram and the United States Navy.\n  In addition to excelling in the Naval Sea Cadet Corps, Cadet CPO Peck \nis an impeccable student. With a high school grade point average of \n3.95, and as a student in all advanced classes, she has mastered time \nmanagement and the ability to balance academics and outside activities. \nShe has received a number of achievements for her work in various \nscience fairs, and she is also an outstanding athlete, lettering in \nindoor track, swimming, lacrosse and soccer.\n  Cadet CPO Peck is a superior, well-rounded young adult who has chosen \nto take advantage of all that life has to offer. As a member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, I am grateful to Cadet CPO Peck for \nher dedication to the United States Navy through the Naval Sea Cadet \nCorps. With so many opportunities ahead after high school, I am \nconfident that whichever avenue she chooses to pursue, she will bring \ngreat energy and leadership to it.\n  I ask my Senate colleagues to join with me in congratulating this \nfine young leader as she is recognized as the 2001 NSCC Cadet of the \nYear and recipient of the Willis E. Reed Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3988-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING REVEREND DR.

Mr. President, I am delighted to rise today with my \ncolleague Senator Bayh to congratulate the Pike County School \nCorporation located in Petersburg, IN on being named ``One of the Best \n100 School Districts in the United States'' for the year 2000 by the \nWall Street Journal and Offspring magazine. The Pike Country school \nadministrators, teachers, and students should take great pride in this \noutstanding accomplishment. This award is based on academic excellence \nin standardized testing such as the SAT, ACT, Indiana's ISTEP+ test, \nthe number of National Merit Scholars produced by the district, \ncommunity living costs, and dollar expenditures per student.\n  In October 1996, I had the distinct honor of meeting with the student \nbody at Pike Central Middle High School. I was able to address the \nstudent body and saw first hand the hard work and dedication of the \nschool's administrators and teachers. After addressing the student body \nI had the pleasure of going for a run with a group of Pike County \nstudents. It's a high honor to be standing on the floor of the Senate \ntoday reflecting on that visit and recognizing Pike County schools for \ntheir outstanding achievements.\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\n  National recognition of Pike County's educational accomplishments is \nparticularly timely as the Senate commences debate on President Bush's \nEducation program. The schools of Pike County have set standards that \nall school districts across this great nation should strive to emulate. \nFive years ago, Pike County School Corporation developed and \nimplemented a district- wide plan to improve scores at all grade \nlevels. They aggressively used standardized tests at all grade levels \nto ensure classroom standards were being met and student weaknesses \nwere being addressed. Their efforts resulted in a significant increase \nin the percentage of students from Pike County meeting Indiana's \nacademic standards. Also, the number of students attending college \nafter high school graduation nearly doubled during the 1998-99 school \nyear, the year that was used for the national study conducted by \nOffspring Magazine.\n  Using Title 1 funds, the Pike County School Corporation developed an \nearly-childhood program that targeted pre-school and kindergarten \nchildren. Using a corporation-developed assessment process, four-year-\nold students were placed into the county's three elementary schools for \nhalf-day pre-school classes, with five-year-olds invited to participate \nin extended-day kindergarten. This program has played an important role \nin the dramatic rise of Pike County ISTEP+ test scores at the third \ngrade level.\n  Additionally, and of particular note, Pike County School Corporation \nwas able to accomplish these goals while spending approximately $6,500 \nper student year, one of the lowest spending rates per student in the \ncountry. As quoted from Offspring magazine, ``the hallmark of a top-\nrated school district isn't necessarily how much money it has to spend, \nbut how it spends the money it has.''\n  This great recognition is a tribute to the superlative efforts of the \nmembers of the local school board, the school administration, teachers, \nand support staff of the PCSC. I congratulate Pike County School \nCorporation and the Pike County community, and wish them continued \nacademic success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3989-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NALC FOOD DRIVE STATEMENT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this year marks the ninth \nanniversary of ``Stamp Out Hunger,'' the largest one-day food drive in \nthe United States. I strongly commend and congratulate the National \nAssociation of Letter Carriers, NALC, for sponsoring this annual event, \nand marvel at its rapid expansion, beginning in only ten cities in \n1992, it now spans over 10,000 cities and towns across our nation.\n  More than 1,500 NALC branches, including the California State \nAssociation of Letter Carriers in my home State, will participate in \nthis year's ``Stamp Out Hunger.'' On May 12, the second Saturday in \nMay, residents across the country will be asked to place boxes and bags \nof food next to their mailboxes, where postal workers will pick them \nup, sort them, and deliver them to community food banks, shelters and \npantries.\n  The success of this program can be seen in the staggering volume of \ndonations: more than 392 million pounds of food have been collected in \nthe program's history. However, what impresses me most is the strong \ncommitment of our nation's postal workers and citizens to end hunger. \nThe only way we will put an end to poverty is to follow their example \nand take action, become involved, make a concerted effort. I urge all \nAmericans to participate in ``Stamp Out Hunger'' on May 12 to put an \nend to the poverty that is plaguing far too many children, men and \nwomen in our communities and across our nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3989-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EISLEBEN LUTHERAN CHURCH\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments on the \n150th anniversary of the Eisleben Lutheran Church in Scott City, MO.\n  Since the first congregation of nineteen members gathered on April \n30th 1848, Eisleben Lutheran Church has grown to become a part of \nMissouri history. Eisleben Lutheran Church's first house of worship was \na log cabin built in the area now known as Scott City. The area \nsurrounding the church was mostly wooded hills and large swamps which \nwere impassible much of the year. In 1867 the second facility known as \nRock Church was built.\n  Today the congregation worships in a church that was completed in \n1913 using the stones from the original Rock Church.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize a group \nof students from Wilson High School in Florence, SC who recently \nparticipated in the ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the \nConstitution'' national finals in Washington, D.C. April 21-23. They \ntested their knowledge of American constitutional government against 49 \nother student groups from across the country in a familiar format to \nthose of us in the Senate, a congressional hearing. During the \nsimulated hearing, students testified as constitutional experts before \na panel of judges. Fifteen students, led by their teacher Yvonne \nRhodes, represented Wilson at the competition. They were: Lakisha \nBoston, Lynette Carr, Christine Chen, Rebecca Derrick, Ashunti \nDrummond, Elizabeth Fortnum, Albert Hayward, Anthony Henderson, \nBenjamin Ingram, Janny Liu, Christina Moss, Jason Owens, Anna Stewart, \nTyler Thomas and Dheepa Varadarajan. I commend these students for their \nimpressive performance in the ``We the People . . .

Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues \nto join me in congratulating Garfield Middle School in Albuquerque, \nwhich is celebrating its 50th anniversary today, April 26. Built to \nserve Albuquerque's growing North Valley, the school first opened for \nthe 1950-51 school year. First built with the intention of serving as \nan elementary school, Garfield actually became the fourth public junior \nhigh school to open in my hometown.\n  Mr. Walter McNutt was Garfield Middle School's first principal. It \nwas under this distinguished man that I served as a public school \nteacher shortly after graduating from the University of New Mexico. I \ntaught math and coached baseball at the school in the 1955-56 school \nyear.\n  The Garfield Middle School's long-held mission has been to foster a \nsense of community among its students, parents and school staff as a \nmeans of boosting pupil achievement.\n  With a multi-cultural enrollment ranging over the years from 650-\n1,200 students, Garfield has earned a number of award-winning and \nnationally-recognized programs.\n  I am proud to also point out that Garfield is actively involved in a \nprogram that is close to my heart, Character Counts. The school is \nnationally recognized as having one of the finest Character Counts \nprograms in the United States. At the school they teach the six pillars \nof good character: responsibility, respect, trustworthiness, fairness, \ncitizenship, and caring.\n  I applaud Garfield Middle School for its accomplishments and as it \ncelebrates its 50th Anniversary, we wish them much continued success in \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3989-5", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3989-S3990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to\n\n[[Page S3990]]\n\nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3990-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3990-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:23 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 503.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah relative to the repealing, rescinding, and \n     superseding of any and all existing applications to Congress \n     for a constitutional convention previously made; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 15\n\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the state of Utah, acting with \n     the best of intentions, has, at various times, previously \n     made applications to the Congress of the United States of \n     America for one or more constitutional conventions for \n     general purposes or for the limited purposes of considering \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States of \n     America on various subjects and for various purposes;\n       Whereas, former Justices of the United States Supreme Court \n     and other leading constitutional scholars are in general \n     agreement that a constitutional convention, notwithstanding \n     whatever limitations have been specified in the applications \n     of the several states for a convention, would have within the \n     scope of its authority the complete redrafting of the \n     Constitution of the United States of America, thereby \n     creating an imminent peril to the well-established rights of \n     the people and to the constitutional principles under which \n     we are presently governed;\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States of America \n     has been amended many times in the history of the nation and \n     may yet be amended many more times, and has been interpreted \n     for 200 years and been found to be a sound document which \n     protects the rights and liberties of the people without the \n     need for a constitutional convention;\n       Whereas, there is no need for--rather, there is great \n     danger in--a new constitution, the adoption of which would \n     only create legal chaos in America and only begin the process \n     of another two centuries of litigation over its meaning and \n     interpretation; and\n       Whereas, such changes or amendments as may be needed in the \n     present Constitution may be proposed and enacted, pursuant to \n     the process provided therein and previously used throughout \n     the history of this nation, without resort to a \n     constitutional convention: now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, By the Legislature of the state of Utah that any \n     and all existing applications to the Congress of the United \n     States of America for a constitutional convention or \n     conventions heretofore made by the Legislature of the state \n     of Utah under Article V of the constitution of the United \n     States of America for any purpose, whether limited or \n     general, be hereby repealed, rescinded, and\n\n[[Page S3992]]\n\n     canceled and rendered null and void to the same effect as if \n     the applications had never been made; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah urges \n     the legislatures of each and every state which have applied \n     to Congress for either a general or a limited constitutional \n     convention to repeal and rescind the applications; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to \n     presiding officers of both houses of the legislatures of each \n     of the other states of the Union, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-23. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature from \n     the State of Utah relative to a standard national poll \n     closing time; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n                         House Resolution No. 6\n\n       Whereas, during election night in 2000, television networks \n     made declarations of victory for both candidates for \n     President of the United States before the polls had closed;\n       Whereas, in one erroneous declaration, the winner of the \n     eventually decisive state of Florida was announced hours \n     before polls in the western region of the nation were closed \n     and before all polls in western Florida had closed;\n       Whereas, when news services declare winners before the \n     nation's polls close, voters in states where polls are not \n     yet closed may conclude that their vote will not affect the \n     outcome and choose not to vote;\n       Whereas, releasing the vote count results for states whose \n     polls are closed before the closure of polling places in \n     other regions of the country can distort the results of an \n     election by suggesting that votes not yet cast will have no \n     bearing on the outcome;\n       Whereas, in close races like the most recent election of \n     President of the United States, declarations of victory \n     before polls close can affect the outcome of the vote;\n       Whereas, a uniform poll closing time would prevent the \n     publicizing of early election returns in one region of the \n     nation from impacting the vote in other regions;\n       Whereas, if a uniform poll closing time was established for \n     the Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Pacific time zones, \n     polling places in western regions of the country could open \n     earlier on the morning of election day to compensate for \n     their earlier closing time; and\n       Whereas, uniform poll closing times in these time zones \n     would significantly reduce the possibility that an election \n     could be tainted by premature declarations of victory: now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of the State of Utah urge \n     the United States Congress to institute uniform poll closing \n     times for states in the Eastern, Central, Mountain, and \n     Pacific time zones; be it further\n       Resolved, that the United States Congress review the \n     factors that contributed to the problems in the 2000 General \n     Election vote for the Presidency of the United States; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this resolution be presented to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-24. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah relative to the enhancement and \n     modernization of Social Security; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                         House Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, Social Security is a federal program that requires \n     almost unanimous participation by employed workers in the \n     state of Utah and throughout the United States;\n       Whereas, the retirement portion of the Social Security tax \n     is high, having risen from an initial rate of 1% of the first \n     $3,000 of a worker's income, up to a maximum of $30 per year, \n     to the present rate of 12.4% of the first $80,400 of employee \n     wages or self-employment income up to a maximum of $830.80 \n     per month or $9,969.60 per year.\n       Whereas, the maximum Social Security retirement tax, paid \n     by almost 11 million workers, has risen 5.51% in 2001 over \n     the year 2000, and is now 57% higher than in 1990;\n       Whereas, because neither the employee's direct tax \n     contribution to Social Security nor the employer's \n     contribution on the employee's behalf appears on the \n     employee's federal tax return, few employees understand the \n     amount of Social Security retirement tax they actually pay \n     each month;\n       Whereas, individuals can estimate their own Social Security \n     tax cost by estimating 1% of annual compensation paid each \n     month--for example, an annual income of $30,000 would yield \n     an estimated monthly Social Security retirement tax cost of \n     $300 per month.\n       Whereas, the Social Security retirement tax consumes nearly \n     every dollar that many workers of modest income might \n     otherwise be able to save and invest;\n       Whereas, because higher income workers are better able to \n     save and invest over and above the amounts paid in Social \n     Security taxes, escaping Social Security dependence, but \n     modest income workers cannot, the system creates \n     disproportionate dependence on the system by low and middle-\n     income workers;\n       Whereas, for many lower income American workers, the Social \n     Security retirement tax represents virtually all of the \n     monthly retirement savings they assemble;\n       Whereas, with the individual retirement benefit currently \n     ranging from a low of just a few dollars per month to a high \n     of approximately $1,400 per month, and the average monthly \n     retirement benefit currently at about $845 per month, Social \n     Security retirement benefits amount to a below poverty level \n     subsistence for many retirees;\n       Whereas, although Social Security was originally intended \n     to merely supplement other core retirement income sources, \n     the high tax rate prohibits many workers from ever adequately \n     saving and investing, and as a consequence, Social Security \n     has become the core retirement income source for many \n     Americans;\n       Whereas, national demographics have shifted significantly \n     since the system was created as a part of President \n     Roosevelt's New Deal policies;\n       Whereas, in 1945, 41.9 workers supported each retiree, and \n     today just 3.3 workers support each retiree;\n       Whereas, the ratio is expected to dwindle to 2 workers per \n     retiree within the next 30 years, making the current system \n     unsustainable;\n       Whereas, tax receipts currently exceed benefit payments, \n     yet, Social Security Trustees estimate that benefit payments \n     will exceed tax receipts, producing annual deficits, \n     beginning in approximately 15 years, or the year 2015;\n       Whereas, the Social Security Trustees estimate the \n     cumulative annual deficits for years 2015 through 2075 to \n     reach $21.6 trillion;\n       Whereas, it is unethical to perpetuate a system that \n     accrues benefits for a current generation of retirees at the \n     expense of younger workers who will likely never collect \n     benefits but will inherit the mounting debt;\n       Whereas, the current system is unfair to future retirees \n     because after a lifetime of paying into the system, a worker \n     retains no legal right nor claim to any amount or benefit, \n     but is subject to future congresses who will set the benefit \n     rates;\n       Whereas, the current system is unfair to those who die \n     prematurely because it is possible to pay for a lifetime into \n     the system yet draw only minimal benefit or even no benefit \n     prior to death and leave no residual value to any heir;\n       Whereas, the current system is unfair to widows and \n     widowers because they must forego either their own benefit or \n     their deceased spouse's benefit (``widow(er)'' benefit), and \n     may claim the widow(er) benefit only after attaining \n     qualification age themselves regardless of the age of the \n     deceased spouse;\n       Whereas, the current system is unfair to women who leave \n     employment to raise families because many women in Utah and \n     throughout the United States work and pay retirement taxes \n     into the system for many years but never complete the \n     required 10 years or 40 quarters, before leaving employment, \n     making them ineligible for retirement benefits;\n       Whereas, the system is unfair to some ethnic minorities, \n     including African-Americans, whose life expectancies are \n     shorter and will typically collect benefits for a shorter \n     time period;\n       Whereas, retirement security is best achieved by regularly \n     saving and investing one's own money over a lifetime of work, \n     and public policy regarding Social Security should support, \n     facilitate, and encourage saving rather than discourage or \n     deter it;\n       Whereas, the objective of Social Security privatization is \n     for individual workers to have legal ownership in a \n     retirement asset that can be used and ultimately passed on to \n     heirs;\n       Whereas, even with modest return assumptions, the private, \n     individually owned account can be expected to produce a \n     significantly enhanced retirement income;\n       Whereas, private individually owned accounts accrue value \n     and future benefits to the workers regardless of future \n     congressional actions;\n       Whereas, private, individually owned accounts grow on \n     behalf of the worker whether or not the worker completes 40 \n     quarters of contributions;\n       Whereas, private, individually owned accounts can be passed \n     on by inheritance to spouses, children, or grandchildren, \n     affording an opportunity for long-term-generational wealth \n     accumulation:\n       Whereas, a national system of private, individual accounts \n     can be perpetuated without end and without concern for \n     projected dates of insolvency;\n       Whereas, private, individual accounts afford workers the \n     opportunity to select from among multiple investment options, \n     including government bonds or prudent, diversified investment \n     models like those used by large pension or endowment funds;\n       Whereas, workers around the world are embracing privatized \n     systems as a workable solution to an overburdened government \n     Social Security program;\n       Whereas, the successful pioneer Chilean model was commenced \n     20 years ago with at least seven other Latin American \n     countries following suit;\n       Whereas, Great Britain, Australia, and Singapore have also \n     adopted private options, similar reforms are underway in \n     Russia, Hungary, Poland, and Kazakhstan, and the People's \n     Republic of China have embraced a private option with workers \n     contributing one-half of their retirement funds into an \n     individual account system since 1996;\n       Whereas, some U.S. workers have enjoyed a private account \n     system as certain municipalities, including Galveston, Texas \n     were allowed to opt out of Social Security in favor of a \n     privatized system prior to 1981; and\n\n[[Page S3993]]\n\n       Whereas, since many Americans are unable to save and invest \n     for retirement beyond the 12.4% payroll tax, a privatized \n     Social Security option may be the only hope for many lower \n     income or economically disadvantaged Americans to achieve \n     financial empowerment and retirement security: now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah urge \n     the United States Congress to enact legislation to allow \n     individual workers to choose to remain in the current system \n     or to select a private account option. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urge that the legislation \n     not disrupt the benefits paid to existing Social Security \n     recipients. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the legislation create private accounts to \n     be owned and controlled by individual employees or workers, \n     allow the individual employee or worker discretion to invest \n     among multiple prudent and diversified investment options, \n     and create minimum guaranteed income, disability, and death \n     benefits in the private account. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representative, the \n     President of the United States Senate, and the members of \n     Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-25.

Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor recognize \n     the sacrifices of the downwinders, uranium miners, and all \n     other participants and victims of the Cold War, and their \n     losses due to this tragedy. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to \n     Downwinders, Inc. and the members of Utah's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-26.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine relative to Support Pay Equity; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the average American woman who works full time \n     earns approximately 74 cents for each dollar that an average \n     man earns working full time, and the average woman working \n     full time in Maine earns approximately 73 cents for each \n     dollar that an average man working full time in Maine earns; \n     and\n       Whereas, the significant pay gap between men and women \n     performing jobs of comparable skill, effort and \n     responsibility, even when wages are adjusted for levels of \n     education, contributes to the disproportionately high poverty \n     rate among women and children in the State and across the \n     Nation; and\n       Whereas, Congress has found that the gender-based wage gap \n     depresses living standards for American women and their \n     families, harms their health and efficiency, prevents the \n     maximum utilization of available labor resources and tends to \n     cause labor disputes, thereby burdening, affecting and \n     obstructing commerce and creating unfair methods of \n     competition; and\n       Whereas, justice requires that women be paid fairly for the \n     value of their work; and\n       Whereas, the average wage gap between men and women has \n     continued for decades without significant improvement, \n     notwithstanding federal and state laws that prohibit \n     discrimination in compensation for equal work on the basis of \n     sex, including the federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, \n     Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the \n     Maine Revised Statutes, Title 26, section 628; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the President of the United States and the \n     Congress of the United States strengthen efforts to ensure \n     that women are paid fairly for their work; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the United States, \n     to the President of the United States Senate, to the Speaker \n     of the United States House of Representatives and to each \n     Member of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S3993-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. McCain, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation, with an amendment:\n       S. 319: A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to \n     ensure that air carriers meet their obligations under the \n     Airline Customer Service Agreement, and provide improved \n     passenger service in order to meet public convenience and \n     necessity.

A bill to expand the class of beneficiaries who may apply for \nadjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act by extending the deadline for classification petition \nand labor certification filings; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join Senator Hagel, \nSenator Schumer, and Senator Clinton in introducing legislation to \nextend section 245(i), a vital provision of U.S. immigration law, which \nenables persons who are eligible for green cards to adjust their status \nin the U.S., rather than have to return to their country of origin to \ndo so. Last year, Congress made a major effort to bring greater \nfairness to the nation's immigration laws. The Legal Immigration Family \nEquity Act was a sensible compromise worked out on a bipartisan basis \nto deal with many of the injustices that have been so harmful and so \nunfair to so many immigrant families in recent years. Included in the \nlegislation was a partial restoration of 245(i).\n  Under last year's legislation, however, immigrants are required to \nfile their petition by April 30th to qualify for 245(i). This fast-\napproaching deadline is causing fear and confusion around the country. \nEligible immigrants are struggling to file their petitions by April \n30th, but little time remains. Across the country, we hear that many \nqualified persons will not be able to file their petitions by this \ndeadline, because not enough attorneys and legal service organizations \nare available to handle their cases.\n  The legislation we are introducing will extend the deadline to April \n30, 2002, and provide needed and well-deserved relief to members of our \nimmigrant communities. Spouses, children, parents and siblings of \npermanent residents and U.S. citizens will be able to adjust their \nstatus in the U.S., and avoid needless separation from their loved \nones. Similarly, businesses will be able to retain valued employees. In \naddition, the INS will receive millions of dollars in additional \nrevenues, at no cost to taxpayers.\n  Extending the section 245(i) deadline is pro-family and pro-business, \nand it is also good economic policy and good immigration policy. It is \nconsistent with the goal of legislation to reunite immigrant families.\n  Representatives Peter King and Charles Rangel have introduced similar \nlegislation in the House. Congress needs to act quickly to pass this \nimportant legislation. I hope that our Republic and Democratic \ncolleagues will join us in supporting this needed extension.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 779. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \ncertain hospital support organizations as qualified organizations for \npurposes of section 514(c)(9); to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that would \nextend to qualified hospital support organizations the debt-financed \nproperty rules that currently apply to tax-exempt education \ninstitutions and pension funds. This measure is of great importance to \nthe 18,000 inpatients and the more then 200,000 outpatients who receive \nhealth care services from the Queen's Health System of Hawaii. \nCurrently, Federal tax laws that were enacted in 1969 stand between the \nwishes of Queen Emma Kaleleonalani who, in 1885, bequeathed land to the \nQueen Emma Foundation to support the Queen's Health System, and the \ncitizens of Hawaii who depend on the Queen's Health System for health \ncare services.\n  The foundation is a nonprofit, tax-exempt, public charity. Its \npurpose is to support and improve health care services in Hawaii by \ncommitting funds generated by foundation-owned properties to the \nQueen's Medical Center, an accredited teaching hospital in Honolulu \nthat maintains an emergency room open to all, regardless of ability to \npay, and that admits Medicare and Medicaid patients. The foundation and \nthe medical center are members of the Queen's Health Systems, which \nalso operates Molokai General Hospital, a small community hospital on \nthe island of Molokai. Additionally, Queen's operates clinics on \nvarious islands, provides home health care services, supports nursing \nprograms at Hawaiian colleges and universities, operates a medical \nlibrary, holds health fairs, and provides other educational services \nfor the benefit of the Hawaiian community.\n  Presently, the funds that enable the foundation to support these \nservices are generated by Foundation-owned properties that were \nbequeathed more than 100 years ago by Queen Emma. Most of the \nfoundation's land is now encumbered by long-term, fixed-rent commercial \nand industrial ground leases. The returns from these ground leases are \nextremely low, and under their terms, the foundation is unable to \nincrease rents to keep pace with the appreciation of land values in \nHawaii. The foundation would like to increase its cash flow by buying \nout the current leases and re-leasing the land at existing market \nrates. The foundation would also like to upgrade the improvements on \nits lands to further enhance their revenue-generating potential. \nHowever, current debt-financed property rules under the unrelated \nbusiness income tax would subject the revenues earned by the foundation \nfrom its improved properties to income tax, significantly reducing the \nfunds available to the foundation to meet its obligation to provide \nquality health care services to the citizens of Hawaii.\n  Colleges, universities, and pension funds are currently exempt from \nthe debt-financed property rules. The foundation seeks the same \ntreatment that presently applies to educational institutions and \npension funds. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 779\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

For purposes of this subparagraph, a refinancing of \n     such an eligible indebtedness shall be considered qualified \n     if such refinancing does not exceed the amount of the \n     refinanced eligible indebtedness immediately before the \n     refinancing.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to indebtedness incurred on or after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 780. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nindividuals who do not itemize their deductions a deduction for a \nportion of their charitable contributions, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that\n\n[[Page S3997]]\n\nwould create a new era in charitable giving across America. My bill, \nthe Neighbor to Neighbor Act, includes provisions that would allow tax-\nfree distribution of IRA accounts for charitable purposes, and give \nnonitemizers the same deduction that itemizers enjoy. It would also \nallow the deduction for charitable gifts of long-term capital gain \nproperty to be subject to an annual limit of 50 percent of adjusted \ngross income instead of the current 30 percent limitation. It would \nincrease the carryover period for charitable deductions from five years \nto ten years; and it would exclude a charitable deduction from the \nthree percent reduction rule. My bill would allow a taxpayer to deduct \ncharitable contributions up until April 15th, and finally, the Neighbor \nto Neighbor Act would repeal the current two percent excise tax on \nprivate foundations.\n  My bill would greatly simplify one of the most complex provisions in \nthe tax code. The tax code should reward the generosity of good-hearted \nAmericans, it should not penalize those who choose to give to those in \nneed.\n  IRA account owners would be permitted to make distributions from \ntheir IRAs directly to charities, either outright, or in exchange for a \ncharitable gift annuity, a charitable reminder trust, or pooled income \nfund in the Neighbor to Neighbor Act. According to the Employer Benefit \nResearch Institute, there are currently more than one trillion dollars \nin IRA accounts and five trillion dollars in defined contribution \naccounts, which can be rolled into IRA accounts.\n  I have numerous examples, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, \nfrom people who have wanted to donate their excess IRA assets to \ncharity, but were unable to because of the current tax penalties For \nexample, the ability to rollover an IRA to charity would mean literally \nmillions of dollars for Boston College. Syracuse University lost a 1.5 \nmillion-dollar gift because the donor could not rollover his IRA into a \ncharitable remainder trust.\n  A 71-year-old male donor with a 1.3 million IRA wanted to make a life \nincome gift to a major public university in Texas. He wanted to receive \nannual income payments that would help ensure the care of his wife, who \nis in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Given the tax consequences of \nsuch a gift under current law, the donor has not been able to make the \ncharitable contribution.\n  The husband of a hospital volunteer at a medical center in Tennessee \nwould like to establish a charitable trust to benefit cancer research \nin honor of his last wife. He wants to use retirement plan assets of \n1.8 million to establish this cancer research fund, to provide himself \nwith annual payments for retirement income, and to reduce the tax \nburden on his heirs, would be greater for IRA assets than other \nappreciated securities. He has been advised against such a gift because \nof tax disincentives under current law.\n  These are just a few examples of how the current law levies \nsignificant taxes and presents serious disincentives to charitable \ngifts of these assets. Under current, law, any IRA withdrawal is fully \ntaxable as ordinary income in the year in which it occurs. A donor who \nwithdraws IRA assets in order to make a charitable gift is subject to \ntax on the entire amount withdrawn. Under very best of circumstances, \nthis amount might be offset by a charitable deduction, but even then \nthere are significant limitations.\n  My bill, which allows the tax-free distribution of individual IRA \naccounts for charitable purposes, is good public policy. Although IRA \nassets were originally intended as a supplement to retirement income, \nwithdrawal is now allowed, under certain circumstances, to assist in \nfinancing a home or a college education. It is equally appropriate for \npublic policy to allow financially successful individuals, who have \nreached a point where IRA and other tax-deferred retirement assets are \nnot needed for retirement, to use those assets, not for personal \nbenefit, but to support charities that better the lives of others.\n  The Neighbor to Neighbor Act would also allow donors who make \ncharitable contributions, but do not itemize their federal income tax \ndeductions, to be entitled to a ``direct'' charitable contribution \ndeduction. Since three out of four taxpayers do not itemize, the \ncharitable deduction is not available to most taxpayers. A report by \nPrice Waterhouse Coopers estimates that the deduction for nonitemizers \nwould translate into 11 million more donors, and could increase giving \nby as much as 14.6 billion dollars in one year.\n  The deduction also does not provide an equal treatment for all \ndonors, and it encourages fundraising efforts to focus on a small group \nof potential donors. By expanding the charitable contribution deduction \nfor nonitemizers, the playing field would be level for all donors, and \nwould lessen the role of government and the political process in \ncharitable giving.\n  People should not face disincentives that burden charitable giving. \nMy bill would allow the deduction for gifts of long-term capital gain \nproperty to public charities to be subject to an annual limit of 50 \npercent of adjusted gross income instead of the current 30 percent \nlimitation. In addition, the carryover period for charitable deductions \nthat cannot be fully used in a given tax year, due to the applicable \npercentage limitation, would be increased from the current five year to \n10 years.\n  The current percentage limitations on the deductibility of charitable \ncontributions of long-term capital gain property to public charities, \ncoupled with the reduction in the tax rates applicable to realized, \nlong-term capital gains, are having a chilling effect on immediate \ncharitable giving, the former reduces the incentive to make relatively \nlarge gifts of capital assets in the current year if the donor's \ncontribution base is relatively small, compared to the value of the \ngift that could be made.\n\n  For example, just since last June, at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical \nUniversity, four individuals have indicated an interest in giving \namounts ranging from one to three million dollars. These individuals \nhave not yet given because of the tax disincentives of the 30 percent \nrule; they can only deduct charitable contributions up to 30 percent of \ntheir adjusted gross income.\n  By increasing the income tax charitable deduction reduction \npercentage for contributions of long-term capital gain property to \npublic charities from 30 percent to 50 percent of the donor's \ncontribution base, gifts of highly-appreciated assets will be put on \npar with gifts of cash, and the tax law will again boost private \nphilanthropy in America.\n  The Neighbor to Neighbor Act would also allow a taxpayer to deduct, \nfor the current year, charitable contributions made up to the time for \nfiling the taxpayer's federal income tax return for that tax year. \nCurrently, taxpayers may contribute to their IRAs up until April 15th \nand still receive a deduction. Charitable donations should have the \nsame tax treatment.\n  Finally, this bill would repeal the excise tax imposed on the \ninvestment income of private foundations. Private foundations are \nsection 501(c)(3) charities that fund the work of a full range of \ncharitable activities across the country. They are often founded by \nindividuals or families, and their income stream comes primarily, if \nnot entirely, from earnings on their investments.\n  Repeal of the excise tax would have the effect of increasing \ncharitable contributions by hundreds of millions of dollars every year. \nThis is because private foundations are required, annually, to pay out \nfive percent of their assets in charitable distributions, and since the \nexcise tax counts as a credit toward the distribution requirement, \nrepeal would require an increase in charitable distributions by an \nequal amount.\n  The excise tax was originally enacted in 1969 as an ``audit fee,'' \nintended to offset the cost of IRS oversight of private foundations. \nBut today, the tax collects far more than the IRS needs to conduct \naudits. In 1999, the excise tax produced 500 million dollars in \nrevenue. And this year, the budget of all exempt-organization \nactivities at the IRS is only 59 million dollars. Moreover, audits of \nprivate foundations fell from 1,200 in 1990 to 191 in 1999. This \n``audit fee'' is not being used for its intended purpose.\n  The wayward use of these revenues is a good reason to repeal the tax, \nbut not as important as the work we increasingly call on charities to \nperform. With the focus of the President and the Congress on charitable \ngiving, I believe passage of the Neighbor to Neighbor Act would be one \nof the most effective steps we could take.\n\n[[Page S3998]]\n\n  If we hope that charities will join state and federal government \nefforts to provide services for disadvantaged people and otherwise \naddress important societal needs, then Congress should enhance the tax \nincentives that encourage voluntary philanthropy. Private foundations, \nlike public charities, are publicly supported to the extent that they \nreceive tax preferences. The provisions of the Neighbor to Neighbor Act \nare reasonable, efficient steps that will help charities address our \ncommon challenges; challenges we increasingly call on individuals and \nthe private sector to take.\n  In an article for The Journal of Gift Planning, President Bush \nstated, ``I believe that the government's highest calling is often \nsimply to do no harm--to instead be an enabler, a catalyst that creates \na climate that allows America's nonprofits to flourish. A government \nthat serves those who are serving their brothers and sisters. A \ngovernment that rallies the armies of compassion to heal our nation's \nills, one heart and one act of kindness at a time.'' I believe that the \nNeighbor to Neighbor Act does just that, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in support of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 781. A bill to amend section 3702 of title 38, United States Code, \nto extend the authority for housing loans for members of the Selected \nReserve; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation along \nwith Senator Jeffords that would extend the authority of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs Home Loan Guaranty Program for members of the \nSelected Reserve.\n  I am proud to be the author of the original legislation enacted in \n1992 to extend eligibility for the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program to \nNational Guard and Reserve members. Tens of thousands of dedicated \nreservists who served for at least six years, and continue to serve or \nhave received an honorable discharge, have been able to fulfill their \ndream of home ownership through this program. The participation of \nGuard and Reserve members not only benefits these service members, but \nalso stabilizes the financial viability of the program since this group \nhas had a lower default rate than most other program participants. \nFurthermore, the program serves as an important recruiting incentive \nfor the National Guard and Reserve.\n  In the 106th Congress, Senator Jeffords and I introduced legislation \nwhich resulted in the authorization for the program being extended \nthrough September 30, 2007. While this was a step in the right \ndirection, using the benefit for a recruiting incentive will no longer \nbe possible since the authority expires in six years and reservists are \nrequired to serve for at least six years before they qualify for VA-\nguaranteed loans. In order to continue using this program as a \nrecruiting incentive for a few more years, I am introducing legislation \nalong with Senator Jeffords that would extend the authority for the \nprogram through September 30, 2015.\n  The VA Home Loan Guaranty Program is an important component of a \nbenefits package which makes Guard and Reserve service more attractive \nto qualified individuals. This is of particular importance during a \ntime when the civilian sector is competing for the same pool of limited \napplicants, as well as when our military needs are becoming \nincreasingly technical, demanding only the most intelligent, motivated, \nand competent individuals. An extension of the authority will assist \nthe National Guard and Reserve with their recruitment efforts.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure which would recognize \nthe vital contributions of National Guard and Reserve members to our \ncountry, as well as ensure that VA-guaranteed housing loans can \ncontinue to be used as a recruiting incentive.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 781\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR HOUSING LOANS FOR \n                   MEMBERS OF THE SELECTED RESERVE.\n\n       Section 3702(a)(2)(E) of title 38, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``September 30, 2007'' and inserting \n     ``September 30, 2015''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 782. A bill to amend title III of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 to require, as a precondition to commencing a civil action \nwith respect to a place of public accommodation or a commercial \nfacility, that an opportunity be provided to correct alleged \nviolations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, ADA, Notification Act. This bill would amend the \nADA by including a notice requirement for violations of the ADA before \na court could assume jurisdiction over the dispute. This would allow \nbusinesses the opportunity to bring properties into compliance without \nhaving to face costly litigation.\n  The ADA currently does not contain a notice requirement, but allows \nplaintiffs to sue owners of non-compliant businesses immediately. While \nthe public accommodations provisions in Title III of the ADA do not \nallow plaintiffs to collect damages for violations of any of its access \nstandards, they do permit lawyers to collect attorneys fees. The lack \nof a notice requirement has encouraged a number of lawyers to sue \nbusinesses over infractions that are inexpensive to remedy, but for \nwhich the businesses must pay costly plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and \nexpenses.\n  I believe this legislation is a reasonable means to ensure that \nbusinesses will be given notice of violations of the ADA and the \nopportunity to comply with the ADA before costly litigation is begun. \nThis would foster greater compliance with the ADA by allowing \nbusinesses to expend their resources on making their properties more \naccessible to the disabled, rather than on attorneys' fees.\n  Please be assured that I simply want to close a loophole in the ADA \nthat unscrupulous lawyers have exploited. I do not suggest or approve \nof any changes to the ADA that would weaken its substantive \nrequirements for reasonable accommodation to persons with disabilities. \nWe must ensure that the progress begun more than a decade ago continues \nas we work to make public accommodations more accessible to everyone.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 783. A bill to enhance the rights of victims in the criminal \njustice system, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this past Sunday marked the beginning of \nNational Crime Victims' Rights Week. We set this week aside each year \nto focus attention on the needs and rights of crime victims. I am \npleased to take this opportunity to introduce legislation with my good \nfriend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and our cosponsors, \nSenators Feingold, Murray, Johnson, Schumer and Harkin. Our bill, the \nCrime Victims Assistance Act of 2001, represents the next step in our \ncontinuing efforts to afford dignity and recognition to victims of \ncrime.\n  My involvement with crime victims began more than three decades ago \nwhen I served as State's Attorney in Chittenden County, VT, and \nwitnessed first-hand the devastation of crime. I have worked ever since \nto ensure that the criminal justice system is one that respects the \nrights and dignity of victims of crime, rather than one that presents \nadditional ordeals for those already victimized.\n  I am proud that Congress has been a significant part of the solution \nto provide victims with greater rights and assistance. Over the past \ntwo decades, Congress has passed several bills to this end. These bills \nhave included: the Victims Witness Protection Act of 1982; the Victims \nof Crime Act of 1984; the Victims' Bill of Rights of 1990; the Victims' \nRights and Restitution Act of 1990; the Violence Against Women Act of \n1994; the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996; the Victim Rights \nClarification Act of 1997; the Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act \nof 1998;\n\n[[Page S3999]]\n\nand the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000.\n  The legislation that we introduce today, the Crime Victims Assistance \nAct of 2001, builds upon this progress. It provides for comprehensive \nreform of the Federal law to establish enhanced rights and protections \nfor victims of Federal crime. Among other things, our bill provides \ncrime victims with the right to consult with the prosecution prior to \ndetention hearings and the entry of plea agreements, and generally \nrequires the courts to give greater consideration to the views and \ninterests of the victim at all stages of the criminal justice process. \nResponding to concerns raised by victims of the Oklahoma City bombing, \nthe bill provides standing for the prosecutor and the victim to assert \nthe right of the victim to attend and observe the trial.\n  Assuring that victims are provided their statutorily guaranteed \nrights is a critical concern for all those involved in the \nadministration of justice. Our bill would establish an administrative \nauthority in the Department of Justice to receive and investigate \nvictims' claims of unlawful or inappropriate action on the part of \ncriminal justice and victims' service providers. Department of Justice \nemployees who fail to comply with the law pertaining to the treatment \nof crime victims could face disciplinary sanctions, including \nsuspension or termination of employment.\n  In addition to these improvements to the Federal system, the bill \nproposes several programs to help States provide better assistance for \nvictims of State crimes. These programs would improve compliance with \nState victim's rights laws, promote the development of state-of-the-art \nnotification systems to keep victims informed of case developments and \nimportant dates on a timely and efficient basis, and encourage further \nexperimentation with the community-based restorative justice model in \nthe juvenile court setting.\n  Finally, the Crime Victims Assistance Act would make several \nsignificant amendments to the Victims of Crime Act, VOCA, and improve \nthe manner in which the Crime Victims Fund is managed and preserved. \nMost significantly, the bill would eliminate the cap on VOCA spending, \nwhich has prevented more than $700 million in Fund deposits from \nreaching victims and supporting essential services.\n  Congress has capped spending from the Fund for the last two fiscal \nyears, and President Bush has proposed a third cap for fiscal year \n2002. These limits on VOCA spending have created a growing sense of \nconfusion and unease by many of those concerned about the future of the \nFund.\n  We should not be imposing artificial caps on VOCA spending while \nsubstantial unmet needs continue to exist. The Crime Victims Assistance \nAct replaces the cap with a formulaic approach, which would ensure \nstability and protection of Fund assets, while allowing more money to \ngo out to the States for victim compensation and assistance.\n  These are all matters that can be considered and enacted this year \nwith a simple majority of both Houses of Congress. They need not \novercome the delay and higher standards necessitated by proposing to \namend the Constitution. They need not wait the hammering out of \nimplementing legislation before making a difference in the lives of \ncrime victims.\n  The Judiciary Committee has held several hearings over the last five \nyears on a proposed constitutional amendment regarding crime victims. \nUnfortunately, the Committee has devoted not a minute to consideration \nof legislative initiatives like the Crime Victims Assistance Act, which \nSenator Kennedy and I first introduced in the 105th Congress, to assist \ncrime victims and better protect their rights. Like many other \ndeserving initiatives, it has taken a back seat to the constitutional \namendment debate that continues.\n  I regret that we have not done more for victims this year, or during \nthe last few years. I have on several occasions noted my concern that \nwe not dissipate the progress we could be making by focusing \nexclusively on efforts to amend the Constitution. Regretfully, I must \nnote that the pace of victims legislation has slowed noticeably and \nmany opportunities for progress have been squandered. One notable \nexception was the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of \n2000, which included a Leahy-Feinstein amendment dealing with support \nfor victims of international terrorism. Senator Feinstein cares deeply \nabout the rights of victims, and I am pleased that we could work \ntogether on some practical, pragmatic improvements to our federal crime \nvictims' laws.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration, victims \ngroups, prosecutors, judges and other interested parties on how we can \nmost effectively enhance the rights of victims of crime. Congress and \nState legislatures have become more sensitive to crime victims rights \nover the past 20 years and we have a golden opportunity to make \nadditional, significant progress this year to provide the greater voice \nand rights that crime victims deserve.\n  I would like to acknowledge several individuals and organizations \nthat have been extremely helpful with regards to the legislation that \nwe are introducing today: Dan Eddy, National Association of Crime \nVictim Compensation Boards; Steve Derene, Wisconsin Department of \nJustice Office of Crime Victims Services; Susan Howley, National Center \nfor Victims of Crime; and John Stein, National Organization for Victim \nAssistance. I would also like to thank Kathryn M. Turman, the Acting \nDirector for the Office for Victims of Crime, and Heather Cartwright \nand Carolyn Hightower of that office, for their work on this project.\n  While we have greatly improved our crime victims assistance programs \nand made advances in recognizing crime victims rights, we still have \nmore to do. That is why it is my hope that Democrats and Republicans, \nsupporters and opponents of a constitutional amendment on this issue, \nwill join in advancing this important legislation through Congress. We \ncan make a difference in the lives of crime victims right now, and I \nhope Congress will make it a top priority and pass the Crime Victims \nAssistance Act before the end of the year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the section-by-\nsection analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 783\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Authorizes \n     appropriations for grants to develop and implement community-\n     based restorative justice programs in juvenile court \n     settings.\n       Sec. 204. Funding for federal victim assistance personnel. \n     Authorizes appropriations to retain 400 full-time or full-\n     time equivalent employees to serve as victim witness \n     coordinators and victim witness advocates in Federal law \n     enforcement agencies. These positions are currently funded \n     with money from the Crime Victims Fund.\n\n\n               TITLE III--VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n       Sec. 301. Crime Victims Fund. Replaces the annual cap on \n     the Fund with a formula that ensures stability in the amounts \n     distributed to the States, while preserving the amounts \n     remaining in the Fund for use in future years. Discontinues \n     the practice of using Fund money to pay for victim assistance \n     positions in certain federal agencies; these positions would \n     now be funded through direct appropriations under section \n     204. Increases the portion of the Fund that shall be \n     available to OVC for discretionary victim assistance grants \n     and for assistance to victims of federal crime. Permits OVC \n     to retain a maximum of $50 million in an antiterrorism \n     emergency reserve that can be replenished with up to 5 \n     percent of the amounts retained in the Fund after the annual \n     Fund distribution.\n       Sec. 302. Crime victim compensation. Increases from 40 to \n     60 percent the minimum threshold for the annual grant to \n     State crime victim compensation programs. Clarifies that a \n     payment of compensation to a victim shall not reduce the \n     amount of assistance available to that victim under other \n     government programs.\n       Sec. 303. Crime victim assistance. Authorizes States to \n     give VOCA funds to U.S. Attorney's Offices in jurisdictions \n     where the U.S. Attorney is the local prosecutor. Prohibits \n     State crime victim assistance programs that receive VOCA \n     grants from discriminating against victims because they \n     oppose the death penalty or disagree with the way the State \n     is prosecuting the criminal case. Authorizes OVC to make \n     grants to eligible crime victim assistance programs for \n     program evaluation and compliance efforts.

Technical amendment to \n     section 2003 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of \n     2000 (PL 106-386), which inadvertently reversed the existing \n     exclusion under VOCA of individuals eligible for other \n     federal compensation under the Omnibus Diplomatic Security \n     and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 (ODSA). The exclusion of \n     individuals eligible for compensation under ODSA should have \n     been applied to section 1404C of VOCA, which covers direct \n     compensation to victims of international terrorism, and not \n     to section 1404B, which covers assistance to victims of \n     terrorism.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 784. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe limitation on capital losses any individual may deduct against \nordinary income, and to allow individuals a 3-year capital loss \ncarryback and unlimited\n\n[[Page S4004]]\n\ncarryovers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation that \nwould soften the blow that many investors have felt as the stock market \nhas declined. My bill would raise the capital loss limit that can be \napplied against ordinary income. Currently, the limit is $3,000. Under \nmy proposal, the limit would rise to $20,000. Moreover, my legislation \nallows individual taxpayers to carryback capital losses three years to \noffset prior capital gains.\n  This bill reflects the reality of what has happened to many millions \nof investors. In the past year, more than $4.5 trillion of wealth has \nbeen wiped out as our economy has slowed and the markets have declined. \nFor many investors, when they file their taxes next year, they are \ngoing to find that if they have no offsetting gains they are only going \nto be allowed to write off $3,000 of their loss. Of course, they can \ncarry forward that loss. But for an investor who has net capital losses \nof $20,000 this year he or she will not be able to completely write off \nthat investment loss until 2007, assuming no future capital gains. With \n$40,000 of losses, it would take until 2014 to write off those losses.\n  The capital loss/ordinary income limit has been in place since 1976. \nIt seems to me that with 25 years of inflation, that $3,000 limit is \nfar too low. Moreover, I have always believed that if we want to \nencourage investors to take financial risks investing in new frontier \ntechnologies, we should cushion the financial blow when the venture \ndoes not succeed. The best way to do that is to allow them to write off \na greater portion of their loss immediately.\n  The bill also allows individuals the opportunity to carry back losses \nin the same fashion that is allowed to corporations. If their capital \nlosses exceed their capital gains they would be able to carry those \nlosses back three years to offset capital gains incurred in prior \nyears. While I recognize that this may create some complexity for \ntaxpayers since it would require the filing of amended returns, I \nbelieve it is an appropriate and fair way to deal with capital losses. \nIf a corporation can take advantage of this benefit, it seems only fair \nto give that same benefit to individuals.\n  I would certainly like to see the capital gains rate lowered. But as \none Wall Street executive recently was quoted: ``The last time I \nlooked, you had to have gains for this to make any difference.'' I \ncertainly think the proposal I have offered would certainly make a \ndifference to many millions of taxpayers who have suffered grievous \nlosses in the market this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n   There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 784\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit the importation of diamonds from countries \nthat have not become signatories to an international agreement \nestablishing a certification system for exports and imports of rough \ndiamonds or that have not unilaterally implemented a certification \nsystem meeting the standards set forth herein; to the Committee on \nFinance\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the purpose of the Conflict Diamonds Act of \n2001 is to eliminate the illegal diamond trade that has fueled violent \nconflicts in the African nations of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Congo, \nAngola, Ivory Coast, and Burkina Faso. The sale of illicit diamonds has \nallowed criminal gangs like the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra \nLeone to buy arms and supplies in an effort to expand their influence. \nIn the process, they have inflicted unspeakable pain, including torture \nand amputation, on the innocent people they encounter.\n  The Conflict Diamonds Act of 2001 bans the importation into the \nUnited States of diamonds from countries that fail to observe an \neffective diamond control system. Under this legislation, no diamond \nthat has ever been in the possession of the RUF or any other rebel \ngroup will be allowed to enter the United States. This includes \ndiamonds that pass through another country for cutting or setting. The \nConflict Diamonds Act of 2001 authorizes the President of the United \nStates to ban the importation of diamonds and diamond jewelry from \ncountries if he believes that shipments from those countries violate \nthe legislation's intent. Those who knowingly violate the import ban \nwould be subject to criminal and civil penalties under existing U.S. \nCustoms law. The Customs Service would be authorized to seize illicit \nshipments. The import ban would take effect six months after enactment, \nregardless of the status of negotiations for an international \nagreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 787\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Conflict Diamonds Act of \n     2001.\n\n        TITLE I--PROHIBITION ON IMPORTATION OF CONFLICT DIAMONDS\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) The use of funds from illegitimate diamond trade to \n     support conflicts in Africa has had devastating effects on \n     the peoples of the regions involved in those conflicts;\n       (2) U.N. Security Council Resolution 1173 of June 12, 1998 \n     requires the United States and all other U.N. members to take \n     the necessary measures to prohibit the direct or indirect \n     importation from Angola to their territory of all diamonds \n     that are not controlled through the Certificate of Origin \n     regime of the Government of Unity and National Reconciliation \n     (GURN);\n\n[[Page S4005]]\n\n       (3) U.N. Security Council Resolution 1306 of July 5, 2000 \n     requires the United States and all other U.N. members to take \n     the necessary measures to prohibit the direct or indirect \n     importation of all rough diamonds from Sierra Leone into \n     their territory that are not controlled by the Government of \n     Sierra Leone through its Certificate of Origin regime;\n       (4) U.N. Security Council Resolution 1344 of March 8, 2001 \n     requires the United States and all other U.N. members to take \n     the necessary measures to prevent the direct or indirect \n     import of all rough diamonds from Liberia, whether or not \n     such diamonds originated in Liberia;\n       (5) Effective compliance with U.N. Security Council \n     Resolutions 1173, 1306, and 1344 is necessary to eliminate \n     trade in conflict diamonds;\n       (6) Although the President of the United States has issued \n     Executive Orders to implement Resolution 1173 and Resolution \n     1306, additional measures are needed to ensure compliance \n     with, and prevent circumvention of, those resolutions;\n       (7) Further measures are needed to prevent rough diamonds \n     originating in other rebel-controlled conflict areas from \n     entering the global stream of commerce in which legitimate \n     diamonds are sold;\n       (8) The resolution of the United Nations General Assembly \n     approved on December 1, 2000 provides important guidance on \n     devising effective and pragmatic measures to address the \n     problem of conflict diamonds; and,\n       (9) Since legitimate diamond trade is of great economic \n     importance to developing countries in Africa, no law should \n     be enacted, nor regulation or other measure implemented, that \n     would impede legitimate diamond trade or diminish confidence \n     in the integrity of the legitimate diamond industry.\n\n     SEC. 102. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (a) The term ``diamond'' means a natural mineral consisting \n     of essentially pure carbon crystallized in the isometric \n     system with a hardness of 10 on the Mohs scale, a specific \n     gravity of approximately 3.52, and a refractive index of \n     2.42.\n       (b) The term ``rough diamond'' means a diamond that is \n     unworked or simply sawn, cleaved or bruted, as described in \n     Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States subheading \n     7102.31.0000.\n       (c) The term ``conflict diamond'' means a diamond that has \n     at any time been in the possession of any person belonging to \n     or associated with armed insurgents, rebel forces, or any \n     other movement using violence against civilians or \n     internationally recognized governments.\n\n     SEC. 103. RESTRICTIONS ON THE IMPORTATION OF DIAMONDS.\n\n       (a) No person may enter into the customs territory of the \n     United States or aid or abet an attempt to enter any diamond, \n     including any diamond set in jewelry, that has been mined in, \n     or mined and set in, and exported directly from, the Republic \n     of Sierra Leone, the Republic of Angola, or the Republic of \n     Liberia except for a diamond or a diamond set in jewelry:\n       (1) the country of origin of which has been certified as \n     the Republic of Sierra Leone by the internationally \n     recognized government of that country, in accordance with \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1306 of July 5, \n     2000; or\n       (2) the country of origin of which has been certified as \n     the Republic of Angola by the internationally recognized \n     government of that country, in accordance with United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1173 of June 12, 1998.\n       (b) No person may enter into the customs territory of the \n     United States or aid or abet an attempt to enter any diamond \n     directly from a country that: is subject to a United Nations \n     Security Council resolution similar to those identified in \n     subsection (a) or that is not a signatory to an international \n     agreement that establishes a certification system for exports \n     and imports of rough diamonds, that has not unilaterally \n     implemented such a system, or that is not a ``cooperating \n     country'' as defined in subsection (c) of section 105 of this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 104. PROHIBITION OF OTHER IMPORTS TO PREVENT \n                   CIRCUMVENTION OF U.N. RESOLUTIONS.\n\n       The President of the United States is authorized to \n     prohibit the importation of diamonds or diamond jewelry \n     exported from any country except for rough diamonds \n     whose country of origin has been certified as either the \n     Republic of Angola or the Republic of Sierra Leone under \n     the Certificate of Origin regimes described in section 103 \n     (a) (1) or (2), if there are reasonable grounds to believe \n     that such prohibition is necessary to carry out U.N. \n     Security Council Resolution 1173, 1306, or 1344, or any \n     other Resolution banning the exportation or importation of \n     conflict diamonds.\n\n     SEC. 105. IMPLEMENTING MEASURES.\n\n       (a) The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States is \n     authorized to make such rules and regulations as may be \n     necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. The public \n     will be notified and given an opportunity of at least 30 days \n     to comment on all proposed rules and regulations before they \n     take effect.\n       (b) These regulations will provide that an importer is \n     entitled to rely on the country of origin marking that is \n     required under 19 U.S.C. Sec. 1304. However, nothing in this \n     Act shall be construed to override an importer's duty to \n     exercise reasonable care.\n       (c) No later than six months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury will issue a list of \n     countries that are signatories to the international agreement \n     described in Title II, have unilaterally implemented a \n     certification system containing the elements described in \n     subsection (b) of section 203, or are found to be \n     ``cooperating'' countries as defined in this subsection. The \n     Secretary of the Treasury will revise and update this list as \n     necessary. For purposes of this subsection, the Secretary of \n     the Treasury will find that a country is ``cooperating'' if \n     it is acting in good faith to establish and enforce a \n     unilateral certification system meeting the standards \n     described in subsection (b) of section 203 or taking action \n     to ensure that it is not facilitating trade in conflict \n     diamonds. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with \n     appropriate agencies, shall develop and publish criteria that \n     will be used to evaluate whether a country will be deemed a \n     cooperating country. These criteria will be subject to public \n     notice and comment before adoption in final form.\n       (d) The Secretary of the Treasury may extend cooperating \n     country status for more than six months after the initial \n     designation, but shall provide to Congress an explanation of \n     the reasons for why such an extension is necessary.\n       (e) The President of the United States shall ensure that \n     implementation of and compliance with Title I of this Act is \n     monitored by appropriate agencies or by an independent body.\n\n     SEC. 106. PENALTIES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE.\n\n       (a) Civil and criminal penalties.--Any person who enters or \n     introduces into the commerce of the United States, attempts \n     to enter or introduce, or aids or abets an attempt to enter \n     or introduce, merchandise in violation of Title I of this Act \n     or the implementing regulations for Title I will be subject \n     to civil and criminal penalties in effect under the customs \n     laws of the United States, as set forth in Title 19 of the \n     United States Code. The same administrative procedures and \n     defenses that apply under Title 19 of the United States Code \n     will apply to penalties that are sought to be assessed under \n     this subsection.\n       (b) Seizure.--If the Customs Service has reasonable cause \n     to believe that a person has violated the provisions of \n     subsection (a) of this section and that seizure is essential \n     to prevent the introduction of merchandise into the customs \n     territory of the United States whose importation is \n     prohibited by Title I of this Act, then such merchandise may \n     be seized. Within a reasonable time after any such seizure is \n     made, the Customs Service will issue to the person concerned \n     a written statement containing the reasons for the seizure. A \n     person may seek relief from seizure under the procedures and \n     standards prescribed in 19 U.S.C. Sec. 1618 and the Customs \n     Service regulations that implement that provision.\n       (c) Court of International Trade Proceedings.--\n       (1) Jurisdiction.--Section 1582 of Title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by amending paragraph (1) to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(1) to recover a civil penalty under section 592, 593A, \n     641(b)(6), 641(d)(2)(A), 704(i)(2), or 734(i)(2) of the \n     Tariff Act of 1930.\n       (2) Standard of Review.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, in any proceeding commenced by the United \n     States in the Court of International Trade for the recovery \n     of any monetary penalty under this section, all issues, \n     including the amount of any penalty, shall be tried de novo.\n       (d) Proceeds from Fines and Seized Goods.--The proceeds \n     derived from penalties and seizures under Title I of this Act \n     will, in addition to amounts otherwise available for such \n     purposes, be available only for programs to assist the \n     victims of conflicts involving illicitly traded diamonds.\n\n     SEC. 107. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       The President of the United States will report to Congress \n     no later than 180 days after enactment of this Act and \n     annually thereafter on the implementing measures taken to \n     carry out the provisions of this Title and their \n     effectiveness in stopping imports of conflict diamonds into \n     the United States.\n\nTITLE II--NEGOTIATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT TO ELIMINATE TRADE \n                          IN CONFLICT DIAMONDS\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) The most effective and desirable means of eliminating \n     international trade in conflict diamonds is through \n     international cooperative efforts involving governments, the \n     private sector, civil society, and appropriate international \n     organizations;\n       (2) The initiatives of the world diamond industry, as \n     reflected in the Resolution of the World Federation of \n     Diamond Bourses and the International Diamond Manufacturers \n     Association in Antwerp on July 19, 2000, as well as the \n     efforts of the South African-led Working Group on African \n     Diamonds and the World Diamond Council in developing \n     proposals for a global certification system for rough \n     diamonds, are important efforts at international cooperation \n     and may provide effective mechanisms that could be \n     incorporated in an international agreement to eliminate trade \n     in conflict diamonds;\n       (3) Eliminating imports of rough diamonds from countries \n     where conflict diamonds are mined, transshipped, or \n     subsequently shipped into countries where cutting and \n     polishing occur is the most effective way to eliminate trade \n     in conflict diamonds;\n\n[[Page S4006]]\n\n     SEC. 202. SENSE OF CONGRESS--NEGOTIATION OF INTERNATIONAL \n                   AGREEMENT.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the President should \n     engage in negotiations on and seek to conclude an \n     international agreement to eliminate trade in conflict \n     diamonds as soon as possible.

A bill to amend title 37, United States Code, to establish an \neducation savings plan to encourage reenlistments and extensions of \nservice by members of the Armed Forces in critical specialties, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that \nwill provide military personnel the ability to provide for the \neducation of their spouses and children in return for their commitment \nto continue to serve in the armed forces.\n  The purpose of this bill is to promote retention of members of the \narmed forces in critical specialties by establishing a bonus savings \nplan that will provide significant resources for meeting the expenses \nencountered by service members in providing for the education of \nmembers of their families.\n  I met with the Senior Enlisted Advisors of the four armed services \nand the Coast Guard. These Senior Enlisted Advisors are the top \nenlisted person in their respective services. Their job is to advise \nthe Service Chief on matters pertaining to enlisted personnel. These \nexperienced senior leaders are among the most significant resources \navailable to the generals and admirals, and those of us here in \nCongress, as we seek answers to questions on recruiting, retention, and \nquality of life. These enlisted leaders know first-hand and fully \nunderstand the life, the demands on and concerns of enlisted personnel \nin their services.\n  In my meeting with the Senior Enlisted Advisors, I sought their \ninsight on what factors enlisted service members consider when making \nthat critical decision as to whether to continue their active service \nor leave the military. I found myself talking to the very people who \nhave faced the stress of these decisions; who have sat with their \nspouses and families and discussed whether to stay in the military or \nleave and seek a career outside the military. They were very frank and \ncandid in their discussions.\n  One thing I learned is that, like many of us, enlisted service \nmembers share the goal of giving their children better opportunities \nthan they had. To a person, the Senior Enlisted Advisors said that \nbeing able to provide educational opportunities for their families is \nan important goal and would be a powerful retention tool.\n  My bill will provide enlisted service members in critical \nspecialties, who agree to serve a six-year term, resources that can be \napplied to cover the expenses of higher education for their families. \nLet me explain how this will work.\n  Service members, officers or enlisted, in critical specialties, who \nreenlist or extend their service commitment for six years will receive \nUnited States Savings Bonds that can be redeemed to cover educational \nexpenses. When these Savings Bonds are redeemed to cover educational \ncosts, the income, under the current tax code, is tax exempt. My bill \ndoes not modify the tax code. My proposal will take advantage of \ncurrent tax law as it pertains to United States Savings Bonds used for \neducational purposes.\n  Military personnel who have less than three years of service when \nthey reenlist or extend their commitment will receive Savings Bonds \nwith a face value of $5,000. For those service members who have between \nthree and nine years of service when they reenlist or extend their \ncommitment will receive Savings Bonds with a face value of $15,000. \nThose members with more than nine years of service who reenlist or \nextend their commitment will receive Savings Bonds with a face value of \n$30,000.\n  A Service Member who reenlists at the two-year point and receives \n$5,000 in Savings Bonds subsequently reenlists at the end of his six-\nyear commitment--now with eight years of service--would receive an \nadditional $10,000 in Savings Bonds, for a total of $15,000. This \nservice member could reenlist again at the conclusion of the second \nsix-year term,--now in his 14th year--and would receive an additional \n$15,000 for a career total of $30,000 in United States Savings Bonds \nthat can be used for educational purposes. All tax free.\n  My bill will provide military personnel the capability to provide for \nthe education of their spouses and children while investing in America.\n  I am introducing this bill today to enhance the benefits President \nBush announced at Fort Stewart, Georgia, on Monday. The President \nannounced that his budget will include $5.7 billion in additional \nbenefits for military personnel; $1.4 billion to increase military\n\n[[Page S4007]]\n\npay and allowances; $3.9 billion for military health care; and $0.4 \nbillion for improvements to military housing. These increases are much \nneeded and the announcement was enthusiastically received by the men \nand women at Fort Stewart, Georgia who know the sacrifices they are \nrequired to make in service of their country. My bill enhances \nPresident Bush's initiatives by providing educational opportunities \nthat are unavailable today to the children of military personnel. I \nwill hold hearings later this year in the Armed Services Committee to \nfurther develop each of these initiatives.\n  My bill furthers the educational opportunities for military families, \nincreases military readiness by retaining the highly-trained and \nexperienced military personnel we need to continue to be the preeminent \nmilitary force in the world, and accomplished these lofty goals by \ninvesting in America. I urge my colleagues to examine my bill and join \nSenator Warner and I as cosponsors of this important initiative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 789\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to promote the retention of \n     members of the Armed Forces in critical specialties by \n     establishing a bonus savings plan that provides significant \n     resources for meeting the expenses encountered by the members \n     in providing for the education of the members of their \n     families and other contingencies.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Federal rules of Criminal Procedure; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Video \nTeleconferencing Improvements Act. This bill will expand the use of \nvideo teleconferencing in criminal court matters, and promote a safer \nand more efficient federal court system.\n  The federal courtroom, just like all society, is benefiting from \nconstant advances in technology today. Video teleconferencing is one \nexample of this movement. It allows proceedings to operate more \nefficiently and at lower costs, while maintaining many of the benefits \nof communicating in person.\n  The use of video teleconferencing is becoming increasingly common in \nfederal district and appellate courts for various proceedings, such as \nprisoner civil rights complaints and certain appellate matters. The \nstate courts are also benefiting from video technology in many ways, \nincluding for pretrial criminal proceedings. However, in federal court, \nthe use of this technology in criminal matters is almost nonexistent \nbecause the federal rules apparently require the defendant's physical \npresence in court.\n  This legislation would amend the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \nto allow the judge to hold pretrial proceedings, including the \ndefendant's arraignment and initial appearance, through video \nteleconferencing. It would also allow for the sentencing to occur in \nthis manner in special, limited circumstances.\n  Today, some districts have extremely high volumes of criminal cases \nthat they must process. This is especially true in the Border States, \nwhere the number of immigrants who are caught crossing the Mexican \nBorder or committing crimes in the United States has skyrocketed and \ncontinues to rise. This creates a great burden and expense on the \nMarshals Service, which must transport the prisoners, often for very \nlong distances from the holding facility to a far away courthouse. This \ntype of transportation in creases the possibility for escape and can \ncreate a security risk for law enforcement, court personnel, and the \npublic.\n\n[[Page S4008]]\n\n  Pretrial proceedings are often very short and routine. If they can be \nconducted through video, the inmates can stay at the secure facility, \ngreatly decreasing risk and costs. If Marshals could spend less time on \nother duties, such as apprehending dangerous fugitives from justice. \nMoreover, this process would help the courts efficiently manage their \nincreasing caseloads.\n  Similarly, I believe that video teleconferencing could be very \nimportant for sentencing defendants in certain limited circumstances. \nThis is especially true when there is a safety or security risk in \ntransporting the prisoner to the courthouse.\n  For example, in an ongoing case in South Carolina, a dangerous repeat \noffender was sentenced to a long prison term at the maximum security \nfederal prison in Florence, Colorado. However, the court of appeals \nrequired that he be sentenced again. The Federal Bureau of Prisons \nconsidered him a danger to transport. He had a long history of \npsychiatric problems and violent behavior, including repeatedly \nassaulting prison guards and other inmates. In this case, he had even \nthreatened the sentencing judge and the Assistant U.S. Attorney. Rather \nthan transporting the prisoner back to South Carolina, the judge \nresentenced him by video teleconferencing. However, the case is now on \nappeal, and there is legal precedent not allowing this practice. In my \nview, there is simply no reason why a judge should be prohibited from \nsentencing by video in these circumstances.\n\n  This legislation is not an attempt to eliminate criminal defendants \nfrom appearing in person before the judge. Defendants would still be in \ncourt for all phases of the trial, which this bill would not effect. In \nfact, criminal trials must be conducted in person because the accused \nhas the constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. \nFurther, even with these changes, the judge would maintain the \nauthority to hold any pretrial or sentencing proceeding in person if he \nwished. This bill would simply give him the authority to conduct \ncertain routine matters, other than the trial, through video \nteleconferencing.\n  The Rules Committee of the Judicial Conference has been considering \nthis video technology for some time, and recently proposed some of the \nspecific changes that are included in this legislation. I hope they \nwill provide judges discretion to conduct pretrial proceedings by video \nteleconference, and go even further than the formal proposals that they \nhave considered to date.\n  My legislation will help eliminate legal impediments to the \nreasonable use of video teleconferencing and help courts take advantage \nof new technology. These reforms are needed today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 791\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit the targeted marketing to minors of adult-\nrated media as an unfair or deceptive practice, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senators \nKohl, Clinton, and Byrd today in introducing legislation to stop the \nentertainment industry from deceptively marketing adult-rated material \nto children, legislation that hopefully will make the hard job of \nraising kids in today's culture a little easier for America's parents.\n  As my colleagues may recall, Federal Trade Commission released a \ngroundbreaking report last fall documenting the seriousness of this \nproblem. Specifically, the FTC found that the movie, music, and video \ngame industries had been routinely and aggressively targeting the sale \nof heavily-violent, adult-rated products to children. Some companies \nwere going so far as to conduct focus groups for R-rated slasher films \nwith 9- and 10-year olds and to pass out promotional materials for \nother violent R-rated movies at Campfire Girl meetings and Boys and \nGirls Clubs.\n  This report engendered a lot of outrage, and with good reason. These \nindustries were making a mockery of the ratings systems that they had \ncreated and promoted. They were also making an end run around America's \nparents, in effect cutting out the middle mom and dad to target \nviolent, harmful materials directly to children. The report also \ngenerated a number of promises from the offending industries to change \ntheir ways and strengthen their self-regulatory programs.\n  This week, the FTC released a follow-up report to evaluate how well \nthe entertainment industry has done in keeping its promises, and there \nwas some encouraging news. The FTC found in their snapshot survey that \nthe movie and video game industries had made real progress in limiting \ntheir advertising in popular teen venues and in providing more rating \ninformation in their marketing.\n  Other independent analyses show similarly encouraging results. Ad \nrevenues for R-rated films on MTV are apparently declining. Disney, \nWarner Brothers, and Fox have pledged not to market R-rated movies to \nchildren. And several other studios have decided against making or \ndistributing heavily-violent movies that were once regularly targeted \nat kids.\n  I appreciate these steps, which may well result in reduced revenues \nfor some of these companies, and which show that our government can \nwork on behalf of parents to prod the entertainment industry to draw \nsome lines to protect our children without approaching censorship.\n  But much as I appreciate this progress, I cannot really give a full-\nblow hooray for Hollywood, because the FTC report makes clear that this \nproblem has not been solved. Some video game makers and movie studios, \nincluding those that have pledged not to unfairly target kids, are \nstill advertising adult-rated products in places popular with young \nteens. And the leading music companies and their trade group, the RIAA, \nhave sadly been MIA, doing little if anything to respond to the FTC \nreport and curb the marketing of obscenity-laced records to kids.\n  I am also concerned about the future. The FTC rightly recommended \nthat the lasting solution to this problem is responsible self-\nregulation, specifically, uniform policies adopted by the entertainment \nindustry prohibiting the targeting of adult-rated material to children \nand meaningful sanctions to enforce those standards. Unfortunately,\n\n[[Page S4009]]\n\nto date only the video game industry has agreed, and commendably so, to \nmeet this recommendation and truly police themselves. That means there \nis no permanent mechanism of accountability for the movie and music \nindustries, no ongoing norm or standard that says it is wrong to market \nadult-rated material to children. And I fear that the competitive \npressures in these markets are so intense that they will once again \nlead companies to do exactly that once the scrutiny goes away.\n  That is why I feel we must go forward with a legislative response. \nThe bill we are introducing today would provide a narrowly-tailored \nshield to help protect our children from this kind of unfair and \nunhealthy targeting. It would treat the marketing of adult-rated \nmovies, music recordings, and video games to children like any other \ndeceptive act that harms consumers, and give the FTC the same authority \nit has under the current false and deceptive advertising laws to bring \nactions against companies that engage in deceptive practices. In \nparticular, it would give the FTC the authority to penalize companies \nthat violate this provision with civil fines of up to $11,000 per \noffense.\n  Some will claim this is censorship. But the truth is we're not \nempowering the FTC to regulate content in any way or even to make \njudgments about what products are appropriate for children. We are \nsimply saying that if you voluntarily label a product as being \nunsuitable for kids, and then turn around and market it in a way that \ndirectly contradicts that rating, you should be held accountable, just \nlike any other company that misleads consumers. That's not censorship, \nthat's common sense.\n  The bottom line here is that the First Amendment is not a license to \ndeceive. And this legislation translates that important principle into \npolicy. It says to the people who run the entertainment industry that \nthey cannot have it both ways. They cannot label their products for \nadults and target them to kids. And they cannot continue to undermine \ntheir ratings and undercut the authority of parents.\n  I ask my colleagues today on both sides of the aisle for their \nsupport on this bill and the ongoing effort to help protect their \nchildren from harmful media messages. I thank the chair, and ask \nunanimous consent that my statement and bill be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 792\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Media Marketing \n     Accountability Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Children have easy access to a variety of media and \n     entertainment options without leaving their own homes. The \n     vast majority of homes with children have a VCR, a CD player, \n     and either a video game console or a personal computer.\n       (2) Children, and especially teenagers, spend a large \n     amount of time listening to music, seeing movies, and playing \n     video games. Specifically:\n       (A) Children ages 8 through 13 spend approximately 3 hours \n     per week in a movie theater, on average. In addition, 62 \n     percent of children ages 9 through 17 spent an average of 52 \n     minutes per day watching video tapes.\n       (B) 82 percent of children play video games, and do so for \n     33 minutes per day, on average.\n       (C) Children ages 14 through 18 listen to music \n     approximately 2\\1/2\\ hours per day on average.\n       (3) Teenagers spend tens of millions of dollars annually on \n     movies, music, and video games, making them a highly valuable \n     demographic group to the producers and distributors of \n     entertainment products.\n       (4) Media violence can be harmful to children. Most \n     scholarly studies on the impact of media violence find a high \n     correlation between exposure to violent content and \n     aggressive or violent behavior. Additional studies find a \n     high correlation between exposure to violent content and a \n     desensitization to and acceptance of violence in society.\n       (5) On September 11, 2000, the Federal Trade Commission \n     reported that companies in the music, movie, and video game \n     industries routinely target children under age 17 in the \n     advertisement of adult-rated products. Specifically:\n       (A) The Commission found that 80 percent of the R-rated \n     movies studied had been targeted to children. In addition, \n     marketing plans for 64 percent of the R-rated movies studied \n     explicitly mentioned children under age 17 as part of the \n     target audience.\n       (B) The Commission found that all marketing plans for music \n     recordings with explicit content labels either explicitly \n     mentioned children under age 17 as part of the target \n     audience or called for ad placement in media that would reach \n     a majority or substantial percentage of children under age \n     17.\n       (C) The Commission found that 70 percent of Mature-rated \n     video games studied were targeted to children under age 17, \n     and 51 percent explicitly mentioned children under age 17 as \n     part of the target audience. Additionally, the Commission \n     found that 91 percent of the video game manufacturers studied \n     had at one time expressly identified children under age 17 as \n     the core, primary, or secondary audience of an M-rated game.\n       (6) To correct this problem, the Commission called on these \n     industries to adopt voluntary, uniform policies expressly \n     prohibiting these practices and to enforce these policies \n     with real sanctions for violations.\n       (7) To date, as the Commission noted in a follow-up report \n     released on April 24, 2001, only the video game industry has \n     agreed to adopt such a marketing code. The Commission also \n     noted that, despite some encouraging changes in behavior \n     since the release of the Commission's original report in \n     2000, a number of companies in all three industries have \n     nevertheless continued to market adult-rated products in \n     venues popular with children.\n       (8) Because the entertainment industry continues to target \n     its advertising of adult-rated products to children, there is \n     need for narrowly targeted legislation to prohibit, as a \n     false and deceptive trade practice, the targeting of children \n     in the advertisement and other marketing of products rated \n     for adults, and to authorize the Federal Trade Commission to \n     stop these practices.\n\n      TITLE I--TARGETED MARKETING OF ADULT-RATED MEDIA TO CHILDREN\n\n     SEC. 101. PROHIBITION ON TARGETED MARKETING TO MINORS OF \n                   ADULT-RATED MEDIA AS UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE \n                   PRACTICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The targeted advertising or other \n     marketing to minors of an adult-rated motion picture, music \n     recording, or electronic game, in or affecting commerce, \n     shall be treated as a deceptive act or practice within the \n     meaning of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 45), and is hereby declared unlawful.\n       (b) Treatment as Targeted Advertising or Marketing to \n     Minors.--For purposes of this section, the advertising or \n     other marketing of an adult-rated motion picture, music \n     recording, or electronic game shall be treated as targeted \n     advertising or other marketing of such product to minors if--\n       (1) the advertising or marketing--\n       (A) is intentionally directed to minors; or\n       (B) is presented to an audience of which a substantial \n     proportion is minors; or\n       (2) the Commission determines that the advertising or \n     marketing is otherwise directed or targeted to minors.\n\n     SEC. 102.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Adult-rated.--The term ``adult-rated'', in the case of \n     a motion picture, music recording, or electronic game, means \n     a rating or label voluntarily assigned by the producer or \n     distributor of such product, including a rating or label \n     assigned pursuant to an industry-wide rating or labeling \n     system, which rating or label--\n       (A) indicates or signifies that--\n       (i) such product is or may be appropriate or suitable only \n     for adults; or\n       (ii) access to such product by minors should be restricted; \n     or\n       (B) in the case of a music recording, advises or signifies \n     that such product may contain explicit content, including \n     strong language or expressions of violence, sex, or substance \n     abuse.\n       (2) Minor.--The term ``minor'' means an individual below \n     the age established under the rating or labeling system in \n     question to be an appropriate audience for adult-oriented \n     material, but in no event includes an individual 17 years of \n     age or older. If no specific age is so established under the \n     rating or labeling system in question, the term means an \n     individual less than 17 years of age.\n       (3) Adult.--The term ``adult'' means an individual who is \n     no longer a minor.\n       (4) Electronic game.--The term ``electronic game'' means \n     any interactive entertainment software, including any \n     computer game, video game, or on-line game, sold or rented on \n     any tangible medium or by any electronic or on-line medium by \n     which the right to play a specified interactive-\n     entertainment-software product is purchased.\n       (5) Motion picture.--The term ``motion picture'' means any \n     theatrical motion picture shown in a commercial theater or \n     sold or rented by videotape, digital recording, or other \n     tangible medium or by any electronic or on-line medium by \n     which the right to play an individual theatrical motion \n     picture is purchased, except that such term shall not include \n     anything shown on broadcast television or cable television.\n       (6) Music recording.--The term ``music recording'' means \n     any recording of music sold or rented on compact disk, tape \n     cassette, vinyl record, music video, or other tangible medium \n     or by any electronic or on-line medium by which the right to \n     hear a specified work of music is purchased, except that such \n     term shall not include anything shown on broadcast television \n     or cable television.\n\n     SEC. 107. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title shall take effect 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n                        TITLE II--OTHER MATTERS\n\n     SEC. 201. STUDY OF MARKETING PRACTICES OF ENTERTAINMENT \n                   INDUSTRIES REGARDING ADULT-RATED MATERIALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Federal Trade Commission shall conduct \n     a study of the advertising and other marketing practices of \n     the motion picture industry, music recording industry, and \n     electronic game industry regarding adult-rated motion \n     pictures, music recordings, and electronic games.\n       (b) Matters To Be Studied.--In conducting the study under \n     subsection (a), the Commission may examine--\n       (1) whether and to what extent the industries referred to \n     in that subsection direct to minors the advertising and \n     marketing of adult-rated materials, including--\n       (A) whether such materials are advertised or promoted in \n     media outlets in which minors are present in substantial \n     numbers or comprise a substantial percentage of the audience; \n     and\n       (B) whether such industries use other marketing practices \n     designed to attract minors to such materials;\n       (2) whether and to what extent retail merchants, movie \n     theaters, or others who engage in the sale or rental for a \n     fee of products of such industries--\n       (A) have policies to restrict the sale, rental, or viewing \n     to or by minors of adult-rated materials; and\n       (B) have procedures to ensure compliance with such \n     policies;\n       (3) whether and to what extent such industries require, \n     monitor, or encourage the enforcement of their voluntary \n     rating or labeling systems by industry members, retail \n     merchants, movie theaters, or others who engage in the sale \n     or rental for a fee of the products of such industries;\n       (4) whether and to what extent such industries engage in \n     activities to educate the public in the existence, use, or \n     efficacy of their voluntary rating or labeling systems; and\n       (5) whether and to what extent the policies and procedures \n     referred to in paragraph (2), any activities referred to in \n     paragraphs (3) and (4), and any other activities of such \n     industries are effective in restricting the access of minors \n     to adult-rated materials.\n       (c) Factors in Determination.--In determining whether the \n     products of an industry are adult-rated for purposes of \n     subsection (b), the Commission shall use the voluntary \n     industry rating or labeling system of the industry, both as \n     in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act and as \n     modified after that date.\n       (d) Authorities.--In conducting the study under subsection \n     (a), the Commission may use its authority under section 6(b) \n     of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 46(b)) to \n     require the filing of reports or answers in writing to \n     specific questions, as well as to obtain information, oral \n     testimony, documentary material, or tangible things.\n       (e) Reports.--\n       (1) Requirement.--The Commission shall submit to Congress \n     and the public two reports on the study under subsection (a), \n     as follows:\n       (A) An initial report, not later than two years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (B) A final report, not later than six years after that \n     date.\n       (2) Elements.--Each report under paragraph (1) shall \n     include--\n       (A) a description of the study conducted under subsection \n     (a) during the period covered by the report;\n       (B) any findings and recommendations of the Commission \n     arising out of the study as of the end of that period; and\n       (C) the identification of the particular producers and \n     distributors, if any, engaged in advertising or other \n     marketing practices relevant to such findings and \n     recommendations.\n       (f) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``adult-\n     rated'', ``electronic game'', ``motion picture'', ``music \n     recording'', and ``minor'' have the meanings given those \n     terms in section 106.\n\n     SEC. 202. SEPARABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, or the application of such \n     provision to any person, partnership, corporation, or \n     circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of this Act, and \n     the application of such provision to any other person, \n     partnership, corporation, or circumstance, shall not be \n     affected thereby.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nLieberman to introduce the Media Marketing Accountability Act of 2001. \nFor too long, the entertainment industry has drawn a bullseye on our \nchildren's backs, targeting them with violent video games, movies and \nmusic. Media violence has a clear and dangerous effect on our children, \nand it must be curbed.\n  Last fall's Federal Trade Commission report confirmed some of our \nworst fears. It found that more than 70 percent of movie, video game \nand music companies aggressively marketed their violent, adult-rated \nproducts to children. And while this week's report showed some \nmeaningful progress, the ``snapshot'' it took didn't exactly reveal a \npretty picture. Last fall, Senator Lieberman and I pledged not to sit \nby idly. Today we're here to make good on our promise.\n  This legislation is simple. It targets the worst behavior. The \nentertainment industry won't be able to speak out of both sides of \ntheir mouths anymore, saying that a product is harmful to children, but \nthen luring them into the theaters or stores to see it or buy it. This \nbill gives the Federal Trade Commission the authority it needs to go \nafter the bad actors who try to mislead our families and our children.\n  Let me be a little more specific about what the bill does. This \nlegislation gives the FTC the authority to prosecute entertainment \ncompanies for deceptive trade practices if they target adult-rated \nentertainment to children. This legislation doesn't create a whole new \nstructure of rules and punishments; it simply adds this bad behavior by \nentertainment companies to a list of misconduct that the FTC already \nhas the power to punish.\n  But the bill also rewards companies for good behavior. It includes a \nsafe harbor which shields companies from prosecution if they already \nabide by a self-regulatory system that includes an age-based rating \nsystem, prohibits the marketing of adult rated material to children, \nand punishes for non-compliance. Finally, the legislation calls for\n\n[[Page S4011]]\n\ntwo additional studies by the FTC over the next six years.\n  Let me give you a concrete example of the type of behavior this bill \naims to prohibit. Last fall's report uncovered a film industry practice \nof including young children in the test groups for R-rated films. \nStudios asked ten-year-olds to explain what they like about a violent, \nR-rated movie, and then the studio used the feedback to tailor their \nadvertising campaign to lure youngsters into the theaters. We all agree \nthis behavior is just plain wrong, and it is this kind of behavior that \nour legislation will penalize.\n  Our bill does not touch the content produced by the industry, it \nsimply targets specific, egregious behavior. After all, no one is \nsaying that the entertainment industry doesn't produce high-quality and \nimportant products. But we all agree that not every product is \nappropriate for children, and the Federal Government has a legitimate \ninterest in protecting children, a vulnerable audience, from being \ntargeted with violent and vulgar content that the industry itself has \nidentified as inappropriate. Our narrowly tailored legislation will \nhelp protect children and families from this kind of deception.\n  Finally, our bill should not discourage the entertainment industry \nfrom rating its products. To begin with, companies that are already \nregulating themselves effectively will qualify for protection under our \nsafe harbor. The industry's threat to alter or eliminate their rating \nsystems is as irresponsible to families as the behavior we're trying to \nprohibit with this measure. But beyond that, enactment of this \nlegislation would not translate to constant legal action against the \nentertainment industry. The Federal Trade Commission would only \nprosecute those companies who have clearly and flagrantly targeted \nchildren with adult-rated material. As long as companies advertise \ntheir adult-rated products to a logical target audience, they should \nhave no concern about this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 796. A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to ensure that \ndrinking water consumers are informed about the risks posed by arsenic \nin drinking water, to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have had the same 50 parts per billion \nstandard for arsenic in our drinking water since 1942. Since then, \nstudy after study has confirmed that this level of arsenic in our \ndrinking water is unsafe. After decades of review, a final drinking \nwater standard was finally set to go into effect in March of this year. \nThe new standard would have required no more than 10 parts per billion \narsenic in drinking water.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush Administration stopped this new rule from \ngoing into effect. This decision was a major blow to public health in \nthis country. Arsenic causes lung cancer, skin cancer, and bladder \ncancer. We know that if you drink water at the current standard for \narsenic you have a 1 in 100 chance of getting cancer. The Bush \nAdministration has decided that we can wait, despite mountains of \nscientific evidence on the serious health threat posed by arsenic. By \nsuspending the new arsenic standard, the President is preventing \ncommunities from getting started on the upgrades they need to make to \ntheir drinking water systems. This is unacceptable, and I am a co-\nsponsor of legislation that would restore the 10 parts per billion \nstandard.\n  Another consequence of the Bush Administration's decision to suspend \nthe new rule for arsenic has received less attention but is also very \nimportant. The suspended rule contained provisions on the public's \nright to know what level of arsenic is in its drinking water and what \nthe possible health effects may be. The suspended rule requires notice \nto consumers containing very specific information on the health risks \nposed by arsenic. This notice would have been required at 5 parts per \nbillion. This is less than the maximum level permitted in drinking \nwater, but is necessary because there is still a risk posed by arsenic \nat this level.\n  I believe that the public has a right to know if there is an \nenvironmental threat in their community. If the public is fully \ninformed about environmental threats, they may have the opportunity to \navoid them. So, today I am introducing the ``Community Right to Know \nArsenic Risk Act.''\n  My bill would restore the requirements in the suspended rule on the \npublic's right to know. It would ensure that notice is given at the 5 \nparts per billion level.\n  The level of arsenic found in drinking water in many communities \nposes a serious risk to public health. I am especially concerned about \nthe most vulnerable members of the community, including children, the \nelderly, and AIDS or cancer patients, to name a few. I am committed to \nfull disclosure to consumers of both the levels of arsenic in drinking \nwater and the possible health effects. Drinking water that may meet \nfederal standards still may pose health risks that should be known to \nthe consumer. This is certainly the case with arsenic. The consumer \nshould have the right to choose alternative water sources or to seek \ntighter standards. This is a minimum requirement. I encourage my \ncolleagues to co-sponsor this legislation and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 796\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Right-to-Know \n     Arsenic Risk Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NOTICE CONCERNING RISKS POSED BY ARSENIC IN DRINKING \n                   WATER.\n\n       Part F of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j-21 et \n     seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 1466.

Mr. President, on April 7, the Boston College Eagles Ice \nHockey Team defeated the Fighting Sioux of the University of North \nDakota 3-2 in overtime to win the NCAA national championship. The \nvictory marked the first national championship in ice hockey for Boston \nCollege since 1949, and all of us in Massachusetts are proud of them \nfor their outstanding season.\n  An overtime goal for Boston College by Krys Kolanos produced the \nvictory and made up for last year's 4-2 defeat by North Dakota in the \nchampionship game. Chuck Kobasew and Mike Lephart scored the other two \ngoals for Boston College, and goalie Scott Clemmensen did an excellent \njob as well, with 34 saves.\n  The Boston College team compiled an extraordinary record of 33 wins, \neight loses, and two ties during the season. Coach Jerry York, a native \nof Watertown, Massachusetts, had been a star for the Eagles in the 1967 \nseason, was an indispensable part of this year's championship \nachievement as was all the members on the team.\n  The Eagles were led effectively this season by captain Brian Gionta \nand assistant captains Bobby Allen and Mike Lepart. I welcome this \nopportunity to commend all of the players for their brilliant success, \nBill Cass, Anthony D'Arpino, Ales Dolinar, Justin Dziama, Ben Eaves, \nTom Egan, J.D Forrest, Jeff Giuliano, Ty Hennes, Marty Hughes, Tim \nKelleher, Mark McLennan, Brooks Orpik, Brett Peterson, Joe Schuman, Rob \nScuderi, Dan Sullivan, and Tony Voce. I also commend Coach York's \nassistant coaches, Mike Cavanaugh, Jim Logue, and Scott Paluch.\n  The Boston College Eagles are flying high. Massachusetts is proud of \ntheir championship season, and I urge the Senate to approve this well, \ndeserved resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article on the championship Eagles \nfrom the Boston College newspaper ``The Chronicle'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Boston College Chronicle, Apr. 12, 2001]\n\n ``Eagles Rule Roost--University Celebrates Hockey Team's NCAA Frozen \n                             Four Triumph''\n\n                            (By Sean Smith)\n\n       On a glorious spring day, the Boston College community paid \n     tribute Monday afternoon to its men of winter.\n       A jubilant crowd of well-wishers and special guests--\n     including Gov. Paul Cellucci, '70, JD '73, and Boston Mayor \n     Thomas Menino--packed Conte Forum to honor the national \n     champion Eagles hockey team, which won the National \n     Collegiate Athletic Association ``Frozen Four'' tournament \n     Saturday night with a 3-2 overtime victory over defending \n     champion North Dakota in Albany, NY.\n       BC has a 2-0 lead late in the third period before North \n     Dakota rallied to tie. Krys Kolanos, '04, scored less than \n     five minutes into the extra period to notch the win, giving \n     the Eagles their second NCAA hockey championship, and first \n     in 52 years.\n       Freshman Chuck Kobasew--named the Frozen Four Most \n     Outstanding Player--and senior Mike Lephart each scored in \n     the second period for BC's other goals.\n       WEEL-AM sports announcer Ted Sarandis served as master of \n     ceremonies at Monday's celebration, where small children in \n     kid-sized BC hockey shirts cheered the champions alongside \n     elderly alumni and current students in maroon and gold \n     regalia. One alumnus in the crowd received special notice: \n     James Fitzgerald, '49, who scored the winning goal in BC's \n     1949 championship.\n       University President William P. Leahy, SJ, thanking coach \n     Jerry York and his players for ``a memorable season,'' said \n     their efforts exemplified BC as ``an institution dedicated to \n     excellence, in the classroom, the laboratory and the hockey \n     rink.''\n       Cellucci, preparing to start his new job as United States \n     ambassador to Canada, said his last proclamation as governor \n     was to designate April 9, 2001, as ``BC Eagles Hockey Day in \n     Massachusetts.''\n       Menino extended his congratulations not only to the team \n     but also to the parents ``who drove you to the hockey rinks \n     all those mornings.''\n       ``Wow!'' said Athletic Director Gene DeFilippo as he began \n     his remarks. ``Does it get any better that this?'' He rattled \n     off an impressive list of group and individual achievements \n     by the team's eight seniors, including 117 victories, four \n     Frozen Four and three NCAA title game appearances.\n       York, who was treated to a standing ovation and cheers of \n     ``Jer-EE! Jer-EE!'' by the crowd, thanked his assistants and \n     support staff, and praised the players for ``representing \n     this world-class university in a world-class manner.''\n       After senior captains Brian Gionta, Bobby Allen and Lephart \n     offered their own thanks and praises, the moment the crowd \n     had waited for arrived. To the strains of ``We Are the \n     Champions,'' the players skated around the rink holding aloft \n     the NCAA championship trophy.\n       The team has at least one more celebration in its future: \n     an invitation to the White House, on a date to be confirmed \n     later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S4012-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 77--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS BY THE \n     PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON \n                          GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Con. Res. 34\n\n       Whereas the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia, and \n     Lithuania were forcibly and illegally incorporated into the \n     Soviet Union from 1940 until 1991;\n\n[[Page S4013]]\n\n       Whereas from 1940 to 1991, thousands of Estonians, \n     Latvians, and Lithuanians were executed, imprisoned, or \n     exiled by Soviet authorities through a regime of brutal \n     repression, Sovietization, and Russification in their \n     respective nations;\n       Whereas despite the efforts of the Soviet Union to \n     eradicate the memory of independence, the Baltic people never \n     lost their hope for freedom and their long-held dream of full \n     independence;\n       Whereas during the period of ``glasnost'' and \n     ``perestroika'' in the Soviet Union, the Baltic people led \n     the struggle for democratic reform and national independence; \n     and\n       Whereas, in the years following the restoration of full \n     independence, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have \n     demonstrated their commitment to democracy, human rights, and \n     the rule of law, and have actively participated in a wide \n     range of international structures, pursuing further \n     integration with European political, economic, and security \n     organizations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) congratulates Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania on the \n     tenth anniversary of the restoration of their full \n     independence; and\n       (2) calls on the President to continue to build the close \n     and mutually beneficial relations the United States has \n     enjoyed with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania since the \n     restoration of the full independence of those nations.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators Dodd and \nVoinovich, fellow members of the Commission on Security and Cooperation \nin Europe, in submitting a Concurrent Resolution congratulating the \npeople of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania on the tenth anniversary of \nthe restoration of their full independence. The resolution also calls \non the President of the United States to build upon the close and \nmutually beneficial relations with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania that \nhave existed since the restoration of their full independence.\n  This year marks the tenth anniversary of the reestablishment of full \nindependence to the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania \nafter almost five decades of illegal and brutal incorporation into the \nSoviet Union. The Baltic nations were independent between World War I \nand World War II. Their freedom and independence were stolen from them \nin a secret deal struck between Hitler and Stalin.\n  During the Soviet era, thousands of Estonians, Latvians, and \nLithuanians were executed, imprisoned or exiled by the Soviet regime as \nMoscow attempted to repress any resistance to its rule. Besides \nphysically persecuting individuals, the Soviet Union also tried to \ndestroy the rich heritage of the Baltic people, by degrading their \nculture and attempting to replace their native languages with Russian.\n  It didn't work. The Baltic people never gave up their hope for \nfreedom and their long-held dream of independence.\n  Moreover, during the Soviet period of ``glasnost'' and \n``perestroika,'' the Baltic people led the struggle for democratic \nreform and national consciousness. In the ten years following the \nrestoration of their full independence, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania \nhave demonstrated their commitment to democracy, human rights, and rule \nof law at home. At the same time, they have actively participated in a \nwide range of international structures, while pursuing further \nintegration into European political, economic and security \norganizations.\n  Earlier today I had the pleasure to meet with President Vike-\nFreiberga of Latvia, in my capacity as Chairman of the Commission on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. I was joined by Co-Chairman Chris \nSmith and fellow Commissioner Zach Wamp. President Vike-Freiberga \nstruck us as an impressive leader during our wide-ranging discussion of \nEuro-Atlantic cooperation and Latvia's development since the \nrestoration of independence. Therefore, it is fitting that we introduce \nthis resolution today, coinciding with President Vike-Freiberga's \nworking visit to Washington.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S4013-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 353.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 256, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 256) to extend for 11 additional months the \n     period for which chapter 12 of title 11 of the United States \n     code is reenacted.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally \nturning its attention to retroactively renewing Chapter 12 of the \nBankruptcy Code, which protects family farmers and helps them prevent \nforeclosures and forced auctions of their farms.\n  Unfortunately, many family farmers have been left in legal limbo in \nbankruptcy courts across the country since Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy \nCode expired on July 1, 2000. Last year, the House of Representatives \npassed narrow legislation to retroactively renew Chapter 12, but that \nlegislation died in the Senate. I worked to adopt the House-passed bill \nlast year to renew Chapter 12, along with a number of Democratic \nSenators, but the Senate Majority Leader never scheduled a vote on the \nbill.\n  This year, Representative Nick Smith and Representative Tammy Baldwin \nintroduced H.R. 256 to retroactively renew Chapter 12. Thanks to their \nbipartisan efforts the House passed the bill on February 28 by a vote \nof 408-2. I commend them for their leadership in securing House passage \nof this legislation.\n  Earlier this month, Representative Smith and Representative Baldwin \nwrote to me about trying to secure quick Senate passage of H.R. 256. I \nagreed that the Senate should act immediately to renew Chapter 12 of \nthe Bankruptcy Code and send their legislation to the President for his \nsignature into law. I am glad the Majority Leader is finally taking up \nour request to take up and pass H.R. 256.\n  During the debate earlier this year on comprehensive changes to the \nbankruptcy system, some proponents of the controversial reform bill \nclaimed that it must be passed to restore Chapter 12 to the Bankruptcy \nCode. I hope today's action to pass a stand alone Chapter 12 bill will \nmake it clear to all that the Senate does not have to pass a mammoth \nbankruptcy reform bill to provide family farmers with bankruptcy \nprotection. I also hope today's action will put an end to any efforts \nto use Chapter 12 as leverage to enact controversial bankruptcy reform \nlegislation. Our family farmers deserve better.\n  I strongly support H.R. 256 to retroactively give our family farmers \nbankruptcy protection if they fall on hard times. It is past time for \nCongress to retroactively renew Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code to \nprovide a safety net for our nation's family farmers.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 256) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S4015-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AUTHORIZING PRODUCTION OF RECORDS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Natsios, of Massachusetts, to be Administrator of \n     the United States Agency for International Development.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of \nAndrew Natsios. Andrew has ably served the State of Massachusetts as a \nRepresentative in the State House and as Chief Financial Officer for \nthe State. He is an outstanding choice for the important post of \nAdministrator for the Agency for International Development, and I'm \nconfident he'll serve our country with great distinction.\n  The Agency plays an invaluable role for the United States, bringing \nthe hope of a better life to those in need around the globe through \nhumanitarian aid and development projects. Its Administrator must \nunderstand the challenges facing the Agency both internally and \nexternally. He must be a strong and effective manager. He must be \ncommitted to improving the Agency as an institution and have the \nability to advance its development mission effectively. I'm confident \nthat Andrew possesses the skills to accomplish these goals and that he \nwill enhance the agency's valuable work around the world.\n\n[[Page S4016]]\n\n  Andrew has spent much of his distinguished career working on these \nimportant issues--most notably as the Assistant Administrator for the \nBureau of Food and Humanitarian Assistance at the Agency for \nInternational Development, as Director of the Office of Foreign \nDisaster Assistance and as Vice President of World Vision. Because of \nhis outstanding ability, he was appointed as special coordinator to \nmanage U.S. Government relief efforts during the Somalia famine.\n  Andrew has written extensively on the challenges posed by \nhumanitarian and intervention assistance and disaster response to U.S. \nforeign policy interests. He has also lectured at Boston College, the \nUniversity of Massachusetts, and Northeastern University.\n  Because of his strong management skills, Andrew was called in to \nChair the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority and to oversee the Central \nArtery Tunnel Project--the nation's largest public project. We all \nagree that his management has restored credibility to the project. He \nalso served as Governor Cellucci's Chief Financial Officer for \nMassachusetts and was responsible for a $20 billion state budget.\n  Andrew has the vision, skills and ability to lead the Agency for \nInternational Development very effectively in the years ahead. His \nknowledge and experience, and his strong commitment to improving the \nagency will strengthen all of its vital missions.\n  I look forward very much to working with him as the Administrator of \nthe Agency for International Development.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/26/senate-section/article/S4016-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
