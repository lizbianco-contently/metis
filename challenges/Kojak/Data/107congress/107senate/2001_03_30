COORDINATION WITH CANDIDATES OR POLITICAL PARTIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Coordinated expenditure or disbursement treated as \n     contribution.--Section 301(8) of the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 431 (8)) is amended--\n       (A) by striking ``or'' at the end of subparagraph (A)(i)--\n       (B) by striking ``purpose.'' in subparagraph (A)(ii) and \n     inserting ``purpose;'';\n       (C) by adding at the end of subparagraph (A) the following:\n       ``(iii) any coordinated expenditure or other disbursement \n     made by any person in connection with a candidate's election, \n     regardless of whether the expenditure or disbursement is for \n     a communication that contains express advocacy;\n       ``(iv) any expenditure or other disbursement made in \n     coordination with a National committee, State committee, or \n     other political committee of a political party by a person \n     (other than a candidate or a candidate's authorized \n     committee) in connection with a Federal election, regardless \n     of whether the expenditure or disbursement is for a \n     communication that contains express advocacy.''.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 315(a)(7) of the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act of 1971 (U.S.C. 441a(a)(7)) is amended \n     by striking subparagraph (B) and inserting the following:\n       ``(B) a coordinated expenditure or disbursement described \n     in--\n       ``(i) section 301(8)(C) shall be considered to be a \n     contribution to the candidate or an expenditure by the \n     candidate, respectively; and\n       ``(ii) section 301(8)(D) shall be considered to be a \n     contribution to, or an expenditure by, the political party \n     committee, respectively; and''.\n       (b) Definition of Coordination.--Section 301(8) of the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 431(8)), as \n     amended by subsection (a), is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(C) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iii), the term \n     `coordinated expenditure or other disbursement' means a \n     payment made in concert or cooperation with, at the request \n     or suggestion of, or pursuant to any general or particular \n     understanding with, such candidate, the candidate's \n     authorized political committee, or their agents, or a \n     political party committee or its agents.''\n       (c) Regulations by the Federal Election Commission.--\n       (1) Within 90 days of the effective date of the \n     legislation, the Federal Election Commission shall promulgate \n     new regulations to enforce the statutory standard set by this \n     provision. The regulation shall not require collaboration or \n     agreement to establish coordination. In addition to any \n     subject determined by the Commission, the regulations shall \n     address:\n       (a) payments for the republication of campaign materials;\n       (b) payments for the use of a common vendor;\n       (c) payments for Communications directed or made by persons \n     who previously served as an employee of a candidate or a \n     political party;\n       (d) payments for Communications made by a person after \n     substantial discussion about the communication with a \n     candidate or a political party;\n       (e) the impact of coordinating internal communications by \n     any person to its restricted class has on any subsequent \n     ``Federal Election Activity'' as defined in Section 301 of \n     the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971.\n       (2) The regulations on coordination adopted by the Federal \n     Election Commission and published in the Federal Register at \n     65 Fed. Reg. 76138 on December 6, 2000, are repealed as of 90 \n     days after the effective date of this regulation\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is an amendment on coordination. We \nhave been trying now for 2 weeks to reach an agreement. We have come a \nlong way with the hard work of both staffs and a lot of other people \ninvolved. We have narrowed the gap from our original language, which \nall agreed was not satisfactory to what we believe is a reasonable \ncompromise.\n  Basically, we are talking about any coordinated expenditure or other \ndisbursement, means of payment made in concert or in cooperation with, \nat the request or suggestion of or pursuant to any general or \nparticular understanding with such candidate, candidate's authorized \npolitical committee, or their agents or political party or its agents.\n  We are talking about how we can prevent what is really in major \ncircumvention of the intent--in fact, in my view, the letter of the \nlaw--and that is to coordinate soft money, which means that additional \nfunds are funneled into political campaigns on behalf of candidates.\n  Mr. President, the amendment states:\n\n       Within 90 days of the effective date of the legislation, \n     the Federal Election Commission shall promulgate new \n     regulations to enforce the statutory standards set by this \n     provision. The regulation shall not require collaboration or \n     agreement to establish coordination.\n\n  That is an important point in this amendment.\n\n       In addition to any subject determined by the Commission, \n     the regulation shall address (a) payment for the \n     republication of campaign materials, (b) payment for the use \n     of common vendor, (c) payments for communications directed or \n     made by persons who previously served as an employee of a \n     candidate or a political party, (d) payments for \n     communications made by a person after substantial discussion \n     about the communication with a candidate or a political \n     party.\n       The impact of coordinating internal communications by any \n     person to its restricted class has any subsequent ``Federal \n     election activity'' as defined in section 301 of the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act of 1971.\n\n  What we are trying to do is allow legitimate communication within \norganizations, whether they be unions or whether they be organizations \nsuch as the National Rifle Association, National Right to Life, or any \nother organization--protect their legitimate right to communicate and, \nat the same time, prevent the so-called coordination which has been the \nexplosion and exploitation of the loophole which has allowed huge \namounts, hundreds of millions of dollars, literally, of funds to flow \ninto a political campaign.\n  I think it is a very legitimate compromise. It favors neither one \nside nor the other. Again, I would like to emphasize, the present \nlanguage in the bill is not satisfactory, as viewed by both sides. I \nhope that this is far more satisfactory, if not totally satisfactory, \nlanguage so we can enforce the law and at the same time not prevent any \norganization from legitimate communication within that organization.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support this amendment. \nIt would replace section 214 of the McCain-Feingold bill concerning \ncoordination. Section 214 was designed to override an FEC regulation \nissued in December 2000 and scheduled to become effective soon that \nmany observers of campaigns who are concerned about evasions of the law \nthink is far too narrow to cover what really goes on in campaigns.\n  Senators McCain, Levin, Durbin, and I wrote the FEC during the \nrulemaking and expressed our concern about the overly narrow \ninterpretation of the law that the FEC had accepted. But almost from \nthe very first day we introduced the bill, we have heard from people \nabout this provision, and what we have heard has not been pretty. It is \nclear that the provision was not well drafted. It caught what we wanted \nto catch--groups coordinating activities with candidates without a \nspecific agreement concerning a specific ad or other communication, but \nit also caught much more, including perhaps legitimate conversations \nbetween Members of Congress and groups about legislation without \ntouching on a campaign.\n  I committed to these groups and to my colleagues who expressed \nconcern we would address the problems with 214, and we have with this \namendment. But this amendment simply defines ``coordination'' in a \ngeneral way, using language from current law and language from the \nSupreme Court opinion in the Colorado Republican case that came down in \n1996.\n\n[[Page S3185]]\n\n  Then the amendment instructs the FEC to do a new rulemaking, to \ninterpret and enforce this new and admittedly general statutory \nprovision. The amendment, therefore, gives some guidance to the FEC as \nto what issues it should address, without actually dictating the \nresult.\n  I think this is a reasonable solution to a difficult problem. I thank \nall the Senators and staff who have been involved in working out this \namendment.\n  There is one thing I want to make very clear and reiterate: While \nthis amendment instructs the FEC to consider certain issues in the new \nrulemaking, it doesn't require the FEC to come out any certain way or \ncome to any definite conclusion one way or another.\n  Of course, I also want to note that the Senator from Kentucky has \nrepeatedly said this change is being made at the behest of organized \nlabor. That is not true. It is true that labor didn't like the original \n214, but neither did a lot of other groups, including the Christian \nCoalition and the National Right to Life Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters from these groups that \ncontacted us and criticized section 214 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [E-mail from National Right-to-Life]\n\n       Here are some of the key ways in which the McCain-Feingold \n     bill (S. 27) violates First Amendment protections for groups \n     that engage in free speech about politicians and communicate \n     with elected officials and their staffs;\n       Coordination Traps: Under current law, ``coordination'' \n     between a ``candidate'' and a group is established only when \n     there is an actual prior communication about a specific \n     expenditure for a specific project which results in the \n     expenditure being under the direction or control of a \n     candidate, or which causes the expenditure to be made based \n     upon information about the candidate's needs or plans \n     provided by the candidate. But S. 27 (Section 214) would \n     redefine ``coordination'' in extremely expansive terms, to \n     include (for example) mere discussion of elements of a \n     candidate's ``message'' (whatever that is) any time during a \n     two-year period. Thus, if early on Congress representatives \n     of six groups met with Senator Doe to discuss what language \n     they, and he, will use to collectively promote Doe's landmark \n     bill to ban widgets, and Doe subsequently campaigns in part \n     on his leadership on the widget-ban issue, all six groups \n     arguably are ``coordinated'' with Doe.\n       Once such so-called ``coordination'' is established, the \n     ``coordinated'' organizations are flatly prohibited from \n     spending money on any public communications deemed to be ``of \n     value'' to Senator Doe--by any media, at any time of the \n     year. For example, a group's literature promoting the widget-\n     ban bill could be considered to be ``of value'' to Doe, even \n     if Doe's name is not mentioned, if it is disseminated to his \n     constituents. Moreover, even if these organizations have \n     connected PACs, those PACs would be prohibited from \n     engaging in independent expenditures on Doe's behalf of \n     more than $5,000.\n       Under Section 214, ``coordination'' is also triggered by \n     the mere sharing (by a ``candidate'' and a group or person) \n     of certain vendors of ``professional services'' during a two-\n     year period, including ``polling, media advice, fundraising, \n     campaign research, political advice, or direct mail services \n     (except for mailhouse services).''\n       ``Electioneering Communications'': Section 201 applies \n     additional restrictions to so-called ``electioneering \n     communications,'' defined to cover TV and radio \n     communications that merely mention the name of a federal \n     politician, during ``pre-election'' periods, which include \n     30-day pre-primary periods that begin as early as February of \n     each even-numbered year, as well as a 60-day period before a \n     general election. For example, under the bill, an \n     organization would engage in an ``electioneering \n     communication'' if it purchased a radio ad within 30 days of \n     a primary that said no more than, ``Urge [Congressman X] to \n     vote against [or ``in favor of''] the McCain-Feingold bill.'' \n     The bill flatly prohibits such ``electioneering \n     communications'' by unions and by corporations, including \n     for-profit business corporations, trade associations, \n     veterans' groups, and organizations that hold 501(c)(3) \n     status from the IRS. There is a narrow ``exception'' to the \n     ban: corporations that hold 501(c)(4) or 527 status from the \n     IRS would be permitted to pay for ``electioneering \n     communications,'' but only by setting up a ``segregated \n     fund,'' sort of a quasi-PAC, which could include no corporate \n     or union contributions or business proceeds. The names of \n     donors of over $1,000 to this quasi-PAC would be reported to \n     the government and placed in the public domain.\n       Advance Notice Requirements: The ``disclosure'' provisions \n     (for example, Section 202 and Section 212) include \n     requirements that ``electioneering communications'' and \n     independent expenditures be reported as soon as any contract \n     is signed for the communication--which would be, in many \n     cases, weeks in advance of the actual broadcasting of an ad. \n     Such an advance notice requirement might be a boon to some \n     powerful officeholders--an incumbent governor seeking a \n     Senate seat, for example--who could then bring pressure to \n     bear on broadcasters to refuse to sell airtime for the ads, \n     or to back out. But under the First Amendment, Congress lacks \n     authority to demand that NRLC declare in advance when and \n     where we intend to utter a politician's name to the public, \n     just as it lacks authority to utter a politician's name to \n     the public, just as it lacks authority to impose such a \n     burden on newspaper editorial boards.\n       Endorsements by Members of Congress: Section 101 of S. 27 \n     would prohibit members of Congress from endorsing the \n     fundraising efforts of advocacy groups that use any part of \n     the money for any communication to the public--by any medium, \n     at any time of the year--that ``promotes,'' ``supports,'' \n     ``attacks'' or ``opposes'' a member of Congress (or other \n     ``candidate''). This obviously would cover many of the \n     routine communications that issue-oriented groups use to \n     promote pending legislation. The following statement, for \n     example, would certainly be considered an ``attack'' by some: \n     ``Senator McCain has introduced an awful bill that would \n     restrict the right of pro-life groups to communicate with the \n     public about the voting records of members of Congress. \n     Please write to Senator Jones and urge him to oppose the \n     bill.'' Likewise, ``Senator Baucus has voted to keep the \n     brutal partial-birth abortion method legal, but the bill is \n     coming up again soon. Please call Senator Baucus and urge him \n     to support the bill this time.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Christian Coalition of America]\n\nProtect Free Speech--Oppose H.R. 380, the Shays-Meehan Campaign Finance \n                                  Bill\n\n                                                February 27, 2001.\n       Dear Representative: The Christian Coalition of America \n     strongly opposes H.R. 30, the Shays-Meehan campaign finance \n     bill.

Because this legislation could effectively put our \n     voter guides, as well as other voter education and issue \n     advocacy activities at serious risk, we urge you to vote \n     against the Shays-Meehan bill, as well as to actively oppose \n     it on the House floor.\n       One of the most egregious of the unconstitutional \n     provisions contained in H.R. 380 applies year-round during \n     the entire two-year election cycle (or six-year cycle with \n     respect to Senators). Section 206 contains a broad definition \n     of ``coordination'' between a candidate and an outside \n     group--so broad that if a representative or an organization \n     were to discuss with an officeholder his ``message'' on a \n     legislative issue, such as partial-birth abortion, anytime \n     during the two-year election cycle, and the officeholder were \n     to later campaign in the issue, the organization would be \n     viewed as having ``coordinated'' with the officeholder. The \n     organization could then be accused of violating the federal \n     election laws if it were to disseminate a communication to \n     the public that is deemed to be ``of value'' to the \n     officeholder in his reelection campaign, even it if did not \n     mention the officeholder by name.\n       Section 206 also broadens the definition of \n     ``coordination'' to the point where if an incorporated \n     organization making a voter education expenditure and a \n     campaign were to merely use the services of the same \n     fundraiser or media advisor--without having consulted or \n     coordinated in any way--the expenditure would be considered \n     an illegal contribution to the candidate's campaign if it \n     were deemed to be ``of value'' to the campaign. This is what \n     some have called, a form of ``guilt by association.''\n       And, as a catchall definition of ``coordination,'' the bill \n     contains a vaguely worded restriction on payments ``made by a \n     person in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, . . . \n     or pursuant to any general or particular understanding with a \n     candidate'' or candidate's agent.\n       Another section of the bill, Section 201, would prohibit \n     incorporated organizations from funding television or radio \n     communications to the public which mention the name of a \n     candidate within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general \n     election. This proposed restriction is blatantly \n     unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has repeatedly protected \n     the First Amendment right of like-minded citizens to educate \n     the public on issues and where the officeholders and \n     candidates stand on the issues. In Buckley v. Valeo (1976) \n     and its progeny, the Supreme Court has made clear that issue \n     advocacy (discussion on an issue in the public realm without \n     expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate) \n     is protected under the First Amendment from government \n     regulation. Yet, under Section 201 of the Shays-Meehan bill, \n     an organization such as the Christian Coalition of America, \n     would be prohibited from disseminating a broadcast \n     communication regarding an upcoming congressional vote within \n     60 days of an election, if the communication merely advised \n     constituents of the name of their elected representative who \n     would be casting that vote. The communication would also be \n     banned if it merely mentioned the names of the sponsors of \n     the bill, such as a reference to the ``Shays-Meehan'' bill.\n       But the Shays-Meehan bill goes even further in bringing \n     issue advocacy by private citizen organizations under federal \n     government regulation. The United States Supreme\n\n[[Page S3186]]\n\n     Court and numerous other federal courts, have repeatedly \n     protected issue advocacy and voter education from government \n     regulation unless it ``expressly advocates'' the election or \n     defeat of a clearly-identified candidate (i.e., ``vote for,'' \n     ``defeat,'' etc.). This clear test ensures that the speaker \n     will know whether they are complying with the law. As the \n     Supreme Court explained in Buckley v. Valeo, the lack of such \n     a clear distinction `'offers no security for free discussion. \n     In these conditions it blankets with uncertainty whatever may \n     be said. It compels the speaker to hedge and trim.'' Yet the \n     Shays-Meehan bill would do just that.\n       Section 201 would eliminate this bright-line protection set \n     forth by the Supreme Court and redefine ``express advocacy'' \n     to mean ``expressing unmistakable and unambiguous support for \n     or opposition in one or more clearly identified candidates \n     when taken as a whole and with limited reference to external \n     events.'' This would take the determination beyond words of \n     support or opposition (which is currently the standard in \n     order to protect issue advocacy), to instead move to an \n     examination of the overall context of a communication with \n     respect to a candidate or type of candidate (such as pro-life \n     candidates). Under this vague definition, a communication \n     that contains any negative or positive commentary about an \n     officeholder/candidate's positions or voting record, might \n     become the subject of a complaint to the Federal Election \n     Commission (FEC). This vague definition (in similar language) \n     has been put forth by the Federal Election Commission in \n     regulations and been rejected in court. Congress should \n     reject it as well.\n       Lastly, the Shays-Meehan bill purports to contain an \n     ``exception'' for voter guides. But under this exception, an \n     organization could not verbally clarify the voting record or \n     position of an officeholder or candidate for purposes of \n     compiling the voter guide. Moreover, the ``exception'' \n     prohibits the voter guide from containing ``words that in \n     context can have no reasonable meaning other than to urge the \n     election or defeat of one or more clearly identified \n     candidates,'' as well as requiring that the voter guide \n     ``when taken as a whole . . . not express unmistakable and \n     unambiguous support for or opposition'' to a candidate--vague \n     wording that would leave organizations that issue voter \n     guides constantly at risk of being the subject of an FEC \n     complaint and investigation. Furthermore, organizations that \n     wish to issue voter guides would still have to fear violating \n     the broad ``coordination'' prohibitions elaborated on at the \n     beginning of this letter.\n       In light of the serious First Amendment ramifications that \n     this bill would have on the week of the Christian Coalition \n     of America, as well as on our nation's ability to discuss and \n     debate issues, we urge you to vote against H.R. 380, the \n     Shays-Meehan campaign finance bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Susan T. Muskett, J.D.,\n                                    Director, Legislative Affairs.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment as well. \nI think this has been worked out carefully. I commend the Members and \nstaffs who worked on this amendment. This is in very sound shape. It \navoids the potential problems of being overly broad or too vague with \nrespect to the language, which would expose too many honest and good \npeople who want to be involved in the political process from \nallegations of criminality. None of us want that to occur. This \namendment is worthwhile.\n  Mr. President, if I might, since we are going to be a few minutes \nbefore we vote on this, I want to take a couple minutes and address \nanother matter that may come up this morning which deserves some \nattention. That is what I see as one of the glaring problems still with \nthe bill as a result of an amendment we adopted last week dealing with \nthe so-called millionaires loophole. I voted against that amendment \nbecause I thought it was unnecessary. But it is even more so by the \nevents over the past week, as we have adopted amendments now which have \nincreased the hard dollar limits by 100 percent. Thus, the need for \nproviding some additional resources to so-called less wealthy \ncandidates is certainly far less than it was a week ago.\n  As we all recall, last Tuesday the Senate adopted amendment No. 115 \noffered by Senators Domenici, DeWine, Durbin, McConnell, and others. I \nopposed the amendment because it did not appear to me to be reform. It \nadded more money to the system and did so in a way to protect \nnonwealthy incumbents with substantial campaign treasuries. The \namendment that may be offered later this morning would intend to close \nwhat I think is an unintended loophole in this language.\n  The Domenici amendment addressed the situation of a wealthy candidate \nfinancing his or her own election with personal resources. It granted \nmore generous contribution limits to nonwealthy opponents. It sounds \nreasonable enough, but in the case of a nonwealthy incumbent, the \namendment ignored the substantial resource that such an incumbent may \nhave at his or her disposal in their campaign committees' accounts or \ntreasuries.\n  The amendment that may be offered provides that the amount of such \ncampaign balances must be taken into account before a wealthy \ncandidate's contributions to his or her own campaign trigger the higher \ncontribution limits for the incumbent.\n  Last Tuesday, the authors of this amendment described the situation \nof a wealthy candidate financing his or her own election as a \nconstitutionally protected loophole. But my colleagues' solution, as \nadopted last week, unwittingly opens a more insidious loophole. One \nthat protects incumbents and, more precisely, incumbents' campaign \ntreasuries, from a wealthy candidate.\n  In describing the purpose of their amendment, which I opposed, my \ncolleague contended that the Buckley decision created a substantial \ndisadvantage for opposing candidates who must raise campaign funds \nunder the current fundraising limitations.\n  That was last Tuesday. This week we adopted the Thompson-Feinstein \namendment which doubled the individual hard money contribution limits \nand indexed those limits for future inflation.\n  The Thompson-Feinstein amendment also doubled the contribution amount \na Senate campaign committee can make directly to candidate to $35,000 \nper election cycle and indexed it for inflation also.\n  In a period of 1 short week, we potentially gave an incumbent facing \na wealthy challenger an additional $17,500, plus an additional $4,000 \nper couple per election. So the substantial disadvantage that \nincumbents supposedly faced last Tuesday has been substantially \neliminated by the actions we took during this week on the bill.\n  Even so, the entire premise of the Domenici amendment that somehow \nincumbents need protection from wealthy opponents ignores one simple \nfact: Many nonwealthy opponents are actually incumbents sitting on \nhealthy campaign accounts. Those campaign war chests can be equal to or \ngreater than the personal funds being used by a so-called wealthy \nopponent.\n  For example, based on FEC disclosures, some of my colleagues facing \nreelection next year are sitting on campaign accounts with cash \nbalances ranging from $100,000 to in excess of $3 million.\n  Surely my colleagues cannot be serious that with $1 million or $2 \nmillion sitting in their treasuries, and the advantages of incumbency \nwe have automatically, including increased hard money limits, that they \nsomehow need protection from a candidate who decides to put $600,000 \ninto their own race.\n  For example, take a State the size of mine, a State with a little \nover 3 million people. The threshold amount would be $270,000. A \nwealthy candidate who contributed or spent $600,000 of his or her own \nmoney in that race would trigger contribution limits three times the \nnormal for that incumbent, or $12,000 per individual per election, or \n$24,000 per couple. If you double that for primaries, as well as an \nelection, you actually get $48,000. That is a substantial increase from \nwhere we were a week ago.\n  If that same incumbent has a war chest of $1 million, he actually has \na cash balance of $400,000 more than the wealthy challenger.\n  Are we really serious that the incumbent in that situation is somehow \ndisadvantaged--should he or she be able to raise $24,000 from a couple \nuntil the difference in the balances are reached? Yet that is exactly \nwhat the Domenici amendment, which I opposed, will provide.\n  Although my colleagues have argued that the tiered trigger system of \nthe Domenici amendment is proportional, and that proportionality levels \nthe playing field, that is simply not the case when a nonwealthy \ncandidate is an incumbent.\n  In the case of a nonwealthy incumbent, the provision does anything \nbut level the playing field. It becomes essentially an incumbent \nprotection provision.\n  The amendment that was adopted last week simply goes too far under \nthe present circumstances.\n\n[[Page S3187]]\n\n  The amendment that may be offered by Senator Durbin, myself, and \nothers restores some balance between the incumbents with healthy \ncampaign treasuries and individuals with personal wealth. It requires \nthat the personal wealth of an opponent be offset by the amount of \ncampaign treasury funds of a nonwealthy incumbent before any trigger of \nbenefits to that incumbent occurs.\n  This amendment effectively adds the amount of the cash-on-hand \nbalance reserves of an incumbent's war chest into the calculation of \nthe opposition personal funds amount. So in my example, until the \n``wealthy'' challenger spent $1 million in personal funds, that \n``poor'' incumbent with the war chest would not get the advantage of \nthe increased limits.\n  Just as my colleague's amendment last week was an attempt to correct \nthe unintended effects of the Buckley decision, this amendment, which I \nbelieve will be offered, corrects the unintended effects of the \namendment adopted last week; namely, protecting incumbents from wealthy \nopponents.\n  When that amendment is offered, I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 165\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is the pending amendment the McCain \namendment on coordination?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, unfortunately, the McCain amendment \ncoordination provision lets big labor continue to coordinate its ground \ngame with the Democrats. As you know, I have been predicting for 2 \nweeks that there would be an effort to water down provisions in the \nbill that were offensive to big labor.\n  With all due respect to the author of the amendment, the intent is \nquite clear: to mitigate the damage that has caused concern among those \nin organized labor about this bill. I note there is apparently not \nenough concern to get many Democratic votes against on final passage \nMonday, but they are very upset about the coordination provisions of \nthis bill, thus the reason for the amendment that has been sent to the \ndesk.\n  Let me make it clear, the coordination provision lets big labor \ncontinue to coordinate its ground game with the Democratic Party. It \ndoes this by changing the ``concept of coordinated activity'' that \nincludes the union in-kind activity to ``coordinated expenditures or \ndisbursements'' which are legal terms of art that do not encompass in-\nkind contributions. This new coordination provision is still \nunconstitutional and will result in Government witch hunts because it \ndoes not require actual collaboration or agreement to have a finding of \ncoordination. This is in direct contravention to Colorado 1 and will \nresult in a lengthy onerous investigation of citizens groups.\n  Mr. President, there will be a need to have a rollcall vote on the \nMcCain amendment at 11 a.m. I do not know whether this is the \nappropriate time to request that rollcall vote or not.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If the Senator wishes to request a \nvote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I request the yeas and nays on the \nMcCain amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 166\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 166.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nincrease the penalties imposed for making or accepting contributions in \n the name of another and to prohibit foreign nationals from making any \n                    campaign-related disbursements)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 305. INCREASE IN PENALTIES IMPOSED FOR VIOLATIONS OF \n                   CONDUIT CONTRIBUTION BAN.\n\n       (a) Increase in Civil Money Penalty for Knowing and Willful \n     Violations.--Section 309(a) of the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 437g(a)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (5)(B), by inserting before the period at \n     the end the following: ``(or, in the case of a violation of \n     section 320, which is not less than 300 percent of the amount \n     involved in the violation and is not more than the greater of \n     $50,000 or 1000 percent of the amount involved in the \n     violation)''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (6)(C), by inserting before the period at \n     the end the following: ``(or, in the case of a violation of \n     section 320, which is not less than 300 percent of the amount \n     involved in the violation and is not more than the greater of \n     $50,000 or 1000 percent of the amount involved in the \n     violation)''.\n       (b) Increase in Criminal Penalty.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 309(d)(1) of such Act (2 U.S.C. \n     437g(d)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(D) Any person who knowingly and willfully commits a \n     violation of section 320 involving an amount aggregating \n     $10,000 or more during a calendar year shall be fined, or \n     imprisoned for not more than 2 years, or both. The amount of \n     the fine shall not be less than 300 percent of the amount \n     involved in the violation and shall not be more than the \n     greater of $50,000 or 1000 percent of the amount involved in \n     the violation.''.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 309(d)(1)(A) of such Act \n     (2 U.S.C. 437g(d)(1)(A)) is amended by inserting ``(other \n     than section 320)'' after ``this Act''.\n       (c) Mandatory Referral to Attorney General.--Section \n     309(a)(5)(C) of such Act (2 U.S.C. 437(a)(5)(C)) is amended \n     by inserting ``(or, in the case of a violation of section \n     320, shall refer such apparent violation to the Attorney \n     General of the United States)'' after ``United States''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply with respect to violations occurring on or after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we talked about imposing a lot of new laws \nand new provisions in some areas where I think we may not be doing what \nwe wish to achieve. We are in this bill proposing to take political \nparties out of the campaign process which inevitably is going to shift \nmoney into other channels. One of the things I don't think we have \nadequately considered is what we do about people who have violated \nexisting laws. Certainly, to the extent I have heard concerns about \ncampaign finance, it has been about the failure to provide adequate \npenalties for those who violate the laws that are already on the books.\n  Under current campaign finance laws, there is no meaningful \npunishment of campaign violators. Over the last several years, we have \nhad hearings, investigations and read about key figures in campaign \nscandals only to learn later that they walk. It is small wonder that \nabuse occurs on the scale that we have recently witnessed. It is a \nmisdemeanor offense to make a campaign contribution in the name of \nanother person, knowingly permit your name to be used for a \ncontribution or knowingly accept a contribution made in the name of \nanother, in other words make an illegal contribution through a conduit \n(2 U.S.C. 441f).\n  Despite this clear prohibition, it came to light that during the 1996 \npresidential campaign millions of dollars in illegal donations from \nforeign nations were funneled into party and campaign coffers through \nconduit contributors, some as outrageous as nuns and other people of \nworship. Despite these outrageous abuses, illegal contributions \ntotaling hundreds of thousands of dollars in some cases flowed with \nimpunity. Under the circumstances, the punishments handed out to those \ncaught red-handed can barely be considered slaps on the wrist.\n  As simply a misdemeanor offense, those intent on corrupting the \nprocess do not fear the consequences. Despite the scale of some of the \nabuses, the offense is rarely prosecuted. When it is, the offenders are \nhanded minimal fines and no jail time. The message from the so-called \nprosecutions is that there is no threat of jail time for those who \nbreak campaign finance laws. If it feels good, do it.\n  As the gross abuses of the 1996 presidential campaign came to light, \nwe heard from the perpetrators of the\n\n[[Page S3188]]\n\nabuses themselves that what was needed was not enforcement of the law \nbut new laws and reform of the campaign finance system. Despite their \ngross indifference to the law, it appears they got their wish. We are \nhere debating more laws with no discussion about increasing penalties \nand cracking down on law breakers.\n  If we are truly serious about reforming the system, we must crack \ndown on the lawbreakers. Abusers must be punished accordingly or no new \nlaw is going to make a difference in cleaning up the system.\n  Violators have to fear punishment or they will continue to violate \nthe law as they have abused existing law. There is no reason to think \nthat yesterday's lawbreakers will not break tomorrow's laws unless they \nunderstand there are consequences. New laws cannot be effective if \n``teeth'' are not put in the law. Without this change, ``reform'' talk \nis cheap and just talk.\n  My amendment would make it a felony to knowingly make conduit \ncontributions, knowingly permit your name to be used for such a \ncontribution or knowingly accept a contribution made in the name of \nanother. The amendment does not change the conditions of the underlying \noffense, but by making it a felony, it adds some ``teeth'' to the law. \nMaybe the Johnny Chungs and the Charlie Tries of this world will \nunderstand there are consequences for their actions and no longer \nviolate campaign finance laws with impunity.\n  As a felony offense, violators will be subject to either jail time or \na stiff fine, or perhaps both. Fines will be increased dramatically to \na minimum of not less than 300 percent of the amount involved. The \namendment requires, not suggests, that the FEC refer these cases to the \nJustice Department. Finally, it broadens the prohibition on donations \nfrom foreign nationals, ensuring that clever lawyers won't be able to \nmove funds to accounts like ``redistricting'' or others. There is a \nprohibition on donations from foreign nationals. This takes away an \nexploitable loophole.\n  By taking this step, Congress will be sending a clear message that it \nconsiders the funneling of illegal campaign contributions a serious \noffense to be punished accordingly.\n  It becomes an offense that prosecutors can use in pursuing a \ncase. Currently there is little incentive for a suspect to cooperate if \nthey are threatened only with a misdemeanor. There is less incentive \nfor busy prosecutors to dedicate the time and resources to prosecute \nthis offense if it remains a misdemeanor. This amendment gives \nprosecutors something they can use.\n\n  This amendment goes after law-breaking contributors to any candidate \nof any party. Contributors to all parties are required by law to \ndisclose their donations properly. Concealing the source of a donation \nis illegal. If you do it, you can expect punishment. Similar \nlegislation has been introduced on the House side and has strong \nbipartisan support.\n  We in Congress should be very concerned about the growing willingness \nwe have seen in recent cycles for people to break the law apparently \nwith impunity. We should be further concerned with the meaningless \npunishments handed down and the signal it sends that we will tolerate \ncorruption.\n  According to news accounts, what has become of these notorious \nabusers of our campaign finance laws?\n  Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie was convicted of funneling over $1 million \nin conduit contributions during the 1996 cycle, a large percentage of \nthe money was traced to Macau. For this, Mr. Trie was sentenced on \nNovember 1, 1999 to 3 years probation and 4 months home detention and \nfined $5,000--but he received no jail time.\n  Mr. Johnny Chung funneled $300,000 he received from a general in the \nChinese Military Intelligence Agency and made another $350,000 in \nconduit contributions. This individual who brazenly said ``the White \nHouse is like a subway, you have to put in coins to open the gate,'' \nwas sentenced to 3,000 hours of community service for bank fraud, tax \nevasion, and his role in aiding donations to the Clinton campaign, but \nhe received no jail time.\n  Mr. President, 3,000 hours of community service--if they make enough, \nthat ought to be a good year's work for anybody. They ought to be \nwilling to do community service not as a punishment but as their \ncontribution.\n  Next, John Huang pleaded guilty on August 12, 1999, to arranging \nillegal political contributions from overseas. It was found that he \narranged over $1 million in illegal contributions, primarily with money \nfrom Indonesia. He was fined $10,000 and sentenced to 1 year probation \nand 500 hours of community service but no jail time.\n  I suspect that whatever source provided him the million dollars \nprobably helped him cover the amount of that fine. And 500 hours of \ncommunity service, well, that would be a nice year's work.\n  Maria Hsia, who funneled over $100,000 through nuns and monks at a \ntemple was tried and convicted of five counts. She was sentenced on \nFebruary 6 of this year to a whopping 90 days--90 days--of home \nconfinement--that is really tough; you have to stay home for 90 days--\n250 hours of community service, 3 years of probation and she was fined \na whopping $5,000. The ``home confinement,'' of course, permits Ms. \nHsai to work each day, care for her elderly parents and attend \nreligious services--but no jail time. So you can't really say this is \nan onerous penalty.\n  Billionaire James Riady agreed on January 11 of this year to pay an \n$8.6 million fine and plead guilty to unlawfully reimbursing donors to \nthe 1992 campaign of President Bill Clinton--but he will serve no jail \ntime.\n  But for a billionaire, $6 million is like me reaching in my wallet to \nbuy lunch at the sandwich shop. Do you think that hurt him very much? I \ndo not believe so. For $8.6 million, he has every incentive to come \nback and do his trick again. That is a small price to pay for being \nable to exercise inappropriate, unwarranted, and illegal influence on a \ncampaign.\n  Until this point, this body has focused exclusively on making it more \ndifficult for candidates to raise money legally while remaining silent \non blatant abuses. If we are to get serious about reform, at least we \nshould go after those who are willing to break the law. If campaign \nviolators refuse to respect the law, then maybe they will respect the \nthreat of real, not meaningless, punishment. Congress needs to get \ntough and send a clear message that the days of tolerance for these \nillegal, unlawful, and improper practices are coming to an end. I urge \nmy colleagues to adopt this very simple amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields the time?\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri.\n  There is a great deal of redundancy in his amendment. We already bar \nforeign contributions and increase penalties in some areas. But I think \nthe Senator from Missouri makes very valid points. I think his \namendment probably addresses some very helpful areas. I am prepared to \naccept the amendment. I do not know about all Members yet, but we would \nlike to run it by them and see if we can't get some agreement on the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator from Iowa withhold for just a \nmoment? We have an amendment that is cleared. I would just like to \nprocess it if I could.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the pending amendment is the Bond \namendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent it be temporarily set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 167\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is an amendment by Senator\n\n[[Page S3189]]\n\nHatch with regard to expedited review that has been cleared on both \nsides. I send that amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. Hatch, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 167.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                 (Purpose: To provide expedited review)\n\n       On page 38, after line 3, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 403. EXPEDITED REVIEW.\n\n       (a) Expedited Review.--Any individual or organization that \n     would otherwise have standing to challenge a provision of, or \n     amendment made by, this Act may bring an action, in the \n     United States District Court for the District of Columbia, \n     for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief on the ground \n     that such provision or amendment violates the Constitution. \n     For purposes of the expedited review provided by this section \n     the exclusive venue for such an action shall be the United \n     States District Court for the District of Columbia.\n       (b) Appeal to Supreme Court.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, any order or judgment of the United States \n     District Court for the District of Columbia finally disposing \n     of an action brought under subsection (a) shall be reviewable \n     by appeal directly to the Supreme Court of the United States. \n     Any such appeal shall be taken by a notice of appeal filed \n     within 10 calendar days after such order or judgment is \n     entered; and the jurisdictional statement shall be filed \n     within 30 calendar days after such order or judgment is \n     entered.\n       (c) Expedited Consideration.--It shall be the duty of the \n     District Court for the District of Columbia and the Supreme \n     Court of the United States to advance on the docket and to \n     expedite to the greatest possible extent the disposition of \n     any matter brought under subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment that will \nprovide for expedited judicial review of the provisions of the McCain-\nFeingold Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2001. Without this \namendment, American citizens and public interest groups, among others, \nwill be subject to controversial, unworkable, and in my mind, likely \nunconstitutional provisions that infringe free speech rights protected \nby the first amendment.\n  Supporters of the bill should welcome this amendment as well. All of \nus, supporters and opponents alike, stand go gain by a prompt and \ndefinite determination of the constitutionality of many of the bill's \ncontroversial provisions.\n  For those who oppose the bill, these controversial provisions pose \nimminent danger not only to individuals' rights to free speech, but \nalso to our cherished two party system. Because the harm these \nprovisions will cause is serious and irreparable, it is imperative that \nwe afford the Supreme Court the opportunity to pass on the \nconstitutionality of this legislation as soon as possible.\n  The way the amendment works is simple, and I believe it should be \nnoncontroversial. Those who challenge the constitutionality of the \nlegislation must bring their case in the district court of the District \nof Columbia. Furthermore, only those who can show cognizable harm under \nthe legislation will be permitted to bring a case. The district court, \nof course, has the authority to consolidate all the challenges brought \nagainst the legislation. To make certain that the district court \nconsiders the case promptly, my amendment directs the court to \n``expedite to the greatest possible extent the disposition of [the] \nmatter.''\n  My amendment also provides for an expedited appeal of the district \ncourt's ruling to the Supreme Court. The hearing of this appeal by the \nSupreme Court, however, follows the customary procedures for a writ of \ncertiorari--that is, the Supreme Court has the discretion whether or \nnot to review the case. If the Supreme Court declines to review the \nruling, then the district court's ruling would stand.\n  Now some may complain that with this approach we are bypassing the \nCircuit Courts of Appeal. To them I say this: Such a procedure is not \nunprecedented. Indeed, the Supreme Court's own rules allow for such a \nprocedure when it is authorized by law or when the case is of such \nimperative public importance as to justify deviation from normal \nappellate practice. I think we can all agree that the issues presented \nby this legislation meet that threshold.\n  I hope that my colleagues--whether they support or oppose the \nunderlying legislation--will support my amendment. It is in all of our \ninterests to have the prompt, authoritative, and final resolution of \nthese issues that an expedited appeal will provide.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is acceptable to those \nwho support this bill because we agree with the Senator from Utah that \nquestions about its constitutionality should be resolved promptly. A \nprocedure similar to the one set up in this amendment was used when the \n1974 act was challenged, and although not all of us agree with \neverything that the Supreme Court decided in the Buckley case, the \nprocess served the country relatively well.\n  Let me make just a few points of clarification. First, the amendment \nmakes no change in what would otherwise be the law on the issue of who \nhas legal standing to sue. The text of the amendment is absolutely \nclear on that point. Second, as the Senator from Utah notes, the venue \nfor actions challenging the constitutionality of the bill will be in \nthe United States District Court for the District of Columbia, with \ndirect appeal to the United States Supreme Court. The district court \nwill have the power to consolidate related challenges into a single \ncase.\n  Finally, and most importantly, although the amendment provides for \nthe expedition of these cases to the greatest possible extent, we do \nnot intend to suggest that the courts should not take the time \nnecessary to develop the factual record and hear relevant testimony if \nnecessary. And we do believe that the Court should allow interested \nparties to intervene, or become amici curiae as was done in the \nlitigation that led to the Buckley decision. This case will be one of \nthe most important that the Court has heard in decades, with \nramifications for the future of our political system for years to come. \nBy expediting the case, we in no way want to rush the Court into making \nits decision without the benefit of a full and adequate record and the \nopportunity for all interested parties to participate.\n  With that understanding, I support the amendment and I commend the \nSenator from Utah for thinking ahead to the inevitable legal challenges \nthat await this bill and coming up with a fair and expeditious \nprocedure to handle them.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we have been able to work out the amendment \noffered by my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, with regard to an \nexpedited review of the McCain-Feingold measure.\n  While I strongly disagree with my colleague's conclusion that absent \nreview, the citizens of this Nation will be subjected to \nunconstitutional provisions that infringe on speech, I do support the \nintent of this amendment. I believe that this measure, S. 27, is a \nbalanced attempt to follow the requirements laid down in Buckley and \nthe Shrink Missouri PAC cases. The Court has essentially invited \nCongress to express our will in this area, and the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation does just that.\n  My support for the Senator's amendment should in no way be read to \nsuggest that I think there are provisions of this measure that are \nunconstitutional. To the contrary, I believe it will pass \nconstitutional review. However, I understand the Senator's desire to \nput this question to the test in an expedited manner.\n  This is not an unusual request for such far-reaching and important \nlegislation. The purpose of this amendment is to provide expedited \njudicial review of this legislation. In this Senator's mind, this is a \ngood idea. I am confident that the Supreme Court will ultimately uphold \nthis legislation and it is in everyone's best interest to know that as \nsoon as possible.\n  But by saying that, however, I do not want to suggest that the Court \nshould not take adequate time to review any such challenge. \nFurthermore, I am not suggesting that such an expedited review be \nconducted at the expense of allowing all interested parties to \nintervene in this matter in order to provide assistance to the Court in \nits decision. This may be the first major effort to reform this \nNation's campaign finance\n\n[[Page S3190]]\n\nlaws in nearly 25 years that becomes law, and there is a wealth of \nexpertise on this issue in both Congress and the private sector which \ncan be of immense assistance to the Court in its review.\n  Finally, I express my appreciation to the Senator from Utah for his \nwillingness to clarify that any such expedited challenge to this \nmeasure must be brought exclusively in the District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe we are ready to adopt it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there is no objection to the amendment on \nthis side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate on the \namendment? The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 167) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 168\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 168.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To add a nonseverability provision with respect to the ban on \n           soft money and the increase in hard money limits)\n\n       On page 37, strike lines 15 through 24 and insert the \n     following:\n\n    TITLE IV--NONSEVERABILITY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS; EFFECTIVE DATE\n\n     SEC. 401. NONSEVERABILITY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), if \n     any provision of this Act or amendment made by this Act, or \n     the application of a provision or amendment to any person or \n     circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder \n     of this Act and amendments made by this Act, and the \n     application of the provisions and amendment to any person or \n     circumstance, shall not be affected by the holding.\n       (b) Nonseverability of Prohibition on Soft Money of \n     Political Parties and Increased Contribution Limits.--If any \n     amendment made by section 101, or the application of the \n     amendment to any person or circumstance, is held to be \n     unconstitutional, each amendment made by sections 101 or 308 \n     (relating to modification of contribution limits), and the \n     application of each such amendment to any person or \n     circumstance, shall be invalid.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. All it \ndoes is provide that if the soft money ban is struck down in the \ncourts, then the hard money increases now included in the bill will \nalso be taken out.\n  During the debate on raising the hard money limits, we heard a lot of \ndiscussion about, if we are going to ban all the soft money, then we at \nleast ought to raise the hard money limits. I happened to personally \noppose that, but obviously I was on the losing side of that issue. So \nthe hard money limits were raised. There is some question as to whether \nor not the ban on soft money is going to be upheld in the courts. There \nare those who say that it can withstand constitutional scrutiny; there \nare others who say it won't. I don't know. It is sort of a tossup on \nthat one.\n  All my amendment says is that if the courts strike down the ban on \nsoft money, then the increase in hard money that we included will go \nback to the limits we now have in law. It is very simple. I don't know \nthat I need to describe it any more than that.\n  We would be a laughing stock if, in fact, the courts struck down the \nsoft money ban so that now we have soft money and an increase in hard \nmoney. What kind of reform is that? Obviously, if the soft money ban is \nfound to be constitutionally secure, then we have the increases in the \nhard money.\n  That is all this amendment does. There is more I could say about how \nmuch people give in hard money, but that has already been discussed. I \ndon't need to go through that. It would cast a bad light on reform if \nin fact the courts struck down the soft money ban so now we have soft \nmoney and more hard money. That would be the total antithesis of what \nwe are trying to do here.\n  That is what the amendment is. It is very simple. It is \nstraightforward. Again, my amendment says, if the courts strike down \nthe ban on soft money, then the increases we have put in here on hard \nmoney will go back to the levels we have had for the last 25 years.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I think this is an amendment that makes some sense. He is \nabsolutely correct. There is some question about the soft money \nconstitutionality. If that ban is found to be unconstitutional, then \nthe door is wide open again. As my colleague knows, while I supported \nthe Thompson-Feinstein compromise, I did so reluctantly, having spoken \nout against the increases. I agree with my colleague on that point. I \nhave some concerns over the so-called millionaires amendment as well \nwhich allows for an exponential increase in contributions if someone \nchallenges us with personal wealth. I know that makes Members uneasy, \nbut it allows for a factor as high as presently six times the hard \ndollar limits.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. I don't know if his amendment includes reaching that \nprovision. Even if we go back to the original hard dollar limits, we \nstill include the millionaires which would allow those numbers to go \nup. I was curious as to whether or not the amendment touched on that \nprovision.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't think it touches that. No, we did not touch on \nthat provision with the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa voted against \nnonseverability yesterday. After Senator McCain and Senator Thompson \nand others went through this painful compromise of working out an \nappropriate hard money increase that only had 16 votes against it, the \nSenator from Iowa wants to come in here at the last minute and unravel \nthat compromise. I thought we were past that on this bill, I say to the \nSenator from Arizona. I thought we were down to a few wrap-up items. \nThis amendment ought to be defeated overwhelmingly, and we should stick \nwith the compromise that was so painstakingly worked out the other day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky is exactly \nright. This whole thing has been a series of fragile compromises. This \nwould unravel the whole effort. Although the Senator from Kentucky and \nI are not in agreement on the amount, there is no doubt that we have to \nincrease hard money. To say that we would not increase hard money at \nall and do away with all the soft money is just not a viable proposal. \nI hope the Senator from Iowa will recognize that there is overwhelming \nopposition to this amendment, and we could voice vote it at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I join in the opposition to the Harkin amendment. There \nwas a very good discussion yesterday about the rarity and lack of \nwisdom of the nonseverability provisions. To head in that direction, \ngiven the rarity of it, given the clear intention of the Senate \nyesterday, is unwise. We oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the pending \namendment is one I had sent up earlier. To summarize the amendment, \nwhich is\n\n[[Page S3191]]\n\nnow under consideration, it is simple and straightforward. It says if \nthe courts strike down the ban on soft money, then the increases in the \nhard money limits we put in this bill would also go back to the levels \nwe have right now. So we would not be faced with a situation later on \nthat. If the court struck down the soft money ban, we get to raise soft \nmoney and also get the increases in the hard money limit.\n  Senator Dodd pointed out that my amendment does not reach to the \nmillionaire amendment that we adopted. It doesn't. I did not include \nthat. These are the things I understand that are going to have to be \nworked out in conference with the House. I am hopeful that as we go \ninto conference, the problem I just pointed out would also be \naddressed. We certainly don't want to wind up having both the soft \nmoney and the increases in hard money--at least I don't think.\n  In talking with colleagues on this side, that is why I decided to \noffer this amendment. But I understand that it would not be adopted; I \nunderstand the lay of the land.\n  I ask that we just proceed to a voice vote on the amendment and, \nhopefully, the managers would consider this when they get into \nconference.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is bipartisan opposition to the \namendment of the Senator from Iowa. We will be voting no on the voice \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 168) was rejected.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote. I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum to be \ncharged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, what is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Bond amendment No. 166.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 166, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Bond, I send a \nmodification to the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 305. INCREASE IN PENALTIES IMPOSED FOR VIOLATIONS OF \n                   CONDUIT CONTRIBUTION BAN.\n\n       (a) Increase in Civil Money Penalty for Knowing and Willful \n     Violations.--Section 309(a) of the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 437g(a)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (5)(B), by inserting before the period at \n     the end the following: ``(or, in the case of a violation of \n     section 320, which is not less than 300 percent of the amount \n     involved in the violation and is not more than the greater of \n     $50,000 or 1000 percent of the amount involved in the \n     violation)''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (6)(C), by inserting before the period at \n     the end the following: ``(or, in the case of a violation of \n     section 320, which is not less than 300 percent of the amount \n     involved in the violation and is not more than the greater of \n     $50,000 or 1000 percent of the amount involved in the \n     violation)''.\n       (b) Increase in Criminal Penalty.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 309(d)(1) of such Act (2 U.S.C. \n     437g(d)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(D) Any person who knowingly and willfully commits a \n     violation of section 320 involving an amount aggregating \n     $10,000 or more during a calendar year shall be fined, or \n     imprisoned for not more than 2 years, or both. The amount of \n     the fine shall not be less than 300 percent of the amount \n     involved in the violation and shall not be more than the \n     greater of $50,000 or 1000 percent of the amount involved in \n     the violation.''.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 309(d)(1)(A) of such Act \n     (2 U.S.C. 437g(d)(1)(A)) is amended by inserting ``(other \n     than section 320)'' after ``this Act''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply with respect to violations occurring on or after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, while I will not object to the adoption of \nthe amendment by my colleague from Missouri, Mr. Bond, I do not believe \nthat it presents the best approach for ensuring comprehensive \nenforcement of this new law. In particular, I disagree with the method \nof appearing to single out one type of violation for enhanced \nenforcement or prosecution, namely conduit contributions in the name of \nanother.\n  My lack of objection should not be read to infer that either this \nSenator, or this body, believe that conduit contributions represent the \nmost serious abuse of campaign finance laws nor that such an abuse \nrequires selective enforcement and prosecution apart from other \nviolations of the Act.\n  I also want to be clear that I do not completely agree with the \ncharacterizations of the Senator from Missouri of the alleged campaign \nfinance abuses in the 1996 Presidential and Congressional elections. \nLet me also be clear, campaign finance violations are already subject \nto civil enforcement and prosecution as both misdemeanor and felony \noffenses. The remedies Senator Bond is proposing appear to already be \navailable in law if the facts or evidence in such cases include \naggrevated circumstances.\n  An unintended result of the amendment of Senator Bond may be the \nappearance and reality of selective prosecution. Such a result is \navoided by the approach of my colleagues from Tennessee, Senator \nThompson, and Connecticut, Senator Lieberman. Theirs is the preferred \napproach which provides for comprehensive enforcement of all violations \nof the new law. I am pleased that their provision has also been \nincluded in S. 27, the McCain-Feingold legislation, and believe that it \nshould be applied across the act to all violations.\n  We all agree that existing civil and criminal laws must be vigorously \nand uniformly enforced. I believe that this will be the case.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this has been worked out now and is \nacceptable to both sides.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Kentucky is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment, as modified, \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 166), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am very cognizant of the very short \nperiod of time remaining under the UC agreement on amendments. We have \nbeen working on a modification of the so- called millionaires \namendment. I believe we are very close in trying to equalize this \nsituation so that when a person contributes a certain amount of money, \nthen the incumbent or the candidate without the money will be able to \nhave not an unfair advantage.\n  We have been in consultation, and I hope we can reach an agreement \nunder the UC, if all sides agree, to have an amendment adopted after \nthe vote. That is up to Senator McConnell. I want to hear from him on \nthis issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I missed the first part of the comment \nof the Senator from Arizona. I gather it was whether this amendment can \nbe offered after 11 o'clock.\n  We have been on this bill 2 weeks. This was adopted the first day of \nthe 2-week debate, and here we are at 2 minutes to 11 still trying to \nfix it. With all due respect to the Senator from Michigan, I am not \ngoing to agree to a modification of the consent agreement so it can be \noffered after 11 o'clock. I will be happy to work with him on whether \nit can be included as a technical amendment at the end on Monday. I am \nnot going to agree to change the consent under which we are currently \noperating.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I understand Senator McConnell's position. \nIt\n\n[[Page S3192]]\n\nhas been long debated. I had hoped we would reach agreement that by \nunanimous consent we could offer an amendment after 11 o'clock because \nwe are still working on some of the technical aspects of this \namendment. But if the Senator from Kentucky believes he has to object \nto that unanimous consent request, then I will offer this amendment at \nthis time. I ask the Senator if that is his position.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think the Senator should offer the amendment because \nthis, at the risk of repeating myself, is the first amendment we dealt \nwith 2 weeks ago, and here we are 1 minute to 11 trying to modify it. \nMy colleague had plenty of time to do that. The Senator can go ahead \nand do that if he wants.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 169\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 169.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To limit the increase in contribution limits in response to \n    expenditures from personal funds by taking into consideration a \n                      candidate's available funds)\n\n       On Page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.     . RESTRICTION ON INCREASED CONTRIBUTION LIMITS BY \n                   TAKING INTO ACCOUNT CANDIDATE'S AVAILABLE \n                   FUNDS.\n\n       Section 315(i)(1) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of \n     1971 (2 U.S.C. 441a(i)(1)), as added by this Act, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(E) Special rule for candidate's campaign funds.--\n       (i) In general.--For purposes of determining the aggregate \n     amount of expenditures from personal funds under subparagraph \n     (D)(ii), such amount shall include the net cash-on-hand \n     advantage of the candidate.\n       (ii) Net cash-on-hand advantage.--For purposes of clause \n     (i), the term `net cash-on-hand advantage' means the excess, \n     if any, of\n       (I) the aggregate amount of 50% of the contributions \n     received by a candidate during any election cycle (not \n     including contributions from personal funds of the candidate) \n     that may be expended in connection with the election, as \n     determined on June 30 and December 30 of the year preceding \n     the year in which a general election is held, over\n       (II) the aggregate amount of 50% of the contributions \n     received by an opposing candidate during any election cycle \n     (not including contributions from personal funds of the \n     candidate) that may be expended in connection with the \n     election, as determined on June 30 and December 30 of the \n     year preceding the year in which a general election is held.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me explain.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 11 o'clock has arrived, and there \nare 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. DODD. Parliamentary inquiry: Is it permissible for a modification \nto be sent to the desk and considered prior to the vote of an amendment \nthat has already been submitted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Could I ask for clarification? I have 2 minutes to \nexplain the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes, equally divided.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This was one of the first amendments, the Domenici-\nDeWine-Durbin amendment, related to the millionaire candidates who are \nshowing up more and more.\n  Since this amendment was originally adopted, some people have noted \nthe fact that some incumbents may have cash on hand and that ought to \nbe taken into consideration when you consider the triggers as to \nmillionaires' expenditures. That is what this amendment addresses.\n  We also had changed the hard money contributions. We have raised the \nlevel of the contributions, which affects the same amendment, the \nDomenici amendment. I am only addressing the cash on hand aspect. I \nhope my colleagues would agree with me that we want to get as close to \npossible to a level playing field but not create incumbent advantage. \nThat is what this amendment seeks to do.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for doing this. I opposed the \nmillionaires amendment for the very reason that the Senator from \nIllinois outlined this morning. The reason he has offered this \namendment is to correct it; it creates a giant loophole.\n  Talk about incumbent protection, we allow now six times the new \nlevels of hard money. It allows literally someone to receive a check \nfrom one couple of $48,000, vastly in excess of what Members intended \nwhen they adopted this amendment a week ago.\n  Under the Feinstein-Thompson increase in hard dollars, we need to \ncome back to this. The Senator from Illinois offered a reasonable, \nsensible amendment to correct this problem. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I make the record clear. We asked for unanimous consent \nso we could continue to work on this amendment. I only addressed the \ncash on hand.\n  I agree completely with the Senator from Connecticut when it comes to \nthe increased hard money contribution. I hope to address that in my \ntechnical amendment, if not in conference. I agree with him completely \non the point. We have not had the time this morning to include that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If ever that were a faulty excuse, this is the time. \nThis was the first amendment adopted 2 weeks ago and the Senator from \nIllinois is here at the last minute trying to unravel an amendment that \ngot 70 votes. A Domenici amendment was passed 70-30 2 weeks ago and \nhere at the last minute we are trying to unravel it.\n  It is no surprise that there is some confusion about what is going \non. My conclusion is that a vote that got 70 Members of the Senate \nmaybe ought to stand. I think the Durbin amendment should be opposed.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 164, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Is it permissible to move to a second amendment? I want to \nsend a modification on behalf of the Senator to the desk on the Reed \namendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object--I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 37, between line 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

The Senator from Arizona has 1 minute.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 165\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment. It \nbasically codifies regulation. It requires the Federal Election \nCommission to promulgate new regulations to enforce the statutory \nstandards. It shall not require collaboration or agreement to establish \ncoordination, in addition to any subject determined by the Commission. \nIn other words, we are asking the FEC to promulgate regulations to \ncrack down on the abuses of coordination. I think it is legitimate. It \nneither favors unions nor business and corporations.\n  It may not be the answer that we both wanted, but it is a far \nsignificant improvement from the present language. I look forward to \nworking with the Senator from Kentucky in trying to improve it even \nfurther.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I urge that the amendment be opposed. I \nparticularly want to get the attention of the Republican Senators. I \nhave been predicting for 2 weeks that at the end there would be an \neffort to water down offending language that big labor did not like \nthat was inadvertently included, or maybe on purpose included, in the \noriginal McCain-Feingold. This is that effort. What it does is let big \nlabor continue to coordinate its ground game with the Democratic Party.\n  This is a modification of the original language in McCain-Feingold \nwhich the AFL-CIO thought was offensive. It is now being modified in a \nway that makes it bite less. So this will complete the job.\n  You noticed, all the amendments during the course of the last 2 weeks \nthat had any impact on labor at all were defeated. Now the provision \nthat was in the bill that was offensive to labor is being watered down. \nI urge that this amendment be opposed.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 20 seconds, if I \ncan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent for 20 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3194]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. This amendment covers every organization. If you are for \nMcCain-Feingold, you don't want to put people in the situation where \nyou are potentially becoming a criminal because you had a conversation. \nSo this covers the NRA, pro-life groups, every organization. Without \nthe adoption of this amendment, you have a situation that is inviting \ncriminality. I do not think any of us want to see that be the case. \nSenator McCain and others have worked this out. I urge the adoption of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized for 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me sum this up. This is the last gift to the AFL-\nCIO right here at the end of the bill. It will allow them to continue \nto coordinate their ground game with the Democrats.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nDomenici, DeWine, and Levin be shown as cosponsors of the modified \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am going to oppose the modified Durbin \namendment. Quite simply, it preserves all of the incumbency protection \nprovisions of the original Domenici amendment.\n  I compliment my colleague from Illinois on his attempt to correct his \namendment of last week, but this modification does not get the job \ndone.\n  Let me review for my colleagues what happened last Tuesday and which \nprovisions of the Domenici amendment are most objectionable to this \nSenator.\n  Last Tuesday the Senate adopted amendment number 115 offered by \nSenators Domenici, DeWine, Durbin, McConnell and others regarding \nwealthy candidates. The proponents of this amendment claimed that it \naddressed an unintended effect of the Buckley decision--namely, that \nwealthy candidates have a constitutional right to use their own \nresources to finance a campaign. My colleagues argued at the time that \nthe Buckley decision created a substantial disadvantage for opposing \ncandidates who must raise campaign funds under the current fund-raising \nlimitations.\n  That is an outrageous statement. Who among us really believe that we \nare disadvantaged by hard money contribution limits? The benefits of \nincumbency are well known and are recognized obstacles for challengers \nto overcome.\n  The contention of my colleagues, who supported the Domenici amendment \nlast week, is that the current limits are simply too low for incumbents \nto overcome challengers who have independent wealth. Consequently, \ntheir amendment establishes threshold amounts, based on the voting \npopulation of the state, which if exceeded by contributions of personal \nwealth by a candidate, would trigger outlandish benefits to an \nincumbent. Benefits of 4 to 6 times the contribution limits of current \nlaw.\n  I opposed that amendment because it clearly created yet another \nadvantage of incumbency--that of ignoring the significant wealth that \nincumbents also have in the form of campaign treasuries.\n  Moreover, the benefits afforded to an incumbent with a war chest were \nway out of line with the threshold limits that triggered these \nbenefits.\n  For example, in my State of Connecticut, the voting age population is \nroughly 2.5 million. Under the Domenici amendment, a wealthy candidate \nwould only have to expend $250,000 of his or her own resources to \ntrigger benefits to an incumbent. And what are those benefits? Well, it \ndepends upon how much the wealthy candidate spends.\n\n  If the wealthy candidate spends $500,000 of his or her own money--not \nan insignificant sum, but not huge either--the amendment would triple \nthe contribution rates for the incumbent. That means that the incumbent \ncould raise funds, equal to 110% of the $500,000, in amounts three \ntimes as large as current law. The incumbent facing this moderately \nwealthy challenger in the State of Connecticut would be able to solicit \n$6,000 per individual, per election for a total of $12,000, or $24,000 \nper couple. That is hardly reform.\n  But what if that moderately wealthy challenger expends twice that \namount\n\n[[Page S3195]]\n\nin personal resources, or $1 million? In that case, the so-called \ndisadvantaged incumbent can raise contributions from individuals at 6 \ntimes the current rate. In that instance, the incumbent could legally \nsolicit funds from an individual in the amount of $12,000 per election, \nor $24,000 per election cycle, or $48,000 per couple.\n  Is there anyone who believes that asking a couple to write a check in \nthe amount of $48,000 is reform or in the best interest of this \nDemocracy? I think not.\n  But let me add another twist. Suppose this same incumbent, facing the \nwealthy challenger, has a campaign account--as almost all incumbents \ndo. And in that campaign account there is a balance of $1,000,000, not \nan unrealistic amount for many incumbents. And yet, even though that \nincumbent has 1 million dollars in the bank, and the wealthy candidate \nspends only $500,000 of their personal funds, the incumbent still gets \n3 times the benefits. What is fair about that?\n  Some of my colleagues suggest that their campaign accounts are not \nthe same as a challenger's personal wealth--that they have worked hard \nto raise those campaign dollars, living within the current limits of \nonly $1,000 per individual per election. Before my colleagues feel too \nsorry for themselves, let me point out that I am sure that wealthy \ncandidate believes he has worked equally hard for his personal wealth. \nAnd like the wealthy candidate who, alone, controls whether to spend \nthose resources, the incumbent is similarly in charge of his or her \ncampaign account.\n  There is simply no way to justify treating an incumbent's war chest \ndifferently than a challenger's personal wealth. And yet, both the \noriginal Domenici amendment and this so-called fix offered today do.\n  The amendment by the Senator from Illinois also ignores what has \ntranspired since last Tuesday and the adoption of the original \namendment. Since that time, the Senate has adopted the Thompson-\nFeinstein amendment which doubled the hard money contribution limits \nfor individuals and indexed them for future inflation, so we are now up \nto $2,000 per year, or $4,000 per election, $8,000 per couple. That \namendment also doubled the amount that a Senate campaign committee can \ngive such a candidate to $35,000 and indexed it for inflation also.\n  In the period of a short week, we potentially gave an incumbent \nfacing a wealthy challenger an additional $17,500, plus an additional \n$4,000 per couple per election. To address these increased limits would \nrequire additional reform which Senator Durbin's amendment does not \naddress--that is, whether the benefits of this provision providing for \na triple or 6 times current rates, are now too great. When the original \namendment was drafted, the contributions limits were one-half of what \nthey are today. Consequently, any benefits offered by this amendment \nshould recognize that fact.\n  Moreover, this so-called fix is not a fix at all. To fairly level the \nplaying field, an incumbent's campaign treasury should be matched \ndollar-for-dollar by a wealthy candidate's spending of personal funds \nbefore any benefits accrue to the incumbent. But that is not what the \namendment before us does. Rather, it allows an incumbent to disregard \n50% of the funds in his or her war chest before matching such balances \nagainst the personal spending of a challenger.\n  So again, in the example of a race in Connecticut, the incumbent has \na war chest of $1,000,000, but only $500,000 of that is considered. So \nwhen the wealthy candidate spends $500,000 of his or her own money, no \nbenefits are triggered. But as soon as that wealthy candidate spends \n$1,000,000, the triple limits apply. That simply does not make sense. \nThe entire balance of the incumbent's campaign treasury should be \ncounted.\n  I opposed the original amendment because it did not appear to me to \nbe reform, and I oppose this so-called fix as well. I urge my \ncolleagues in the House to take a close look at this provision and \neither completely eliminate the Domenici provision from the bill--which \nwould be preferable--or amend it to eliminate the substantial loophole \nfor incumbents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for the third reading and was \nread the third time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, that essentially completes the \nunderlying bill, upon which final passage will occur at 5:30 on Monday. \nThere will be no more rollcall votes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I know the leaders were discussing this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 hour on Monday, off the \nbudget resolution, prior to the vote at 5:30 for Members to come over \nto make final comments about the adoption of this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, we need to check with \nour leader in terms of how that might impact the running of the clock \non the budget resolution, which is the most important item for next \nweek, obviously. I will have to object, until I get some word from the \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think it is appropriate to have at \nleast a brief discussion before final passage--very brief because we \nhave been on this 2 weeks. People do have a sense of what this issue is \nabout.\n  One possibility, of course, would be to let that time we use on this \nsubject count on the budget resolution. That would probably smooth the \npassage to approving this. We will get a report from our leader \nshortly.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I point out we are not on the budget \nresolution yet. I was just looking for time for Members to speak on the \nbill, to get a little time to be heard prior to final passage.\n  It seems to me that is not an unreasonable request. Given the 2 weeks \nwe have spent on this bill, I think Members would like to spend a few \nminutes expressing their thoughts on this legislation. Rather than take \nthe time of the Senate today, I thought prior to the vote on Monday was \nthe time to do that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The perfect time to do it is right now. We are \nbasically finished with business for today, and anybody who believes \nthey need to express themselves on this matter further after 2 weeks of \nrobust debate might want to take advantage of morning business, or \nsomething along those lines, today.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum until we \ncome to some understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Stuart Taylor, Jr. of the National \nJournal, has been among the more insightful and persuasive voices \nemerging against the so-called reformers' campaign finance effort.\n  In the January 1, 2000 edition of that publication, in a piece \nentitled The Media Should Beware of What it Embraces, Mr. Taylor \ncautions the media to reconsider its hypocrisy in so zealously \nattacking the first amendment freedom of every other participant in the \npolitical process.\n  This is especially significant because at one point not long ago, Mr. \nTaylor had advocated banning party soft money.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article by Mr. Taylor and an \narticle by Michael Barone, which ran in U.S. News, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the National Journal, Jan. 1, 2000]\n\n              The Media Should Beware of What It Embraces\n\n                        (By Stuart Taylor, Jr.)\n\n       The uncritical enthusiasm of most media organizations for \n     abolishing ``soft money'' and restricting issue advertising \n     by ``special interests'' prompts this thought: How would the \n     networks and The New York Times like a law imposing strict \n     limits on their own rights to editorialize about candidates? \n     After all, if some of their favored proposals were to be \n     enacted, the media would be the only major interest still \n     enjoying unrestricted freedom of political speech.\n       A few liberal legal scholars have proposed such laws as a \n     long-term component of any\n\n[[Page S3196]]\n\n     ``reform'' aimed at purging the influence of private money \n     and promoting true political equality. Associate Professor \n     Richard L. Hasen of Loyola University Law School (Los \n     Angeles) put it this way in the June issue of the Texas Law \n     Review:\n       ``If we are truly committed to equalizing the influence of \n     money on elections, how do we treat the press? Principles of \n     political equality could dictate that a Bill Gates should not \n     be permitted to spend unlimited sums in support of a \n     candidate. But different rules [now] apply to Rupert Murdoch \n     just because he has channeled his money through media outlets \n     that he owns. . . . The principle of political equality means \n     that the press too should be regulated when it editorializes \n     for or against candidates.''\n       Far-fetched? Politically impossible? Blatantly \n     unconstitutional?\n       Perhaps. But I'm not the only one worried about the lack of \n     a stopping point on the slippery slope that runs from such \n     seemingly modest proposals as the McCain-Feingold bill to the \n     notion of censoring New York Times editorials. Listen to \n     former acting Solicitor General (and former Deputy White \n     House Counsel) Walter Dellinger, the most widely respected \n     constitutional expert to come out of the Clinton \n     Administration:\n       ``I've been struck by how shallow the thought has been \n     about whether McCain-Feingold is a good idea. There's a \n     credible argument that political parties may be the least bad \n     place for monies to be funneled, and yet that's where money \n     would be limited.\n       ``[And] it's odd to see the press clamoring for restricting \n     independent spending on campaigns by everybody other than the \n     media. Even assuming that it would be desirable to say to one \n     individual or group that you may not spend more than X \n     dollars for television ads--while allowing another individual \n     to buy a television network and spend as much as he wishes \n     promoting a candidate or a party--it may be impossible under \n     the First Amendment to restrict the `media,' and it may be \n     technically impossible in the age of the Internet to draw \n     lines between the `media' and everyone else.''\n       Part of Dellinger's point is what more-conservative critics \n     of campaign finance restrictions stress: that each \n     incremental step advocated by us reformers would create new \n     problems and new inequities, fueling demands for more and \n     more sweeping restrictions on political speech.\n       I say ``us reformers'' because I have been among the \n     advocates of banning unlimited gifts of soft money to the \n     political parties. (See NJ, 9/11/99, p. 2535.) But while John \n     McCain and Bill Bradley have been riding a wave of media \n     acclaim for pushing various reforms, I've been having second \n     thoughts.\n       Banning soft money has considerable attraction because it \n     would stop corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals from \n     giving political parties the huge gifts that emit such a \n     strong stench of corruption, or at least of influence-\n     peddling.\n       But unless accompanied by a major increase in the caps on \n     individual contributions of ``hard money''--which most \n     campaign finance reformers vehemently oppose--a soft-money \n     ban could muffle the voices of the parties and their \n     candidates while magnifying the influence of the independent \n     groups (``special interests'') that have already come to \n     dominate some election campaigns. These include ideologically \n     based groups ranging from the National Right to Life \n     Committee on the right to the Sierra Club on the left.\n       Would it make sense to shift power from broad-based \n     political parties to ideologically driven interest groups \n     that are relatively unknown to the electorate? Dellinger \n     thinks not: ``It wasn't a political party that did the Willie \n     Horton ad. It was an independent expenditure group. . . . \n     They are free to do drive-by political character \n     assassinations without political accountability.''\n       In part for this reason--and in part because of the simple \n     urge to quiet their critics--many members of Congress insist \n     that any soft-money ban be coupled with restrictions on fund \n     raising by independent groups that use issue ads to influence \n     elections.\n       The House-passed Shays-Meehan bill would restrict fund \n     raising by such independent groups. And while those \n     restrictions have been stripped from the Senate bill (McCain-\n     Feingold) in order to pick up more votes for the effort to \n     abolish soft money, most reformers see that move as only a \n     temporary, tactical concession.\n       A further complication is the likelihood that the current \n     Supreme Court majority would strike down the Shays-Meehan \n     restrictions on independent groups, even it if upheld the \n     provision abolishing soft money. The reason is that the \n     danger of corruption that has persuaded the Justices to \n     uphold caps on hard-money contributions to candidates (and \n     that might persuade them to uphold a ban on soft-money \n     contributions to parties) seems far more remote when \n     independent groups are raising and spending the money.\n       Indeed, the urge of many reformers to restrict independent \n     groups has less to do with preventing corruption than with \n     equalizing the political clout of all citizens by reducing \n     that of people (and groups) with money. And that goal clashes \n     with the Court's crucial holding in 1976, in Buckley vs. \n     Valeo, that ``the concept that government may restrict the \n     speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance \n     the relative voices of others is wholly foreign to the First \n     Amendment.''\n       Suppose, however, that Congress does eventually abolish \n     soft money and tightly restrict issue ads and that the \n     Supreme Court goes along--and thereby abandons its First \n     Amendment ruling in Buckley. One result would be to weaken \n     the political parties and the independent groups alike by \n     restricting their fund raising.\n       Another result, liberal and conservative scholars agree, \n     would be to enlarge greatly the power of the big media \n     companies, because they would be the only major organizations \n     still free to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to \n     amplify their speech about political campaigns. A.J. \n     Liebling's line--``freedom of the press is guaranteed only to \n     those who own one''--would become truer than he ever \n     imagined. In such an environment, what justification would \n     remain for continuing to exempt the institutional media from \n     the pervasive regulation of everyone else?\n       Would the media be protected by their image of themselves \n     as disinterested, politically neutral guardians of democracy? \n     Hardly. The public is already properly skeptical of the \n     accuracy and fairness of the big media companies. Many of \n     them are already owned by commercial conglomerates, such as \n     General Electric (which owns NBC and half of MSNBC), Disney \n     (which owns ABC), and Rupert Murdoch's empire (which owns the \n     Fox network, The New York Post, The Weekly Standard, and \n     more). Many are even big soft-money donors.\n       And a media monopoly on freedom of political speech would \n     enhance the already considerable incentives for monied \n     interests seeking political clout to go into the media \n     business.\n       Could the media count on the Supreme Court to strike down \n     any congressional restrictions on their rights to \n     editorialize? Dellinger believes so. I'm a bit less \n     confident. For if we ever reach that point, Buckley vs. Valeo \n     will already be dead, the First Amendment will be \n     unrecognizable, and political speech will no longer be deemed \n     a fundamental freedom, but rather a privilege to be rationed.\n       In such a ``post-Buckley era,'' Hasen enthuses, ``op-ed \n     pieces or commentaries expressly advocating the election or \n     defeat of a candidate for federal office could no longer be \n     directly paid for by the media corporation's funds. Instead, \n     they would have to be paid for either by an individual (such \n     as the CEO of the media corporation) or by a PAC set up by \n     the media corporation for this purpose. The media corporation \n     should be required to charge the CEO or the PAC the same \n     rates that other advertising customers pay for space on the \n     op-ed page.''\n       This scenario seems very remote now. But it suggest some \n     questions that we should ask ourselves before jumping aboard \n     the campaign finance reform bandwagon: How far do we want to \n     go? Is there a good place to stop? Who will be at the \n     controls? And will we be any happier in the end that the \n     campaign finance reformers of 1974 have been with the system \n     they helped create?\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From U.S. News, Nov. 15, 1999]\n\n                       Money Talks, as It Should\n\n                          (By Michael Barone)\n\n       ``How a company lets its cash talk,'' read the headline in \n     the New York Times last month. The article tells of the \n     success of Samuel Heyman, chairman of GAF Corp., in lobbying \n     for a bill to change rules for asbestos lawsuits. The article \n     sets out how much money Heyman, his wife, and GAF's political \n     action committee have contributed to politicians and both \n     parties, and the reader is invited to conclude that this \n     billionaire and his company are purchasing legislation that \n     will benefit them. Money buys legislation, which equals \n     corruption: It is the theme articulated by John McCain in the \n     Senate last month and on the campaign trail; it was the \n     premise of questions asked at the Hanover, N.H., candidates' \n     forum and taken for granted by Al Gore and Bill Bradley in \n     their responses; it is the mantra of countless editorial \n     writers and of Elizabeth Drew in her book The Corruption of \n     American Politics.\n       But is it true? Careful readers of the Times's ``cash \n     talks'' story can find plenty of support for another \n     conclusion: ``Strong arguments talk.'' For 25 years, asbestos \n     lawsuits have transferred billions of dollars from companies \n     that once manufactured asbestos (it was banned in the 1970s) \n     to workers exposed to asbestos and their lawyers. Asbestos \n     causes sickness in some but by no means all workers many \n     years after exposure. But most claimants who have recovered \n     money are not sick and may never be, while those who are sick \n     must often wait years for claims to be settled. The biggest \n     winners in the current system are a handful of trial lawyers \n     who take contingent fees of up to 40 percent and have made \n     literally billions of dollars.\n       Heyman's proposal, altered somewhat by a proposed House \n     compromise, would stop nonsick plaintiffs from getting any \n     money, while setting up an administrative system to determine \n     which plaintiffs are sick and to offer them quick settlements \n     based on previous recoveries. The statute of limitations \n     would be tolled, which means that nonsick plaintiffs could \n     recover whenever signs of sickness appear. Sick plaintiffs \n     would get more money more quickly, while companies would be \n     less likely to go bankrupt; 15 asbestos firms are bankrupt \n     now, and the largest pays only 10 cents on the dollar on \n     asbestos claims. The two groups who lose, according to \n     Christopher Edley, a former Clinton White House aide and \n     Harvard Law professor who\n\n[[Page S3197]]\n\n     has worked on the legislation, would be nonsick plaintiffs \n     who might get some (usually small) settlements under the \n     current system and the trial lawyers who have been taking \n     huge contingent fees.\n       These are strong arguments, strong enough to win bipartisan \n     support for the bill, from Democratic Sens. Charles Schumer \n     and Robert Torricelli as well as House Judiciary Chairman \n     Henry Hyde and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. You would \n     expect Hyde and Lott to support such a law, but for Schumer \n     and, especially, Torricelli, it goes against political \n     interest: Torricelli chairs the Senate Democrats' campaign \n     committee, and Democrats depend heavily on trial lawyer \n     money. One can only conclude that Schumer and Torricelli were \n     convinced by strong arguments, which was certainly the case \n     for Democrat Edley, who was writing about cases long before \n     Heyman's bill was proposed. When McCain charged that the \n     current campaign finance system was corrupt, Republican Mitch \n     McConnell challenged him to name one senator who had voted \n     corruptly. Certainly no one who knows the issues and the \n     senators involved would have cited this case.\n       Air pollution? And not just this case. When a government \n     affects the economy, when it sets rules that channel vast \n     sums of capital, people in the market economy are going to \n     try to affect government. They will contribute to candidates \n     and exercise their First Amendment right to ``petition the \n     government for a redress of grievances,'' i.e., lobby. Both \n     things will continue to be true even if one of McCain's \n     various campaign finance bills is passed. There is no \n     prospect for full public financing of campaigns (Gore says \n     he's for it, but he has never really pushed for it); one \n     reason is that it leaves no way to prevent frivolous \n     candidates from receiving public funds. (Look at the zoo of \n     candidates competing for the Reform Party's $13 million pot \n     of federal money). Reformers speak of campaign advertisements \n     as if they were a form of pollution and try to suppress issue \n     ads as if no one but a candidate (or newspaper editorialist) \n     had a First Amendment right to comment on politicians' \n     fitness for office. And to communicate political ideas in a \n     country of 270 million people you have to spend money.\n       The idea that the general public interest goes \n     unrepresented is nonsense. There is no single public \n     interest; reasonable people can and do disagree about every \n     issue, from asbestos lawsuits to zoo deacquisitions. This \n     country is rich with voluntary associations ready to \n     represent almost anyone on anything; any interest without \n     representation can quickly get some. Even when the deck seems \n     stacked, as it has for trial lawyers on asbestos regulation, \n     there will be a Samuel Heyman with, as Edley puts it, ``the \n     moxie to act on his convictions.'' Money talks, as it always \n     will in a free society. But in America, and on Capitol Hill, \n     strong arguments can talk louder, and do.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it has been encouraging to see the \nevolution of this debate over the years. While the New York Times and \nWashington Post are a broken record, repeating ad nauseam the tired and \ndisproven cliches of the reform industry, there has been a marked \nincrease in dissents put forth op-eds and scholarly works.\n  Among the leading columnists who has weighed in on behalf of the \nfirst amendment perspective is Charles Krauthammer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Krauthammer's column of March 23, \n2001 in the Washington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 23, 2001]\n\n                        McCain's Costly Crusade\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       Pharmaceutical companies live on patent protection. They \n     make their profits in the few years they enjoy a monopoly on \n     the drugs they have discovered. They fight fiercely to \n     protect their turf, and given generously to politicians to \n     make sure they protect that turf too.\n       Who, then, do you think has just issued a report showing \n     that changes in law and regulation have effectively doubled \n     the drug companies' patent protection time? Some tiny, \n     Naderite public interest group? Some other representative of \n     the little guy?\n       No. A nonprofit institute founded and largely funded by the \n     insurance companies. Insurance companies, you see, pay the \n     bill for patent protection by drug companies. And they don't \n     like it. There is more than one 800-pound gorilla in this \n     room.\n       You wouldn't know that from hearing John McCain talk about \n     how special interests buy their way in Washington. They try \n     to, but they run up against the classic Madisonian structure \n     of American democracy. Madison saw ``factions,'' what we now \n     call interests, not only as natural, but as beneficial to \n     democracy because they inevitably check and balance each \n     other.\n       His solution to the undue power of factions? More factions. \n     Multiply them--and watch them mutually dilute each other. For \n     two centuries we followed the Madisonian model. But now \n     McCain's crusade calls for restriction rather than \n     multiplication: curtailing the power--and inevitably the \n     right to petition and the right to free speech--of special \n     interests.\n       True, money in politics in corrupting; opponents of McCain \n     should admit as much. Generally one can't prove quid pro \n     quos. But it is obvious that legislators are more attentive \n     to the views of those who give money. Otherwise, they \n     wouldn't give it. The problem, however, is that like all \n     attempts to banish sin from public life--Prohibition, for \n     example--campaign reform comes at a fearful price.\n       There are three basic ways to conduct effective political \n     speech: own a printing press; buy a small piece of space (or \n     time) in a medium owned by others, say, 30 seconds on TV or a \n     page in a newspaper; or bypass the media and directly support \n     a political actor--candidate, leader, party--whose views \n     reflect yours.\n       McCain-Feingold would drastically restrict the third, by \n     banning ``soft money'' contributions to parties. The Snowe-\n     Jeffords amendment would drastically restrict the second by \n     curtailing political ads by outside groups.\n       This is bad policy, first of all, on principle. Free speech \n     is the first of all the amendments not by accident. It is the \n     most important. Which is why we regulate it with the most \n     extreme circumspection. It borders on the comic that the \n     First Amendment should be (correctly) interpreted as \n     protecting nude dancing and flag-burning but not political \n     speech. And there are few more effective ways for someone who \n     does not own a printing press to express and promote his \n     political views than by contributing to a party that reflects \n     them.\n       Hence, the second problem with McCain-Feingold. It purports \n     to eliminate the influence of money and power in politics. In \n     fact, it eliminates only some influence. It does not end \n     influence peddling. It only skews it.\n       By restricting Madison's multiple factions, McCain-Feingold \n     radically tilts the playing field toward (a) incumbent \n     politicians, who enjoy the megaphone of public office; (b) \n     the very rich, who can buy unlimited megaphone time (which is \n     why so many now populate the Senate); and (c) media moguls, \n     who own the megaphones.\n       The conceit of McCain-Feingold is that politicians \n     prostitute themselves only for big corporate or individual \n     contributors. But they give far more care and feeding, \n     flattery and deference to the lords of the media. It stands \n     to reason.\n       They can be helped or hurt infinitely more by the New York \n     Times or network news shows than by any lobbyist. By \n     restricting the power of contributors, McCain-Feingold \n     magnifies the vast power of those already entrenched in \n     control of information.\n       How to mitigate the effects of money? By demanding absolute \n     transparency, say, full disclosure on the Internet within 48 \n     hours of a contribution, so that contributions can be the \n     subject of debate during, not after, the campaign. And by \n     requiring TV stations, in return for the public licenses that \n     allow them to print money, to give candidates a substantial \n     amount of free air time.\n       Far better to reduce the demand for political money rather \n     than the supply. For the Robespierre of American politics, \n     however, such modest steps are almost contemptible. McCain's \n     mission is not the mitigation of sin but its eradication. Yet \n     like all avengers in search of political purity, McCain would \n     leave only wreckage behind: a merely different configuration \n     of influence-peddling--and far less freedom.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, William Raspberry has also made some \nastute observations on this issue over the years. In the March 23, 2001 \nWashington Post, in a column entitled ``Campaign Finance Frenzy,'' Mr. \nRaspberry makes a refreshing observation, conceding that while he is \ndrawn to ``reform'' he is not sure just what ``reform'' means. What is \nit? A fair question.\n  ``I don't quite get it,'' Mr. Raspberry writes. He's for it but \nconfesses to not being sure what it is.\n  I venture to guess Mr. Raspberry speaks for a lot of people who are \nnot intimately familiar with the McCain-Feingold bill and the \njurisprudence which governs this arena.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Raspberry's column be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 23, 2001]\n\n                        Campaign Finance Frenzy\n\n                         (By William Raspberry)\n\n       When it comes to campaign finance reform, now being debated \n     in the Senate, I don't quite get it.\n       I know what the problem is, of course: People and \n     organizations with big money (usually people and \n     organizations whose interests are inimical to mine) are \n     buying up our politics--and our politicians. It is \n     disgraceful, and I'd like it to stop.\n       What I don't get is how the reform proposals being debated \n     can stop it.\n       Up to now, I've been too embarrassed to say so. I think I'm \n     for McCain-Feingold, but that's largely because all the \n     people whose politics I admire seem to be for it. Besides, \n     John McCain looks so sincere (I don't really\n\n[[Page S3198]]\n\n     have a picture of Russ Feingold in my mind) and the Arizonan \n     has made campaign finance reform such an important matter \n     that he was willing to risk offending a president of his own \n     party. I'm attracted to people of principle.\n       Similarly, I've been denouncing the substitute lately put \n     forward by Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) because my colleagues \n     who know about these things say it is a sham--even a step \n     backward. I don't like shams.\n       The problem is (boy, this is humiliating!) I don't know \n     what I want.\n       Do I want to keep rich people from using their money to \n     support political issues? Political parties? Political \n     candidates? No, that doesn't seem right.\n       Didn't the Supreme Court say money is speech, thereby \n     bringing political contributions under the protection of the \n     First Amendment? That pronouncement, unlike much that flows \n     out of the court, makes sense to me. If you have a First \n     Amendment right to use your time and shoe leather to harvest \n     votes for your candidate, why shouldn't Mr. Plutocrat use his \n     money in support of his candidate? If it's constitutional for \n     you to campaign for gun control, why shouldn't it be \n     constitutional for Charlton Heston and the people who send \n     him money to campaign against it?\n       If money is speech--and it certainly has been speaking \n     loudly of late--how reasonable is it to put arbitrary limits \n     on the amount of permissible speech? Is that any different \n     from saying I can make only X number of speeches or stage \n     only Y number of rallies for my favorite politician or \n     cause?\n       But if limits on money-speech strike me as illogical, the \n     idea that there should be no limits is positively alarming. \n     Politicians--and policies--shouldn't be bought and sold, as \n     is happening far too much these days.\n       The present debate accepts the distinction between ``hard'' \n     and ``soft'' contributions--hard meaning money given in \n     support of candidates and soft referring to money contributed \n     to political parties or on behalf of issues.\n       McCain-Feingold would put limits on hard money \n     contributions and, as I read it, pretty much ban soft money \n     contributions to political parties. Hagel would be happy with \n     no limits on contributions to parties but has said he might, \n     in the interest of expediency, accept a cap of, say, $60,000 \n     per contribution.\n       Hagel's view is that the soft money given to parties is not \n     the problem, since we at least know where the money is coming \n     from. More worrisome, he says, are the ``issues'' \n     contributions that can be made through nonpublic channels and \n     thus protect the identity of the donors.\n       Why has money--hard or soft--come to be such a big issue? \n     Because it takes a lot of money to buy the TV ads without \n     which major campaigns cannot be mounted. Politicians jump \n     through all sorts of unseemly hoops for money because they're \n     dead without it.\n       So why aren't we debating free television ads for political \n     campaigns? Take away the politician's need for obscene sums \n     of money and maybe you reduce the likelihood of his being \n     bought. We'd be arguing about how much free TV to make \n     available or the thresholds for qualifying for it, but at \n     least that is a debate I could understand.\n       All I can make of the present one is that I'm for campaign \n     finance reform, and I'm against people who are against \n     campaign finance reform. I just don't know what it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/30/senate-section/article/S3198-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, in my brief tenure in the Senate, I \nhave never witnessed the Senate perform better or meet the expectations \nof the American people so unequivocally. The Senate is particularly \nindebted to the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, , and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, for presiding over this debate and dealing \nwith difficult moments. They have led the Senate to what is, in my \nexperience, its finest hour.\n  I will confess, when this debate began on McCain-Feingold, I had real \nreservations as to whether, indeed, an attempt at narrow reform could \ngenuinely result in comprehensive campaign finance reform. This \nlegislation has exceeded my expectations. The public may have expected \nsimply an elimination of soft money, but many of us who have lived in \nthis process know that the rise of soft money contributions was only \none element in a much broader problem.\n  This legislation is genuine comprehensive campaign finance reform. We \nhave dealt with the need to control or eliminate soft money, but also \nreduce the cost of campaigns themselves, allowed a more realistic \nparticipation through hard money contributions, and dealt with the \nrising specter of eliminating the class of middle-class candidates in \nthis country by opening this only to become the province of the very \nwealthy.\n  The burden may soon go from this Congress to the Supreme Court. I \nonly hope that the Supreme Court meets its responsibility to protect \nthe first amendment, assuring that in our enthusiasm to deal with \ncampaign finance abuses we have not trespassed upon other fundamental \nrights of the American people. I understand that is their \nresponsibility. I know they will meet it.\n  I hope they also balance that this Congress felt motivated to deal \nwith the problem of public confidence, assuring the integrity of the \nprocess; that, indeed, the Court is mindful that we have attempted to \nmeet that responsibility.\n  I have never felt better about being a Member of this institution. I \nam proud of my colleagues. I believe we can feel good about this \nproduct. It is not partisan in nature. It does not deal with one part \nof this problem. It is broad. It is deep reform. It has been a good \nmoment for the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate will debate, beginning next week, \nlegislation that will be remembered by Americans for decades to come.\n  The budget resolution that the Senate will debate will set the Nation \non a course that will change, that will affect, and that will impact \nupon people's lives for a generation or more.\n  How long is a generation? One might think in terms, in speaking of a \ngeneration, of 25, 30 years. We are at a unique moment--hear me--we are \nat a unique moment in the history of this Nation when we must decide \nwhat is the most appropriate way to allocate a projected surplus when \nwe know that just over the horizon we are facing the staggering costs \nof the retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  What do we mean in terms of the calendar when we speak of the baby \nboom generation? I started out in politics in 1946. The baby boom \ngeneration began then and there, for the most part, in 1946. That was a \ngood starting point. Ten years from now, when 53 million Americans are \nexpecting Social Security--hear me--10 years from now, when 53 million \nAmericans will be expecting Social Security to be there for them in \ntheir retirement, they will remember--they will remember--whether we \nvoted for a budget resolution that failed to address the long-term \nfinancing crisis that faces the Social Security program. They will \nremember, and so will we.\n  Ten years from now, when 43 million Americans--hear me, again--10 \nyears from now, when 43 million Americans are expecting to rely on the \nMedicare program for their health care, they will remember whether we \nvoted for a budget resolution that failed to address the long-term \nproblem--they will remember whether we failed to address the long-term \nproblem--the financing crisis that faces the Medicare program. Forty-\nthree million Americans will remember us, whether we addressed the\n\n[[Page S3199]]\n\nfinancing crisis that faces the Medicare program.\n  Ten years from now our elderly citizens will remember if we, in our \nday in time, voted for a resolution that failed to provide a fair \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Ten years from now our children--our children--will remember if we \nvoted for a budget resolution that resulted in a nation with a failed \ninfrastructure--broken roads, dilapidated bridges, polluted water, \nwater that is not safe to drink. They will remember if we voted for a \nbudget resolution that forced them to go to crumbling schools. What \nwill we say, when they say: Where were you?\n  When God walked through the Garden of Eden--in the cool of the day, \nwhen the shadows were falling, when the rays from the Sun were dying \nout in the west--Adam was hiding. God said, ``Adam, Adam, where art \nthou?''\n  Ten years from today, the people of America will look at today's \nlegislators, on both sides of the aisle--they will look at the mighty \nmen and women who were given the awesome honor and the profound duty to \nserve this country in this hour--and they will say to us: Where were \nyou? Where were you? You were there at a time when you could have acted \nto preserve this system, this Social Security system, Medicare, our \ninfrastructure, our Nation's schools, its forests, its parks. You were \nthere. You had the chance. You had the duty. Where were you?\n  This is a critical debate. I have been through lots of them. This is \nas critical a debate, you mind me--hear me, listen to me--this is as \ncritical a debate as you will ever participate in or witness or hear or \nsee in your lifetime, this debate that is coming up on the resolution \nnext week. And yet as we approach this critical debate, we are being \nasked to do so without a detailed President's budget, without a markup \nin the Senate Budget Committee, and based on highly, highly \nquestionable 10-year surplus projections--projections. Guesswork--that \nis what it is, these projections.\n  When Alexander was being importuned by the Chaldeans upon his return \nfrom India not to enter the city of Babylon, Alexander said: ``He is \nthe best prophet who can guess right.''\n  That is what we have here. He is the best prophet who can guess \nright. And who knows? Who knows? When one looks at these 10-year \nprojections that tell us there will be these huge surpluses, $5.6 \ntrillion--that is the projection for 10 years--it isn't worth the paper \nit is written on. What is the weather tomorrow? What is the weather \nthis coming weekend? What is the weather the middle of next week? They \ncan't tell us. With all of our marvelous techniques, they can't tell \nus. What will the stock market do on Monday? They can't tell us. They \ndidn't know in advance that it was going to drop 436 points in one day.\n  Yet we are told that we have massive surpluses down the road and, on \nthat basis, on the basis of those projections, we are going to have a \n$1.6 trillion tax cut. And it is growing. All in all, it is already \nwell over $2 trillion, and still growing. Some are saying we ought to \nhave a bigger one based on these projections.\n  We are operating without a detailed President's budget, without a \nmarkup in the Senate committee, and based on these highly questionable \n10-year surplus projections. We do not have a detailed proposal from \nthe President of the United States on how to address the Social \nSecurity crisis. We do not have a detailed explanation from the \nPresident on how to fix the Medicare program. We do not know the \ndetails of his proposed budget cuts that are supposed to help pay for \nhis proposed $2 trillion tax cut. We don't have it.\n  Yet we are not only being importuned but we are virtually being \nforced to take up this budget resolution next week with a beartrap \nrestriction on time that militates against the Senate's working its \nwill. We are being forced into this situation, and we can't even see \nthrough a glass darkly, as the Apostle Paul said. We are flying blind. \nYou know the old saying: It is your money.\n  I hear a lot of talk about bipartisanship. I think that is what the \npeople want--bipartisanship. Let us hope we can give it to them. But \nthey want something else, too. They want us to do our work, and they \nwant us to do our work well. That is what they are paying us to do. \nThat is why they gave every Senator here the votes that placed upon our \nshoulders the toga of senatorial honor. With that honor goes the duty.\n  They want us to do our work. They want us to do it well. They want us \nto represent their views and their interests well. Doing that--\nrepresenting their views and their interests well--should be a \nbipartisan concern, a concern of every Member of this body regardless \nof party.\n  It is our sworn duty, especially now, now when we are debating a \nbudget that will set the course of this Nation for the next decade. And \nthe ramifications of this budget will go far beyond the next decade. We \nowe our people our very best judgment.\n  How can we exercise that judgment, if we don't know the details of \nthe President's budget? How can any of us go back to our people at home \nand claim that we knew what we were doing on this critical matter--a \nbudget that will largely set our course for the next 10 years and \nbeyond--when we only had just a little, teeny-weeny glimpse of the \npicture on which to base our judgments and to base our votes? \nConscience should pain us very deeply if we dare make that claim.\n  The Members of this Senate do not at this time--not one Senator in \nthis body--know the details of the President's budget. Yet we are \nbeginning to consider the budget in 2 days--Saturday, Sunday, Monday. \nMembers have no committee report from the Budget Committee--none. \nHaving no committee report, Members therefore have no majority views. \nMembers have no minority views. We don't have any committee report. We \nare denied a committee markup of a resolution.\n\n  On that point, let me say, I have been told--I want to make this \nclear--I have been told by one of my colleagues in the Senate--it may \nbe a Republican, it may be a Democrat; I am on good speaking terms with \nboth sides--I was told that one of our Republican colleagues told this \ncolleague, whom I am now quoting, that the reason the Budget Committee \ndid not vote on a budget resolution was that Robert Byrd in some way \nhad precluded it or prevented it.\n  Do you see what is going on here? There is an effort apparently to \ndemonize Robert Byrd, along with some other Senators. But I am the \ndemon, understand, according to that rumor, and that is all it is. \nApparently, the reason we don't have a measure that has been reported \nout of the Budget Committee, called a markup, is that Robert Byrd \nsomehow prevented it.\n  I am waiting on any member of that Budget Committee to come to the \nfloor and say that to me, right here and before other Senators. That is \nthe kind of old wives' tale, the kind of rumor, that has no basis \nwhatsoever. Yet it is being used to create fiction here in the minds of \nthe Republicans that the reason we don't have that markup is because of \nSenator Byrd. It is what he did in the committee. He prevented it. He \nprevented it. Senator Byrd prevented it.\n  There isn't a scintilla of truth in that. I have seen that happen \nbefore. I have been a victim of demonizing before in the Senate.\n  I am the one who asked the question at the last meeting, ``Is this \nthe last meeting of the committee? If it is, why don't we have a \nmarkup?''\n  Well, Members have no committee report, Members have no majority \nviews, and Members have no minority views because we have no committee \nreport. We are flying as blind as if we were flying in a blizzard with \nour eyes sewn shut. It should be of no comfort at all to the American \npeople, who are watching through those electronic eyes above the \nPresiding Officer's chair, that the blindness is completely bipartisan.\n  Now that is truly bipartisan. The blindness is completely bipartisan. \nNo Member of this Senate, regardless of party, has a complete picture \nof what is contained in this 10-year budget. Further exacerbating our \ncommon difficulties here is that there is no clear mandate for the \nPresident's budget.\n  I respect this President. I have an admiration for this President. I \nlike what he said in his inaugural speech. I like the fact that he \nreferred to the Scripture, to the Good Samaritan. I like the fact that \nwhen I sat down with him at dinner in the White House last week, at his \ninvitation--he was kind enough to\n\n[[Page S3200]]\n\ninvite me, my colleague Ted, the chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee, and our wives to dinner at the White House. I \nlike the fact that he said grace. He asked God's blessing upon the \nfood. In many circles in this town and across this land, the word \n``God,'' except in a profane use, is taboo. Don't mention God. On TV, I \nnoticed the other day a Member of the other body swore in a witness and \nsaid, ``Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give \nis the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.'' I said to \nmy wife, ``Why did that Member not also say `so help you God' ''?\n  So you can use God's name all you want to in profanity. That is the \n``in'' thing, but don't use it otherwise. But this President used God's \nname. He had us all bow our heads. He didn't call on me and he didn't \ncall on Senator Stevens. He, himself, thanked God for the food.\n  So what I am saying is, I have a great respect for this President, \nbut this President has no clear mandate for this budget. Look at the \nSenate. It is 50/50; half the people on one side, half on the other. So \nthere is no clear mandate for this President's budget. The election was \na virtual dead heat. Who would know that better than the distinguished \nSenator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, who is on this floor. The election \nwas a virtual dead heat. The Senate is split 50/50. We have no clear \ndirection from the people on what they think of this budget plan. They \ndon't know about it.\n  I say to Senators, as they said in the days of the revolution, ``Keep \nyour powder dry. Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes.'' I \nthink we ought to wait to see what is in this budget before we buy into \nit. Let's wait and see before we have this concurrent resolution on the \nbudget before this Senate.\n  We have no clear direction from the people on what they think of this \nbudget plan because they don't know what is in it. All they know is \nwhat they heard in a campaign that maybe started up in the snows of \nwinter in New Hampshire. Maybe that is where this idea came from, the \n$1.6 trillion, or whatever it is. Maybe it is where some of the other \nthings came from. But we have no clear direction from the people today \non what they think of this budget plan because they have not seen it, \nand neither have any of our colleagues on the right or on the left, on \nthe Republican side, on the Democratic side. We are all like the blind \nleading the blind, in which case we all fall into the ditch.\n  Such a situation underscores every Senator's responsibility to \nunderstand the details before he casts his vote in the name of the \npeople he or she represents.\n  (Ms. STABENOW assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, what I am saying is nonpartisan. I am \nsaying on behalf of my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, \nwho are in the majority, in a 50/50 Senate: You have a right to know \nthe details of the President's budget. And I say that to my colleagues \non the Democratic side: You have a right to know. And I say to the \npeople out yonder in the hills, in the mountains, on the Plains, on the \nstormy deep: You have a right to know what is in that budget. And we \nwon't know because, apparently, the die is cast and the concurrent \nresolution on the budget will be called up next week under the \nrestrictions of the Budget Act.\n  So here we have it. It is the product of hearings and the product of \nthe chairman's work--the chairman and his staff. And I have a very high \nrespect for the chairman. He has been kind enough, upon occasion, to \ncome to my office and talk with me about matters. There is a bond \nbetween us. It will not be broken, but what we are going to be voting \non next week, the concurrent budget resolution--will be the handiwork, \nfor the most part, at this moment, of the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee.\n\n  The House has passed a concurrent resolution on the budget. I have \nnot seen it. It may very well be that the leader will call that up. \nThat will be the basic measure on which we begin to work our will.\n  There are reconciliation instructions in that measure. If there were \nreconciliation instructions in the Senate measure that had come out of \nthe Budget Committee, I would like, under the circumstances, to move to \nstrike those instructions. There may not be any reconciliation \ninstructions in the Senate Budget chairman's proposal which may be \noffered as a substitute for the House resolution. Then perhaps there \nwill be an alternative by the ranking member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee.\n  Who knows how this will work itself out? But let us say just for the \nmoment that when the product leaves the Senate, it leaves without \nreconciliation instructions. It still has to go to conference, and \nthere Senate conferees will be faced with the reconciliation \ninstructions of the House. They will be in conference.\n  I know my colleague from Florida wants to speak or wants me to yield. \nLet me say before I yield, Senators simply do not know. It is a stacked \ndeck. We do not know what the cards are in that deck. We do not know on \nwhat we will be voting. I say wait and see what is in that President's \nbudget before you make up your mind to support, for example, a massive \ntax cut of $1.6 trillion or $2 trillion, which is what it will amount \nto certainly by the time the other matters are taken into \nconsideration. Wait until you see. Do not jump, do not leap, do not \nstart across that railroad crossing. The red lights are flashing. Do \nnot start across it. Do not launch out into that unknown. Do not sign \nup. Do not sign up here. Let us wait and see what is in the President's \nbudget. I think you are in for some surprises.\n  A short time ago, we received an outline of the President's budget. I \nhave it right here--this so-called blueprint: ``A Blueprint for New \nBeginnings.'' Now that is just a little peek, a little peek; let's see \nwhat this does; a little peek, just a little peek. We get to see just a \nlittle peek of what will be in the President's budget. Yet, we are \nexpected to sign on at this juncture and say: Sign me up; I am for \nthat; I will be for that; I am for a $1.6 trillion tax cut, or whatever \nit may be. Sign me up.\n  How are you going to pay for it? Out of what domestic programs is the \ncost going to come? You cannot count on those. It is really a laughing \nmatter, to count on those projected surpluses out there.\n  What are some of the programs that are going to help pay for that tax \ncut? I am going to sign up for tax cuts; put me down; put my name down; \nI am going to sign up for that.\n  What are you prepared to give for that tax cut? Look at your children \nout there in those crowded classrooms. Look at the broken windows in \nthe schools. Look at the broken plumbing in the schools. Look at our \nhousing developments where the people live. Look at our parks and our \nforests. What about Medicare? What are we going to do about Medicare? \nWhat are we going to do about Social Security? What about our \nhighways? What about our airports? What about safety in the air? What \nabout safety in drinking the water in this country that comes out of \nthe faucet? Are you willing to suffer huge cuts in those programs? What \nabout energy? We are facing an energy crisis in this country. What are \nyou willing to give there? And I can go on and on and on.\n\n  Why do we want to get on board something blindfolded--blindfolded? So \nI say wait and see, wait and see. We should have the budget before us. \nWe are the people's elected representatives. We have no king in this \ncountry. People decided that over 200 years ago. The people's \nrepresentatives--you, the Presiding Officer, you, the Senator, my \nfriends on the Republican side--they are as entitled to know what is in \nthis budget as we, the Democrats, are. Their duties are as deep, their \nresponsibilities are as demanding as are ours.\n  So I am making a bipartisan, or nonpartisan, speech this afternoon, \nand I am saying: Let us have the President's budget. No one can tell me \nthat, this late in the game, the executive branch cannot share with us \nthe budget details. Why won't they share the budget details with us? \nThey can do it. Why don't our friends on the Republican side tell the \npeople in the Republican administration: Share with us; we have as much \na responsibility as the Democrats have to know where we are going; \nshare with us; what is in this budget?\n  Even if I had to wait on the document itself, why shouldn't the \nadministration at this point in time be willing, and why should not \nMembers on both sides feel the need for, the desire for,\n\n[[Page S3201]]\n\nthe necessity for the details that are in that budget? They are \navailable somewhere. Surely they are not going to fall from the skies \non the first day after recess. They are around. Why can't we have them \nbefore we vote?\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson. He is on \nthe floor. He has been sitting here and listening, and he is now \nstanding. I am prepared to yield the floor or I can yield to him, \nwhichever he desires.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, that I be allowed to yield \nto the Senator for a statement if he wishes or for questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I thought it might be \ninstructive in the course of this debate if the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia might explain the gravity of the situation contained \nwithin the budget resolution having to do with reconciliation \ninstructions; how several months from now it would bring back to this \nbody a tax bill that would be able to be debated only under very \nconfined circumstances, throwing out the history, the tradition, and \nthe rules of the Senate which have caused it to be recognized as the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world.\n  Would the Senator please explain for purposes of this debate the \nthreat to the institution that is known as the greatest deliberative \nbody in the world?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the very distinguished Senator. \nWilliam Ewart Gladstone, who was Prime Minister of England four times \nreferred to the U.S. Senate as ``that remarkable body, the most \nremarkable of all the inventions of modern politics.''\n  Why did he do that? Because this Senate is so unique there is nothing \nelse in the world like it. There has never been anything in the world \nlike it. It is the forum of the States, and as a result of the Great \nCompromise of 1787, July 16, the States are equal in the Senate. The \nStates are equal. Every State is equal to every other state when it \ncomes to voting.\n  Here, if anywhere, the people's representatives may debate freely and \nmay amend at length.\n  From 1806 until 1917, there was no limitation on debate in this body. \nSince 1917, of course, debate can be limited in this body by the \ninvocation of the cloture rule. Other than that, the only way, as the \nSupreme Court has said, we can have debate limited in this Senate is if \nwe limit it ourselves; if we agree by unanimous consent agreement that \nwe will limit debate, then it will be limited.\n  Now comes the Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. From that \nday to this we have had, by virtue of that act, a Congressional Budget \nOffice, we have had congressional Budget Committees in the two Houses, \nand we have agreed by that act to bind our hands and to restrict \nourselves in regard to debate and to amendments on concurrent budget \nresolutions, reconciliation bills, and conference reports thereon.\n  The purpose of that act was to set up a framework of fiscal \ndiscipline which would allow us to oversee the whole budget, its \nrevenues, its expenditures, and certain other elements of the fiscal \nequation, and exercise discipline and reduce the deficits.\n  Prior to that time, we passed 13 appropriations bills. Each little \nsubcommittee, being a little legislature of its own, adopted its \nappropriation bill without knowledge of what the other dozen \nsubcommittees were including in the appropriation bills they were \nreporting out. We had no control over the global fiscal situation, but \nthe Budget Reform Act enabled us to unify the actions of all of these \nsubcommittees and to have better control of the overall fiscal picture \nand to exercise fiscal discipline.\n  It came with a price, as I say. It came with very severe restrictions \non debate time and on amendments.\n  Now, to answer the distinguished Senator's specific question, in the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget we will lay out the blueprint for \nthe year, and the impact will be for many years into the beyond. In \nthat blueprint, there will likely be reconciliation instructions. The \nConcurrent Resolution on the budget, which will be coming up next week, \nhas a time limitation of 50 hours: 2 hours on amendments in the first \ndegree; 1 hour each on debatable motions, or appeals or amendments in \nthe second degree.\n\n  But this measure will say to the Finance Committee in the Senate, or \nthe Ways and Means Committee in the House, to report a bill providing \nup to x amount of money for tax cut purposes. It may say up to $1.6 \ntrillion. It will instruct that Finance Committee here or the Ways and \nMeans Committee in the House to bring back a reconciliation measure \nwith x amount for tax cuts.\n  The Finance Committee eventually will bring back its tax bill. That \nis where the vote will come on cutting the taxes--not here. This \nconcurrent resolution on the budget will never become law. It will \nnever even get to the President's desk. He will never sign it. That \nFinance Committee will report back a tax bill. That is the \nreconciliation bill about which the Senator is asking. On that measure, \nthere will be 20 hours of debate--20 hours, half to the majority and \nhalf to the minority. That means we on our side of the aisle will have \n10 hours, my Republican friends on the other side of the aisle will \nhave 10 hours.\n  Under the act, the majority party can yield all of its time back if \nit wishes at any point. Let's say just for the purpose of having an \nunderstanding, the majority party could yield all of its time back, \nyield its 10 hours back; that would leave 10 hours on our side--the \nminority.\n  Suppose then, the minority wishes to offer an amendment, which under \nthe act is 2 hours. Guess what? The majority, let's say, has already \nyielded all its time back on the resolution. Guess what? The majority \ngets half the time on the amendment that we, the minority, offer on our \nside. So, in effect, the majority could, in a certain scenario, end up \nwith 5 of the minority's remaining 10 hours.\n  Let's go a bit further. The majority could move to cut remaining time \non the measure to 2 hours or to 1 hour or to 30 minutes or to zero \nminutes. It is not a debatable motion, and it carries by a majority \nvote.\n  If we were to follow the thesis that might makes right, a party could \nmake us go to a vote without any time left for debate. It is a \nbeartrap. It is a gag rule. Who is being gagged? The people, our \nconstituents, because their elected representatives are being gagged.\n\n  Enough said, in response to the question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, will the Senator further \nyield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, I retain the floor and I \nmay yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  He started telling us the story about one of the great Prime \nMinisters of England, Gladstone--four times Prime Minister--who made \nreference to the Senate as a great deliberative body. The scenario the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia has just outlined is a \ndescription that could occur on this floor, in the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world, that would foreclose debate, would stop \namendments, would ram down the throats of Senators a piece of \nlegislation that would have far-reaching economic and fiscal \nconsequences for this Nation, without the opportunity for debate and \namendment.\n  As we contemplate this prospect happening as a result of our passing \nthis budget resolution next week, will the Senator further contemplate \nand reflect upon the history of the Founding Fathers in crafting this \nConstitution in the protection of the minority and how those rights of \nthe minority might be trampled next week?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I want to yield the floor soon. There are \nother Senators here, including the Senator from Florida, who want to \nspeak. I do not want to maintain the floor.\n  Let me answer the Senator like this. One of the reasons for the \nSenate's being is for the protection of the minority. The minority can \nbe right. With respect to the upcoming Budget\n\n[[Page S3202]]\n\nResolution, the minority is being gagged by the events that are \nbringing us up to the point of action on the concurrent resolution on \nthe budget. And a part of that gagging, if I may use the word this \nway--a part of that gagging is that we are being forced to act on the \nPresident's budget without seeing the President's budget. That is a \nkind of gagging, as I see it. Senators are not going to be able to \nspeak on what is truly in the President's budget.\n  It is a fast-track operation that takes away the rights of the \nminority. In this instance, it is also going to take away the rights of \nthe majority Senators. They won't see the budget either.\n  Let me leave it at that for the moment. I hope I will have another \nopportunity one day to speak on this. But let me close by saying this. \nThe Senator from Florida, the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, the \nSenator from Delaware here--these Senators, and the Senators on the \nother side of the aisle, come here wanting to work for the people, \nwanting to be a part of a productive process, and wanting to fulfill \ntheir commitments to the people who send them here. That is what they \nwant to do.\n  They must understand, however, that they cannot do that and achieve \nthe full potential if the minority--and in this instance it is also the \nmajority, meaning both sides, Republican and Democrats--are forced to \ndebate a matter which is a revolving target. We can't see it: It is \nhere--no. It is here--no. It is there. It is here. It is there. We \ncan't see it. It is a budget we shall have to read in the dark.\n  A Senator cannot fulfill his high ideals. He comes here with the \nhighest, most noble purpose. ``I do not want to be a part of the \nbickering. I want to be a part of making things happen. I want to serve \nmy people. It is time to get on with the business of the people. I \ndon't want to be a part of this bitter partisanship.''\n  But how can you do what you want to do if you have this resolution \ncrammed down your gullet because of a time constriction here that is \ngoing to be enforced and because you don't know what is in that budget? \nBelieve me, if you did know what is in that budget, it might change \nyour mind on many things in that budget, one of which could be a $1.6 \ntrillion tax cut.\n  It may not change your mind. Senators shouldn't have to vote in the \ndark. Senators shouldn't have to wear blinders in making this decision. \nThis decision isn't just for you, or for me, or for my children today. \nIt is not just for my grandchildren today, not just for my great-\ngranddaughter, Caroline. It is beyond all these, because we will be \nlaying down a baseline here. We are going to be laying down a baseline. \nWe are going to be making decisions here without knowing what we are \nreally voting on really, and that decision is going to affect our \nchildren and their children.\n  We know it is going out there 10 years, but that is not the whole \npicture. It is a fateful decision that we are embarking upon, and we \nare being forced to make these judgments sight unseen in many \ninstances--a pig in a poke.\n  That is not right. That is wrong. That is not just. That is an \ninjustice to our people.\n  Madam President, I am going to yield the floor. I thank the Senators \nwho are here on this nice afternoon. We have finished our voting for \nthe day but these Senators are still working.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nI may proceed for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I want to add to the comments \nof the very distinguished Senator who has taught us freshmen Senators \nso much in the few short days that we have been here.\n  If I may dare to expound upon the lesson that he has already taught \nus today by just underscoring the fact of this wonderful experiment we \nsometimes call a democracy is really a republic. The rights of the \nminority were one of the most cherished rights to be protected under \nthe Constitution. That is why a body such as this was developed, \ncrafted, and created by those political geniuses who, at a moment in \nhistory, happened to come together and create this government.\n  For the protection of the rights of the minority, they clearly \nintended that whenever a piece of legislation would come in front of \nthis body--which would be so important that it would have an economic \nconsequence over years and years--that it ought to have the right of \ndebate for more than 10 hours.\n  You heard the Senator describe how this tax bill may come back to \nthis body and only have 10 hours of debate. And through the process of \namendment it could have even less than 10 hours of debate.\n  No one ever contemplated that a $1.6 trillion tax bill--which all the \neconomists are starting to tell us is really a $2.5 trillion tax cut, \nand maybe even more--would ever be discussed, debated and amended in \nless than 10 hours.\n  That is a travesty; and, that is what the American people need to \nunderstand is about to happen, if we don't clean up this budget \nresolution next week.\n  I echo the sentiments already expressed by the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia that we should have, as a priority--and I can tell \nyou my people in Florida have clearly indicated to me in no uncertain \nterms that their No. 1 priority is to pay down the national debt, out \nof this surplus, if it continues to exist, and if the projections are \nright. One projection is $5.6 trillion. But recently that was lowered \nto $4.5 trillion. With the economy seemingly going in a downward trend, \nwho knows what that projection of the surplus is going to be?\n  It is incumbent upon us, as we all have agreed, that we enact a \nsubstantial tax cut. It is incumbent upon us to make reasoned \njudgments, with fiscal restraint, on how we can pay down the national \ndebt; enact a tax cut; and, provide for certain other priorities in \nthis nation that my people have also told me that they want very much:\n  A prescription drug benefit that will modernize Medicare;\n  A substantial investment in education, so we can bring down class \nsize; so we can pay teachers more; and, so we can have safer schools \nand have those schools be accountable.\n  My people have also instructed me about their concern for the \nenvironment. They want investment there. They clearly are concerned \nabout health care; and, they want investment there. They are concerned \nabout providing for the common defense. They want an additional \ninvestment there--to pay our young men and women in the armed services \nadequate wages to keep the quality we need in the defense of this \ncountry, instead of losing it to the private sector.\n  I have mentioned a few things. All of those are high priorities for \nthe people of this nation, and I know they are high priorities for the \npeople of Florida.\n  They sent me up here to exercise judgment about how to pay down the \nnational debt, and how within the resources we have, to enact a \nsubstantial tax cut, take care of those other needs, and to be fiscally \ndisciplined in the process of exercising that judgment--so we don't run \nourselves into the economic ditch like we did in the 1980s, when we \nwere deficit financing.\n  I will conclude. I have been through this before because I was one of \nthe people who voted for the 1981 tax cut. It was an excessively large \ntax cut. It was well intended, but it was overdone. It was overdone so \nmuch so that we had to undo it--not once, but three times--in the \ndecade of the 1980s, while I was in the House of Representatives.\n  As a result of that, and a lack of fiscal restraint by the Congress, \nthe annual deficit spending--that is spending more than you have coming \nin in tax revenue--in the late 1970s went from approximately $22 \nbillion to close to $300 billion by the end of the decade--that's \nspending $300 billion more in that one year than we had in tax \nrevenue. You see what the result was in the economy in the 1980s. You \nsee how painful it was to have to turn that around.\n\n  Thus, it is our responsibility in the government of the United States \nto wisely spend the surplus. And I can tell you, this one Member of the \nSenate wants to be able to exercise his judgment for the people who \nsent me here to be as fiscally disciplined and fiscally restrained as I \ncan--so we don't go back into that economic ditch.\n\n[[Page S3203]]\n\n  I am grateful, beyond measure, to the Senator from West Virginia for \nthe history lessons he has provided for us, for the perspective he has \nprovided for us, for the knowledge he has provided about what can \nhappen to the economy of this Nation. It is my intention, with every \nounce of energy I have, to continue to speak out on the issue of fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  There is a very crucial vote that is coming up next week on how we \ndispose of this budget resolution, and how we dispose of the \nreconciliation instructions, which will ultimately determine how we \nhandle the tax bill when it comes back to the Senate for debate.\n  Again, let me say, in closing, what a tremendous privilege it is for \nme to be a part of this deliberative body. I want to be a good Senator. \nI want to be a Senator who reaches across the aisle to forge bipartisan \nconsensus. And that opportunity is either going to be there or not, in \ngreat measure, next week. I hope it is going to be a bipartisan \nconsensus.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business with Senators \npermitted to speak for 10 minutes each.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from New York speak out of order and that she may \nspeak for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object if the Senator chooses to speak for 20 minutes, but I would \nlike to get in the queue, if I might. Since the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia has been speaking now or has had the floor at least \nfor over an hour, I would like, after the Senator from New York has \nconcluded--for however long she takes--to have the right to speak or be \nyielded time for up to 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I come to the floor today to speak out \nand join the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida to express our concerns about the \nupcoming budget debate.\n  First, I thank Senator Byrd for his extraordinary commitment to this \ninstitution, which is really unprecedented in history and is such a \nblessing for not only the institution and those who have been \nprivileged to serve with him but for our country. And I heed his words \nseriously because he has taken the long view about what is in the best \ninterests of a deliberative body, of this Senate, of a nation, that \nshould rely upon the careful, thoughtful analysis of the issues that \ncome before us and the people we represent.\n  I am personally grateful to him for the time he has taken as my good \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from Florida, referred to, to help \nmentor us freshmen Senators, to give us the guidance we need to be able \nto do the best possible job for the people who sent us here. And it is \nsuch an honor to stand on the floor of this Senate, a place I have long \nrevered, on behalf of New Yorkers.\n  But I come today with somewhat of a heavy heart because I believe in \nthe principles and values this Senate represents. I want to see them \nfulfilled. I want to be a part of perpetuating them into our future.\n  I find myself, as a new Member, struck by how difficult it will be to \ndischarge my responsibilities in the upcoming week without having seen \nthe budget, without having the opportunity to debate its priorities, \nand even more than its priorities, the values which it seeks to \nimplement. I do not know that the people I represent, or the people any \nof us represent, will get the benefit of our best judgment, that the \ndecisions we make will be grounded in our careful, thoughtful analysis.\n  There will certainly be differences among us. That is what makes this \na great deliberative body and makes our country so great. We come with \ndifferent experiences. We come with different viewpoints. I come as the \ndaughter of a small businessman who did not believe in mortgages, did \nnot have a house until he could pay for it with cash, did not believe \nin credit, and who believed it was his responsibility to always make \nsure our family's books were balanced.\n  I come with the belief that we had to go to extraordinary efforts to \nmake sure our economy enjoyed these last 8 years of prosperity and \nprogress and that we could not have done so had we not reversed the \ndecade of deficits and debt that really did undermine America's \ncapacity at home and abroad.\n  So when we talk about the important debate in which we will engage \nnext week, I think it is the most important debate in which I may \nengage in my entire term as Senator. It is certainly one of the most \nimportant debates for our country, and everyone who is following it, to \nunderstand what is at stake.\n  This debate will set our priorities as a nation for the foreseeable \nfuture and could determine whether or not we have surpluses, whether or \nnot we will be prepared for the impending retirement of the baby \nboomers that starts in just 11 years. It is a debate that will \ncertainly be about numbers, deficit projections, surplus projections, \nand spending.\n  But I think underlying it is a debate about who we are as a people. \nIt is not only about our prosperity, not only about our Federal \nbudget--it is certainly about that--it is about who we are as \nAmericans.\n  I come to this body determined to represent the people of my State \nand our country, as all of us do. But will we be able to do that? We \nare going to be deciding, in the votes we cast--starting with \nprocedural votes--whether or not our seniors will have prescription \ndrug benefits. We are going to be deciding whether or not our children \nwill have the teachers they need and the schools they deserve to have. \nWe are going to be deciding whether we have the sewer systems and the \nclean drinking water that every American deserves and should be able to \ncount on. We are going to be deciding whether or not we do have the \nresources to maintain America's strength around the world, whether we \nwill combat terrorism, whether we will stand firm with our allies. We \nare going to be determining whether we make the investments in research \nand development that will make us a stronger, richer, smarter nation in \nthe decades ahead.\n  I am deeply concerned that we enter this debate without the benefit \nof the administration's budget.\n  I am privileged to serve on the Budget Committee under the \nextraordinary leadership of the Senator from North Dakota and my \ncolleagues, the Senators from West Virginia and Florida. We sat through \nfascinating hearings. We listened as our defense priorities were \ndiscussed, as our education priorities were discussed, as our health \ncare priorities were discussed. We listened to experts from all across \nthe spectrum of economic opinion and analysis. I found it an \nextraordinarily enlightening experience. But we are not going to get a \nchance to debate with our colleagues what it is we as a committee \nshould be deciding to recommend to this body with respect to the budget \nwe will be debating. So we are flying blind. We are looking through a \nglass darkly. We are in the dark.\n  Will this budget have the investments we need to protect child care \nand child abuse programs? The early information is it will not; that we \nwill be turning our backs on working parents, cutting tens of millions \nof dollars from child care. Will we protect our most vulnerable \nchildren, those who are abused? The information we have, without a \nbudget but kind of leaking out of the administration, suggests that we \nare going to be asked to cut child abuse prevention programs.\n  We also are being told that we are going to be asked in this budget \nto cut training programs for the pediatricians who take care of the \nsickest of our children in our children's hospitals. These are very \ndifficult issues in any circumstance, but not to have the chance to be \nable to analyze what is\n\n[[Page S3204]]\n\nbeing proposed is troubling to me. Will this budget ensure our children \nwill grow up in a safe environment with clean water and clean air, with \naccess to quality, affordable health care? Will it adequately protect \nour food supply? Every day we see a new article in the paper about what \nis happening with our food supply in Europe, in the United States, \naround the world. Will we be able to protect ourselves so we have the \nkind of reliable food supply that Americans deserve?\n  What are we doing in this time of surplus to ensure a safety net for \nall Americans, young and old? The prescription drug benefit that we \nhear about from the administration would leave over 25 million of our \nseniors without prescription drugs. I don't want to choose between some \nof our seniors and others in New York, those who may be just a penny \nover the limit that they, therefore, won't get the prescription drugs \nthey need. I want to make sure that everyone on Medicare--and that is \nwhat most Americans want--has access to those prescription drugs.\n  To pay for the tax cut, the administration includes the Medicare \nsurpluses. Those are resources that should be ensuring the solvency of \nMedicare for all Americans, totally in a reserve that is set off, never \nto be used for any other obligations. I believe other obligations that \nwe have should be paid for in the context of a balanced budget and not \nput Medicare at risk.\n  The administration has correctly committed to doubling the number of \npeople served through community health centers. I support that. It is a \nworthy goal. But then on the other hand, I understand they are doing it \nby completely eliminating the community access program that ensures \nthat community health providers work together to create an \ninfrastructure for care so no patient falls through the cracks. New \nYork is filled with wonderful religiously based hospitals, privately \nbased hospitals that are part of this infrastructure of care that would \nbe left out completely. We also have the finest teaching hospitals in \nthe world. There are no resources that will continue to make sure that \nthey are the finest in the world. New York trains 50 percent of all the \ndoctors in America. What are the plans for making sure that continues \nand that our teaching hospitals are given the resources they need?\n\n  We are also hearing that the administration's budget will provide \nmore security guards for our Nation's schools. That, too, is a worthy \ngoal. In fact, I was heart broken to hear today of yet another school \nshooting in another school in another part of our country. That is an \nissue we must address. If security guards would help, I will support \nthat. But I am troubled and my heart goes out to the families who are \nsuffering these terrible tragedies in school shootings.\n  I will do whatever I can on all fronts to try to deal with that \nproblem. But I understand from the President's budget that they are \nshifting funds from the very successful COPS Program that has really \nhelped us drive down the crime rate in order to pay for the security \nguards at the schools. We are robbing Peter to pay Paul. Why would we \ntake resources away from the COPS Program, where so many brave men and \nwomen put on the uniform and walk those streets, that has become so \neffective in driving crime out of neighborhoods? Why would we take \nmoney away from our police officers and put it in our security guards \nat schools, if we need to do both? I argue strenuously we do.\n  Are we being confronted with such a Hobson's choice because of a \ngenuine shortage of resources or are we making these choices and \ncutting needed investments simply to allow for an enormously expensive \ntax cut that leaves millions of Americans out, leaves millions of \nAmerica's working families again behind where they need to be in order \nto make the decisions that are best for their families because we are \nfavoring others?\n  The kinds of priorities I speak of today, for which I have fought for \nso many years, going back to the days when we tried to bring fiscal \nresponsibility to our budget, when we tried to lower the crime rate, \nwhen we tried to improve health care and education and protect the \nenvironment, are bipartisan priorities. These are genuinely American \npriorities. Child care, child abuse prevention, police on our streets, \nwe don't stop and ask: Are you for it or against that based on party? \nWe say: Isn't this something we should do together in America?\n  Madam President, I hope we will come together once again, Republicans \nand Democrats, Americans, to fashion a budget that pays down the debt, \nwhich is still the best tax cut we can give the vast majority of \nAmericans. That is what puts money in your pocket when you have to have \na mortgage, when you do have a credit card, when you do have a car \npayment. Let's keep those interest rates down.\n  We have learned from the last 8 years that the best way to do that is \nto be fiscally responsible and pay down our debt.\n  We need to provide sensible tax relief. Everybody in this Chamber is \nfor that--sensible, affordable, fiscally responsible tax relief that \nsays to every American, we are going to make it possible for everybody \nto share in these surpluses. We are not going to favor one group over \nanother. That is the kind of tax relief I would be proud to be part of \nand for which I will speak out.\n  Finally, we need a budget that invests in our Nation's most pressing \nneeds, not just what we see right before us. The fact that we should \ncontinue to lower class size in the early grades, that we should \ncontinue to modernize our schools, those are needs I see every day. I \ngo in and out of schools. I talk with teachers and parents and \nstudents. I know how much better our education system can be if we have \nboth increased accountability and increased investments. I know we have \nneeds that are staring us right in the face that we may be turning our \nback on if we are not careful.\n  I also want to be looking to the horizon, looking around the corner. \nIt is not just enough to take care of today. We have to be thinking \nabout next year and the next 10 years and the next 25 and 50 years, if \nwe are to fulfill our obligations as stewards for our people. That \nmeans we cannot turn our backs on the demands of Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  As a member of the so-called baby boomer generation, I do not want to \nbe part of a generation that is not responsible. The World War II \ngeneration is often rightly called the greatest generation. I am proud \nof the service of my father. I am proud of the service of all who came \nbefore. But they also understood the investment that needed to be made. \nIt was in those years after that war when we started investing in our \nNation's schools, started building the Interstate Highway System, \nstarted making the investment that we, frankly, have been living on for \nthe last 50 years in this country. How on Earth can we keep faith with \nthose who came before us, let alone our children and grandchildren and \ngreat grandchildren, if we don't have the same level of responsibility?\n\n  I think we have a rendezvous with responsibility, and it is now. If \nwe turn our backs on that responsibility, we are going to have a great \nprice to pay. Maybe the bill won't become due until 5 years, 10 years, \nmaybe 15 or 25 years. But like my colleagues who have spoken, I want to \nbe able to say to the young children I meet that we tried to be \nresponsible, we tried to do the right thing that will make us a \nstronger, richer, smarter nation.\n  The American people--and I certainly know that people in New York who \nsent me--send us here to Washington to work together across party \nlines, to make the tough choices necessary to move our country forward. \nThat is exactly what I want to do. It is not necessarily going to mean \nthat Democrats will support all Republican proposals, or vice versa. \nBut what it does mean is that we will reason together and work together \nto do what is right for our Nation. I hope when that process begins \nnext week we will have a chance to really sit down and look at the \nPresident's budget, have a good, honest, open debate, as we just had \nthese last few weeks about another very important matter before this \nbody, and that we will honestly say what the priorities are we are \nsetting, the values we stand for, the vision we have for America.\n  I believe there won't be a more important issue that I will face. I \nwant to make my decisions in a deliberative, thoughtful manner. I want \nto look for ways I can work with my friends across\n\n[[Page S3205]]\n\nthe aisle, as well as my colleagues on this side, because I want to be \nsure that at the end of the day we have done the right thing for the \nchildren of America. If we are not going to leave any child behind, \nthen let's make sure we know what we are voting on that will affect \nevery child.\n  If we can make that determination to work together, I am confident we \ncan come up with a bipartisan, sensible policy that leads to a budget \nwe can support. In the absence of that, it will be very difficult to do \nso, and I hope that certainly the people of New York and America \nunderstand we are trying to stand firmly in favor of a process that may \nsound arcane and difficult from time to time to understand but which \ngoes back, as Senator Byrd so rightly points out, to people who were \nvery thoughtful about how to design a process that protected the rights \nof everybody. It is not just about that, as important as that is; it is \nfundamentally about the choices we will make for the children and \nfamilies of America.\n  I know that people of good faith will find a way to come to a \nresolution about how we proceed next week. I am looking forward to \nthat. But I do have to say that, in the absence of such an agreement, I \nfor one will have to be asking the hard questions the people of New \nYork sent me here to ask about what specifically will be done to affect \nthe hopes and aspirations and needs and interests of the people I \nrepresent.\n  So I will be guided by three principles:\n  Will this budget pay down the debt to continue us on a path of fiscal \nresponsibility that protects Social Security and Medicare?\n  Will we be in a position to recognize that the investments we need to \nmake are important investments that are not going to disappear \novernight?\n  And, at the end of the day, will we have made decisions that will \nprotect America's long-term interests at home and abroad?\n\n       Madam President, I hope I will be able to answer \n     affirmatively every one of those questions.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the distinguished Senator from \nArizona yield me just a couple of minutes?\n  Mr. KYL. Certainly.\n  Mr. BYRD. Without the time being charged to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Madam President, I merely want to take this moment to thank both of \nthe Senators on my side of the aisle who have spoken this afternoon--\nthe Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, and the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York, Mrs. Clinton--in support of the need for having the \nPresident's budget in the Senate before the Senate debates and amends \nthe concurrent resolution on the budget.\n  They have spoken from their hearts. I have sat and listened to every \nword, and I am personally grateful for the insights they brought here, \ntheir dedication, their perception of the necessity for our having the \nPresident's budget, or at least knowing what is in the budget before \nthe Senate proceeds to it.\n  Let me also thank them for their desire to work with other Senators \non both sides of the aisle, their desire for bipartisanship, their \ndesire to work with our Republican leadership and our Republican \nSenators. Both of these Senators who have spoken have manifested that \nvery clearly, stated it clearly, and it comes from their heart because \nthey came here to do the work of the people, and they know that the \nwork of the people and of the Nation and our children cries out for \nbipartisanship, cries out for us working together to meet the needs of \nthis country.\n  That is what they are here for. That is what they are here to do. I \nthank them for such a clear enunciation of the need to serve our people \nand, in so serving, the need to have before us all of the facts and \ndetails that we can so we can exercise judgment on both sides of the \naisle. I thank them from the bottom of my heart.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/30/senate-section/article/S3205-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3205-S3208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, while the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia is still here, let me thank him for the remarks he has just \nmade. I, too, listened very carefully to his remarks, as well as to the \nSenator from Florida and the Senator from New York.\n  But I must say that I find this rather bemusing--if I am using that \nterm correctly. People around the country might wonder why there is \nsuch an emphasis on, or such a concern for, taking up the budget. After \nall, isn't it time to take up the budget? Indeed, in the normal course \nof events in the Senate, we would be taking up the budget about right \nnow. So why is there all this expression about concern about taking up \nthe budget? I suggest it has to do with the old phrase, ``You follow \nthe money.''\n  While I came here to speak about another subject, I want to speak for \na few minutes about this subject because I think people across this \ncountry deserve to know what is really behind all of this talk about \ntaking up the budget. You see, the truth is, until we take up the \nbudget and pass a budget, we can't take up tax relief. Until we take up \nand pass tax relief, the money that is available here in Washington to \nbe spent by the politicians will be spent by the politicians. So you \nfollow the money. If we never take up the budget, then we can't pass \nthe tax relief. If we don't pass the tax relief, the money that the \nhard-working families of this country have sent to Washington, DC, will \nbe available for this Congress to spend.\n  People who like to spend other people's money don't want to see tax \nrelief. They can't stand in the way of tax relief, which is too \npopular. It is going to pass. But they might be able to stop the budget \nfrom being considered, based upon some parliamentary procedures. That, \nMadam President, is what I think this is all about.\n  Let me take the four points that have been raised by my friends \nacross the aisle in order:\n  First of all, that we can't possibly take up the budget yet because \nwe don't have the details of the President's budget. I have in my hand \na copy of something called ``A Vision of Change For America.'' The \nSenator from West Virginia will remember this. It is dated February 17, \n1993.\n  This is what the Democratically controlled Senate had before it when \nit considered the budget resolution in that year. We did not have the \nClinton budget. There was no Clinton budget.\n  Like the first year of President Bush, that was the first year of \nPresident Clinton. It takes a new President's team a little while to \nput together the budget, but that has never stopped the Congress from \npassing a budget in the ordinary timeframe because that is the first \nthing we have to do. We are pretty well stymied in all of the other \nthings we have to do in terms of reconciliation, in terms of \nappropriations, until we have adopted the budget.\n  What is this ``Vision for Change for America'' that President Clinton \nsent up? It was not a budget, as he acknowledges here; it was a \nblueprint, a vision, as he called it, pretty similar to the document \nthe Senator from West Virginia has been referring to that President \nBush sent up to Capitol Hill.\n  It is a blueprint. It is a vision for what he would like to do. There \nis a lot of information in it. It is not as detailed as the usual \nbudget, to be sure, but there is plenty of information about the \ngeneral direction he would like to take.\n  What happened to this ``Vision for Change for America''? Did \nRepublicans say: We cannot possibly take this budget resolution up; we \nhave to wait for a detailed budget by President Clinton? Actually, I \nthink some Republicans did say that, but the Democratic leadership \nsaid: Forget it; we are going to take up the budget resolution, and \nthis body passed a budget resolution in a number of days--we are trying \nto determine whether it was 12 or 13. It was a number of days, close to \n2 weeks, before the real Clinton budget was sent up here. The Senate \nacted upon its budget resolution before it ever had the detailed \nClinton budget before it.\n  I do think it is a bit much to argue that it is unprecedented, that \nit is improper for the Senate to take up a budget resolution when it \nhas not yet got the exact, complete, detailed budget from the \nPresident. We know full well the general direction this President's \nbudget is going to take.\n  The second point is that there are questionable forecasts. I have \nheard\n\n[[Page S3206]]\n\nthe phrase twice used here, ``looking through a glass darkly.'' My \ngoodness, we have to make decisions every day based upon what we think \nis going to happen. We cannot know for certain. As the fine Senator \nfrom West Virginia pointed out, we can hardly forecast the weather \ntomorrow, and that is true.\n  Yet we make decisions in the Congress, in the Government, in \nbusiness, for our own families every day based upon imperfect and \nuncertain knowledge of what is going to happen in the future. We have \nto do that; otherwise, we would be frozen into inaction. We would never \nbe able to do anything. We do the best we can.\n  We have been using very conservative budget estimates. The \ncongressional budget estimates are that over the next 10 years, we \nwould have about a $5.6 trillion surplus and in that President Bush has \ndecided to ask for $1.6 trillion over a 10-year period to be returned \nto American taxpayers. That is the size of his tax cut.\n  That tax cut was proposed during the campaign when the estimated \nbudget surplus was far less. That budget surplus has grown virtually \nevery quarter since then. It is now up to $5.6 trillion, $5.8 trillion.\n  Given the fact that these are conservative estimates, given the fact \nthat we all have to make decisions on imperfect information, it \ncertainly seems to me we ought to at least proceed to take up the \nbudget. My goodness, we will be here all year waiting for exactitude, \nand nobody, of course, expects that.\n  The third point I have heard is there is not going to be room for \ndebt relief if we are not careful. That, of course, is not true. I was \nin a hearing yesterday of the Finance Committee in which we had experts \ntalk about how much debt we could pay down and over what period of \ntime.\n  Everybody agrees that the debt can be paid down within the 10-year \nperiod as far as we can possibly pay it. The only difference is, can we \npay it down to about $500 billion or down to $1 trillion, somewhere in \nbetween there? The experts are in disagreement as to where exactly we \ncan pay it down. It is virtually impossible to pay off more debt than \nthat because it is held by people in long-term obligations and \nobligations that would cost too much to buy back.\n  We are going to pay down the debt all we can, and there is just over \n$1 trillion left, after we have done the tax cuts, after we have paid \noff the debt, and after we have paid for everything on which the \nGovernment has to spend money, plus a 4-percent rate of growth, more \nthan the rate of inflation. And that is on top of record huge \nhistorical increases in spending over the last 2 years, all of which \nare built into the baseline.\n  We have the historic spending, greater even than--well, literally any \nother period in our history, including all but the largest year of \nspending in World War II. We have historic spending levels. We are \nincreasing that spending; we are paying off the national debt; we are \nproviding $1.6 trillion over 10 years in tax relief; and we still have \nanother billion dollars left over. That does not sound to me to be a \nvery risky proposition.\n  Finally, the fourth point that has been raised by our friends on the \nother side is we have to come together in a bipartisan spirit, and \nthat, I gather, is why the Democratic leadership has worked so hard to \nget every single Democrat to oppose the budget resolution in an \nabsolute 100-percent partisan vote. That is bipartisanship?\n  Every Democrat can decide to oppose this budget resolution on the \nbasis that they do not like it. That is totally fair. They will \nprobably all conclude that is why they are not going to vote for it, \nand I certainly respect that. But I think it is a bit much to talk \nabout a spirit of bipartisanship when we already know that for several \ndays this week, the Democratic leadership has been working very hard to \nget an absolute, 100-percent partisan vote against the Republican \nbudget resolution. That is not bipartisanship.\n  That is the condition we are faced with right now. Why wouldn't \nSenators want to take up the budget? What is really behind this? As I \nsaid, follow the money. We cannot cut taxes until we take up the \nbudget, and that, in fact, is why some Senators do not wish us to take \nup the budget.\n  Paul Harvey has a saying at the end of his broadcast in which he \nsays: ``And that's the rest of the story.'' If we are direct and clear-\neyed about this, this is the rest of the story. It has nothing to do \nwith whether we should take up the budget, whether we have enough \ninformation to take up the budget, whether it is time to take up the \nbudget, whether we will have all week long to debate the budget, to \noffer amendments to the budget. All of that will be quite possible.\n\n  It all has to do with partisan politics to delay taking up the budget \nso that we delay taking up the issue of tax relief because there are a \nlot of folks who do not want the degree of tax relief for which \nPresident Bush has called.\n  I see my distinguished friend from West Virginia wants to intercede \nwith a comment which he will pose in the form of a question, and I will \nbe happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am struck with amazement, if I might say. \nI thank the distinguished Senator for yielding. But when he charges the \nDemocratic leadership with having spent all these days trying to get a \nsolid vote against this resolution, I ask the question: What on Earth \nhas the Republican leadership been doing this past week?\n  I am sorry that this discussion is taking a very partisan turn.\n  I say that with all due respect to the very distinguished Senator. I \ndidn't come here to speak in politically partisan terms. I have been \ntalking about the need for both sides of the aisle to have the \nPresident's budget in front of us before we vote.\n  May I say to the distinguished Senator, I don't determine my vote on \nwhat the leadership on this side says or what the leadership on that \nside says. So let me debunk his mind with respect to that.\n  Let me get to the earlier point of the distinguished Senator when he \nspoke of the ``Vision of Change,'' when he was reacting to my comments \nregarding ``A Blueprint for New Beginnings,'' this outline of what the \nBush administration is proposing. It is a mere outline. The \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona reminded the Senate that in 1993 the \nSenate operated on the basis of this document entitled ``A Vision of \nChange for America.''\n  The difference, may I say to my friend, and he probably already knows \nthis, the difference in 1993 and now is that this document in 1993 \ncontained more detail than does this document on which we are going to \nhave to base our judgment, apparently, in the forthcoming debate next \nweek.\n  Furthermore, in that instance, the Budget Committee had a markup and \nreported to the Senate a concurrent resolution on the budget. That is \nnot the case here. The Budget Committee of the Senate has not had any \nmarkup this year. In 1993 the Budget Committee had a markup. It sent to \nthe Senate a document, a resolution, that came out of that committee \nand was the result of that committee's deliberations, both Democrats \nand Republicans. Further, in that instance, CBO had enough information \nto provide an analysis of Clinton's 1993 budget.\n  We need a CBO analysis for this budget. We don't have it here. We had \nit then. We had a markup by the Budget Committee that year; we were \ndenied a markup in the Budget Committee this year. We were denied that \nopportunity. We had a CBO analysis in 1993; in this instance we don't \nhave. Furthermore, in that instance we were following the true purposes \nof the Budget Reform Act in that we were seeking to reduce the \ndeficits; in this case we are going to increase the deficits in all \nlikelihood if we enact a huge tax cut purely on the basis of projected \nsurpluses.\n  And finally, in that instance, not a single Republican in the Senate, \nnot a single Republican in the House of Representatives, voted for the \nbudget. So, if my friends on the Republican side are going to hold this \ndocument up and say, look what we did back then, the Senate went ahead \nand acted on the basis of that document. That is the role model, I \nassume they are saying. Look at what you did, you Democrats; you did it \nwithout the President's budget in 1993.\n  But they fail to remind listeners that not a single Republican voted \nfor that document, and that that document is the basis for the surge of \nsurpluses that\n\n[[Page S3207]]\n\nwe now enjoy. The budget in 1993 took us out of the deficit ditch and \nmade possible the surpluses of today, and yet not a single Republican \nin either House voted for that document. And here we are today, the \nRepublicans are extolling the 1993 budget.\n  Mr. KYL. I think the Senator from West Virginia would concede I have \nbeen quite liberal in yielding to him to answer that question.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator has. I wanted to help set the record straight.\n  Mr. KYL. I know that, and I appreciate the Senator helping to set the \nrecord straight. Let me set it exactly straight, however.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am waiting.\n  Mr. KYL. President Clinton's vision of America was transmitted on \nFebruary 17, 1993, 145 pages long, outlining the details of the fiscal \n1993 spending stimulus package and tax increase plan, plus the other \nvisions of President Clinton.\n  President Bush's ``Blueprint for New Beginnings,'' of which the \nSenator from West Virginia has a copy, was transmitted on February 28, \n2001. The document is 207 pages long and outlines a 10-year budget plan \nwith $1.6 trillion in tax cuts.\n  The Senator from West Virginia might say my document is more detailed \nthan your document. I think that is a matter of judgment. My document \nis longer than your document. It covers a longer period of time.\n  The fact is, neither are budgets in the pure traditional sense, the \nSenator from West Virginia would acknowledge. Both are the best the \nadministration could do within the short period of time they had, and \nin both cases the majority party in the Senate sought to take up a \nbudget resolution prior to the submission of the budget by the \nPresident.\n  The Democratic-controlled Congress in 1993 not only reported a budget \nresolution on a party-line vote--and I will stop for a moment and say \nthe Senator from West Virginia is exactly correct, not a single \nRepublican supported it but every Democrat did support it. So I don't \nknow which side you blame for being partisan.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not blaming either side.\n  Mr. KYL. It was a partisan vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not blaming either side.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you. I thought for a moment you were suggesting \nRepublicans were partisan for sticking together but Democrats were not \npartisan for sticking together. The fact is, at that time the Democrats \nwere in charge of the Senate. It passed Senate and House floors on \nparty-line votes--budget resolutions based on the document, completed \nconference on the two budget-passed resolutions, completed and passed \non party-line votes, budget resolution conference based upon this \n``Vision of Change'' document and, most importantly, Congress did all \nof this by April 1, 1993, a full week before President Clinton \nsubmitted his detailed budget plan.\n  The 107th Congress now is working to adopt a budget resolution in the \nSenate following the submission of President Bush's blueprint, and that \nis no different than what was done in the 1993 democratically-\ncontrolled Congress.\n  The point I am trying to make is that all of this debate about \nprocedures--is it the real budget? Is it just a blueprint? Have we ever \ndone this before? Is it partisan? All of that is a smokescreen. It is a \nsmokescreen to hide the fact that my friends on the other side of the \naisle are trying to delay the consideration of the budget in order to \ndelay the consideration of tax relief so that possibly something will \ncome up so the tax relief won't pass to the degree that President Bush \nwants it to pass.\n  Just to make it crystal clear, I would never suggest that the Senator \nfrom West Virginia would feel himself bound to follow his party \nleadership. I suggest that it is the Senator from West Virginia who is \nhelping to lead his party. I know in this case he believes strongly \nabout this. We believe just as strongly. I do not think that it is too \nmuch to ask the Congress to take up the budget at the time it does \nevery year, pursuant to the budget resolution, and consider that budget \nso we can get on with the other business of the Congress and the other \nbusiness of the nation, to take up the questions of appropriations for \nall of the spending programs we need to fund, to take up the question \nof tax relief for hard-working Americans, and to do all the other \nthings the American people sent us back here to do.\n\n  To try to get bogged down in a bunch of parliamentary or procedural \nwrangling, I suggest, doesn't do the people's business.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I had asked for an hour to present to the \nSenate another very interesting set of comments.\n  However, given the fact that we have begun an actual conversation on \nthe Senate floor, something somewhat rare, I am delighted to continue \nto use the time that was allocated to me under the unanimous consent \nagreement to continue this debate and, under it, not only have \nRepublicans speaking, but also to have Democrats speaking, with the \nstipulation that when we are all done with this I have an opportunity \nto present my other remarks in full, which really will not take a full \nhour but at least I ask I have that opportunity at the time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, what we are seeing here is not a very \nilluminating discussion between two Senators. This is precisely what \nthe President, I think, had in mind when he said he would like to see \nan end to the quibbling and to the bickering and the partisanship in \nWashington.\n  I came to the floor today suggesting that the Senate would be much \nbetter off if we had the President's budget in front of us before we \nvote. Then I said even if we can't have the President's budget, surely \nthe administration has the details, the information it can submit to \nthe Senate. Let us see what is in it. I did not come here with any \nintent to engage in quibbling, or partisanship.\n  Mr. KYL. I hope the Senator from West Virginia doesn't mind if anyone \ndisagrees with his assessment that we shouldn't take up the budget. May \nI ask the Senator a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order, Madam President.\n  Mr. KYL. The regular order is I have the time, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I say I came here hoping I could speak out for the \nrights of both sides of the aisle; the rights of Republican Senators, \nthe rights of Democrats; the rights of the majority, the rights of the \nminority, to have before us the President's budget, which we need in \norder to exercise a reasoned judgment. That is what I came here for. I \nam not interested in bickering, arguing about partisanship.\n  I will be just as happy if we concentrate on the need for the \nPresident's budget for the edification of both sides. I want to stand \nup for our rights, for the Senator's rights--the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask the Senator from West Virginia, were you willing to \nstand up for the----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order, Senators are having discussion. They are \nsupposed to go through the Chair. I believe the Senator from Arizona \nhas the floor. I believe he can only yield for a question.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to yield to the Senator for a question if he \nwould care to answer it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will be glad to ask a question.\n  Mr. KYL. When Republicans, in 1993, objected to the consideration of \nthe budget resolution on the grounds that President Clinton's ``Vision \nof Change'' was not a real budget, did the Senator from West Virginia \nstand up for their rights to wait until the President submitted a \ncomplete budget? Or did the Senator from West Virginia vote with the \nmajority on a purely partisan vote to pass the budget resolution and, \nin fact, to pass the final budget resolution, all prior to the time \nPresident Clinton submitted a budget?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I was thinking of Cicero's statement when \nhe said, ``Let us not go over the old ground.''\n  Mr. KYL. That was then; this is now.\n  Mr. BYRD. Wait. Let's just wait. I like your smile, but I don't like \nthe interruption of Cicero's quotation. But the Senator is being very \nliberal to me in letting me speak on his time.\n  Cicero said:\n\n       Let us not go over the old ground. Let us, rather, prepare \n     for what is to come.\n\n\n[[Page S3208]]\n\n\n  The Senator wants me to ask him a question? I will ask that question.\n  Mr. KYL. No, I want the Senator to answer the question.\n  Mr. BYRD. I answered the question, didn't I?\n  Mr. KYL. Was the answer yes?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Yes, I voted for that budget.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you.\n  Mr. BYRD. I was one of--I don't remember the precise number, but I \nwas one Senator who voted for that budget in 1993, and not a single \nRepublican voted for it in the Senate or in the House. Yet, it was that \nbudget that put this country on the course of having surpluses rather \nthan deficits.\n  Now, did the Senator want me to ask a question or answer a question?\n  Mr. KYL. No, I think the Senator answered the question. The Senator \nwas willing to vote for a budget resolution prior to the submission of \nthe complete budget by the President in 1993, but he criticizes \nRepublicans for doing precisely the same thing in the year 2001.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator from Arizona just yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. If I might, since the Senator from Oklahoma was here earlier \nand had sought recognition, I would like to yield to him first.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator has an hour under his control. I wish to \nmake a speech on campaign finance.\n  Mr. KYL. Then, Madam President, perhaps what I should do is ask how \nmuch time we have remaining so I can give the remarks I was originally \nprepared to give and then yield to those others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 and one-half minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KYL. I think that will be sufficient to give the other remarks I \nhave, unless the Senator from North Dakota wishes to engage me in a \nlengthy colloquy, in which case I would want to ask for a little bit \nmore time.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, I will be very brief. Was the Senator aware that in \n1993 there was sufficient detail from the President to have the Joint \nTax Committee and the Congressional Budget Office estimate the cost of \nthe President's tax proposals? That is totally different from this \nyear. In this year, we have insufficient detail from the President for \nthe Joint Tax Committee and the Congressional Budget Office to give us \nan independent estimate of the cost of the President's proposals.\n  Mr. KYL. That is a question. Let me answer by saying apparently the \nJoint Tax Committee believes it has enough information, because it has \ngiven us an estimate of the cost, both to the House and the Senate. In \nfact, it gave a very uncomplimentary estimate of the part of the tax \nrelief which I am putting forward. I might argue with what they have \ncome up with, but apparently they believed they had enough information \nto do it.\n  We do have an estimate this year, whether it is right or wrong. We \nhad an estimate back in 1993. We have an estimate this year. We are \ngoing to have to live with it one way or the other. But I don't think \nthat should be a basis for suggesting it is improper at this point to \ntake up the budget resolution. I think what we have established is that \njust as with the change of President in 1993, when you have a President \nin the year 2001, it is unrealistic to expect there would be the same \ndegree of detail in the budget they send up in their very first year as \nthere is for the remainder of their term.\n  But the fact has not stopped Congress from acting on a budget \nresolution at the time of year when it should do so, that we will be \ndoing that, and that hopefully we will have an entire week next week \nfor a continuation of this debate for proposals of amendments. I \nsuspect we will be going very late at night next week as we consider \nall the different ideas different Senators have before we finally act \non the budget.\n  I hope, to conclude the remarks here, this could be done in a \nbipartisan fashion and it will not be a purely partisan vote. One would \nhope that. We will see how it develops.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator further yield just for a brief question?\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to get on with what I started a half hour ago, \nif I may.\n  Mr. CONRAD. May I be permitted a brief question?\n  Mr. KYL. I think, as the Senator from West Virginia has said, I have \nbeen more than liberal in yielding to my colleagues. I really would \nlike to get on to what I came here to talk about.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, we have not seen an estimate from the \nCongressional Budget Office nor the Joint Tax Committee of the cost of \nthe President's plan, except for pieces of it, the estate tax provision \nof the Senator from Arizona, and two pieces of it from the House. But \nwe don't have an estimate of the President's full plan.\n  Mr. KYL. What we have, of course, is the estimate of those portions \nof the President's tax plan that have been put forward by Members of \nthe House and Senate, and that is ordinarily what is reviewed and what \nwe get estimates of. That is plenty enough for us to move forward on it \nat this point.\n  I know the Senator from North Dakota appreciates that we in the \nSenate operate on that basis as a routine matter.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to have this exchange. I think it may \nillustrate some of the tough sledding that we have to do as we move \nforward with the consideration of the President's budget, with the \nSenate budget resolution, with our tax relief legislation, and the \nother business that we have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/30/senate-section/article/S3208-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3208-S3211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CHINA'S MILITARY POLICY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise today to express concern about the \ndirection of Chinese military policy vis-a-vis the United States.\n  America's relationship with China is one of the key foreign policy \nchallenges facing our nation in the 21st Century. It is hard to \nunderstate the importance of our relationship with China. It is the \nworld's most populous nation, has the world's largest armed forces, and \nis a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. Its economic and \nmilitary strength has grown a great deal in recent years, and is \nprojected to continue to grow significantly in the coming decades. And \nmost significantly, it is intent on gaining control over Taiwan, even \nby military force if necessary.\n  For some time now, I have been concerned that, out of a desire to \navoid short-term controversies in our relationship with China that \ncould prove disruptive to trade, we have overlooked serious potential \nnational security problems.\n  As Bill Gertz noted in his book, The China Threat, the former \nadministration believed that China could be reformed solely by the \ncivilizing influence of the West. Unfortunately, this theory hasn't \nproven out--the embrace of western capitalism has not been accompanied \nby respect for human rights, the rule of law, the embrace of democracy, \nor a less belligerent attitude toward its neighbors. Indeed, serious \nproblems with China have grown worse. And continuing to gloss over \nthese problems for fear of disrupting the fragile U.S.-China \nrelationship, primarily for trade reasons, only exacerbates the \nproblems.\n  We must be more realistic in our dealings with China and more \ncognizant of potential threats. As Secretary of State Colin Powell said \nin his confirmation hearing:\n\n       A strategic partner China is not, but neither is it our \n     inevitable and implacable foe. China is a competitor, a \n     potential rival, but also a trading partner willing to \n     cooperate in areas where our strategic interests overlap . . \n     .  Our challenge with China is to do what we can do that is \n     constructive, that is helpful, and that is in our interest.\n\n  I believe it is in our best interest to seriously evaluate China's \nmilitary strategy, plans for modernization of its People's Liberation \nArmy, including the expansion of its ICBM capability, and buildup of \nforces opposite Taiwan. Let us not risk underestimating either China's \nintentions or capabilities, possibly finding ourselves in the midst of \na conflict we could have prevented.\n  I would like to begin by answering a seemingly obvious question: Why \nisn't China a strategic partner? Among other things, China is being led \nby a communist regime with a deplorable human rights record and a \nhistory of irresponsible technology sales to rogue states. Furthermore, \nBeijing's threatening rhetoric aimed at the United States and Taiwan, \nas well as its military modernization and buildup of forces opposite \nTaiwan, should lead us to the conclusion that China potentially poses a \ngrowing threat to our national security. While it is true that\n\n[[Page S3209]]\n\nChina is one of the United States' largest trading partners, we must \nnot let this blind us to strategic concerns. Strategically, we must \nconsider China a competitor--not an enemy, but certainly a cause for \nconcern that should prompt us to take appropriate steps to safeguard \nour security.\n  Chinese government officials and state-run media have repeatedly \nthreatened to use force against Taiwan to reunite it with the mainland; \nand further, have warned the United States against involvement in a \nconflict in the Taiwan Strait. For example, in February 2000, the \nPeople's Liberation Army Daily, a state-owned newspaper, carried an \narticle which stated, ``On the Taiwan issue, it is very likely that the \nUnited States will walk to the point where it injures others while \nruining itself.'' The article went on to issue a veiled threat to \nattack the U.S. with long-range missiles, stating, ``China is neither \nIraq or Yugoslavia . . . it is a country that has certain abilities of \nlaunching a strategic counterattack and the capacity of launching a \nlong-distance strike. Probably it is not a wise move to be at war with \na country such as China, a point which U.S. policymakers know fairly \nwell also.''\n  This treat, and countless others like it, have been backed by China's \nrapid movement to modernize its army. The immediate focus of the \nmodernization is to build a military force capable of subduing Taiwan, \nand capable of defeating it swiftly enough to prevent American \nintervention. According to the Department of Defense's Annual Report on \nthe Military Power of the People's Republic of China, released in last \nJune, ``A cross-strait conflict between China and Taiwan involving the \nUnited States has emerged as the dominant scenario guiding [the Chinese \nArmy's] force planning, military, training, and war preparation.''\n\n  We should also be concerned with China's desire to project power in \nother parts of the Far East. According to a recent Washington Post \narticle, China announced that it will increase its defense spending \nthis year by 17.7 percent--its biggest increase in the last 20 years. \nChina's publicly-acknowledged defense budget of over $17 billion for \nnext year is higher than the defense budgets of neighboring countries \nlike India, Taiwan, and South Korea. Most analysts estimate China's \nreal spending on defense is at least three times as great as the \npublicly disclosed figure. For example, according to the Secretary of \nDefense's January 2001 report, Proliferation: Threat and Response, \nChina's military funding levels are expected to average between $44 and \n$70 billion annually between 2000 and 2004. Chinese Finance Minister \nXiang Huaicheng, in a speech to China's National People's Congress, \nstated that the increase would go, in part ``. . . to meet the drastic \nchanges in the military situation around the world and prepare for \ndefense and combat given the conditions of modern technology, \nespecially high technology.'' This is consistent with the Department of \nDefense's assessment in the Annual Report on the Military Power of the \nPeople's Republic of China, that ``China's military planners are \nworking to incorporate the concepts of modern warfare . . . and have \nplaced a priority on developing the technologies and tactics necessary \nto conduct rapid tempo, high technology warfare . . .'' Defense \nDepartment assessment, an invasion of the island would likely be \npreceded by ``a naval blockade, air assaults and missile attacks on \nTaiwan.'' Furthermore, it states:\n\n       Airborne, airmobile, and special operations forces likely \n     would conduct simultaneous attacks to the rear of Taiwan's \n     coastal defenses to seize a port, preferably in close \n     proximity to an airfield. Seizing a beachhead would likely \n     constitute a support attack. An airborne envelopment would \n     facilitate amphibious operations by cutting off Taiwan's \n     coastal defenders from supply lines and forcing them to fight \n     to two directions. China would likely seek to suppress \n     Taiwan's air defenses and establish air superiority over an \n     invasion corridor in the Taiwan Strait . . .\n\n  To solidify is ability to launch such an attack. China is expected to \ncontinue to increase its force of short-range ballistic missiles. \nAccording to an article in the Far Eastern Economic Review, Taiwan \nestimates that the Chinese Army currently has 400 short-range missiles \ndeployed opposite that island. More recently, the Washington Times \nreported that a U.S. satellite detected a new shipment of short-range \nmissiles to Yongan, in Fujian province, opposite Taiwan. The Washington \nTimes had previously reported ``that China had deployed nearly 100 \nshort-range ballistic missiles and mobile launchers'' at this \nparticular base. Bill Gertz's book, the China Threat, cites a 1999 \ninternal Pentagon report that indicates China plans to increase its \nforce of short-range M-9 and M-11 missiles to 650 by 2005. In addition, \nChina has also deployed medium-range CSS-5 missiles, with a range of \n1,800 kilometers, which cannot be stopped by Taiwan's Patriot missile \ndefense batteries.\n  China's continued development of its ICBM force, which directly \nthreatens U.S. cities, is also troubling. The Defense Department's \nreport, Proliferation: Threat and Response, states:\n\n       China currently has over 100 nuclear warheads . . . While \n     the ultimate extent of China's strategic modernization is \n     unknown, it is clear that the number, reliability, \n     survivability, and accuracy of Chinese strategic missiles \n     capable of hitting the United States will increase during the \n     next two decades.\n       China currently has about 20 CSS-4 ICBMs with a range of \n     over 13,000 kilometers, which can reach the United States. \n     Some of its ongoing missile modernization programs likely \n     will increase the number of Chinese warheads aimed at the \n     United States. For example, Beijing is developing two new \n     road-mobile solid-propellant ICBMs. China has conducted \n     successful flight tests of the DF-31 ICBM in 1999 and 2000; \n     this missile is estimated to have a range of about 8,000 \n     kilometers. Another longer-range mobile ICBM also is under \n     development and likely will be tested within the next several \n     years. It will be targeted primarily against the United \n     States.\n\n  Another study completed by the National Intelligence Council, \npresenting the consensus views of all U.S. intelligence agencies, \nechoed these concerns stating, Beijing ``will have deployed tens to \nseveral tens of missiles with nuclear warheads targeted against the \nUnited States'' in the not too distant future. The intent of this \ndeployment is obvious--to preclude the United States from intervening \nin any Chinese military actions against Taiwan.\n  China's advances in its air and naval forces are also weighing upon \nthe growing imbalance in the Taiwan Strait. Russian transfers of \nmilitary equipment and technology are accelerating China's efforts in \nthese areas. According to a February article in Jane's Intelligence \nReview,\n\n       Between 1991 and 1996 Russia sold China an estimated $1 \n     billion worth of military weapons and related technologies \n     each year. That figure doubled by 1997. In 1999 the two \n     governments increased the military assistance package for a \n     second time. There is now a five-year program (until 2004) \n     planning $20 billion worth of technology transfers.\n\n  China's Air Force is continuing its acquisition of Russian fighters \nand fighter bombers. For example, China now has at least 50 Russian Su-\n27 fighters, and has started co-producing up to 200 more. Furthermore, \naccording to a 1999 Defense News article, Russia and China signed a \npreliminary agreement in 1999 calling for the transfer to China of \napproximately 40 Su-30MKK fighter-bombers, which are comparable to the \nU.S. F-15E Strike Eagle. According to a 1999 article in the Russian \npublication Air Fleet (Moscow), these aircraft will be equipped with \nprecision-guided bombs and missiles, as well as an anti-radar missile. \nDelivery has not yet occurred, but is expected within the next three \nyears.\n  The June 2000 Defense Department report predicted that by 2020, the \n``. . . readiness rates, the distances over which China can project air \npower, and the variety of missions which China's air forces can perform \nalso can be expected to improve.'' Furthermore, it states that after \n2005, ``. . . if projected trends continue, the balance of air power \nacross the Taiwan Strait could begin to shift in China's favor.'' This \nshift will undoubtedly be accelerated by Russia's assistance.\n\n  Additionally, the report estimates that, by 2005, China will have \ndeveloped the capability for aerial refueling and airborne early \nwarning. Also, the development of a new Chinese active-radar air-to-air \nmissile similar to the U.S. AMRAAM for China's fourth-generation \nfighters is likely to be complete.\n  In an effort to increase its ability to place a naval blockade around \nTaiwan, the Chinese Navy is in the process of acquiring new submarines, \nanti-ship missiles, and mines. According to the Defense Department's \nJune 2000 report,\n\n[[Page S3210]]\n\n``China's submarine fleet could constitute a substantial force capable \nof controlling sea lanes and mining approaches around Taiwan, as well \nas a growing threat to submarines in the East and South China Seas.'' \nFurthermore, a January 2001 Jane's Defense Weekly article states that \nthe core of China's future naval plans calls for the acquisition of an \naircraft carrier capability and the incorporation of nuclear-powered \nattack submarines into its fleet. According to this article, the \nChinese Navy recently acquired two Russian Sovremenny-class destroyers \narmed with Sunburn anti-ship missiles that were developed by Russia to \nattack U.S. carrier battle groups. It is also continuing to buy Kilo-\nclass submarines from Russia, and has discussed purchasing an aircraft \ncarrier from Russia.\n  Faced with China's moves to increase its ability to blockade Taiwan \nor to disrupt sea lanes near the island, its steps to develop the \nability to establish air superiority over the Taiwan Strait, and its \nmoves to increase its missile force facing the United States and \nTaiwan, we must contend with the question of how to deter an attack on \nTaiwan, and how to defend our forces which would be deployed in the \narea.\n  The obvious answer is to supply Taiwan with the defensive weaponry it \nhas sought to buy from the United States and to be able to defend the \nUnited States against missile attack threatened by China. Taiwan has \nsubmitted its official defense request list to the United States, and \nnext month, the Administration will make its final decision as to which \nitems will be sold.\n  According to the Washington Times, Taiwan has requested approximately \n30 different weapons systems from the United States this year. Though \nthe official list is classified, a recently released Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee staff report discussed Taiwan's current defense \nneeds, mentioning some of the items that it is interested in acquiring. \nI would like to highlight just a few of these items.\n  According to this Senate report, Taiwan has, once again, expressed \nits need for four Aegis destroyers--a request that was repeatedly \ndenied by the Clinton Administration. These destroyers would, according \nto the Foreign Relations Committee report, provide Taiwan ``with an \nadequate sea-based air defense and C4I system to deal with rapidly \ndeveloping [Chinese] air and naval threats.'' Because final delivery \nwill take 8 to 10 years, however, Taiwan will need an interim solution \nto deal with these threats. Thus, it may be necessary to sell Taiwan \nfour used Kidd-class destroyers, which do not have a radar system as \ncapable as Aegis, but are more advanced than what Taiwan currently \npossesses.\n\n  Additionally, the report indicates that Taiwan has stated its need \nfor submarines. It currently has only four, while China has sixty-five. \nThey could prove particularly important should Taiwan need to defend \nitself against a Chinese blockade of the island.\n  Taiwan also needs our help to deal with the growing imbalance of air \npower across the Taiwan Strait. According to the report, Taiwan's Air \nForce has indicated its need to be able to counter China's long-range \nsurface-to-air missiles, and to counterattack its aircraft and naval \nvessels from long distances. In order to counter China's surface-to-air \nmissile sites that can threaten aircraft over the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan \nhas expressed interest in obtaining High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles \n(HARM). Taiwan reportedly would also like to purchase Joint Direct \nAttack Munitions (JDAM), and longer-range, infra-red guided missiles \ncapable of attacking land targets.\n  The United States should approve all of Taiwan's requests, provided \nthey are necessary for Taiwan to defend itself, and provided they do \nnot violate technology transfer restrictions. Section 3(b) of the \nTaiwan Relations Act states, ``The President and Congress shall \ndetermine the nature and quantity of such defense articles and services \nbased solely upon their judgment of the needs of Taiwan . . .'' \n(Emphasis added) Taiwan clearly needs to upgrade its capabilities in \nseveral key areas and should act to address these shortfalls.\n  We must also deal with a broader question. Since the approach adopted \nby the Clinton Administration clearly did not move China in the right \ndirection, how can we positively influence China to act responsibly and \neschew military action against Taiwan?\n  One way is to be unambiguous in our dealings with China. During the \ncold war, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher took a principled stand \nagainst the Soviet Union, which contributed to one of the greatest \naccomplishments in history: the West's victory without war over the \nSoviet empire. The time has come for the United States to take a \nsimilarly principled, firm approach to our dealings with China. We \nshould hold China to the same standards of proper behavior we have \ndefined for other nations, and we should work for political change in \nBeijing, unapologetically standing up for freedom and democracy.\n  We should begin by assuring that the United States is not susceptible \nto blackmail by China--to freeze the United States into inaction by \nthreat of missile attack against the United States. In this regard, we \nneed to work toward the development and deployment of a national \nmissile defense system. The United States currently has no defense \nagainst a ballistic missile attack from China, or any of the countries \nthat it has assisted in developing a long-range missile capability. \nMissile defense will allow us to abandon the cold war policy of \nmutually assured destruction.\n  China has threatened that NMD deployment will lead to destabilization \nand to an arms race with that country. I disagree. As former Secretary \nof Defense William Cohen testified to the Senate in July of last year, \n``I think it's fair to say that China, irrespective of what we do on \nNMD, will in fact, modernize and increase its ICBM capability.''\n  And this is why president George W. Bush is correct to remain firm in \nhis decision to deploy an NMD system as soon as possible.\n  Secondly, we need to maintain strong U.S. military capabilities in \nAsia and improve ties to our allies in the region. As Secretary of \nState Colin Powell recently said about these relationships, \nparticularly with Japan, ``Weaken those relationships and we weaken \nourselves. All else in the Pacific and East Asia flows from those \nstrong relationships.''\n  The United States can promote democracy, free-markets, and the rule \nof law by standing by our democratic allies in Asia, like Japan and \nTaiwan. The preparedness of Taiwan's defense forces is questionable. \nIncreasing this preparedness will decrease the chances that the United \nStates will need to become involved in a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, \nor that such a conflict will occur in the first place. As I mentioned \nearlier, not only do we need to sell Taiwan the necessary military \nequipment for defense against China, our defense officials and military \npersonnel need to be able to work with their Taiwanese counterparts to \nensure that they know how to use the equipment. Without this training, \nthe equipment we provide will be far less useful.\n  As stated in the Defense Department's report:\n\n       The change in the dynamic equilibrium of forces over the \n     long term will depend largely on whether Taiwan is able to \n     meet or exceed developments on the mainland with programs of \n     its own. Its success in deterring potential Chinese \n     aggression will be dependent on its continued acquisition of \n     modern arms, technology and equipment, and its ability to \n     integrate and operate these systems effectively . . .\n\n  President Bush recently stated that China, our ``strategic \ncompetitor'' needs to be ``faced without ill will and without \nillusions.'' Our long-term goal is to live in peace and prosperity with \nthe Chinese people, as well as to promote democratic transition in that \ncountry. China's far-reaching ambitions in Asia, coupled with efforts \nto modernize and strengthen its military force, however, require the \nUnited States to exercise leadership. There is no doubt that China will \nand should play a larger role on the world stage in the coming years. \nThe challenge before us is to deal with this emerging power in a way \nthat enhances our security by dealing candidly and strongly with some \nof the troubling facts and trends. It is time to take a more clear-eyed \napproach to dealing with China.\n\n[[Page S3211]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/30/senate-section/article/S3208-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3208-S3211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CHINA'S MILITARY POLICY\n\n  Mr. KYL.

And continuing to gloss over \nthese problems for fear of disrupting the fragile U.S.-China \nrelationship, primarily for trade reasons, only exacerbates the \nproblems.\n  We must be more realistic in our dealings with China and more \ncognizant of potential threats. As Secretary of State Colin Powell said \nin his confirmation hearing:\n\n       A strategic partner China is not, but neither is it our \n     inevitable and implacable foe. China is a competitor, a \n     potential rival, but also a trading partner willing to \n     cooperate in areas where our strategic interests overlap . . \n     .  Our challenge with China is to do what we can do that is \n     constructive, that is helpful, and that is in our interest.\n\n  I believe it is in our best interest to seriously evaluate China's \nmilitary strategy, plans for modernization of its People's Liberation \nArmy, including the expansion of its ICBM capability, and buildup of \nforces opposite Taiwan. Let us not risk underestimating either China's \nintentions or capabilities, possibly finding ourselves in the midst of \na conflict we could have prevented.\n  I would like to begin by answering a seemingly obvious question: Why \nisn't China a strategic partner? Among other things, China is being led \nby a communist regime with a deplorable human rights record and a \nhistory of irresponsible technology sales to rogue states. Furthermore, \nBeijing's threatening rhetoric aimed at the United States and Taiwan, \nas well as its military modernization and buildup of forces opposite \nTaiwan, should lead us to the conclusion that China potentially poses a \ngrowing threat to our national security. While it is true that\n\n[[Page S3209]]\n\nChina is one of the United States' largest trading partners, we must \nnot let this blind us to strategic concerns. Strategically, we must \nconsider China a competitor--not an enemy, but certainly a cause for \nconcern that should prompt us to take appropriate steps to safeguard \nour security.\n  Chinese government officials and state-run media have repeatedly \nthreatened to use force against Taiwan to reunite it with the mainland; \nand further, have warned the United States against involvement in a \nconflict in the Taiwan Strait. For example, in February 2000, the \nPeople's Liberation Army Daily, a state-owned newspaper, carried an \narticle which stated, ``On the Taiwan issue, it is very likely that the \nUnited States will walk to the point where it injures others while \nruining itself.'' The article went on to issue a veiled threat to \nattack the U.S. with long-range missiles, stating, ``China is neither \nIraq or Yugoslavia . . . it is a country that has certain abilities of \nlaunching a strategic counterattack and the capacity of launching a \nlong-distance strike. Probably it is not a wise move to be at war with \na country such as China, a point which U.S. policymakers know fairly \nwell also.''\n  This treat, and countless others like it, have been backed by China's \nrapid movement to modernize its army. The immediate focus of the \nmodernization is to build a military force capable of subduing Taiwan, \nand capable of defeating it swiftly enough to prevent American \nintervention. According to the Department of Defense's Annual Report on \nthe Military Power of the People's Republic of China, released in last \nJune, ``A cross-strait conflict between China and Taiwan involving the \nUnited States has emerged as the dominant scenario guiding [the Chinese \nArmy's] force planning, military, training, and war preparation.''\n\n  We should also be concerned with China's desire to project power in \nother parts of the Far East. According to a recent Washington Post \narticle, China announced that it will increase its defense spending \nthis year by 17.7 percent--its biggest increase in the last 20 years. \nChina's publicly-acknowledged defense budget of over $17 billion for \nnext year is higher than the defense budgets of neighboring countries \nlike India, Taiwan, and South Korea. Most analysts estimate China's \nreal spending on defense is at least three times as great as the \npublicly disclosed figure. For example, according to the Secretary of \nDefense's January 2001 report, Proliferation: Threat and Response, \nChina's military funding levels are expected to average between $44 and \n$70 billion annually between 2000 and 2004. Chinese Finance Minister \nXiang Huaicheng, in a speech to China's National People's Congress, \nstated that the increase would go, in part ``. . . to meet the drastic \nchanges in the military situation around the world and prepare for \ndefense and combat given the conditions of modern technology, \nespecially high technology.'' This is consistent with the Department of \nDefense's assessment in the Annual Report on the Military Power of the \nPeople's Republic of China, that ``China's military planners are \nworking to incorporate the concepts of modern warfare . . . and have \nplaced a priority on developing the technologies and tactics necessary \nto conduct rapid tempo, high technology warfare . . .'' Defense \nDepartment assessment, an invasion of the island would likely be \npreceded by ``a naval blockade, air assaults and missile attacks on \nTaiwan.'' Furthermore, it states:\n\n       Airborne, airmobile, and special operations forces likely \n     would conduct simultaneous attacks to the rear of Taiwan's \n     coastal defenses to seize a port, preferably in close \n     proximity to an airfield. Seizing a beachhead would likely \n     constitute a support attack. An airborne envelopment would \n     facilitate amphibious operations by cutting off Taiwan's \n     coastal defenders from supply lines and forcing them to fight \n     to two directions. China would likely seek to suppress \n     Taiwan's air defenses and establish air superiority over an \n     invasion corridor in the Taiwan Strait . . .\n\n  To solidify is ability to launch such an attack. China is expected to \ncontinue to increase its force of short-range ballistic missiles. \nAccording to an article in the Far Eastern Economic Review, Taiwan \nestimates that the Chinese Army currently has 400 short-range missiles \ndeployed opposite that island. More recently, the Washington Times \nreported that a U.S. satellite detected a new shipment of short-range \nmissiles to Yongan, in Fujian province, opposite Taiwan. The Washington \nTimes had previously reported ``that China had deployed nearly 100 \nshort-range ballistic missiles and mobile launchers'' at this \nparticular base. Bill Gertz's book, the China Threat, cites a 1999 \ninternal Pentagon report that indicates China plans to increase its \nforce of short-range M-9 and M-11 missiles to 650 by 2005. In addition, \nChina has also deployed medium-range CSS-5 missiles, with a range of \n1,800 kilometers, which cannot be stopped by Taiwan's Patriot missile \ndefense batteries.\n  China's continued development of its ICBM force, which directly \nthreatens U.S. cities, is also troubling. The Defense Department's \nreport, Proliferation: Threat and Response, states:\n\n       China currently has over 100 nuclear warheads . . . While \n     the ultimate extent of China's strategic modernization is \n     unknown, it is clear that the number, reliability, \n     survivability, and accuracy of Chinese strategic missiles \n     capable of hitting the United States will increase during the \n     next two decades.\n       China currently has about 20 CSS-4 ICBMs with a range of \n     over 13,000 kilometers, which can reach the United States. \n     Some of its ongoing missile modernization programs likely \n     will increase the number of Chinese warheads aimed at the \n     United States. For example, Beijing is developing two new \n     road-mobile solid-propellant ICBMs. China has conducted \n     successful flight tests of the DF-31 ICBM in 1999 and 2000; \n     this missile is estimated to have a range of about 8,000 \n     kilometers. Another longer-range mobile ICBM also is under \n     development and likely will be tested within the next several \n     years. It will be targeted primarily against the United \n     States.\n\n  Another study completed by the National Intelligence Council, \npresenting the consensus views of all U.S. intelligence agencies, \nechoed these concerns stating, Beijing ``will have deployed tens to \nseveral tens of missiles with nuclear warheads targeted against the \nUnited States'' in the not too distant future. The intent of this \ndeployment is obvious--to preclude the United States from intervening \nin any Chinese military actions against Taiwan.\n  China's advances in its air and naval forces are also weighing upon \nthe growing imbalance in the Taiwan Strait. Russian transfers of \nmilitary equipment and technology are accelerating China's efforts in \nthese areas. According to a February article in Jane's Intelligence \nReview,\n\n       Between 1991 and 1996 Russia sold China an estimated $1 \n     billion worth of military weapons and related technologies \n     each year. That figure doubled by 1997. In 1999 the two \n     governments increased the military assistance package for a \n     second time. There is now a five-year program (until 2004) \n     planning $20 billion worth of technology transfers.\n\n  China's Air Force is continuing its acquisition of Russian fighters \nand fighter bombers. For example, China now has at least 50 Russian Su-\n27 fighters, and has started co-producing up to 200 more. Furthermore, \naccording to a 1999 Defense News article, Russia and China signed a \npreliminary agreement in 1999 calling for the transfer to China of \napproximately 40 Su-30MKK fighter-bombers, which are comparable to the \nU.S. F-15E Strike Eagle. According to a 1999 article in the Russian \npublication Air Fleet (Moscow), these aircraft will be equipped with \nprecision-guided bombs and missiles, as well as an anti-radar missile. \nDelivery has not yet occurred, but is expected within the next three \nyears.\n  The June 2000 Defense Department report predicted that by 2020, the \n``. . . readiness rates, the distances over which China can project air \npower, and the variety of missions which China's air forces can perform \nalso can be expected to improve.'' Furthermore, it states that after \n2005, ``. . . if projected trends continue, the balance of air power \nacross the Taiwan Strait could begin to shift in China's favor.'' This \nshift will undoubtedly be accelerated by Russia's assistance.\n\n  Additionally, the report estimates that, by 2005, China will have \ndeveloped the capability for aerial refueling and airborne early \nwarning. Also, the development of a new Chinese active-radar air-to-air \nmissile similar to the U.S. AMRAAM for China's fourth-generation \nfighters is likely to be complete.\n  In an effort to increase its ability to place a naval blockade around \nTaiwan, the Chinese Navy is in the process of acquiring new submarines, \nanti-ship missiles, and mines. According to the Defense Department's \nJune 2000 report,\n\n[[Page S3210]]\n\n``China's submarine fleet could constitute a substantial force capable \nof controlling sea lanes and mining approaches around Taiwan, as well \nas a growing threat to submarines in the East and South China Seas.'' \nFurthermore, a January 2001 Jane's Defense Weekly article states that \nthe core of China's future naval plans calls for the acquisition of an \naircraft carrier capability and the incorporation of nuclear-powered \nattack submarines into its fleet. According to this article, the \nChinese Navy recently acquired two Russian Sovremenny-class destroyers \narmed with Sunburn anti-ship missiles that were developed by Russia to \nattack U.S. carrier battle groups. It is also continuing to buy Kilo-\nclass submarines from Russia, and has discussed purchasing an aircraft \ncarrier from Russia.\n  Faced with China's moves to increase its ability to blockade Taiwan \nor to disrupt sea lanes near the island, its steps to develop the \nability to establish air superiority over the Taiwan Strait, and its \nmoves to increase its missile force facing the United States and \nTaiwan, we must contend with the question of how to deter an attack on \nTaiwan, and how to defend our forces which would be deployed in the \narea.\n  The obvious answer is to supply Taiwan with the defensive weaponry it \nhas sought to buy from the United States and to be able to defend the \nUnited States against missile attack threatened by China. Taiwan has \nsubmitted its official defense request list to the United States, and \nnext month, the Administration will make its final decision as to which \nitems will be sold.\n  According to the Washington Times, Taiwan has requested approximately \n30 different weapons systems from the United States this year. Though \nthe official list is classified, a recently released Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee staff report discussed Taiwan's current defense \nneeds, mentioning some of the items that it is interested in acquiring. \nI would like to highlight just a few of these items.\n  According to this Senate report, Taiwan has, once again, expressed \nits need for four Aegis destroyers--a request that was repeatedly \ndenied by the Clinton Administration. These destroyers would, according \nto the Foreign Relations Committee report, provide Taiwan ``with an \nadequate sea-based air defense and C4I system to deal with rapidly \ndeveloping [Chinese] air and naval threats.'' Because final delivery \nwill take 8 to 10 years, however, Taiwan will need an interim solution \nto deal with these threats. Thus, it may be necessary to sell Taiwan \nfour used Kidd-class destroyers, which do not have a radar system as \ncapable as Aegis, but are more advanced than what Taiwan currently \npossesses.\n\n  Additionally, the report indicates that Taiwan has stated its need \nfor submarines. It currently has only four, while China has sixty-five. \nThey could prove particularly important should Taiwan need to defend \nitself against a Chinese blockade of the island.\n  Taiwan also needs our help to deal with the growing imbalance of air \npower across the Taiwan Strait. According to the report, Taiwan's Air \nForce has indicated its need to be able to counter China's long-range \nsurface-to-air missiles, and to counterattack its aircraft and naval \nvessels from long distances. In order to counter China's surface-to-air \nmissile sites that can threaten aircraft over the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan \nhas expressed interest in obtaining High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles \n(HARM). Taiwan reportedly would also like to purchase Joint Direct \nAttack Munitions (JDAM), and longer-range, infra-red guided missiles \ncapable of attacking land targets.\n  The United States should approve all of Taiwan's requests, provided \nthey are necessary for Taiwan to defend itself, and provided they do \nnot violate technology transfer restrictions. Section 3(b) of the \nTaiwan Relations Act states, ``The President and Congress shall \ndetermine the nature and quantity of such defense articles and services \nbased solely upon their judgment of the needs of Taiwan . . .'' \n(Emphasis added) Taiwan clearly needs to upgrade its capabilities in \nseveral key areas and should act to address these shortfalls.\n  We must also deal with a broader question. Since the approach adopted \nby the Clinton Administration clearly did not move China in the right \ndirection, how can we positively influence China to act responsibly and \neschew military action against Taiwan?\n  One way is to be unambiguous in our dealings with China. During the \ncold war, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher took a principled stand \nagainst the Soviet Union, which contributed to one of the greatest \naccomplishments in history: the West's victory without war over the \nSoviet empire. The time has come for the United States to take a \nsimilarly principled, firm approach to our dealings with China. We \nshould hold China to the same standards of proper behavior we have \ndefined for other nations, and we should work for political change in \nBeijing, unapologetically standing up for freedom and democracy.\n  We should begin by assuring that the United States is not susceptible \nto blackmail by China--to freeze the United States into inaction by \nthreat of missile attack against the United States. In this regard, we \nneed to work toward the development and deployment of a national \nmissile defense system. The United States currently has no defense \nagainst a ballistic missile attack from China, or any of the countries \nthat it has assisted in developing a long-range missile capability. \nMissile defense will allow us to abandon the cold war policy of \nmutually assured destruction.\n  China has threatened that NMD deployment will lead to destabilization \nand to an arms race with that country. I disagree. As former Secretary \nof Defense William Cohen testified to the Senate in July of last year, \n``I think it's fair to say that China, irrespective of what we do on \nNMD, will in fact, modernize and increase its ICBM capability.''\n  And this is why president George W. Bush is correct to remain firm in \nhis decision to deploy an NMD system as soon as possible.\n  Secondly, we need to maintain strong U.S. military capabilities in \nAsia and improve ties to our allies in the region. As Secretary of \nState Colin Powell recently said about these relationships, \nparticularly with Japan, ``Weaken those relationships and we weaken \nourselves. All else in the Pacific and East Asia flows from those \nstrong relationships.''\n  The United States can promote democracy, free-markets, and the rule \nof law by standing by our democratic allies in Asia, like Japan and \nTaiwan. The preparedness of Taiwan's defense forces is questionable. \nIncreasing this preparedness will decrease the chances that the United \nStates will need to become involved in a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, \nor that such a conflict will occur in the first place. As I mentioned \nearlier, not only do we need to sell Taiwan the necessary military \nequipment for defense against China, our defense officials and military \npersonnel need to be able to work with their Taiwanese counterparts to \nensure that they know how to use the equipment. Without this training, \nthe equipment we provide will be far less useful.\n  As stated in the Defense Department's report:\n\n       The change in the dynamic equilibrium of forces over the \n     long term will depend largely on whether Taiwan is able to \n     meet or exceed developments on the mainland with programs of \n     its own. Its success in deterring potential Chinese \n     aggression will be dependent on its continued acquisition of \n     modern arms, technology and equipment, and its ability to \n     integrate and operate these systems effectively . . .\n\n  President Bush recently stated that China, our ``strategic \ncompetitor'' needs to be ``faced without ill will and without \nillusions.'' Our long-term goal is to live in peace and prosperity with \nthe Chinese people, as well as to promote democratic transition in that \ncountry. China's far-reaching ambitions in Asia, coupled with efforts \nto modernize and strengthen its military force, however, require the \nUnited States to exercise leadership. There is no doubt that China will \nand should play a larger role on the world stage in the coming years. \nThe challenge before us is to deal with this emerging power in a way \nthat enhances our security by dealing candidly and strongly with some \nof the troubling facts and trends. It is time to take a more clear-eyed \napproach to dealing with China.\n\n[[Page S3211]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/30/senate-section/article/S3211-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3211-S3212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of a \nwonderful victory by the 2001 NCAA Wrestling Champions, The University \nof Minnesota. Because this is the Golden Gophers' first national \nchampionship in wrestling, this team victory is worthy of special note.\n  As colleagues may know, I follow college wrestling closely. Having \nseen a good deal of wrestling in my life, I can say that the \nperformance by this year's Golden Gopher team was nothing short of \nspectacular. Throughout this season, members of the team showed a level \nof determination and skill that became the pride of the people of my \nstate and captured the respect of college wrestling fans across the \ncountry. In gaining the national championship on March 19, the team \nscored 138.5 points and earned an NCAA-record 10 All-Americans.\n  College wrestling is a consummate American sport. It centers around \nmatches in which individuals face off and are recognized for their \nstrength, speed, and versatility, just as we celebrate individual \nachievement in other aspects of American life. However, wrestling \nchampionships are not won by individuals, they are won by teams. Just \nas this country thrives based on the contributions of all its citizens, \ncollege wrestling teams rely upon teammates of all weights for points \nif they are to gain a championship.\n  I do want to take this opportunity to make the point to my colleagues \nthat we should be concerned about recent problems of amateur wrestling \nin the United States. According to a recent report from the Government \nAccounting Office, 40 percent of the nation's college wrestling \nprograms have disappeared in the past two decades. As someone who was \ngiven the opportunity to develop personally through the challenge of \nwrestling and as a former student-athlete who gained access to a first-\nrate education thanks to a wrestling scholarship, I am concerned about \nthose who, increasingly, are not able to pursue wrestling during their \ncollege years. It is important to many Americans that the United States \nbe competitive in all Olympic sports such as wrestling. Furthermore, \namateur athletics has provided a way up and a way out for many young \nAmericans. We have a responsibility to do what we can to revitalize a \nwonderful sport at the college level.\n  That can be a discussion for a later day, Mr. President. Today is a \nday to celebrate the accomplishment of a superb team, The University of \nMinnesota Golden Gopher wrestlers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/30/senate-section/article/S3212-5", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3212-S3213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE 80TH BIRTHDAY OF HAROLD BURSON, FOUNDING CHAIRMAN, BURSON-\n                               MARSTELLER\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, last month marked the 80th \nbirthday of Harold Burson, the founding chairman of one of the world's \nleading public relations firms, Burson-Marsteller. This milestone, \ncelebrated with good health and good humor by Mr. Burson along with his \nfamily and many friends, is especially noteworthy to the people of \nTennessee because he is one of our most distinguished native sons. \nHarold Burson was born in Memphis on February 15, 1921. Despite a \nlifetime of accomplishment and honors on a global scale, he has never \nforgotten his Tennessee roots. Likewise, Mr. Burson's lifetime of \nprofessional achievement has earned him the deep respect of his fellow \nTennesseans.\n  I ask that a series of letters written in tribute to Mr. Burson on \nthe occasion of his 80th birthday be printed in the Record.\n  These letters from President Bush and others demonstrate that Harold \nBurson's contributions have meaning not just to folks in Tennessee, but \nto all Americans.\n  Thanks to the legacy of Harold Burson, public relations is a more \nrespected and honored profession. Those of us who have the privilege of \nholding public office know that public opinion is at the heart of our \ndemocratic process. Harold Burson has helped create a profession that \nhas brought credibility\n\n[[Page S3213]]\n\nand integrity to the practice of influencing public opinion. People who \nhave worked with Mr. Burson and have had him as a mentor are leading \nthe public relations industry today and will do so in the future. \nThanks to Mr. Burson's good health and robust spirit at the age of 80, \nhis legacy is still being written.\n  When the last century was coming to a close, PRWeek, an industry \npublication, named Harold Burson the most influential figure in public \nrelations in the twentieth century. The publication cited Mr. Burson's \ncareer as a counselor, advisor and mentor, and described him as ``the \nmost complete PR professional in history.''\n  I know other Americans join me in wishing Harold Burson many more \nyears of health, happiness and fulfillment.\n  The letters follow.\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 2001.\n     Mr. Harold Burson,\n     Founding Chairman, Burson-Marsteller,\n     New York, NY.\n       Dear Mr. Burson: It is a privilege for me to join your \n     friends and relatives in saluting you on your eightieth \n     birthday.\n       For half a century, you have been a pioneer in the public \n     relations profession.

SLUCTER AND THE 551ST PARACHUTE INFANTRY BATTALION\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nheroic efforts of Mr. Glenn Slucter, a Michigan veteran of the 551st \nParachute Infantry Battalion. He and approximately 50 other veterans \nwho served with him received a Presidential Unit Citation on February \n23, 2001, at the Pentagon for their heroism during World War II.\n  It is certainly fitting that Mr. Slucter and his fellow veterans are \nnow being recognized for their brave and exemplary service. Although it \nhas been more than fifty years since the war ended, it is important \nthat their heroic role in the invasion of Southern France and the \nBattle of the Bulge is finally being acknowledged and honored. This \nceremony was a wonderful reminder of the critical part our veterans \nhave played in protecting and preserving our life of freedom.\n  Mr. Slucter and four of his children traveled to Washington, DC to \nattend the ceremony. How thrilling it must have been for him and the \nother members of his unit to renew old friendships and receive the \nrecognition in front of their families and friends that they so richly \ndeserve. I am sure this was an opportunity to reminisce as well as \nexpress sorrow for the many members of their battalion who did not make \nit home.\n  It is my privilege to join the United States Army in paying tribute \nto a man who has given so much to his country. I applaud Glenn Slucter \nfor his bravery and his selfless acts during World War II. We should \nall be proud and grateful for the efforts of Glenn Slucter and the \nmembers of the 551st Parachute Infantry Battalion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/30/senate-section/article/S3213-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WE THE PEOPLE\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to commend fifteen \nstudents from Orofino High School in Orofino, ID: Zach Annen, Hannah \nBrandt, Joshua Corry, Diana Dangman, Nathan Dobyns, Emily Hall, Harmony \nHaveman, Jessica Hill, Piper Hope, Stacy Ray, Sarah Spaulding, Heather \nVeeder, Jessica Weeks, Brian Wilks; and Sam Young.\n  These students will be in Washington, DC, April 21-23, 2001 to \ncompete in the national finals of the ``We the People . . . The Citizen \nand the Constitution'' program. These young scholars have worked \ndiligently to reach the national finals and through their experience \nhave gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental \nprinciples and values of our constitutional democracy.\n  I also like to recognize their teacher, Cindy Wilson, for helping \nprepare these young students.\n  ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution'' is one of \nthe most extensive educational programs in the country. It has been \ndeveloped specifically to educate young people about the Constitution \nand the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled \nafter hearings in the United States Congress and consist of oral \npresentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges. \nThe students' testimony is followed by a period of questioning by the \nsimulated congressional committee. The judges evaluate students on \ntheir depth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional \nknowledge.\n  The 250th anniversary of James Madison's birth in 1751 offers an \nappropriate opportunity to examine his contributions to American \nconstitutionalism and politics. To this end, the Center for Civic \nEducation has collaborated with James Madison's home, Montpelier, to \nproduce a supplement to ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the \nConstitution.'' The national finals will include questions on Madison \nand his legacy.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the ``We the People . \n. .'' program has provided curricula materials at upper elementary, \nmiddle, and high school levels for more than twenty-six and a half \nmillion students nationwide. The program provides students with a \nworking knowledge of our Constitution, Bill of Rights, and the \nprinciples of democratic government. Members of Congress and their \nstaff enhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues \nwith students and teachers and by participating in other educational \nactivities.\n  The class from Orofino High School is currently conducting research \nand preparing for the upcoming national competition in Washington, DC. \nI wish these young ``constitutional experts'' the best of luck at the \n``We the People'' national finals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/30/senate-section/article/S3213-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3213-S3214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO LADY LOBOS BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a team of \nspecial women who are champions in the eyes of the residents of my home \nState of New Mexico. I am paying tribute to the University of New \nMexico's Lobo Women's Basketball team, which came up one point short of \nwinning the Women's National Invitation Tournament last night.\n  The Ohio State Buckeyes women's team battled the Lady Lobos on their \nhome court, at ``the Pit'' in Albuquerque, one of the most phenomenal \nbasketball sites in the country. There, the Lady Lobos and the Buckeyes \nwowed the fans with an exciting 62-61 game. Despite the heartbreaking \nend, the Lobo women had a fantastic year worthy of any trophy and our \nadmiration.\n  This team has helped to move women in this sport forward by leaps and \nbounds, providing an outstanding example of dedication, talent and hard \nwork for young girls in my State.\n\n[[Page S3214]]\n\n Their hard work in the NIT tournament builds on a distinguished \nhistory of collegiate women's basketball. Back in 1972 President \nRichard Nixon signed into law title IX, which stated that no person in \nthe United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from \nparticipation in any educational program or activity that receives \nfederal assistance. That same year, the Association for Intercollegiate \nAthletics for Women held its first women's collegiate basketball \nchampionship.\n  Fast forward to the year 2001, where today unprecedented numbers of \nyoung girls and women are playing basketball as part of their overall \neducation. I believe it is outstanding that the UNM Lady Lobos are able \nto repeatedly played before a sold out audience of more than 18,000 \nscreaming fans.\n  Wednesday night's title game should not be viewed as a \ndisappointment, because I believe the excitement the Lady Lobos \ngenerated across New Mexico can only serve as motivation for next year. \nThe Lobo women, who finished the season 22-13, are also an inspiration \nfor the elementary, middle and high school girls who watched their \nsuccessful season. They can believe, like the UNM Ladies basketball \nteam's future, that the sky is the limit.\n  I believe the Lady Lobos have embarked on a tradition of greatness, \nwhich is no small feat considering their newness on the scene. Despite \nthe discontinuation of the program from 1987 to 1991, the players have \nsince shown us their determination and delivered games of pure \nexcitement. In the last four years, the average game attendance for the \nUNM women has skyrocketed and kept pace with the best teams across the \nnation. This is testimony to the interest that this women's team has \nbrought to the game.\n  On behalf of thousands of admiring fans, I extend my congratulations \nand thanks to the University of New Mexico Lobo Women's Basketball team \nfor their successful year. I salute Coach Don Flanagan and his team: \nJordan Adams, Susan Babcock, Jasmine Ewing, Melissa Forest, Cristal \nGarcia, Chelsea Grear, Nikki Heckroth, Molly McKinnon, Lauren McLeod, \nMiranda Sanchez, Jennifer Williams, and Brittany Wolfgang. We are proud \nof the team and its accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/30/senate-section/article/S3214-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3214-S3215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1255.

A bill to amend the Sherman Act to make oil-producing and \nexporting cartels illegal; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, in the last year, consumers all across the \nnation have watched gas prices rise, seemingly without any end in \nsight. And, if consumers weren't paying enough already, just a few days \nago the OPEC nations agreed to cut production by a million barrels a \nday, an action sure to drive up prices even higher. Such blatantly \nanti-competitive action by the oil cartel violates the most basic \nprinciples of fair competition and free markets and should not be \ntolerated. It is for this reason that I rise today, with my colleagues \nSenators DeWine, Specter, Leahy, Feingold, Thurmond, and Grassley, to \nreintroduce the ``No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act'', \n``NOPEC''. This legislation is identical to our NOPEC bill introduced \nlast year, which passed the Judiciary Committee unanimously.\n  Real people suffer real consequences every day in our nation because \nof OPEC's actions. Rising gas prices--prices that averaged above $2 per \ngallon in many places last summer, are a silent tax that takes hard-\nearned money away from Americans every time they visit the gas pump. \nHigher oil prices drive up the cost of transportation, harming \nthousands of companies throughout the economy from trucking to \naviation. And those costs are passed on to consumers in the form of \nhigher prices for manufactured goods. Higher oil prices mean higher \nheating oil and electricity costs. Anyone who has gone through a \nMidwest winter or a deep South summer can tell you about the tremendous \npersonal costs associated with higher home heating or cooling bills.\n  We have all heard many explanations offered for rising energy prices. \nSome say that the oil companies are gouging consumers. Some blame \ndisruptions in supply. Others point to EPA requirement mandating use of \na new and more expensive type of ``reformulated'' gas in the Midwest. \nAfter last spring's gas price spike, which dove prices above $2 per \ngallon for a time in the Midwest, some even claimed that refiners and \ndistributors were illegally fixing prices. At the request of the \nWisconsin delegation and Senator DeWine, the Federal Trade Commission \nlaunched an investigation last year to figure out if those allegations \nwere true. After an exhaustive, nearly year-long investigation, they \nfound no evidence of illegal price fixing as a cause of higher gas \nprices.\n  But one cause of these escalating prices is indisputable: the price \nfixing conspiracy of the OPEC nations. For years, this conspiracy has \nunfairly driven up the cost of imported crude oil to satisfy the greed \nof the oil exporters. We have long decried OPEC, but, sadly, until now \nno one has tried to take any action. NOPEC will, for the first time, \nestablish clearly and plainly that when a group of competing oil \nproducers like the OPEC nations act together to restrict supply or set \nprices, they are violating U.S. law. It will authorize the Attorney \nGeneral or FTC to file suit under the antitrust laws for redress. Our \nbill will also make plain that the nations of OPEC cannot hide behind \nthe doctrines of ``Sovereign Immunity'' or ``Act of State'' to escape \nthe reach of American justice.\n\n[[Page S3217]]\n\n  In recent years a consensus has developed in international law that \ncertain basic standards are universal, and that the international \ncommunity can, and should, take action when a nation violates these \nfundamental standards. The response of the international community to \nethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia and action by the courts of \nBritain to hold General Augusto Pinochet accountable for human rights \nabuses and torture that occurred when he was President of Chile are two \nprominent examples. The rouge actions of the international oil cartel \nshould be treated no differently. The most fundamental principle of a \nfree market is that competitors cannot be permitted to conspire to \nlimit supply or fix price. There can be no free market without this \nfoundation. In this era of globalization, we truly need to open \ninternational markets to ensure the prosperity of all. And we should \nnot permit any nation to flout this fundamental principle.\n\n  Some critics of this legislation have argued that suing OPEC will not \nwork or that threatening suit will hurt more than help. I disagree. Our \nNOPEC legislation will, for the first time, enable our authorities to \ntake legal action to combat the illegitimate price-fixing conspiracy of \nthe oil cartel. It will, at a minimum, have a real deterrent effect on \nnations that seek to join forces to fix oil prices to the detriment of \nconsumers. This legislation will be the first real weapon the U.S. \ngovernment has ever had to deter OPEC from its seemingly endless cycle \nof price increases.\n  There is nothing remarkable about applying U.S. antitrust law \noverseas. Our government has not hesitated to do so when faced with \nclear evidence of anti-competitive conduct that harms American \nconsumers. Just last year, in fact, the Justice Department secured a \nrecord $500 million dollar criminal fine against German and Swiss \ncompanies engaged in a price fixing conspiracy to raise and fix the \nprice of vitamins sold in the United States and elsewhere. The mere \nfact that the conspirators are foreign nations is no basis to shield \nthem from violating these most basic standards of fair economic \nbehavior.\n  There is also nothing remarkable about suing a foreign government \nabout its commercial activity. There are many recent cases in which \nforeign governments have been held answerable for their commercial \nactivities in U.S. courts, including a case against Iran for failure to \npay for aircraft parts, a case against Argentina for breach of its \nobligations arising out of issuance of bonds, and a case against Costa \nRica for violating the terms of a lease. Our NOPEC legislation falls \nsquarely within this tradition.\n  Even under current law, there is no doubt that the actions of the \ninternational oil cartel would be in gross violation of antitrust law \nif engaged in by private companies. If OPEC were a group of \ninternational private companies rather than foreign governments, their \nactions would be nothing more than an illegal price fixing scheme. But \nOPEC members have used the shield of ``sovereign immunity'' to escape \naccountability for their price-fixing. The Federal Sovereign Immunities \nAct, though, already recognizes that the ``commercial'' activity of \nnations is not protected by sovereign immunity. And it is hard to \nimagine an activity that is more obviously commercial than selling oil \nfor profit, as the OPEC nations do. Our legislation will correct one \nerroneous twenty-year-old lower federal court decision and establish \nthat sovereign immunity doctrine will not divest a U.S. court from \njurisdiction to hear a lawsuit alleging that members of the oil cartel \nare violating antitrust law.\n  In the last few weeks, I have grown more certain than ever that this \nlegislation is necessary. Between OPEC's decision last week to cut oil \nproduction and the FTC's conclusion that American companies do not bear \nprimary responsibility for last summer's gas price spike, I am \nconvinced that we need to take action, and take action now, before the \ndamage spreads too far.\n  For these reasons, I urge that my colleagues support this bill so \nthat our nation will finally have an effective means to combat this \nselfish conspiracy of oil-rich nations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 665\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe use of completed contract method of accounting in the case of \ncertain long-term naval vessel construction contracts; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to simplify \nand restore fairness to the naval shipyard accounting statutes under \nwhich our six major U.S. naval shipyards pay taxes on the naval ship \ncontracts they are awarded by the Navy.\n  Quite simply, this legislation would permit naval shipyards to use a \nmethod of accounting under which shipbuilders would pay income taxes \nupon delivery of a ship rather than during construction. Under current \nlaw, profits must be estimated during the construction phases of the \nshipbuilding process and taxes must be paid on those estimated profits. \nThe legislation being proposed would simply allow naval shipbuilders to \nuse a method of accounting, under which the shipbuilder would pay taxes \nwhen the ship is actually delivered to the Navy.\n  Prior to 1982, federal law permitted shipbuilders to use this method, \nbut the law was changed due to abuses by federal contractors in another \nsector, having absolutely nothing to do with shipbuilding. Moreover, \nnon-government shipbuilding contracts are already allowed to use this \nmethod of accounting, and this legislation contains provisions designed \nto prevent the types of abuses witnessed in the past. Specifically, the \nbill would restrict shipyards from deferring tax payments for a period \nbeyond the time it takes to build a single ship.\n  This bill would not reduce the amount of taxes ultimately paid by the \nshipbuilder. It simply would defer payment until the profit is actually \nknown upon delivery of the ship. I believe that this is the most fair \nand most sensible accounting method. It is the method\n\n[[Page S3218]]\n\nthat naval shipbuilders used to employ. It is the method which \ncommercial builders are permitted to use to this day. This legislation \nhas the strong support of the major shipyards that build for the Navy. \nAs such, I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in a strong show of \nsupport for this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire):\n  S. 668. A bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to ensure that all \ndogs and cats used by research facilities are obtained legally; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pet Safety \nand Protection Act of 2001. Senator Bob Smith joins me in sponsoring \nthis bill that will close a serious loophole in the Animal Welfare Act.\n  Over 30 years ago, Congress passed the Animal Welfare Act to stop the \nmistreatment of animals and to prevent the unintentional sale of family \npets for laboratory experiments. Despite the well-meaning intentions of \nthe Animal Welfare Act and the enforcement efforts of the Department of \nAgriculture, the Act routinely fails to provide pets and pet owners \nwith reliable protection against the actions of some unethical dealers.\n  Medical research is an invaluable weapon in the battle against \ndisease. New drugs and surgical techniques offer promise in the fight \nagainst AIDS, cancer, and a host of life-threatening diseases. I am not \nhere to argue whether animals should or should not be used in research. \nAnimal research has been, and continues to be, fundamental to \nadvancements in medicine. However, I am concerned with the sale of \nstolen pets and stray animals to research facilities.\n  There are less than 40 ``random source'' animal dealers operating \nthroughout the country who acquire tens of thousands of dogs and cats. \n``Random source'' dealers are USDA licensed Class B dealers that \nprovide animals for research. Many of these animals are family pets, \nacquired by so-called ``bunchers'' who sometimes resort to theft and \ndeception as they collect animals to sell them to Class B dealers. \n``Bunchers,'' posing as someone interested in adopting a dog or cat, \nusually respond to advertisements such as ``free pet to a good home,'' \nand trick animal owners into giving them their pets. Some random source \ndealers are known to keep hundreds of animals at a time in squalid \nconditions, providing them with little food or water. The mistreated \nanimals often pass through several hands and across state lines before \nthey are eventually sold by a random source dealer to a research \nlaboratory.\n  While I am not suggesting that laboratories intentionally seek out \nstolen or fraudulently obtained dogs and cats as research subjects, the \nfact remains that many of these animals end up in research \nlaboratories, and little is being done to stop it. It is clear to most \nobservers, including animal welfare organizations around the country, \nthat this problem persists because of random source animal dealers.\n  The Pet Safety and Protection Act strengthens the Animal Welfare Act \nby prohibiting the use of random source animal dealers as suppliers of \ndogs and cats to research laboratories. At the same time, the Pet \nSafety and Protection Act preserves the integrity of animal research by \nencouraging research laboratories to obtain animals from legitimate \nsources that comply with the Animal Welfare Act. Legitimate sources are \nUSDA-licensed Class A dealers or breeders, municipal pounds that choose \nto release dogs and cats for research purposes, legitimate pet owners \nwho want to donate their animals to research, and private and federal \nfacilities that breed their own animals. These four sources are capable \nof supplying millions of animals for research, far more cats and dogs \nthan are required by current laboratory demand. Furthermore, at least \nin the case of using municipal pounds, research laboratories could save \nmoney since pound animals cost only a few dollars compared to the high \nfees charged by random source animal dealers. The National Institutes \nof Health, in an effort to curb abuse and deception, has already \nadopted policies against the acquisition of dogs and cats from random \nsource dealers.\n  The Pet Safety and Protection Act also reduces the Department of \nAgriculture's regulatory burden by allowing the Department to use its \nresources more efficiently and effectively. Each year, hundreds of \nthousands of dollars are spent on regulating 40 random source dealers. \nTo combat any future violation of the Animal Welfare Act, the Pet \nSafety and Protection Act increases the penalties under the Act to a \nminimum of $1,000 per violation.\n  As I stated before, this bill in no way impairs or impedes research, \nbut will end the fraudulent practices of some Class B dealers. The \nhistory of disregard for the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act by \nsome animal dealers makes the Pet Safety and Protection Act necessary \nand I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 668\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of\n\n[[Page S3219]]\n\n1965 to promote parental involvement and parental empowerment in public \neducation through greater competition and choice, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join today with my \ndistinguished colleague from New Hampshire and a broad, bipartisan \ngroup of cosponsors to introduce the Empowering Parents Act of 2001. \nSenator Judd Gregg has been a consistent champion of charter schools \nand a passionate advocate of competition and choice in public \neducation. I cannot imagine a better colleague to partner with on my \nfirst legislative initiative in the U.S. Senate.\n  Like the Senator from New Hampshire, I come from a small State. Also \nlike my friend from New Hampshire, I was once the governor of my small \nState. I think it is appropriate, that Senator Gregg and I have seen \nfit to team up so early in my tenure here in the Senate. During the \nfall campaign, I was fond of saying that we need more people in \nWashington who think and act like Governors. My years in the National \nGovernors' Association taught me that Governors tend to be results-\noriented and tend to have a healthy impatience for partisan bickering.\n  We in this Chamber will always have our disagreements. Next week, for \nexample, we are scheduled to begin debate on the budget and every \nexpectation is that it will be a very partisan debate. That makes it \nall the more important, that we push forward in those areas where we're \nable to reach bipartisan agreement. The issue of vouchers is one on \nwhich we are unlikely to come to a consensus. Expanding the number of \ncharter schools and broadening public school choice, however, is \nsomething that we can agree on, and we should.\n  Charter schools and public school choice inject market forces into \nour schools. They empower parents to make choices to send their \nchildren to a variety of different schools. That means that schools \nwhich offer what students and parents want, be it foreign languages, \nmore math and science, higher test scores, better discipline, those \nschools will be full. Schools which fail to listen to their customers, \nto parents and students, may see their student populations diminish \nuntil those schools change. At the same time, charter schools are \npublic schools, held to high standards of public accountability. And \nunlike vouchers, public school choice preserves indeed, it helps to \nfulfill the promise of equal access upon which public education and the \ncommon school tradition have always been premised.\n  In my State, we've enthusiastically embraced both the charter \nmovement and public school choice. We introduced charter schools and \nstatewide public school choice almost 5 years ago. A greater percentage \nof families exercise public school choice in Delaware today than in any \nother State in the Nation, and in the last year alone the number of \nDelaware students in charter schools has more than doubled. The \nevidence is that these reforms, together with high standards and broad-\nbased educator accountability, are working to raise student achievement \nand to narrow the achievement gap between students of different racial \nand ethnic backgrounds. Students tested last spring, at every grade \nlevel tested and in each of our counties, made significant progress \nwhen measured against their peers throughout the country, as well as \nagainst Delaware's own academic standards.\n\n  Let me tell you briefly, about one of the schools in my State that is \nhelping to accomplish both of these goals, raising student achievement \nand closing the achievement gap. In Delaware, we have close to 200 \npublic schools. Students in all of these schools take Delaware's State \ntests measuring what students know and can do in reading, writing, and \nmath. We also measure our schools by the incidence of poverty, from \nhighest to lowest. The school with the highest incidence of poverty in \nmy State is the East Side Charter School in Wilmington, DE. The \nincidence of poverty there is over 80 percent. Its students are almost \nall minority. It is right in the center of the projects in Wilmington. \nIn the first year after East Side Charter School opened its doors, \nalmost none of its students met our State standards in math. Last \nspring, there was only one school in our State where every third grader \nwho took our math test met or exceeded our standards. That school was \nthe East Side Charter School.\n  It's a remarkable story, and it has been possible because the East \nSide Charter School is a remarkable school. Kids can come early and \nstay late. They have a longer school year. They wear school uniforms. \nParents have to sign something akin to a contract of mutual \nresponsibility. Educators are given greater authority to innovate and \ninitiate. With highly qualified and highly motivated teachers and with \nstrong leadership from active citizens who want to make a positive \ndifference for their community, the East Side Charter School has become \na beacon of hope to parents and students in a neighborhood where you \ncan no longer have a pizza or newspaper delivered to your door. It has \nprovided parents in that community with an option for their children \nthey might not otherwise have had.\n  The legislation that Senator Gregg and I are introducing today aims \nto make similar options available in communities all across our \ncountry, particularly in low-income communities and communities with \nlow-performing schools, just like Wilmington's East Side. It encourages \nStates and local districts with low-performing schools to expand public \nschool choice. It also eliminates many of the artificial barriers to \ncharter school financing that have prevented the supply of new charter \nschools from keeping pace with the growing demand among parents and \nstudents.\n  Language was inserted in the FY 2001 Labor-HHS appropriations bill \ngiving students the right to transfer out of failing schools. Some \nsimilar provision will likely be included in any legislation we pass \nthis year reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \nUnfortunately, the right to transfer out of a failing school will not \nby itself translate into a meaningful array of alternatives for \nparents. Nor, as far as I am concerned, will a $1,500 voucher, though I \nknow there is some disagreement on this point even among supporters of \nthis bill. In some high poverty school districts, there are no higher \nperforming schools for students to transfer into. In other districts, \nadministrative barriers or capacity constraints could well limit the \nchoice provided to parents to a single alternative, which may or may \nnot be the school that parents believe best meets their child's needs. \nMoreover, at least in my State--and I don't pretend to know \nthe circumstances in other States--you can't get your kid in to get an \neducation at the private or parochial schools for $1,500.\n\n  Unless we help to establish new charter schools in communities with \nlow-performing schools, and unless we provide encouragement to the \nStates and local school districts that serve these communities to \ncreate broad and meaningful choice at the intra-district level and \nideally at the inter-district level, the right to ``choice out'' of a \nfailing school will be little more than an empty promise. The \nEmpowering Parents Act aims to keep the promise by helping to ensure \nthat parents are empowered with real choices for their children within \nthe public school system.\n  The Empowering Parents Act does three things. First, it provides $200 \nmillion in competitive grants to States and local districts with low-\nperforming schools for the purpose of expanding public school choice. \nThis will help to make the right to public school choice that we intend \nto make part of title I a meaningful right for parents with children \ntrapped in failing schools.\n  Second, the Empowering Parents Act expands the credit enhancement \ndemonstration for charter schools that passed last year and also \nexempts all interest on charter school loans from federal taxes. This \nwill leverage private financing to help charter schools finance start-\nup costs, as well as the costs associated with the acquisition and \nrenovation of facilities, the most commonly cited barriers to the \nestablishment of new charter schools.\n  Third and finally, the Empowering Parents Act creates incentives for \nStates to provide per pupil facilities funding programs for charter \nschools. According to a recent GAO report, ``Charter Schools; Limited \nAccess to Facility Financing,'' the per pupil allocations that charter \nschools receive as\n\n[[Page S3220]]\n\npublic schools to educate public school students are frequently just a \nfraction of the amount that is provided annually to traditional public \nschools for operating expenses and thus provide none of the funding \nthat traditional public schools receive for facility costs. \nAdditionally, GAO reports that school districts that are allowed to \nshare local facility financing with charter schools often do not. The \nresult is that charter schools are forced to literally take money out \nof the classroom, dipping into funds meant to pay teachers and purchase \ntextbooks, just so they can secure a roof over their students' heads. \nThe Empowering Parents Act would provide matching grants to states to \nencourage them to level the playing field between charters and \ntraditional public schools with respect to facility financing.\n  Mr. President, the call for competition and choice among accountable \npublic schools can be heard all across America. Just 7 years ago, there \nwas only one charter school in existence in the entire nation. Today, \n36 States and the District of Columbia have charter school laws, and \nthere are over 350,000 students attending nearly 1,700 charter schools. \nAs fast as the movement for charters and choice has grown, the reality \nis that the ideal of involved and empowered parents choosing a child's \nschool from among a range of diverse but accountable public schools \nremains the exception rather than the rule in America. In fact, 7 out \nof 10 charter schools around the country have a waiting list of \nstudents they can't accommodate. The charters and choice movement is a \ngrassroots movement, and thus, appropriately, most of action is taking \nplace at the state and local level. There is an old saying, however, \nthat you must lead, follow, or get out of the way. Charters and choice \nare sparking innovation in schools around the country, and there is a \nrole for the Federal Government to play in spreading the synergy.\n\n  A key role of the Federal Government in the area of education is to \nlevel the playing field for children that come from tough, \ndisadvantaged backgrounds. We are committed in America to the principle \nthat every child deserves a real chance to reach high standards of \nachievement. I have said often that we need to start our efforts to \nlevel the playing field by ensuring that every child enters \nkindergarten ready to learn, which means promoting early childhood \neducation, beginning with full funding for Head Start. However, charter \nschools and public school choice should also play an integral part in \nour efforts to close the achievement gap, because whenever a child is \nleft trapped in a failing school, it means that we have failed as a \nnation to fulfill the promise of equal opportunity for all and special \nprivileges for none.\n  Passing the Empowering Parents Act would represent a landmark federal \ncommitment to parental involvement and parental empowerment in public \neducation. It would send a clear message from coast to coast that we \nwill no longer settle in America for a public education system that \ntraps students in schools that fail to meet high standards. That's not \na Democrat message. That's not a Republican message. That's a message \nof hope and opportunity, a message I believe Republicans and Democrats \ncan embrace together.\n  When Lynne Cheney visited Delaware in the heat of last fall's \nPresidential campaign to shine a national spotlight on the East Side \nCharter School, it was a great tribute to the tremendous \naccomplishments of the parents, teachers, and administrators who have \npoured their energy and creativity into that remarkable school. It was \nalso a tribute, I believe, to our bipartisan spirit of cooperation in \nDelaware and to the progress that we can achieve when we work \ntogether--Republicans and Democrats, legislators and business leaders, \nparents and teachers. Our charters and choice legislation passed on \nconsecutive days back in 1995. One bill was sponsored by a Republican, \none by a Democrat. It was truly a bipartisan effort.\n  That's the way we do things in Delaware. We work together. We get \nthings done. It is this uncommon tradition of putting aside partisan \ndifferences and doing what is right for Delaware that has enabled our \nState to shine. And it is this same spirit of common-sense bipartisan \nthat is needed in Washington if America is to embrace a new century \nstrong and confident in our future.\n  We will have plenty to fight about in this Chamber, this year and in \nthe years to come. I suggest to my colleagues, let's take the \nopportunities we have to find common ground and to show the American \npeople that we can work together to make a difference for communities \nand families across this country. As the broad bipartisan support for \nthis legislation attests, the Empowering Parents Act provides us with \nan opportunity to govern in a positive, progressive, and bipartisan \nfashion. I ask my colleagues to join with Senator Gregg and myself to \nhelp pass the Empowering Parents Act, and thereby to register a win for \nbipartisanship and more importantly, a win for children trapped in \nschools that are failing to meet their potential or allow their \nstudents to reach their own potential.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 670. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to eliminate methyl \ntertiary butyl ether from the United States fuel supply and to increase \nproduction and use of ethanol, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am joining with my good friend, \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry Committee, Senator Richard Lugar, to introduce the ``Renewable \nFuels Act of 2001.'' Over the years, Senator Lugar has been one of the \nnation's leading champions of American agriculture and energy \nindependence, and I am pleased to work with him on this effort to \nencourage the use of ethanol in our nation's fuel supply in a way that \nimproves air quality and strengthens the nation's energy security.\n  The bill Senator Lugar and I are introducing today is a refinement of \na proposal we introduced in the last Congress. Many of the provisions \nof that bill were included in legislation reported by the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee in September 2000. \nUnfortunately, time ran out on the 106th Congress before final action \ncould be taken on that committee bill.\n  The Renewable Fuels Act of 2001 allows states to address a serious \ngroundwater contamination problem by phasing out MTBE and establishes a \nnationwide renewable fuels standard that encourages the environmentally \nsound use of ethanol. The effect of this measure will be to get MTBE \nout of groundwater, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, diversify our \ndomestic liquid fuels production base, and promote investment and job \ncreation in rural communities. The bill will also result in substantial \nreductions in taxpayer outlays by enabling farmers to value-add their \nproducts into renewable liquid fuels and reduce oil imports that are \nexacerbating our trade deficit.\n  The genesis of this legislation is found in the compelling need to \nresolve the problem of MTBE contamination of groundwater in states such \nas California. As we discovered in the 106th Congress, the solution to \nthis problem, whose roots go back over a decade to the congressional \ndebate on the merits of RFG with oxygenates, is extremely complex.\n  A review of the Congressional Record debate shows that the Congress \nhad several major objectives in enacting the RFG with oxygenates \nprogram, including: to improve the environment by reducing mobile \nsource vehicle emissions (VOC ozone precursors; toxics; NOx; \nand CO2); to improve energy security by reducing oil \nimports; to stimulate the economy, especially in rural areas; and to \nprovide regulatory relief to the automobile industry, small businesses/\nstationary sources, and state and local authorities.\n  While the detection of MTBE in drinking water supplies in some areas \nof the country has encouraged criticism of the RFG program, the record \nshows that most of the Congress' original goals for the RFG program \nhave been met and, in many cases, even surpassed. The RFG program has, \nin fact, provided refiners with environmentally clean, high performance \nadditives that have substantially extended gasoline supplies. Due to \nthe increased demand for oxygenated fuels like ethanol, capital has \nbeen invested in farmer-owned cooperative ethanol plants throughout\n\n[[Page S3221]]\n\nthe Midwest, and rural communities have benefited from quality jobs and \nexpanded tax bases. Harmful emissions in our major cities, from \nCalifornia to the Northeast, have fallen dramatically. Our trade \ndeficit has been substantially reduced, and taxpayers have saved \nhundreds of millions of dollars in farm program costs.\n\n  In short, the RFG program has been one of the most successful \nprivate/public sector programs in recent memory.\n  Some of our colleagues from areas that have experienced MTBE water \ncontamination problems believe the entire RFG program should be \ndismantled. They argue that the RFG program has run its course and that \nstates should be allowed to waive its oxygenate requirement.\n  I do not accept this argument and will strongly resist any effort to \ngrant state petitions to opt out of the 1990 RFG minimum oxygen \nstandard requirements. That option is not supported by the science and \nwould simply encourage multinational oil companies to import more crude \noil and to use energy-intensive methods to refine it into toxic \naromatics that combust into highly carcinogenic benzene.\n  I am sympathetic, however, to concern about the existence of MTBE in \ngroundwater, and Senator Lugar and I offer an alternative response to \nthe states' struggle to deal with this issue. We believe the Renewable \nFuels Act addresses this challenge swiftly and effectively without \nabandoning the documented benefits of the RFG program.\n  Consider the agricultural, energy and environmental benefits of our \napproach. A September 6, 2000, United States Department of Agriculture \nanalysis concluded that the Renewable Fuels Standard, RFS, provision in \nour bill would increase ethanol demand from baseline projections of 2.0 \nbillion gallons, to a minimum of 4.6 billion gallons, over the next 10 \nyears. This is a substantial increase when compared with sales last \nyear, which reached approximately 1.5 billion gallons. USDA found that, \nunder this renewable fuels standard, farm incomes would increase by an \naverage of $1.3 billion per year each year from 2000 to 2010. That \ntotals to more than $13 billion for hard hit rural communities. \nTaxpayer outlays would drop dramatically due to the improved, market-\nbased terms of trade in basic farm commodities. Some experts calculate \nthat the nation's taxpayers would directly benefit from billions of \ndollars per year in farm program savings.\n  At today's price for imported oil, our bill's RFS provision would \nsave the country over $4 billion annually in current dollars. The \n``Renewable Fuels Act of 2001'' will triple the use of renewable fuels \nin the United States over the next 10 years. This tripling represents \nless than 4 percent of the nation's total motor fuels consumption, \nwhich is well less than the oil industry's projected demand growth over \nthe next 10 years. However, while small in relationship to the market \nshare of multinational oil companies, it would account for the lion's \nshare of the stated goal of Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee Chairman Frank Murkowski when he recently announced his \nCommittee's goal to reduce the Nation's oil import dependence over that \nsame period.\n  As for the environment, the Renewable Fuels Act of 2001 provides \nstates like California with a way to get MTBE out of groundwater \nwithout sacrificing ethanol's contribution to the reduction of \nemissions of the greenhouses gases linked to global climate change.\n  Finally, as impressive as its record has been, I believe the RFG \nminimum oxygen standard program has more to offer the country. And I am \npleased to report that President Bush agrees with that analysis.\n  In a visit to Sioux Falls, SD, earlier this month, the President has \nsome encouraging words to say about the role of renewable fuels like \nethanol. He emphasized his commitment ``to value-added processing, to \nmake sure that ethanol is an integral part of the gasoline mixes in the \nUnited States.''\n  I applaud President Bush's vision for ethanol. We agree that it is \ntime to make ethanol an integral part of this country's fuel mix, in a \nmanner that is predictable, sustainable, cost effective, and \nenvironmentally responsible. The ``Renewable Fuels Act of 2001'' meets \nall of these criteria.\n  What Senator Lugar and I are suggesting is a truly national program \nthat addresses geographically diverse needs in a synergistic manner. \nThis comprehensive approach has encountered skepticism from well \nmeaning interests that are, understandably, focused on their own \npriorities: state officials who are intent on cleaning up their \ngroundwater; elected officials who are philosophically troubled by the \nperception of federal mandates; and farm groups whose fear of the \nvagaries of the legislative process make them reluctant to lock arms \nwith traditional foes.\n  Senator Lugar and I present the Renewable Fuels Act of 2001 as a new \nparadigm for reconciling historically competitive interests in a manner \nthat will promote a broad range of national benefits. It is my hope \nthat our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as \nrepresentatives of state and local governments, the environmental \ncommunity, the oil industry and farm groups, will take an open minded \nlook at this approach.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Daschle in \nreintroducing the Renewable Fuels Act of 2001. This bill is intended to \nform the basis for a solution to the MTBE problem that will be \nacceptable to all regions of the nation.\n  In July 1999, an independent Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in \nGasoline called for major reductions in the use of MTBE as an additive \nin gasoline. They did so because of growing evidence and public \nconcerns regarding pollution of drinking water supplies by MTBE. These \ntrends are particularly acute in areas of the country using \nReformulated Gasoline.\n  Because of concerns regarding water pollution, it is clear that the \nexisting situation regarding MTBE is not tenable. MTBE is on its way \nout. The question is what kind of legislation is needed to facilitate \nits departure and whether that legislation will be based on \nconsideration of all of the environmental and energy security issues \ninvolved.\n  The Renewable Fuels Act of 2001 will be good for our economy and our \nenvironment. Most important of all, it will facilitate the development \nof renewable fuels, a development critical to ensuring U.S. national \nand economic security and stabilizing gas prices.\n  The security of our whole economy revolves around our over-dependence \non energy sources from the unstable nations of the Middle East. We must \nbe able to address this challenge. Finding an environmentally sensitive \nway to promote the use of renewable fuels is an important part of this \nchallenge. That is what I believe our bill will accomplish.\n  The Renewable Fuels Act of 2001 will lead to at least four billion \nseven hundred million gallons of ethanol being produced in 2011 \ncompared to one billion, six hundred million gallons today. Under the \nAct, one gallon of cellulosic ethanol will count for one and one-half \ngallons of regular ethanol in determining whether a refiner has met the \nRenewable Fuels Standard in a particular year. This will greatly \naccelerate the development of renewable fuels made from cellulosic \nbiomass. These fuels produce no net greenhouse gas emissions.\n  The Renewable Fuels Act of 2001 will establish a nationwide Renewable \nFuels Standard, RFS, that would increase the current use of renewable \nfuels from 0.6 percent of all motor fuel sold in the United States in \n2000 to 1.5 percent by 2011. Refiners who produced renewable fuels \nbeyond the standard could sell credits to other refiners who chose to \nunder comply with the RFS.\n  This bill would require the EPA Administrator to end the use of MTBE \nwithin four years in order to protect the public health and the \nenvironment. And it would establish strict ``anti backsliding \nprovisions'' to capture all of the air quality benefits of MTBE and \nethanol as MTBE is phased down and then phased out.\n  Unlike last year's bill, this bill retains the Minimum Oxygen \nStandard in the Clean Air Act Amendments. However, the Clean Air Act is \namended to ensure that, after MTBE is removed from gasoline, there will \nbe no backsliding in clean air provisions related to ground level ozone \nand toxic air pollution and also that there will be strict limitations \non the aromatic content of reformulated gasoline and of all gasoline in \norder to further safeguard clean air.\n\n[[Page S3222]]\n\n  I hope that my colleagues will examine this bill as well as other \nlegislative approaches that would spur the development of renewable \nfuels such as ethanol, whether derived from corn or other agricultural \nor plant materials, while maintaining strict clean air requirements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/30/senate-section/article/S3222-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 30--CONDEMNING THE DESTRUCTION OF PRE-\n          ISLAMIC STATUES IN AFGHANISTAN BY THE TALIBAN REGIME\n\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Wellstone) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a concurrent \nresolution condemning the destruction of pre-Islamic statues in \nAfghanistan by the Taliban regime. A similar resolution has been \nintroduced in the House of Representatives. This resolution expresses \nthe grave concern of the Congress over the recent destruction of \nreligious treasures in Afghanistan by the Taliban and over the \ntreatment of the Afghani people by their Taliban rulers.\n  Afghanistan is home to a rich cultural heritage, steeped in Buddhist \nhistory and ancient artifacts. More than 1,500 years ago, a pair of \nBuddha statues, each standing over 100 feet tall, was carved out of a \nmountainside in Bamiyan. Since their creation, these statues have been \nvisited by many people. they were both religious and cultural \ntreasures--they become one of the most important models for the \ndepiction elsewhere of Buddha. Significant relics such as these should \nhave been preserved for the edification and enlightenment of future \ngenerations.\n  Islam and Buddhism have peacefully coexisted in Afghanistan for more \nthan 1,000 years. Two years ago, Mullah Mohammed Omar, the leader of \nthe Taliban regime, called for the preservation of Buddhist cultural \nheritage in Afghanistan. The Islamic faith supports religious tolerance \nand coexistence, evidenced in the Qur'anic verse ``Unto you your \nreligion, and unto me my religion.''\n  In spite of this edict, several times within the last year the \nleaders of the Taliban regime have ordered the military to disfigure \nthese and other Buddhist statues. On February 26, 2001, Taliban leader \nMullah Mohammed Omar ordered the utter destruction of these \nirreplaceable cultural treasures, along with all other pre-Islamic \nstatues in the nation, calling them ``shrines of infidels.'' Mohammed \nOmar claimed that statues of the human form are in contradiction with \nShari'ah and the tenets of Islam. Shari'ah refers to the laws and way \nof life prescribed by Allah in the Qur'an, and dictates ideology of \nfaith, behavior, manners, and practical daily life. Destruction of the \nstatues clearly contradicts a basic tenet of the Islamic faith which is \ntolerance.\n  The the recent destruction of Buddhist statuary is the latest action \nby the Taliban demonstrating an open disregard for international \nopinion and basic norms of human behavior which include respect for \nindividuals and their beliefs. Tales of horrific human rights \nviolations continue to be told. Confirmed reports tell of men, \nimprisoned for political reasons, being held in windowless cells \nwithout food and hung by their legs while being beaten with cables. In \nJanuary of this year, Taliban troops massacred several hundred Hazaras, \nmembers of a Muslim ethnic group in the Bamiyan province. This was just \nthe latest in a series of such slaughters. Such executions are not \nuncommon.\n  The regime has a history of showing support for terrorist groups and \nviolating human rights. Women are a frequent target of abuse. Facing \nthe threat of public beatings, women cannot leave their homes unless \naccompanied by a male relative and are forbidden from participating in \nactivities in which they may interact with men. For this reason, women \nwere banned from work and school under the Taliban, although some were \nallowed to work on projects sponsored by foreign charities until that \nright was revoked last summer. This further restriction of women under \nthe Taliban is exacerbated by the increasing occurrence of the rape and \nabduction of Afghani women. The State Department recently reported that \nthe Taliban sold women from the Shomali plains areas to Pakistan and \nthe Arab Gulf states. The State Department in its human rights reports \nalso describes the risk of rape and abduction and tells of young women \nforced to marry local commanders who kidnap them. This is a sad \nsituation with no apparent end. Afghanistan appears to be a bottomless \npit of human misery, a misery afflicted by the few on the many.\n  Afghanistan has suffered its share of human and natural disasters. \nWhile prolonged civil war continues to wreak havoc among the \npopulation, agricultural productivity has been reduced by the worst \ndrought in 30 years. This setback reduced crop yields by 50 percent and \nresulted in a 80 percent loss of livestock, affecting half the \npopulation.

I thank the Chair and the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to further engage the Senator from Arizona \nbecause the Senator from Arizona asserted that we have received the \nestimates of the cost of the President's tax package, and that is \nsimply not the case. It is not true. If he has received it, I would \nlike him to give me a copy because we haven't received it.\n  We haven't received it because the Joint Tax Committee has said they \ndon't have sufficient detail about the President's package to do such a \nreestimate, and so we are being asked to go to a budget resolution \nwithout having the President's budget, without having the estimates \nfrom an independent source of the cost of the President's budget \nproposal, and with no markup in the Senate Budget Committee, which is \nunprecedented, not even an attempt to mark up in the Senate Budget \nCommittee, and all under a reconciliation which denies Senators their \nfundamental rights to engage in extended debate and amendment.\n  There were remarks made on the floor that are just not true. It is \none thing to have a disagreement, and we can disagree. We can even \ndisagree on the facts. The facts are clear and direct. The differences \nbetween the present and 1993 are sharp. In 1993, we did not have the \nfull President's budget. We did have sufficient detail for an \nindependent, objective review of the cost of the President's tax \nproposals. We do not have that now. We do not have the reestimate. We \ndo not have an objective independent review of the cost of this \nPresident's tax plan.\n  What has been reestimated is part of the plan. And what has been \nreestimated is the estate tax plan of the Senator from Arizona, not the \nPresident's estate tax plan, because the Joint Tax Committee has made \nclear they don't have sufficient detail to make such a reestimate. This \nbody is being asked to write a budget resolution without the budget \nfrom the President, without sufficient detail from this President to \nhave an objective, independent analysis of the cost of his proposal, \nwithout markup in the committee.\n  That is another difference. In 1993, we had a full and complete \nmarkup in the Budget Committee. This time there is none. It has never \nhappened before.\n  Some on their side will say, well, in 1983, we went to the floor with \na budget resolution without having completed a markup in the committee. \nThat is true. But at least we tried to mark up in the Budget Committee \neach and every year. Virtually every year we have succeeded, except \nthis year. There wasn't even an attempt to mark up the budget \nresolution in the committee.\n  As I say, we are now being asked to go to the budget resolution with \nno budget from the President, without even sufficient detail to have an \nindependent analysis of the cost of his proposal, which is a massive \n$1.6 trillion tax cut that threatens to put us back into deficit, that \nthreatens to raid the trust funds of Medicare and Social Security, and \nwe have had no markup in the committee.\n  The majority is proposing to use reconciliation, which was designed \nfor deficit reduction, for a tax cut. That is an abuse of \nreconciliation. It would be an abuse if it was for spending; it is an \nabuse if it is for a tax cut. That was not the purpose of special \nprocedures in which Senators give up their rights, their rights to \ndebate and amend legislation. That is wrong. That turns this body into \nthe House of Representatives.\n\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side, in 1993, when our \nleadership came to some of us and asked to use reconciliation for a \nspending program, we said no. This Senator said no. That is an abuse of \nreconciliation because reconciliation is for deficit reduction, not for \nspending increases, not for tax cuts. We are not to short-circuit the \nprocess of the Senate--extended debate, the right to amend--because \nthose are the fundamental rights of every Senator. That is the basis \nthe Founding Fathers gave to this institution. The House of \nRepresentatives was to act in a way that responded to the instant \ndemands of the moment. The Senate was to be the cooling saucer where \nextended debate and discussion could occur, where Senators could offer \namendments so that mistakes could be avoided.\n  All of that is being short-circuited. All of that is being thrown \naside. All of that is being put in a position in which the fundamental \nconstitutional structure of this body is being altered.\n  Because the Senator from Oklahoma was so gracious, I am going to stop \nfor the moment so he can make his remarks. Then I will resume at a \nlater point in time. I wanted to do this as a thank-you to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma for his good manners and graciousness. I appreciate it.\n\n[[Page S3225]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/30/senate-section/article/S3225-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3225-S3227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nNorth Dakota. Sometimes when we are here, we get a little impatient \nsince we all have places we want to go. I appreciate his comments, and \nI very much look forward to debating the budget and tax bills on the \nfloor of the Senate next week and, frankly, over the next couple of \nmonths, as we do our appropriations bills.\n  I enjoy those issues, and I would have preferred doing those instead \nof campaign finance for the last 2 weeks. I would have preferred doing \nthe education bill. I, for one, was urging our caucus, and Senator \nMcCain and others, to defer on campaign finance so we could take up \nsome of the higher priorities which, in my opinion, are education, tax \nreduction, and the budget. I didn't win that debate.\n  We have been on the campaign finance bill for the last couple weeks \nbecause of the tenacity, persistence, and stubbornness of our good \nfriends, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Feingold. I compliment them. They have been persistent \nand tenacious in pushing this bill. I also compliment them for their \nefforts in working with many of us who tried to make the bill better. \nWe had some successes and we had some failures. In some ways this bill \nis a lot better than it was when it was introduced and in some areas it \ngot a lot worse. I will touch on a few of those.\n  I had hoped we would be able to improve the bill. I could not support \nthe bill when it was originally introduced before the Senate. I had \nhoped we could make some improvements so that this Senator could \nsupport final passage. I was committed to try to do that. We had some \nsuccess in a couple of areas, but we had some important failures as \nwell.\n  I also compliment others who worked hard on this bill including \nSenator Thompson and Senator Hagel. Senator Hagel came up with a good \nsubstitute. Senator Thompson had a good amendment dealing with hard \nmoney, and I worked with him on that amendment.\n  I also compliment Senator McConnell and Senator Gramm, who were \nfierce, articulate opponents and spoke very well. Senator Gramm's \nspeech last night was one of the best speeches I have heard in my \nentire Senate career. He spoke very forcefully about freedom of speech \nand the fact that even though the editorial boards and public opinion \npolls say, let's vote for this, that we should abide by the \nConstitution.\n  The Presiding Officer, Senator Byrd, reads the Constitution as \nfrequently, maybe more frequently than anybody in this body. When we \nare sworn into office, we put up our hand and we swear to abide by the \nConstitution.\n  The first amendment to the Constitution, one of the most respected \nand important provisions in the Constitution, states very clearly that \n``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or \nof the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to \npetition the Government for redress of grievances.''\n  ``Congress shall make no law . . .'' Mr. President, that includes the \nMcCain-Feingold bill. In my opinion, this bill restricts our freedom of \nspeech, not only in the original version, but especially in the version \nthat we have now.\n  Some of the different sections of this bill go by different names \nbased on their sponsors. I have great respect for my colleagues, and I \nknow Senators Snowe and Jeffords worked on a section restricting speech \nbefore elections by unions, corporations, and by other interest groups. \nThis bill restricts their ability to speak, to run ads. This bill \nprohibits them, in many cases, from being able to run ads less than 60 \ndays prior to an election that mention a candidate's name. There are a \nlot of groups, some on the left, such as the Sierra Club, and some on \nthe right, such as National Right To Life, for example, that may want \nto run ads about a bill before Congress. We may be debating partial \nbirth abortion or ANWR, and we might be having this debate in September \non an appropriations bill, less than 60 days before the election. This \nbill will say they cannot run an ad with an individual's name saying \nvote this way or that way, or don't support this person, because he is \nwrong on ANWR, or he is correct on the right to life issue. Their free \nspeech would be prohibited. I find that to be unconstitutional.\n  I have heard a lot of debate on the floor saying they did not think \nthat Snowe-Jeffords is unconstitutional, and other people saying that \nit was. Then Senator Wellstone came up with an amendment that said, \nlet's expand that to all interest groups--the same restrictions we had \non unions and businesses on running ads within 60 days. Let's make that \napply to them as well. Senators McCain and Feingold said the Wellstone \namendment was unconstitutional. If that was unconstitutional, then the \nunderlying bill was unconstitutional because, basically, Senator \nWellstone copied it.\n  Why would we pass a bill we know is going to be unconstitutional? And \nthat relates to the nonseverability amendment, described as a killer \namendment. Why? Because they know some of the bill is going to be \ndeclared unconstitutional. Why would we pass legislation we know is \ngoing to be unconstitutional? Yet, some of the proponents are basically \nadmitting it is going to be unconstitutional.\n  The big fight was on severability. The sponsors had to have that \nbecause we more than suspect that parts of this bill will be declared \nunconstitutional. I think they are right, because the people sitting at \nthe Supreme Court are going to say: does this bill restrict an \norganization's ability to communicate and mention a Member's name, or \nmention an issue that is before Congress? It will restrict that right. \nSo it will restrict their ability to have freedom of speech.\n  I think parts of this bill--not all of it, but certainly parts of \nit--will be determined unconstitutional. I think we should not be \npassing unconstitutional bills. I think we should not say, let's just \npass it and let the courts do the homework on it. I guess you can do \nthat, but I think we have the responsibility to uphold the \nConstitution, respect the Constitution, and not to be passing things we \nknow are unconstitutional, that won't uphold a constitutionality test.\n\n  In addition, I mentioned that we had some victories and some defeats. \nOne of the victories, in my opinion, was when we increased the hard \nmoney limits, which have been frozen at the 1974 levels. I compliment \nSenators Hagel and Thompson because they pushed that amendment. I \nhelped them negotiate the compromise. We increased what individuals can \ndo. They were frozen, since 1974, at $1,000, and we doubled that amount \nand indexed that for inflation. So we improved that section. \nIndividuals can now participate more fully and extensively. That was a \ngood amendment. Not everything in this proposal is bad. There are good \nthings and bad things. I came to this debate thinking I might be \nwilling to ban so-called soft money, if it could be done \nconstitutionally, if we could increase hard money, the money that is \ncompletely reported and that everybody says is legitimate. I wanted to \nstop the practice that both parties have used, used quite well on the \nDemocrat side, with the so-called joint committees, where individuals \nexceed the individual amount, and contribute thousands and thousands of \ndollars more through a special committee, through either the Republican \nSenatorial Campaign Committee or the Democratic Senate Campaign \nCommittee.\n  The Democrats did it to the tune of $21 million last year, and the \nRepublicans did it to the tune of $5 million last year. In one race in \nNew York, there was $13 million of soft money directed toward one \ncandidate. How can you have limits and then have other people \ncontributing millions of dollars outside those limits? Everybody has \nheard about that Denise Rich contribution. She contributed over \n$100,000 to one Senate candidate, and I thought the law was only $1,000 \nfor a primary and $1,000 for a general election. But Denise Rich \ncontributed over $100,000 through the use of a joint committee. That \nwas an abuse. It needed to be stopped.\n  Now, let me turn to the issue of coordination. I mentioned this last \nnight on the floor. The coordination section in the underlying McCain-\nFeingold bill was grossly inadequate in its respect for free speech. \nThe sponsors of the bill, Senators McCain and Feingold,\n\n[[Page S3226]]\n\nadmitted as much and said we needed to fix it. The bill had a several-\npage definition of coordination, saying if a union or interest group \ncoordinated with a campaign, they would have to report everything they \ndid and consider it as a contribution. And if you didn't do so, there \ncould be fines and penalties against that organization and against the \ncandidate. You could make them criminal violations because they would \nbe violating the law. We didn't want to make people criminals and put \nthem in jail because, basically, they were exercising their \nconstitutional rights.\n  Senators McCain and Feingold said they would fix that. I looked at \nthe fix, and they fixed it for the unions, but not for everybody else. \nFor the unions, they excluded the in-kind contributions. Unions don't \nhave to report those, disclose them, and they are not considered \ncoordination. That affects a lot of money, maybe to the tune of in \nexcess of $100 million or $200 million. That in-kind contribution is \nexcluded from the coordination fix we just adopted earlier today. But \nwe didn't fix the expenditures side of that.\n  So if you have other groups, such as National Right To Life or the \nSierra Club, and so on, that make expenditures and are working on \ncampaigns and handing out leaflets and so on, that may well be \nconsidered a coordinated activity that has to be reported and disclosed \nboth by the candidate and by the organization. Right now, they don't \nhave to do that. We are going to say that could be illegal activity. \nWhat I am saying is that they took care of the unions, but not of these \ngroups.\n\n  I don't like this coordinated section because I think it goes way too \nfar. We are risking telling people who are exercising their \nconstitutional rights engaging in campaigns, they better not do that or \nthe heavy hand of the Federal Government might come in and say they \nviolated the law. The people accused will say, what law? These are \npeople that might be trying to convince people not to drill in ANWR, or \nmaybe that we should. Maybe we want to change the mining laws, or maybe \nwe should not change the mining laws. They should have a right to \npetition Congress. That is what the First Amendment says. We should not \nabridge anybody's right to petition the Government for a redress of \ngrievances. But we do under this bill if it is during a campaign or \nwithin 60 days of an election. You are certainly going to be \nhandicapping their ability to redress a grievance to the Government--\ntheir right to petition the Government.\n  Again, we have the Constitution, and we have this bill. I find this \nbill to be in violation of the Constitution. Under my reading of the \nConstitution--and I am not a constitutional scholar--I believe we are \neliminating or reducing an individual's ability to be able to petition \nthe Government, and an individual's ability to have freedom of speech \nto say, ``I agree with them,'' or ``I disagree with them,'' or ``I \ndisagree with Senator so-and-so,'' or ``I agree with Senator so-and-\nso,'' right before the election. This bill says, no, you can't do it. \nIf you do it, you might well be in trouble.\n  But, oh, we have a little fix for the unions. We will just run it \nthrough on the last amendment of the day, which is what happened.\n  Do you know what else concerning the unions is missing in this bill? \nYou would think in the year 2001 we would say that all campaigns \ncontributions would be voluntary. Guess what? They are not in America \ntoday. There are millions of Americans who are compelled to contribute \nto campaigns they don't support. They would rather not. Some people say \nthese people don't have to contribute because they don't have to join \nthe union. In some States, they have to join, or if they don't, they \nhave to join under an agency fee arrangement, and they have to pay \ndues. They may not want to, but they have to. They have to pay the dues \nor the agency fee. A lot of that money--maybe in excess of $10, or $15, \nor $20 a month--is used for political activity. That individual may not \nwant it to be used for that.\n  He might disagree with the leadership of the union that money is \ngoing to candidates to whom he or she is totally opposed. We wanted to \nhave a provision that says no one should be compelled to contribute to \na campaign; they would have to give their permission before money can \nbe taken out of their paycheck every month.\n  Oh, no, that amendment could not be accepted. To be fair, the \namendment that was offered was not a good amendment, in my opinion, \nbecause it also included shareholders, and there is no way in the world \nyou can include a shareholders provision, in my opinion. But the voices \nwere clear: You are not going to win on that Paycheck Protection \namendment.\n  Senator Hatch offered another amendment that said at least let's have \ndisclosure on businesses and unions on how much money they are putting \ninto campaigns. I thought surely that amendment was going to be \nadopted. That amendment was not adopted.\n  I will say right now that I believe organized labor put hundreds of \nmillions of dollars into the campaigns last cycle, and we do not know \nand we will not know because this bill does not require that they tell \nus. Everybody else has to disclose contributions; organized labor does \nnot. They do not have to disclose their independent activities. They do \nnot have to disclose their indirect, in-kind contributions to \ncampaigns. They have thousands of people making phone calls day after \nday that are paid full salaries, benefits, at a station set up for \npolitical activity, and most of that is not disclosed. We do not know \nand this bill does not help us know. Is this a balanced package? It \nlooks to me more and more that it is not.\n  Originally, this bill had language supposedly to codify Beck, Beck \nbeing a decision that if a union person did not want their money used \nfor political purposes, they could file notice and get a refund. I \nnever thought that case was satisfactory because their money would be \nused in ways with which they still would not agree, but it was better \nthan nothing. They could get a refund.\n  If somebody does not want money used for political purposes, they \nshould say no and not have to contribute.\n  The underlying bill purported to codify Beck, but it did not do that. \nI raised that issue with Senator McCain and Senator Feingold, and they \nconcurred with me. We struck the language that weakened Beck, in my \nopinion, significantly. That made the bill a little better.\n  I want to give credit when credit is deserved. Certainly this bill is \nimproved by the hard money increase. I think it was improved by \nstriking the language, what I would call the false Beck. That language \nwas taken out of the bill. That made it a little bit better.\n  Then there was another provision this Senator fought very strongly \nagainst, but only at the last minute because I just found out about it \nat the last minute, and that was the amendment by our friend and \ncolleague from New Jersey, Senator Torricelli, that dealt with lower \nadvertising rates for politicians.\n  I fought it, but we only had 30 votes against it. Under that \namendment, broadcasters have to offer the lowest unit rate to \ncandidates for each type of time over a 365-day period. That is an \noutlandish, enormously expensive subsidy for politicians. And while \npeople say, this is great, we are limiting money in politics, and so \non, what we have given politicians is an enormous multimillion-dollar \ngift through this amendment, a multimillion-dollar gift. We defeated a \ncouple amendments that dealt with public financing of campaigns, but \nthis amendment is indirect public financing of campaigns because it is \ngoing to allow politicians to get the rates cheaper than anybody else \nin America. It also has a little provision that says the politicians's \nads cannot be preempted.\n\n  To give an example, prior to the election in October, it gets \nexpensive because a lot of people are trying to buy time. There is a \nlot of competition. A lot people watch ``Monday Night Football.'' I \nlike to watch it. I am sure commercial ads get expensive on Monday \nnight or any night of high visibility.\n  We said: Politician, you get the cheapest rate of the year, and you \ncan use that time on Monday night, you can use it on any great night. \nYou get to have the cheapest time of the year. You get your time, and \nit may be one-tenth as expensive as normal rates for ``Monday Night \nFootball'' or some other program. You get the lowest rate\n\n[[Page S3227]]\n\nof anybody throughout the entire year, and they cannot preempt you. You \nbuy the time, you've got it.\n  Maybe the broadcaster is in rural West Virginia or Oklahoma and has a \nradio station or a TV station and is scraping to get by. They are going \nto get paid the lowest rate they charge on a hot summer night. The \nbroadcaster may think: This is good, we have the new ``ER'' or some \nother new show that is really popular, so we can make some money. But \nthey are going to have politicians swamping them saying: Give that time \nto me.\n  We passed an enormous subsidy for politicians. It is an enormous \nadvantage for incumbents because incumbents usually outraise their \nchallengers most of the time. We just increased the advantage \nincumbents have by millions of dollars. Thank you very much. We should \npat ourselves on the back: Hey, this is good, and we were able to slide \nthis through. People don't know--they think we are reforming campaigns, \nand we are giving politicians enormous subsidies and acting as if it is \nreform, and being proud of it. We are going to slap everybody on the \nback about our great reform. We did a little nice thing to which nobody \npaid attention. Politicians, you get the lowest rate of anybody all \nyear long, and you get to use it the night before an election. That is \nour little gift to ourselves to which nobody paid attention. It is \nanother good reason, in my opinion, that this bill should be defeated.\n  I look at groups who are active in campaigns, and they will say: You \nare infringing on our ability to get our message out, to communicate, \nto run ads, to mention names, vote for, vote against. We are making it \nvery difficult, in some cases illegal, under this bill. It is wrong and \nunconstitutional. We also greatly increase subsidies for politicians. I \nthink that is absolutely shameful. We should not have done it, but we \ndid it.\n  While this bill may be an improvement over present law on the whole, \nit is unconstitutional and it includes an egregious subsidy for \npoliticians. It should be defeated, and I will vote no on this measure \nwhen we vote on Monday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/30/senate-section/article/S3227-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3227-S3230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is midway through Friday afternoon. We \nknow most Americans are heading home from a busy day working and \nproviding for their families. They may be looking forward over the \nweekend to some of the basketball championships that are going to be \nplayed on Saturday and again on Monday evening. They are looking \nforward to attending services on Sunday and then spending some time \nwith their families.\n  Then perhaps on Monday, when they go to work, they may hear on the \nradio or on television that the Senate is involved in what they broadly \nterm ``a resolution on the budget.'' By and large, many are going to \nwonder exactly what that means and what is its relationship to their \nlives. They are going to wonder, what is it going to mean to my \nchildren's education, what is it going to mean to my parents' \nprescription drugs, what is it going to mean as far as investing in \nhousing or in law enforcement, or any of the areas of national \npriority, or what is it going to mean in terms of the security of \nMedicare and Social Security? They are going to wonder about this.\n  I heard over the last several months the President of the United \nStates talk about the fact that he is going to urge the Congress to \npass a very sizable tax cut. He talks about $1.6 trillion tax cut. We \nknow the real figures are far in excess of that because they do not \ninclude other factors, as others have pointed out in earlier debates. \nSenator Conrad has done such a wonderful job not only in educating the \nMembers of the Senate but also in helping the American people \nunderstand what is at stake with the President's tax reductions and the \nreal economic impact it will have on the economic stability of our \nNation.\n  People are hearing our President say we can have a very sizable tax \ncut, and even with that tax cut, still be able to preserve Social \nSecurity and Medicare and fulfill the kinds of commitments that were \nmade in the course of the campaign on prescription drugs, on education, \non national security and defense.\n  Citizens will wonder when they hear others speak in the Senate, \nprincipally from this side, when the Democrats say we cannot afford it \nall. They are going to hear those voices and wonder how do we really \nput all of this into some perspective. They are hard working and this \ndoesn't make a great deal of sense. Maybe there is some sense that the \nbudget resolution will result in an outcome that perhaps, over the \ncourse of this week, citizens will think, if I pay careful attention I \nwill better understand.\n  There are two very obvious conflicting statements we are receiving. \nOne says we can afford the tax cuts. I think the American people are \nsomewhat skeptical of that. They should be.\n  I remember being here in 1981. I was one of 11 who voted against the \nReagan tax cut that had similar kinds of support. As a matter of fact, \nmany of those individuals who have been working on this current tax \nreduction are the same people who worked on President Reagan's tax \nreduction. At that time, we heard it all. It is the same record. I \nalmost believe it's the same speech.\n  I can hear it then: We can afford to have these major tax cuts. We \ncan afford that and still provide billions and tens of billions in \ndefense, and we are going to meet our national security, and we are \ngoing to be able to afford all of this and still see an expanding and \ngrowing economy.\n  Of course, that was not the case. We saw the direct result of those \ntax cuts when this country went into a deficit of $4.6 trillion. \nPeople's eyes kind of glaze over when we talk about those figures. For \nthe average family, it means they will pay several hundred dollars a \nyear more on their student loan programs because it will be higher \ninterest rates. They will pay several hundred dollars more on their car \npayments when buying a new car. They will spend several thousand \ndollars more, if fortunate enough, in purchasing a new home.\n  That is what happened with the Reagan tax cut. That is the hidden \ncost that every working family and middle-income family is paying for \nevery single year when we have those very sizable deficits. Those are \nthe facts.\n  I think they understand it. They understood over the period of the \nlast 8 years that we had the longest period of economic growth and \nprice stability. In my part of the country, in New England, in 1992, we \nwere close to 8 percent unemployment, and we were looking at the future \nwith a great sense of trepidation. There was reduction in types of \ndefense, the real estate market was flat. Many of the innovative and \ncreative computer companies had not worked out. We were wondering what \nthe future would hold.\n  Then we put in place an economic program, fiscal policy, monetary \npolicy, investment incentives for the private sector, investments in \npeople, and we saw economic progress.\n  We shouldn't lose track of the fact that the proposal of 1981 was \ncharacterized by our current President's father as being voodoo \neconomics. The American people were warned it was voodoo economics. \nThose are not my words, they were the characterization of President \nBush, father of our current President.\n  Now we have a very similar program. The American people are torn, \nwith all these surpluses they keep reading and hearing about, 80 \npercent of which are estimated to be coming 3\\1/2\\ to 4 years from now. \nWhat family would be betting their own kind of future on what may \nhappen 3\\1/2\\ years from now in terms of their income? But here we are \ntalking about the future of our nation with all of its implications in \nterms of the economic policy, with what that means, whether we will \nhave jobs, can you afford a home, or student loans. That is what we \ntalk about in terms of economic policy.\n\n[[Page S3228]]\n\n  We have to ask, as any family would, what does this really mean? We \nhave on the one hand a President who says we can have all of that tax \ncut and everything is going to be fine. We will be able to invest in \neducation, we can give you that prescription drug program. Don't worry, \nwe will be able to meet our national security even though it is a \nchanging time in national security. We will be able to meet the other \nkinds of requirements for our country. We can do all of this and \npreserve Social Security and Medicare, too.\n  Take a deep breath, Mr. Citizen. I think most Americans will say: \nYes, let's take a deep breath.\n  What does all that have to do with where we are today? This proposal \nnow that is being advanced by the same party, and in many ways, the \nsame leadership--not the President but in the Republican leadership \nthat we will have this next week--is supposedly the blueprint that \ngives the assurance to the American people that they are going to be \nable to afford the tax cut and also that they are going to have \nsufficient resources to do what this President and what the Republican \nParty have stated is their commitment to do in enhancing education, \nproviding a prescription drug program, and saving Social Security and \nMedicare. That blueprint is in what we call the budget. That makes \nsense. People ought to be able to understand that. If we are going to \nhave those very large surpluses and do everything else, we can draw one \nconclusion; if we are not, we ought to be somewhat more cautious about \nwhere we are going in terms of the sizable tax reduction.\n  I am for a tax reduction, one that is affordable and fair. But that \nisn't what we are talking about now. We are talking about an excessive \none that is unfair. Nonetheless, we are talking about a major tax \nreduction.\n  So it is fair for the American people to ask their representatives, \nas has been asked by a number of our colleagues today, and particularly \neffectively by my very good friend, the Senator from West Virginia who \nis presiding, where is the meat in this package? Where are we going to \nfind out what is in this proposal that should be on everybody's desk on \na Friday afternoon, when we will be starting debate on it on Monday; \nwhere is the budget that will say, OK, if we do the President's tax \nprogram, this is what the budget is going to be in every one of these \nprograms--in education, prescription drugs, and Medicare. Where is that \npiece of paper? Where is it?\n  It doesn't exist, Mr. President. Therefore, this kind of debate that \nwe are being asked to conduct by the Republican leaders is basically a \nsham. Do we understand? It is a sham. Why? Because we have no figures. \nWe have the general comments. We have been able to learn a figure here \nand a figure there, but we have the broadest kinds of figures. Being \nable to try and understand what is being talked about, we don't have \nit. We can't represent in the debate, which is supposed to be about the \nfuture of the economic condition of this country, the proposal of the \nPresident of the United States--a proposal of billions of dollars, a \ndocument that we are unable to have, which is going to give the \nassurance to the American people what we will be spending to educate \ntheir children, or what we will be providing to preserve Social \nSecurity or what we will be spending for a prescription drug program. \nIt doesn't exist. It doesn't exist. And, if it did exist, it would have \nbeen talked about and referenced by our good Republicans this afternoon \nwhen it was challenged by the Senator from West Virginia and a number \nof our colleagues. It does not exist, Mr. President, in spite of the \nrequests.\n\n  There is not a family who would follow these kinds of procedures. I \nmean if we were looking at an American family and a family budget, \ncould we say any family would say that all we care about is the cost of \na new car. We only have to care about that. We have sufficient money to \nbuy a new car. We do not know how we will provide for the other \nnecessities--education for our kids, payments on the house, food on the \ntable. But what we are going to do is, since we know we have the money \nhere to buy the car, that is what we are going to do.\n  That is what, effectively, is being done with this phony debate on \nthe budget. You are saying you have the downpayment on the tax cut. But \nyou are not saying what you are going to do about your children's \neducation. You are not saying what you are going to do about your \nchildren's health. You are not saying what you are going to do about \nfood. Those are the other elements. They do not exist. What family \nwould do that?\n  If there is not an American family who would do it, why should we? \nWhy should we? Why should we, as representatives of the American \nfamily, do it with the Federal budget? That is what we are asking.\n  Is there an American business that would say: We have the money to \nbuy the furniture. We have it right in our cash account. Let's go out \nand buy the furniture, even though we are going to have to do something \nin terms of new machinery, even though we are going to have to do \nsomething in terms of research in the future. We don't know what that \nis going to be, but let's go ahead and spend the money anyways. We \ndon't know, we can't tell you how much of that is going to be for \nresearch. We can't even tell you what the rent is going to be for our \nbusiness. We can't even tell you what advertising is going to be. But \nwe have that money for the furniture. Is there an American business \nthat would do that? No. There is not an American business that would do \nit. That is what we are being asked to do with this budget. That is why \nthis whole process is so badly flawed.\n  Members who are interested in preparing amendments are having \ndifficulty drafting the amendments because we don't know how they fit, \nthis is the core issue. The principal responsibilities that we have on \nbudgetary matters reflect the national priorities for this country. \nThat is what Members of Congress and the Senate are all about, when it \ncomes to budgetary matters: allocating resources on national \npriorities, that is what it is all about.\n  We have other responsibilities, as we have seen, trying to deal with \nthe proliferation of money in campaign financing, or we have other \nfunctions in terms of educating our constituents. We have other \nimportant responsibilities with regard to the judiciary. Yes. But when \nwe are talking about the finances, we are talking about the nation's \npriorities, and we are talking about allocating resources to reflect \nthe nation's priorities.\n  The fact is not that money in and of itself is going to solve our \nproblems. We know that is not the case too often. But it is a \nreflection of what our national priorities are if we allocate \nresources. If we, for example, fully fund the IDEA, the program to help \nlocal communities educate disabled children, which is being funded now \nat 17 percent--many of us believe that ought to be up to the 40 percent \nwhich we represented. We didn't guarantee it to the States, but we \nrepresented was going to be our best effort to try to provide the \nresources to do that. We really made a commitment to the States --more \nimportant, to the families--that we were going to do that. And we have \nleft them short.\n\n  Is there anyone here this afternoon, anyone left of our Republican \ncolleagues, who will be able to tell us what is going to be in that \nbudget for the IDEA over the next 5 years? How about over the length of \nthis tax cut? That would be pretty interesting, wouldn't it? So \nfamilies could say: Do we really want to have that much of a tax break, \nor should we save some of those resources to make sure we are going to \nprovide help and assistance to local communities, local school \ndistricts, to provide some relief when they have a particular need with \na child who has developmental disabilities, through no fault of their \nown, and because of those needs and a community's attempt to provide \nfor and mainstream these children?\n  Mr. President, 15 years ago, over 4.5 million of them were tucked \naway in closets. Now they are out in the schools. We are trying to meet \nthose needs. We don't know what all those needs are going to be. We \ncannot say. In some areas, they may have very severe kinds of \nchallenges and have scarce resources, and in other communities they may \nhave fewer challenges and lots of resources. We are trying to see if we \ncannot provide some minimum to help. Isn't that more important than the \ntax cut?\n  Where in the document is it, how much we are going to expend to help\n\n[[Page S3229]]\n\nand assist those parents? Where is it? Someone show us, someone show \nnot just Members of the Senate but someone explain it to the people of \nMassachusetts who think they have a Senator who ought to know that, \njust like every other State expects their Senators to know it.\n  But, no, no, we are not going to do that. No, we are not going to. \nOne, we either do not have it, or if we have it, we are not going to \ngive it to you--no. No.\n  What was the request that was made? What was the request that was \nmade on our side of the aisle by those who are part of the Budget \nCommittee and our Democratic leadership and our representatives on \nAppropriations, the committees that are going to have important \nresponsibilities on this? Why don't we just wait, wait for just another \nweek, wait for just another 2 weeks or another 3 weeks until we get \nthat budget so the American people will understand and have a full \npicture of what is going out and what we are going to commit ourselves \nto and what is going to be left there for tax relief, tax reduction.\n  What is the answer to that? What is the reason they refuse to do so?\n  None of us want to be making judgments in terms of motivations. But \nit seems to me, if I was on the other side and believed deeply that \nthis tax reduction of a monumental and growing size--not just as stated \nby the Senator from Massachusetts, but every publication says it who \nhas been over there, watching the Ways and Means Committee. If they \nbelieved in it, they ought to be able to justify it and come out on the \nfloor of the Senate and justify why they believe that is a fair \nprogram, and why providing X amount of money is sufficient for the \nIDEA. They ought to be able to come out here. We ought to be able to \ndebate it.\n  Will that debate take place? No. No. Why not? If they believed in the \nprogram as much as they indicated in their speeches, you would think \nthey would relish that opportunity. Let's educate the American people. \nLet's take it to the American people and convince them we have the \nright on our side.\n\n  But, no, they are not willing to do that. They are not willing to do \nit. Instead, we are left completely in the dark, which is not just a \ndisservice to any single Member of the Senate, but is just an \nabsolutely contemptible attitude to the people we represent, a \ncontemptible, arrogant attitude--contemptible, arrogant attitude to the \npeople we represent.\n  Fairness--supposedly. We are supposed to have a new mood in \nWashington. We are going to change the rhetoric in Washington. We are \ngoing to change the whole parameters of debate and discussion in \nWashington. It is going to be a new time.\n  This is the worst of the old times. As a member of the Senate, I \ncannot think back to a time that there has been a conscious attempt to \nkeep the Members of this body in the dark on a major kind of policy \nissue that affects the nation's future in such a basic and tangible \nway, not a single incident. Maybe it comes to others, maybe it will \ncome to others, but it certainly did not to me.\n  This is something. I can see people saying: Why are people getting \nall worked up about this on Friday afternoon?\n  Why didn't we know this earlier? We didn't know this earlier because \nwe didn't know that was going to be the posture and the position of the \nRepublican leadership earlier. We at least thought we might have the \nopportunity for just a few days to go through and examine it. But no. \nWe are denied that. That has only become more certain and definite in \nthe most recent hours.\n  The American people ought to be very wary of what will be happening \nin this Senate with this debate next week because we are basically \nfailing to meet our responsibilities to them in an extraordinary and \nimportant way. Let me give a very brief concrete example of what I am \ntalking about.\n  As we have seen, there have been bits and pieces of the budget which \nhave been put out. The President has indicated that his budget for \nprescription drugs will be $153 billion. We have that figure. If the \nCongressional Budget Office, joint task, and OMB had taken what the \nPresident guaranteed in the Presidential campaign, that would be $220 \nbillion. This is $153 billion. With the $220 billion, they were only \ngoing to get to less than a third of all the seniors. What are we going \nto expect with this lesser figure?\n  Let me go on to give some concrete examples with the limited \ninformation that we have.\n  The Congressional Budget Office reports that to maintain current \nGovernment services--that is effectively to maintain those services \nthat are in effect today--for discretionary spending primarily in \neducation, NIH--it doesn't include Social Security or Medicare--but \nlet's take basic education programs; there would be the prescription \ndrug program--it reports that to maintain those Government services, in \nthe year 2002 it would cost $665 billion. But the administration \nproposes only $660.7 billion, which falls short $4.3 billion of the \nCBO's current services figure.\n  In addition, the administration's discretionary budget includes $5.6 \nbillion in emergency reserve and $12 billion in new defense spending. \nAs a result, under the Bush budget, spending on all the nondefense \ndiscretionary programs would actually decrease by an average of 4 \npercent next year, or $13 billion.\n  Cuts to individual programs will substantially exceed the 34 percent \nnext year because President Bush finds the dollars to fund proposed \nincreases for some programs--education, NIH, and community health \ncenters--by cutting other existing programs.\n  Accounting for these proposed discretionary increases means that the \nadministration proposes a 7 percent average cut to unprotected \nnondefense discretionary programs next year.\n  What does that mean? Seven percent means: 12 million fewer meals \ndelivered to ill and disabled seniors; 550,000 fewer babies receiving \nnutritional supplements; 300,000 fewer families assisted with heating \ncosts under LIHEAP, with all of the problems we have had not only in \nthe Northeast, Midwest, and the far West; LIHEAP also helps in the \nSouth as well; 300,000 fewer families will be assisted under LIHEAP; \n45,000 fewer job opportunities for youth at a time when we need greater \nskills for young people in order to be a part of the job market.\n  When I entered the Senate, you worked down at the Quincy Shipyard. \nYour father and grandfather worked there. You had a high school \ndiploma, a small house, and 3 or 4 weeks off in the summertime. You had \na pretty good life at that time. Now everyone who enters the job market \nhas eight jobs. And young people have to have continuing training and \neducation to make sure they have the skills in order to be able to \ncompete. And with close to 400,000 of them dropping out of high school \nevery year, we are cutting back on training and job opportunities for \nyouth; 45,000 fewer people treated for mental illness and substance \nabuse at a time when we are facing, for example, the kinds of \nchallenges we have seen in our high schools in recent times.\n\n  Sure, it is a complex problem and a complex issue. But all you have \nto do is read that most recent report put out by the Mental Health \nInstitute, and look at the number of troubled young girls in their \nteens and the challenges they are facing with the explosion that is \ntaking place with their needs; the increasing numbers of suicides by \nteenagers in our society; the challenges of mental health.\n  In my own city of Boston, a third of the children who go to school \nevery day come home where there is physical and substance abuse or \nviolence in terms of guns. And they are dropped in the schools. We are \ntrying to provide some help and assistance to them. We don't do a very \ngood job. We have eight behavioral professionals in our Boston school \nsystem. They are new and are very good, but eight is not enough. Talk \nto our superintendent who is making a real difference trying to reach \nout to these children who are facing some extraordinary pressures.\n  Just in this current proposal that we know about, there will be \n45,000 fewer people receiving help for mental illness; 30,000 fewer \nhomes prepared for low-income families.\n  Tell that to most of the urban areas.\n  We see in my part of the country the need for help and assistance on \nhome ownership; 25,000 fewer children immunized; 10,000 fewer National \nScience Foundation researchers, educators, and\n\n[[Page S3230]]\n\nstudents; 3,000 fewer Federal law enforcement officials; 1,500 fewer \nair traffic controllers; 30 fewer toxic waste sites cleaned.\n  That is just a brief snapshot of a number of programs that are \ntargeted to youth or children, or in terms of some of the services that \npeople are expecting that could be reduced or cut under that budget \nproposal. That is one of the figures that we have.\n  Because President Bush's budget fails to specify what he would cut, \nit is impossible to determine which programs would be cut less deeply \nand which would be cut more severely than this. For each program held \nharmless, the cuts in remaining programs will exceed 7 percent by that \nmuch more.\n  Are we entitled to know the whole range? Isn't it only responsible, \nthough, that we are able to say, well, we are willing to accept that, \nor how many hundreds of billions of dollars in terms of tax? Shouldn't \nthat be the nature of the debate? Why do we have to scrounge around and \ntry to get these kinds of figures that are being kept away from us? \nThey are not in any document here. These are the extrapolations based \non the Congressional Budget Office of programs in our particular \ncommittee jurisdiction, for the most part. And we see what the impact \nwould be. Should or shouldn't we have that debate, whether it is in \nthese areas here or the whole range of different areas of need we have \nseen in recent times in the areas of education?\n\n  I will just take a few more minutes, Mr. President, to look again at \nthe Federal share of education funding. Referring to this chart, \nfunding for early and secondary education has declined since 1980 from \n11.9 percent to 8.3 percent in the year 2000. Higher education has seen \nthese reductions. We are going down in terms of the participation. \nAgain, it isn't just money solving all the problems, but there has been \na partnership among the Federal, State, and local communities, and our \nprimary responsibility is for those children who are economically \ndisadvantaged.\n  We said in the early 1960s that for children who were particularly \neconomically disadvantaged, we ought to, as a nation, help local \ncommunities. That is basically the Federal involvement in terms of \nhelping local communities. That was what we accepted as part of a \nnational commitment, that we were going to try to provide some help and \nassistance. And we have seen that go down.\n  Yet what is happening on the other side of this? We see that in the \nyear 2000 we have 53 million children going to school, and the total \nnumber of children going to school is going to effectively double in \nfuture years. The number of children who are going to school will \ndouble. Are we going to have this kind of a debate on the budget in \nrelation to that?\n  This chart shows the flow lines, with the growth to 94 million \nchildren going to school as compared to the 53 million children going \nto school in 2000.\n  Shouldn't we, if we are going to at least begin to recognize that \nthere is this partnership, say that in those outyears perhaps we ought \nto--if we are going to have those surpluses; and certainly no one can \nguarantee it--look at not just what the needs are today, but we ought \nto be looking down the road in terms of what we are going to do in \nterms of a national priority?\n  The chart I was just showing was in relation to elementary and \nsecondary education. What we see with this chart is the corresponding \nescalation in terms of the total number of children who are going to \nhigher education. That is enormously important in terms of acquiring \ndifferent kinds of skills so that they are going to be able to be \nimportant players in a modern economy. Everyone has understood that for \nthe longest period of time.\n  We ought to have that debate--whether this budget that we should have \nnext week is going to take into consideration the long-range interests, \nnot just the problem that we have $130 billion of needs currently in \nterms of bringing our elementary and secondary schools up to par, in \nterms of safety and security, and in terms of their ventilation and \nelectronics so that they will be able to have the modern computers. \nThat is $130 billion and is not even talking about current needs but \nabout future needs.\n  Shouldn't we have that out here alongside of what is going to be \nallocated and expended in terms of this tax cut? But, oh, no, we can't \nhave that. We can't have that. We can't wait 2 weeks. We can't wait 2 \nweeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, to be able to get that information out so we \ncan have that informed debate. No, we are not going to do that.\n  So I join those who have expressed their concern about this process. \nI had a good opportunity of listening, with great interest, to my \nfriend and colleague from West Virginia this afternoon back in my \noffice. I hope other Members listened to his excellent presentation in \noutlining the challenges of this moment because he brings to this \ndebate and discussion not only the sweep of history with his own \nextraordinary career in public service, but he brings to it, in \naddition, the most exhaustive understanding and awareness in the \nhistory of this institution and its development, and even more than all \nof that--on top of that, his own experience and his understanding of \nthe history--is his love of the institution and his deep commitment to \nit.\n  So, Mr. President, when he warns about the real implications for this \ninstitution as a servant of the people, it needs to be a warning that \nis well heeded. And it is not being well heeded. If we are to move \nahead the way it has been outlined that we will by the majority leader \nand the Republican leadership, at the end of next week this will be a \nlesser institution in terms of representing the people of this country, \nand that I hope to be able to avoid.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Massachusetts withhold \nhis suggestion?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withhold, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair thanks the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/30/senate-section/article/S3230-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECESS UNTIL MONDAY, APRIL 2, 2001, AT 5 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
