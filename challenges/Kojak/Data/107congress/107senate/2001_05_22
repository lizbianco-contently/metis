The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 724\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment would repeal the Medicaid \nEstate Recovery Program, the real ``death tax'' for many elderly \nAmericans.\n  When nursing home bills force a person onto Medicaid, the Medicaid \nEstate Recovery Program allows the government to put a lien on the \nfamily house and, upon the death of the spouse, recover the amount that \nMedicaid spent on nursing care.\n  This Medicaid death tax does not affect the wealthy. In order to \nqualify for Medicaid, a person has to pay down assets, and the spouse \ncan only keep so much under the spousal impoverishment provisions. But \nthe Medicaid death tax effectively imposes a 100 percent estate tax on \nthese vulnerable Americans.\n  My amendment would repeal this Medicaid death tax. It offsets the \ncost by shaving back ever so slightly the reductions in the estate tax \nrates for the very largest estates.\n  I urge colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the amendment by my good \nfriend from Wisconsin. Medicaid spend-down is a large problem. All who \nhave studied this know it needs to be dealt with. This amendment was \noffered in committee and defeated in committee. It is not germane to \nthis bill. This is a tax bill, not a Medicaid bill. I urge Senators not \nto support it.\n  The pending amendment is not germane. Therefore, I raise a point of \norder that the amendment violates section 305(b)(2) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget \nAct, I move to waive the applicable sections of the act for \nconsideration of my amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, this amendment is about fairness.\n  The bill before us is tilted heavily toward high-income taxpayers. \nThe highest-income 1 percent of taxpayers would receive 35 percent of \nthe benefits, while the majority of taxpayers in the bottom three-\nfifths of the population would get only a little more than 15 percent \nof the bill's benefits.\n  My amendment would strike the cut in the top tax rate, and use the \nsavings to increase the amount of income covered by the 10 percent \nincome tax bracket. It would thus reduce the already large benefits to \nthat less than 1 percent of the population with incomes of more than \n$297,000, and use the savings to give tax cuts to all income taxpayers.\n  This amendment would restore a modicum of fairness to this bill, and \nI urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Feingold amendment goes directly \nagainst one of the key pillars of this bipartisan tax bill now before \nthe Senate.\n  This amendment rejects the principle that we should have rate \nreductions in all marginal rates and do it at all levels. I strongly \nurge my colleagues to vote against the amendment that goes against the \nbipartisan agreement.\n  In addition, we have higher marginal tax rates for businesses of the \nself-employed at 39 percent then for corporations at 35 percent. We \nbelieve there ought to be a closer relationship between the two.\n  Lastly, I plead with my colleagues, how many times do we have to vote \non the same amendment--time after time after time--just offered in a \nlittle different way but by different Members? We have worked hard to \nput together a bipartisan budget agreement, and we also wanted to bring \nsome civility to the process. What we did last night detracts from \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n725.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 725 by the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The next vote is on Feingold amendment No. \n726.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. What is the number of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is No. 726, Feingold amendment \nNo. 726.\n  The Senate will come to order. Senators will take their conversations \noff the floor to the Cloakroom.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the estate tax provisions are a major \nsource of the unfairness in this bill. But even within the estate tax \nprovisions themselves, this bill tilts to the very wealthiest.\n  The bill would increase the unified credit exemption up to $4 million \na person, or $8 million a couple. This change alone will exempt all but \nthe very wealthiest.\n  But the bill would also reduce the rate of taxation that the few \nextremely wealthy families who still have to pay the estate tax would \npay. It thus focuses tax cuts on the very pinnacle of wealth.\n  My motion would spread the estate tax relief in this bill more \nbroadly. My motion would recommit the bill to committee to strike all \nthe estate tax rate reductions in the bill and use the savings to \nexpand the amounts of the estate tax unified credit exemption amounts.\n  Thus under my amendment, more relatively smaller estates would be \nexempted from taxation altogether. This would allow the unified credit \nto increase to $5 million, or $10 million a couple.\n  I urge colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will clarify. This is a motion to \nrecommit, not a vote on an amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think we need a clarification. The Chair told me it \nwas amendment No. 726. I want to know what we are voting on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is a motion to recommit.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Is it still his amendment No. 726?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. It is a motion to recommit the bill to the \nFinance Committee.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, No. 726 is next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This is a motion to recommit the bill to the \nFinance Committee.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to have the motion read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, moves to commit \n     the bill to the Committee on Finance with instructions that \n     the committee report back within 3 days changes that would \n     strike all the estate tax rate reductions in the bill and use \n     the savings to expand the amounts of the estate tax unified \n     credit exemption amounts.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, our bipartisan bill before us uses the \nentire $145 billion to fund the increases in the unified credit. We \nhave $1 million, $2 million, $3 million, all by the year 2005, and that \nis where Senator Feingold's money went. We still found more for a $4 \nmillion credit by the year 2009.\n  This action undoes a very carefully crafted bipartisan effort by \nSenator Lincoln, Senator Kyl, Senator Baucus, and myself. I see this as \none other effort--amendment after amendment--trying to destroy \nparticularly the most easily crafted part of this bill, one mostly \nagreed to, by Senator Lincoln and Senator Kyl. I hope we can get away \nfrom these efforts to destroy this bipartisan compromise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to recommit.

The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my next amendment eliminates the estate \ntax repeal for estates larger than $100 million and uses the savings to \ngive tax cuts to all income-tax payers. Last year, the Treasury \nDepartment said for 1998, 35 estates amounted to more than $100 \nmillion. Thirty-one of those estates paid $1.4 billion in taxes or 7 \npercent of all estate taxes. Repealing the estate tax for those estates \nwould have given those estates a tax cut averaging $45 million each.\n  My amendment by contrast would preserve the estate tax for these very \nwealthy estates and apply the savings to an across-the- board tax cut \nfor all taxpayers by expanding the amount of income subject to the 10-\npercent tax bracket. Too often the choices we have to weigh here are \nheartbreakingly difficult. This is not one of those cases.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, all who have been voting to change the \nestate tax provisions, listen to what is wrong with his amendment. \nEvery one of you who wants to tax people in the estates that we believe \nshould not be taxed will vote against his amendment. His amendment \nseems too good to be true. It is too good to be true. It strikes repeal \nand adds a $100 million unified credit. That ought to be enticing to \nanybody, even anybody who is a Republican.\n  But remember, in our bill, when the estate tax is done away with, the \ncapital gains tax is applied to gains above a very low extended-up \nbasis for everybody. This bill before the Senate allows an extended-up \nbasis to $100 million. There would be no capital gains applied to any \nof the growth. So you are ignoring a principle that we want all money \nto be taxed at least once, by capital gains or by income tax.\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\n  I ask that Members not let $100 million of growth in an estate not be \nallowed to be taxed at least once.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                CELEBRATING WITH SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it was approximately 42 years ago that \nour colleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia, cast his first \nvote. It was in January of 1959. He has cast votes consistently, \nvirtually without missing a vote, for now more than four decades. \nRobert C. Byrd just cast his 16,000th vote. I congratulate our senior \ncolleague from West Virginia.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. President, I also note it is a week from today that he will be \ncelebrating his 64th wedding anniversary as well, so there is much to \ncelebrate. But we congratulate Senator Byrd, we congratulate Senator \nand Mrs. Byrd on their anniversary a week from today, and we thank him \nfor his great service to America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 727\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n727 offered on behalf of the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator Harkin asked me if we could pass \nover his amendment temporarily and go on to another amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 711\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n711 offered by Senator Lincoln.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, if we are truly serious about not \nleaving any child behind, this amendment is essential. The amendment I \nam offering strikes the provision within the education savings accounts \nlanguage that covers only the tuition, fees, room and board expenses \nfor K-12 by still permitting the ESA tax savings for other educational-\nrelated expenses for all students including K-12. This amendment will \ncreate a level playing field by providing the same tax benefits to all \nparents regardless of where they send their children to school.\n  Under my amendment, all parents will be able to take advantage of ESA \naccounts for K-12-related expenses to buy computers, uniforms, other \nitems--afterschool programs for their children--to use to supplement or \nfurther their education. It treats all parents equally.\n  Using ESA accounts for private school tuition is simply vouchers by \nanother name. While I strongly believe in a parent's right to choose a \npublic school education or private school education for their children, \nI am concerned that providing a tax incentive to pay private school \ntuition will divert the critical resources needed to improve our public \nschools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Hutchinson.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, the amendment by my colleague from \nArkansas tears the very heart out of the Coverdell ESA that previously \npassed this Chamber by large bipartisan majorities. This is by no means \nvouchers, by any stretch of the imagination. These are education IRAs, \nand the rights of parents should be preserved to have the maximum \nflexibility in their use. In fact, studies indicate that 75 percent of \nthe parents who have used these ESAs have their children in public \nschools.\n  It harms the bipartisan nature of the chairman's mark, the agreement \nthat was reached on education savings accounts, and to prohibit the use \nof ESA moneys for tuition and fees or room and board as proposed by the \nSenator from Arkansas would mean that the ESAs could only finance \ntutoring, enrichment courses, and postsecondary education costs. It \nwould, in Arkansas, eliminate 26,645 children and their parents from \nparticipation in the use of these education savings accounts.\n  This is a bipartisan measure. It has been agreed upon. It is not \nvouchers by any stretch. I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The amendment is now pending under the \nprevious agreement.\n  The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, everyone in this body stated their \ncommitment to keeping Social Security and Medicare solvent. What this \namendment does is it says we are going to stick to that commitment \nbefore we put in place certain tax policy changes.\n  This amendment is very simple and straightforward. It simply delays--\ndoes not do away with--the implementation of the cut in the top rate \nfor the wealthiest of Americans until we have\n\n[[Page S5409]]\n\npassed, and the President has signed, legislation that OMB certifies \nwill assure the long-term solvency of both Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  The bill before us sets us back in our effort to ensure Social \nSecurity and Medicare solvency. In order to pay for these tax cuts, \nwhich go disproportionately to the wealthy few, and then also to meet \nour basic needs such as health care and law enforcement, in future \nyears Social Security and Medicare would be raided. This is \nunacceptable. We need to strengthen these programs as we prepare the \nbaby boomers to retire and not raid them to give tax breaks to a very \nwealthy few.\n  Again, this amendment simply says we delay the cut in the top rate \nuntil we secure Social Security and Medicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think we went through similar debate \nand a vote yesterday on an approach by the senior Senator from West \nVirginia. So here we are again.\n  In March, we heard from people on the other side of the aisle that we \nneed an economic stimulus immediately. And now we see an amendment--and \nit isn't just this amendment; it is amendment after amendment--seeking \nto delay the tax reduction.\n  This is another attempt to delay a tax cut until other programs are \npassed. We are working on making sure that Social Security and Medicare \nare solvent. Our budget agreement of 2 weeks ago speaks to that. And \nthat does not mean we cannot provide tax relief for American taxpayers, \nand do it right now.\n  I strongly urge the defeat of the amendment.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is not germane to the provisions of the \nreconciliation bill before us. I raise a point of order against the \namendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the point of order and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, all of us know that in this bill there is \nan alternative minimum tax problem. What my amendment seeks to do is \naddress that problem to the best of our ability by providing an \nexemption to all taxpayers at the income level of $100,000 or less from \nbeing put into the alternative minimum tax.\n  Today, there are 1.3 million Americans in the alternative minimum tax \nwho paid it last year. Because of this bill and the lack of indexing \nfor inflation, the result will be that almost 17 million Americans will \npay about $40 billion by the year 2010 as a consequence of being pushed \ninto a new bracket.\n  So we are telling people they are going to get a tax cut, but in \neffect they are not because there is a serious alternative minimum tax \nproblem. I ask colleagues to help make it a fair tax bill for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. \nEvery Member of this Congress knows that we ought to do more about the \nalternative minimum tax than we do in this bill, or that is possible to \ndo at all. It is a major problem that needs to be addressed. We have \nmade good steps to address it by having the child credit be credited \npermanently against the AMT and, secondly, by increasing the AMT \nexemption to $2,000 for singles and $4,000 for joint returns.\n  These are good steps that will mean millions of Americans will not be \nsubject to the AMT. These efforts in the bill go far to address the \nconcerns raised in this amendment--specifically, that those making less \nthan $100,000 should not be subject to the AMT. I think we have \nachieved a good balance in this bill on the AMT with other priorities, \nand this amendment would upset this balance and this bipartisan bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next amendment is the Lieberman amendment \nNo. 693.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to make a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is for the information of all of my \ncolleagues. A number of Senators, obviously, will want to take a break \nfor a quick lunch. I ask unanimous consent that we continue to vote \nanother time or two until we approach 1 o'clock and then recess for 30 \nminutes until 1:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, also, as a matter of procedure, we are \ngetting down to five or six amendments. I hope the minority whip or \nsomebody on that side has a list of amendments that may be proposed but \nhave not been seen on this side. I ask if we can have that shared with \nus so we can get a better idea of what we have left to do.\n  Quite frankly, for Senator Baucus and me, it is a little difficult to \nmanage all these amendments when we do not know what they are or when \nthey are coming up. I would also like to pursue an agreement to \nfinalize a list so we can get our work done.\n  I wonder if somebody on the other side of the aisle can help us with \nthat?\n  In that regard I know there are people who think this bill came up \ntoo soon after it came out of committee, but the leader was asking me \nTuesday night to bring this up Wednesday, after we voted it out of \ncommittee. I thought that was too soon. Senator Baucus said he did not \nwant to bring it up that early. I just took it upon myself to say I \nwould not file the papers until it came up on Thursday so we would have \nan opportunity for people to have access to the language of the bill to \nwrite amendments.\n\n  I hope we will have the courtesy, then, of seeing the amendments that \nmight come up and know how many there are. I see the distinguished \nDemocratic whip, and I wonder if he can respond to my request. My \nrequest is, if there is a list of amendments, could we have that list \nof amendments so we know what our work is going to be.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Iowa, who has worked \nso hard on this legislation, that we have a general idea of amendments, \nand we have been working this morning. I have a list of them in my \npocket. We have quite a few. With the time we are going to have between \n1 p.m. and 1:30 p.m., we will be able to have a more definitive list. \nMaybe even at 1 o'clock we can come up with--it will not be a complete \nlist--a list so Senator Grassley can have an idea of who is offering \namendments and the subject matter of the amendments. We will work on \nthat.\n  Was that the question the Senator asked?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. I appreciate very much what the Senator said. I \nhope we can have such a list. We need to proceed in the bipartisan \nspirit under which Senator Baucus and I have been working and try to \nbring this bill to finality.\n  We have been able to defeat most amendments that have come before us. \nWe know what this bill is going to look like for final passage and that \nwe ought to get to final passage.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 693\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the Lieberman amendment? \nThe Chair recognizes the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I call up amendment \nNo. 693 and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending amendment. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, this amendment aims \nat dealing with the current uncertainty in our economy and, in fact, \nobviously the intention of the Members of the Senate during debate on \nthe budget resolution last month where, on a bipartisan basis, we \nadopted a stimulus package that was fair, fast, and fiscally \nresponsible.\n  Unfortunately, the so-called stimulus plan in this bill that came out \nof the Finance Committee is not fair, fast, or fiscally responsible.\n  Simply put, the stimulus package in this plan will be hundreds of \ndays late and hundreds of millions of dollars short of what America's \nfamilies need, and that is a real economic stimulus now. The Federal \nReserve recognized that again a few days ago in lowering interest \nrates.\n  That is why we have to do this in Congress. That is why this \namendment will replace the semistimulus that is in the tax bill. It \nwill offer cash, $300 to every American taxpayer, payroll and income \ntax. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, common sense tells me we cannot have it \nboth ways, on the one hand telling the country we need an immediate tax \ncut stimulus and on the other hand vote after vote delaying this bill.\n  To pay for these checks, the Joint Tax Committee estimates the \nSecretary of Treasury will have to increase taxes on small business \nowners by about $24 billion.\n  This amendment is also unconstitutional from the standpoint that \narticle I, section 7, gives Congress the taxing powers, not the \nSecretary of Treasury.\n  If we can pass this bill today, I believe we could be on our way to \nputting more cash in families' hands by July 1 with the changes in W-2s \nthat will result with the 10-percent rate going into effect January 1 \nthis year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 693. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. My amendment is now pending, and in order to try to in \nsome small way expedite getting on with the business of the American \npeople, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, this motion would recommit H.R. 1836 to \nthe Finance Committee and direct the committee to report back promptly \nwith an amendment that eliminates any income tax cut for those earning\n\n[[Page S5411]]\n\nmore than $500,000 a year, and uses the savings--approximately $24 \nbillion a year, once fully effective, to establish a tax credit to help \nfamilies afford the costs of long-term care.\n  Over 12 million senior and disabled Americans need long-term care \ntoday. That number will double over the next 10 years.\n  I believe that no one should have to spend down to Medicaid to afford \nlong-term care, and no family should bear the burden alone.\n  A tax credit, as I propose, would provide much-needed relief to the \nfamilies who provide long-term care for their loved ones, and is surely \na better and fairer use of the surplus.\n  This is not about class warfare. This is about providing relief for \nour elderly and for the overburdened families who care for them. I \nthank Senators Grassley, Graham and Bayh for their leadership on this \nissue, and I hope my colleagues will agree that we should not provide a \nwindfall for those earning more than half a million dollars a year, \nwhile ignoring the needs of so many families and the loved-one they \nstruggle to care for.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank Senator Corzine for recognizing some of our \nwork regarding long-term health care financing challenges. However, in \naddition to this amendment, we have had others that don't seem to \nrecognize the Senate Finance Committee's function. We have held \nhearings on this very subject.\n  As I said, I am very committed to working at finding solutions to \nlong-term financing challenges. In fact, I have introduced such a bill \nwith Senator Graham of Florida. The impending retirement of baby boom \ngenerations presents a great incentive to act soon.\n  What this motion doesn't recognize is that we do taxes one time and \nwe will do long-term health care another time. We can do both. This \nbill is not the appropriate vehicle. This amendment will delay the tax \nreduction for working families.\n  I hope we can defeat this motion. I see it as a continuing effort to \nkill the bill.\n  I raise a point of germaneness. The amendment is not germane to the \nprovisions of the reconciliation measure. I therefore raise a point of \norder against the amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I move to waive the Budget Act for consideration of the \nmotion. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this amendment is about fairness and \nsimplification. Under the bill before us, the very wealthiest taxpayers \nget the biggest percentage point reduction in their marginal rates, but \nthe vast majority of taxpayers, the 70 million, who represent 70 \npercent of the taxpayers in this country, get no rate reduction.\n  This chart I show you tells the story. The 15-percent rate, which is \nwhere the vast majority of American taxpayers are, get no rate \nreduction. Those at the very top get the biggest rate reduction.\n  My amendment reduces the unfairness. It reduces the size of the tax \ncut for the top 3 percent of income earners. Specifically, my amendment \nleaves in place the first percentage point reduction for the top two \ntax rates but cancels the next two scheduled reductions, and it uses \nthe savings from this change to increase the standard deduction by \n$1,500 for singles; for couples the standard deduction will be \nincreased by twice this amount, or a full $3,000 when fully phased in.\n  This amendment is about fairness and simplification. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, not only is this amendment a bad\n\n[[Page S5412]]\n\namendment but the information just given out is erroneous. It is wrong. \nIt is bad.\n  Every taxpayer who pays income tax gets a marginal rate tax cut under \nthis bill. Let's make that clear. Every taxpayer gets a tax reduction.\n  I do not know how many amendments we have had on this bill to kill \nthe marginal rate tax reductions we have. We have had a flood of \namendments from the other party. Not one amendment from the other party \nhas been adopted yet. And I have to wonder, what has happened to \nbipartisanship? Is bipartisanship dead and buried, when just 5 months \nago we talked so much about it? If so, I and Senator Baucus have not \nbeen invited to the funeral. I urge the defeat of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, they have not.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n744 offered by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, this amendment is about fairness and \nsimplification. If we look at the bill before us, it gives the biggest \nrate reduction to the highest income-tax payers of all.\n  Only seven-tenths of 1 percent of the taxpayers are in the 39.6-\npercent bracket, but they get 20 percent more rate reduction than the \n36-percent bracket, than the 31-percent bracket, than the 28-percent \nbracket. And in the 15-percent bracket, where the vast majority of \ntaxpayers are in this country, 70 percent of the taxpayers get no rate \nrelief--none.\n  My amendment simply takes the additional rate relief that the very \nwealthiest receive, the additional six-tenths of 1 percent--that is 20 \npercent more than the other brackets--and shifts it to the lowest 70 \npercent of the tax filers in this country. It says: Let's give fairness \nwhen we are giving tax relief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote against \nthe amendment. I am going to offer the rest of my time to the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I think we have been through some very \nexcellent debate and discussion and votes. I urge all my colleagues to \nrecognize it is now time for us to move on. We can vote well into the \nnight or tomorrow or into the weekend, but I think we all recognize \nthat with a sufficient number of votes now, the issues are pretty well \ndecided. I hope we can bring this issue to closure and get back to the \neducation bill.\n  We have fought a good fight here, those of us who have some differing \nviews or different positions, but it is time to move on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question now is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 747, the Carper amendment. The Chair advises the Senator from \nDelaware that there are 2 minutes equally divided on his amendment.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this bipartisan alternative reduces taxes by $1.2 \ntrillion over the next 10 years while making available $150 billion for \nunderfunded education proposals that work.\n  Our measure provides for modest reductions in each of the marginal \ntax rates while establishing retroactively a new 10-percent bracket.\n  This amendment provides for estate tax relief but not for its \nelimination.\n  We double the child credit and make it partially refundable.\n  Unlike the committee bill, our proposal makes permanent the R \ncredit.\n  We extend popular expiring tax breaks and speed up marriage penalty \nrelief.\n  We provide greater AMT protection and fund a number of energy \nproduction and conservation incentives now, not later.\n  I thank Senator Chafee for joining me in offering this comprehensive \nalternative. I yield to him.\n\n[[Page S5413]]\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, can we have a copy of the amendment, \nplease. We do not have a copy of the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment, I say to my friend from \nKentucky, was filed last night. It has been on file since sometime \nyesterday evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an amendment at the desk.\n  The remainder of the time has been yielded to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Chafee.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the central tenet of this bill is reducing \nthe tax cut down to $1.2 trillion. We would devote the other $150 \nbillion towards educational initiatives.\n  How many of us have heard from our constituents about the high cost \nof the property taxes? The main contribution to these high property \ntaxes is the cost of special education, and that is a Federal mandate.\n  Let us right now reduce the tax cut and put it towards IDEA and \nproperty tax relief.\n  I urge adoption of the Carper-Chafee property tax relief amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Delaware for \nhis substitute amendment and urge my colleagues to support it. While in \nmy view both the underlying bill and the substitute cut taxes more \ndeeply than this nation can afford, the Carper substitute is far \npreferable to the underlying bill. It is simply fairer than the \nunderlying bill. It provides a marginal rate cut for the 72 million \nmiddle class taxpayers who were skipped over in the underlying bill. It \nincludes immediate marriage penalty relief and permanent deductibility \nof college tuition. And so, although I would not support enacting a tax \ncut of $1.25 trillion, Senator Carper's amendment deserves our support \nbecause it illustrates a far better and more balanced approach to tax \nand budget policy.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against \nthis amendment. This is another effort to cut our marginal tax rate \ncuts by $150 billion. I defer to the Senator from Oregon for further \ncomment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, we have had many votes taken on \nthe issue of the tax bill. We know how people are going to vote. We \nknow the outcome. It is time to vote on this tax cut so we can get to \neducation and deal with some of the issues Senators have identified.\n  For the sake of the American people, it is time to vote.\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the amendment is not germane to the \nprovisions of the reconciliation bill. I, therefore, raise a point of \norder against the amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I move to waive the relevant section of \nthe Congressional Budget Act for consideration of this amendment. I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

The point of order is sustained, and the \namendment falls.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask to speak for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think we have a copy of the next amendment, so I am \nnot speaking about the next amendment that will be up, but I will plead \nwith the people on the other side who are stalling to keep us from \nvoting on this bill to at least, within the spirit of how Senator \nBaucus and I have run the Finance Committee, be very open and \ntransparent with us on what these amendments are going to be. We cannot \nexpect 100 Members of the Senate to vote yes or no on an amendment \nunless we know what that amendment is.\n  The pattern I set in the Senate Finance Committee is best illustrated \nby something I told each of the other 19 members when I went to their \noffices to visit with them about how they saw the committee ought to \nfunction and how we ought to do business. That is, No. 1, transparency; \nand, No. 2, communication. The bottom line was I told every member if \nthey wanted to know what was going on in this committee, all they had \nto do was ask and they would get an answer. If they didn't get an \nanswer, at least they were entitled to know why they couldn't get an \nanswer. And 99.9 percent of the time I figure everybody is entitled to \nknow what everybody else is doing.\n  Now we reach a point where the product of this bipartisan effort is \nin this Chamber, and I hope in the very same way we can communicate \nwith each other, we can be very transparent. But most important, on the \nissue of what amendments we are going to vote on, we ought to have \nthose amendments at the desk so we can study them while we are debating \nother amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to respond to \nthe distinguished Senator from Iowa as well as to make a couple of \ncomments about the next amendment.\n  I think the Senator from Iowa is absolutely right. We have no \nintention of denying him the opportunity to look at the amendments. I \nask our assistant Democratic leader if he could take responsibility for \nensuring that we would have not only the list of amendments, which we \nwould be happy to share with the Senator, but the text of the \namendments as well. I know he has a copy of the amendment about to be \noffered, and we will do our utmost to ensure copies are made available, \nas well as the list and the sequence of the amendments to be offered \nnext.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 722\n\n  I now ask that amendment No. 722 be considered at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 722.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is located in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted and Proposed.'')\n\n[[Page S5414]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, many Members have said for some time \nwhile we strongly support a tax cut, we have been very concerned about \nthe flaws in this tax cut, concerned because it is based on projections \nwe have grave doubts will ever be realized, budget projections that \nwill be changed as early as July of this year; concerned about the \nmagnitude, the size of the tax cut, and what we know it will do to \nSocial Security and Medicare and how it will take away funds from those \nextraordinarily important commitments we made to our seniors; concerns \nwe have about our ability to pay down the public debt; concerns we have \nabout our ability to pay for prescription drug benefits or fully fund \nour education commitments.\n  We have a great number of concerns given the magnitude of this tax \ncut. We also are concerned about its fairness. This tax cut could be \nbest described as devoting a third, a third, and a third to three very \ndistinct categories of taxpayers. This tax cut gives one-third of the \nentire benefit to the top 1 percent of all taxpayers. Roughly a third \ngoes to the next 19 percent of all taxpayers. And somewhat less than a \nthird goes to the bottom 80 percent of all taxpayers. That is \nultimately, in the second ten-year period, $4 trillion divided into a \nthird, a third, and a third--a third for the top 1 percent, a third for \nthe next 19 percent, and a third for the bottom 80 percent.\n  The tax bill before us also provides reductions in the tax rates--\nthat is, to every rate except the 15 percent rate under which 72 \nmillion American taxpayers fall. Those 72 million Americans--including \n250,000 South Dakota taxpayers--are denied a marginal tax rate cut in \nthis bill.\n  We think we can do better than that. Our country deserves better than \nthat. So we offer our alternative. Our alternative is fiscally \nresponsible. It dedicates $900 billion to a tax cut, provides adequate \nresources for us to continue the effort to pay down the debt, and \nleaves adequate resources for us to meet the other obligations we have \nin health care, education, and Social Security and Medicare.\n  This amendment also recognizes the need for fairness. It provides a \ntax cut for everybody, but it also provides marriage penalty relief \nthat starts next year, not in 5 years; a $1,000 child tax credit that \nextends to working families with incomes over $8,000; estate tax \nrelief, providing up to $4 million for couples and $8 million for farms \nand small businesses; and it provides a tuition tax deduction for \nmiddle class Americans who send their children to college.\n  It provides savings incentives to encourage small businesses to \nprovide pensions for their employees, and a permanent R tax credit. \nIt eliminates the alternative minimum tax for incomes up to $80,000 and \nprovides for energy conservation and efficiency tax incentives for more \nenergy efficient homes, appliances, and cars.\n  I will not belabor this. I will simply say this is the Democratic \napproach to meaningful tax relief this year, tax relief that can be \nrealized this year, not 7 or 8 years from now, tax relief that \nrecognizes we also have other very important priorities, priorities \ninvolving paying down the debt, priorities involving ensuring our \ncommitment to education, health, Social Security, and other priorities \nthat recognize the importance of fairness. I urge its adoption and \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes equally divided. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, obviously the minority leader has a right \nto offer this amendment, even at this late hour and even as thick as it \nis. We all know under the rules of reconciliation you can offer \namendments forever.\n  But I want to remind my colleagues that in 1993 when we were on the \nfloor of the Senate and we were considering, under reconciliation, a \nmassive tax increase that was proposed by then-President Clinton, we \ncould have followed the same strategy. We could have offered amendments \nendlessly. We hated that tax increase as much as some of your \ncolleagues hate this tax cut. But I think wiser heads prevailed, \nrecognizing that in doing that we were trying to do two things that \nwere bad: First, we were corroding the basic structure of the Senate in \nusing our rights in ways that really undercut how the system works in \nreconciliation; and, second, we were trying to win on the floor of the \nSenate what we had lost in the election.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute under the leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I think, second, we would have been trying to win on the \nfloor of the Senate what we had lost in the election.\n  I am no happier about the Clinton tax increase today than I was 8 \nyears ago. But I believe we did the right thing 8 years ago and I would \njust like to say to my colleagues, the Senate has worked its will. We \nknow in the end what the outcome is going to be. We voted on virtually \nevery amendment that can be imagined, at least by the minds of \nSenators--maybe not the mind of man but Senators.\n  I ask my colleagues to let us bring this to a conclusion and to have \nthe vote. That is the plea. I simply ask people look at where we are \nand ask are we serving our institution and are we, in the process here, \nreally abusing a right that every Senator has. Nobody is saying they do \nnot have it. Nobody is saying this is foul play. I just think what goes \naround comes around.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to remember, 8 years ago when we did not do \nthis, when you had a President and when you were taking the country in \na different direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes to \nanswer the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for 3 minutes on each side. I think \nSenator Gramm somewhat responded to Senator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, 3 minutes on each side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I remind colleagues 1993 was fundamentally \ndifferent than this year. In 1993 we were using the reconciliation \nprocess for the reason intended. The reason intended for the \nreconciliation process was to reduce deficits. That was a plan to \nreduce deficits.\n  This is a plan that many of us believe is totally outside the \nreconciliation process, totally outside of what was intended for \nreconciliation. This is not a deficit reduction package; this is a tax \ncut. It ought to be handled in the way other legislation is handled, \nwith Senators having the right to debate and to amend.\n  We are under a very truncated process that takes away the minority's \nfundamental rights in this body. If we want to talk about the \ninstitution and what is critical for the functioning of this \ninstitution, and the fairness towards the minority and minority rights, \nthen that is right at the heart of what is occurring here today because \nthe rights of the minority have been truncated. The rights of the \nminority have been abridged. The rights of the minority have been left \nout.\n  That is why we are in a process in which the only way we can express \nourselves is to offer amendment after amendment so we can make the case \nthat we believe holds against this tax bill.\n\n  There is a fundamental and profound difference between what is \nhappening today and 1993, when reconciliation was used for deficit \nreduction. That was precisely what reconciliation was designed to be \nused for. It is not and was never designed to be used for a tax cut.\n  The rights of the minority have been, in our view, limited. All of us \nwill pay a price in the future if we allow ourselves to be turned into \na House of Representatives where Senators lose their fundamental right \nto debate, their fundamental right to amend.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have 3 minutes?\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, let me first say that in 1974 we \nchanged the law that applies to the Senate with\n\n[[Page S5415]]\n\nreference to how long you take on a budget resolution and what kind of \namendments you can offer in a reconciliation bill. That was a law \nchanged because we decided for the first time in the history of our \ncountry we would have a budget. We didn't have budgets before then, \nbelieve it or not. That budget process was invented then by that \nstatute and the Senate, by an incredibly high vote--I think it was \neverybody but one--voted for that, including those who do not think we \nought to use reconciliation to raise taxes and lower taxes both. This \nwas voted in.\n  You will find since then that on three occasions the Senate has \nspoken on the issue of whether or not you can cut taxes in \nreconciliation. Three times we voted that that is appropriate. We have, \non this process, this year. There was a vote in this body where \nSenators voted on whether we would use reconciliation in this bill for \ntax cuts. The whole argument was presented against it, on which my good \nfriend Senator Byrd took a long time and presented all the history on \nit. I did the opposite. We voted. By a 51-49 vote we said let's use \nreconciliation and let's use it to cut taxes. Then we voted a \nresolution that said how much the taxes should be cut, and we told the \nFinance Committee to return the bill, which is now before us.\n  I do not know how you can claim we are violating anybody's rights. We \nhave voted on those issues. They are the law of the land. When you want \nto repeal or change the 1974 law, do so. It might need amending. It \nmight need changing.\n\n  Three times we voted on a reconciliation bill to cut taxes--three \ntimes. This is the fourth time. But this time we even took up the \nissue: Should we do it or not? And we said yes.\n  With that in mind I must say to my friends on the other side, it \nlooks to me like, when we have spent a total of 31 and a half hours \nincluding the votes on this bill, and we have had 32 votes and only 1 \npassed. It was kind of irrelevant--a good amendment; a Senator on this \nside offered it, good amendment but actually it had nothing to do with \nthe budget, the one that passed.\n  I think everybody in America should know this bill is going to get a \nsignificant majority, bipartisan, of U.S. Senators under this \nparticular set of facts that I just described.\n  So, if we have not debated it enough, how long should it be debated? \nIf we have not done everything can you do on this bill to make the two \nmajor points the Democrats want to make, I don't know how many more \nvotes, how much more time you need?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Point of order, Mr. President. This amendment that we \nare supposed to know was here overnight, has a point of order against \nit. The amendment is not germane to the provisions of the \nreconciliation measure. I therefore raise a point of order against the \namendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I move to waive the relevant sections of \nthe budget act.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Stevens) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 41, nays 58, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 144 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--41\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--58\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Carnahan\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Stevens\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo).

I am pleased to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] moves to \n     recommit H.R. 1836 to the Committee on Finance with \n     instructions to report back within 3 days with the \n     following changes: (1) reduce the marginal rate cuts in \n     the top brackets and estate tax cuts by a total of \n     $350,000,000,000 over the total of fiscal years 2002 \n     through 2011; and (2) add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . STRATEGIC RESERVE FUND FOR SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM \n                   AND DEBT REDUCTION.\n\n       If legislation is reported by the Committee on Finance of \n     the Senate or the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives, or an amendment thereto is offered or a \n     conference report thereon is submitted, that would strengthen \n     Social Security, extend the solvency of the Social Security \n     Trust Funds, maintain progressivity in the Social Security \n     benefit system, and continue to lift more seniors out of \n     poverty, the Chairman of the appropriate Committee on the \n     Budget shall revise the aggregates, functional totals, \n     allocations, and other appropriate levels and limits in the \n     conference report accompanying H.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, every single plan to strengthen Social \nSecurity that has been proposed by any Member on either side of the \naisle costs money. Unfortunately, we don't have the money in this \nbudget.\n  This bill is dramatically backloaded. It costs $1.3 trillion this \ndecade. It costs more than $4 trillion next decade, at the very time \nthe massive surpluses now turn to substantial deficits then.\n  My amendment says: Take $350 billion out of this tax cut and reserve \nit to strengthen Social Security. We all know it costs money. We ought \nto reserve it now. We ought to strengthen Social Security for the \nfuture.\n  I urge my colleagues' support.\n\n[[Page S5416]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have had 8 years where we haven't had \nany strengthening of Social Security, while there was a Democrat \nPresident. There is no question we need to do that, but there is also \nno question that this is a tax bill and we are trying to reduce taxes \nso we can stimulate the economy and keep our economy going.\n  When I got here this year, I thought we were surely going to have \nmore bipartisanship, but here we go again. This is another in a long \nlist of amendments meant to slow down and stop this bill. When is this \npartisanship going to end?\n  I urge the defeat of this amendment. The pending amendment is not \ngermane under the provisions of the reconciliation measure. I therefore \nraise a point of order against the amendment under section 305(b)(2) of \nthe Budget Act.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable sections for \nconsideration of the pending motion, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The amendment offered by Senator Reid is not germane \nto this bill.\n  This amendment has never been reviewed by any committee of \njurisdiction, nor scored by the Congressional Budget Office. No one has \nany idea how much it would cost or what new benefit inequities it would \ncreate. In addition, the proposed offset contained in the amendment is \nan unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the \nSecretary of the Treasury. This is not a serious amendment.\n  If Congress is going to seriously consider this issue, it must be \ndone in the context of overall Social Security reform so we can \ncarefully consider the costs and benefits of any proposed change.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we oppose this amendment. I yield to the \nSenator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. \nThe Senator has raised an important issue dealing with the appropriate \ntreatment of those who are known as the notch babies.\n  We all know this is not the bill on which to resolve this issue. We \nneed to take up that issue in the context of modernizing our Social \nSecurity system, and this is just another attempt to delay final \npassage of the tax bill. So I encourage my colleagues to oppose this \namendment regardless of their views on the underlying issue, and let's \nget on with the vote and approve this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use 1 minute on leader time. If this \nis not the time to help notch babies, when is it? Some of them are \napproaching 84 years of age. Are we going to wait until next year until \nmore die, or the year after? People go home and say nice things about \nthe notch babies. Well, let's vote a nice thing for them today. Today \nis the day. There is no other day. This is our opportunity to take the \nnotch unfairness out of our law.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will use 1 minute out of leader time. We \njust lived through 8 years of a Democratic President, and no one effort \nwas successful--or even tried, as far as I can recall--to help the \nnotch babies. I have always voted in favor of helping the notch people, \nbut the pending amendment is not germane and those on the other side \nknow it. They are getting a great kick out of bringing this up. It is \nnot germane.\n  I raise a point of order against the amendment under 305(b)(2) of the \nCongressional Budget Act.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under all applicable rules of the Senate and \nthe law, I ask that there be a waiver of the Budget Act, and I further \nsay, explain to the notch babies that you are voting on some point of \norder.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I claim 1 minute under the procedure to \nspeak on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order provides for only 1 minute on each \nside.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Maryland be \ngiven 1 minute, and that we have 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, on more than one amendment it has been \nsaid that for 8 years we had a Democratic President and we didn't do \nanything about this issue. We spent most of those 8 years working \nourselves out of the deficit box into which we have been placed by the \nprevious administrations.\n\n  It is only now when we have some surpluses that we can start talking \nabout doing something about these issues. How were you going to do \nsomething when you had a deficit? This is a very worthy cause for using \nsome of those surpluses that we now have. I urge support for the Reid \namendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will use 1 more minute. Well, it seems a \nlittle odd to me that after all these years, all of a sudden on a tax \ncut bill where we are trying to stimulate the economy, we get this \nissue. It is time to vote to reduce taxes. It is time to reduce the \ngames. It is time to quit the partisanship. It is time to end this bill \nand get a vote up or down. If you can win, you win. If you can't win, \nyou don't win.\n  Let's vote on this bill and quit playing partisan politics.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Stevens) \nand the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords) are necessarily absent.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 55, nays 43, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5418]]\n\n             [Rollcall Vote No. 146 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Jeffords\n     Stevens\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ADJUSTMENT TO RATES IN RESPONSE TO BREACH OF LIMITS.\n\n       If, in fiscal year 2002, the discretionary spending level \n     assumed in the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2002 (H. Con. Res. 83) for such year is exceeded, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury shall adjust the reduction in the \n     highest marginal tax rate in the table contained in section \n     1(i)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as added by \n     section 101(a), for taxable years beginning in calendar years \n     after such fiscal year as necessary to offset the decrease in \n     the Treasury resulting from such excess.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wanted the amendment to be read because \nit is a short amendment. It is a fairly straightforward amendment. It \nis a modest effort at making the bill a little more fiscally \nresponsible.\n  The amount of the tax cut is set forth in the budget resolution. That \nsame budget resolution sets a cap for domestic discretionary spending. \nWe are not waiting, as we should, to see how big a tax cut we should \nput in place to see whether or not we are going to live under those \ncaps which the budget resolution sets for domestic discretionary \nspending.\n  This amendment says if Congress breaks the spending caps in the \nbudget resolution, then this 1-percent reduction in the upper bracket, \nwhich is provided for in this fiscal year, will not go into effect to \nthe extent that it is necessary to pay for the excess in domestic \ndiscretionary spending for which the Congress votes. Otherwise, we are \ndipping into the Medicare surplus.\n  This is an amendment for fiscal responsibility. It is modest and will \nhelp make this bill more fiscally responsible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this is the Senate. We do believe in free \nand open debate and amendments. But we go on hour after hour after \nhour. I have not counted the number of amendments on which we have \nvoted. We are probably over 40 amendments. It seems we need to move on; \nwe need to pass this bill and we need to move forward.\n  This is a bill that has been debated; it has been compromised. I \nthink the Senate needs to work its will. I know the amendments keep \ncoming, but at some point we need to pass it and get to conference and \nsend it to the President.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Levin amendment is not germane to the provisions of \nthe reconciliation measure. I, therefore, raise a point of order \nagainst the amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, in my minute I hope I can convince \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment. Just \nthis past weekend, President Bush called for a war on poverty. This \namendment is a step in that direction. It is offered in that spirit. \nWhat we do is help 1.5 million veterans who are now living in poverty \nby giving a tax credit to those employers who hire them. This idea was \nproposed and is supported by the National Coalition for Homeless \nVeterans and the Noncommissioned Officers Association. Veterans groups \ntell me the current tax credit, Welfare To Work, is not working for \nveterans because they are not on welfare. They need this tax credit.\n  So we send our people into harm's way and sometimes they come back \nand they really are having a tough time integrating into society, \ngetting a meaningful job. This will reward employers who give them a \njob. And, by the way, we pay for it by bringing that top rate down to, \nnot 36 percent but 36.05 percent. Let's do this for our veterans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I say to the Senator from California, she does not have \na bad amendment. I think in the proper time and place, such as on the \nWork Opportunity Training Act or things of that nature, it would be a \ngood thing to do and for us to take a look at it. I will be glad to \ntake a look at it. But at this point I am going to have to ask the \namendment be defeated.\n  I raise a point of order, but it needs to be defeated because of the \nchanges it makes in the tax rates. We are working on a tax bill. We \nhave a well-balanced, well-crafted bipartisan bill. We have had 40 \nvotes on amendments. There is too much effort, regardless of the good \nfaith of this person in offering a good idea, to stall, stall, stall. I \nthink we have to get this bill passed and get tax relief to the \nAmerican people.\n  I raise a point of order. The point of order is against the amendment \nunder section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am not trying to stall. I am trying to \nmake this a better bill for our people, including our veterans.\n  I move we waive the Budget Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this amendment is offered on behalf of \nthe senior Senator from Arizona and myself, Mr. McCain. It simply says \nthat, instead of cutting the top marginal rate to 36 percent, cut the \ntop rate to 38.6 percent. In turn, the savings would be devoted to \nexpanding the 15 percent income tax bracket. The idea is to make this \nbill more fair by shifting more of its benefits to middle class people.\n  This is an amendment for which there has been some debate. This \namendment is similar to the amendment offered by Senator McCain \nearlier. This amendment ought to be adopted and ought to be made a part \nof the pending bill. I ask for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 748.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide a proportionate reduction in the credit for State \ndeath taxes before repeal, thereby allowing for responsible full estate \n                              tax repeal)\n\n       On page 66, before line 2, insert the following:\n       ``(C) Coordination with credit for state death taxes.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Rules similar to the rules of \n     subparagraph (A) shall apply to the table contained in \n     section 2011(b) except that the Secretary shall prescribe \n     percentage point reductions which maintain the proportionate \n     relationship (as in effect before any reduction under this \n     paragraph) between the credit under section 2011 and the tax \n     rates under this subsection.''.\n       (d) Revenue Offset.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     adjust the highest rate of tax under section 1 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended by section 101 of \n     this Act) to the extent necessary to offset in each fiscal \n     year beginning before October 1, 2011, the decrease in \n     revenues to the Treasury for that fiscal year resulting from \n     section 2001(c)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (as added by the amendments made by subsection (c)).\n       Beginning on page 70, line 20, strike all through page 79, \n     line 6.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this is an amendment everybody \ncan vote for because you want to protect your States. The bill phases \nout the estate tax for the State portion much quicker than it phases \nout the entire estate tax. It is going to put a real financial burden \non our States. Under the existing bill, the State portion would be \nrepealed much faster, not leaving our States enough time to prepare and \nplan for the loss of revenue. That is unfair to our State governments.\n  This amendment, sponsored by Senator Graham and myself, would result \nin the full repeal of the estate tax but would phase out the State \nestate tax portion at a rate consistent with the repeal of the Federal \nportion and would pay for it through a temporary reduction in the top \nmarginal rate cuts.\n  This would provide for a responsible full repeal of the estate tax \nwhile leaving time for our States to plan for this loss of revenue to \nthe States.\n  I yield back the time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is another one of those amendments. \nIt has just a little change from what we voted on last night.\n  This delegates to the Secretary of the Treasury the setting of tax \nrates. I think this very much is an affront to the constitutional \nrequirement that all revenue measures shall originate in the House.\n  Senator Nelson's amendment strikes at the heart of the principal \njurisdiction over taxation held by the House Ways and Means Committee \nand the Senate Finance Committee. Every year, for 10 years, he \ndelegates the top marginal income tax rate to the Secretary of the \nTreasury to determine.\n  This amendment sacrifices the American taxpayer for the convenience \nof the State treasuries. I urge defeat of the amendment.\n  I have a point of order I want to raise. The amendment is not germane \nto the provisions of the reconciliation measure. That point of order \nis, as you have heard so many times: I raise a point of order that the \namendment violates section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I was not aware that a point of \norder would lie on this. I would like to know what the Parliamentarian \nsays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will rule on the Senator's point of \norder if he wishes.\n  The amendment is not germane.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am sorry, I could not hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not germane. The point of \norder is sustained.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Then, Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 \nof the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the purpose of the pending amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive is too late at this point. \nThe Chair has ruled.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Then we are done. Let's move on to the next amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S5421]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If this is appropriate, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senator from Florida be allowed to put in his request for a waiver \nof the germaneness rule and have a vote on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the purpose of the pending amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question now is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Kohl) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 42, nays 57, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 150 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--42\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--57\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kohl\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 770.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To accelerate the increase in exemption amount for estates \n    and reduce the reduction in the 39.6 percent marginal tax rate)\n\n       Beginning on page 68, strike line 12 and all that follows \n     through page 70, line 19, and insert the following:\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (c) of section 2010 (relating \n     to applicable credit amount) is amended by striking the table \n     and inserting the following new table:\n\n``In the case of estates of decedentThe applicable exclusion amount is:\n      2002 through 2010..................................$4,000,000.''.\n       (b) Lifetime Gift Exemption Increased to $1,000,000.--\n       (1) For periods before estate tax repeal.--Paragraph (1) of \n     section 2505(a) (relating to unified credit against gift tax) \n     is amended by inserting ``(determined as if the applicable \n     exclusion amount were $1,000,000)'' after ``calendar year''.\n       (2) For periods after estate tax repeal.--Paragraph (1) of \n     section 2505(a) (relating to unified credit against gift \n     tax), as amended by paragraph (1), is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(1) the amount of the tentative tax which would be \n     determined under the rate schedule set forth in section \n     2502(a)(2) if the amount with respect to which such tentative \n     tax is to be computed were $1,000,000, reduced by''.\n       (c) GST Exemption.--\n       (1) In general.--Subsection (a) of 2631 (relating to GST \n     exemption) is amended by striking ``of $1,000,000'' and \n     inserting ``amount''.\n       (2) Exemption amount.--Subsection (c) of section 2631 is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(c) GST Exemption Amount.--For purposes of subsection \n     (a), the GST exemption amount for any calendar year shall be \n     equal to the applicable exclusion amount under section \n     2010(c) for such calendar year.''.\n       (d) Repeal of Special Benefit for Family-Owned Business \n     Interests.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 2057 is hereby repealed.\n       (2) Conforming amendments.--\n       (A) Paragraph (10) of section 2031(c) is amended by \n     inserting ``(as in effect on the day before the date of the \n     enactment of this parenthetical)'' before the period.\n       (B) The table of sections for part IV of subchapter A of \n     chapter 11 is amended by striking the item relating to \n     section 2057.\n       (e) Effective Dates.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     amendments made by this section shall apply to estates of \n     decedents dying and gifts and generation-skipping transfers \n     made after December 31, 2001.\n       (2) Subsection (b)(2).--The amendments made by subsection \n     (b)(2) shall apply to gifts made after December 31, 2010.\n       (f) Revenue Offset.--The reductions in the highest marginal \n     tax rate in the table contained in section 1(i)(2) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as added by section 101(a) of \n     this Act, are eliminated to offset the decrease in revenues \n     to the Treasury for each fiscal year resulting from the \n     amendments made by this section as compared to the amendments \n     made by section 521 of the Restoring Earnings To Lift \n     Individuals and Empower Families (RELIEF) Act of 2001 as \n     reported by the Finance Committee of the Senate on May 16, \n     2001.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is similar to amendment No. 759 at the \ndesk, but it has been redrafted to avoid the germaneness point of order \nwhich could have rested against it based on giving authority to the \nSecretary of the Treasury. It eliminates that authority. It just sets \nthe rates.\n  What we do with this amendment is make the changes in the unified \nestate taxes immediate instead of waiting 10 years for that $4 million \nunified exemption, which is so important to making sure that small \nbusinesses are not caught by the estate tax. This amendment says we \nshould do that now. We should bring forward these exemptions, these \nunified exemptions that are important to eliminate small businesses and \nfarms from being caught in the estate tax. Ninety percent of the small \nbusinesses that would be caught by the estate tax will not be caught \nonce we have a $4 million unified exemption. This brings forward that \nexemption and pays for it by eliminating the upper bracket reduction. A \nlot more people will be benefited--a lot more small businesses.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, unanimous consent for what?\n  I didn't hear the unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was a quorum call requested by the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. REID. I don't understand.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Was all the time used up, Mr. President? I thought there \nwas time on each side. The time hasn't all been used up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has not been used up. That is why it \nrequired unanimous consent.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe the unanimous consent was \ngranted by the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. You can't grant something if you can't hear him. Reserving \nthe right to object, we have spent now, this afternoon, probably close \nto 2 hours in quorum calls. There is going to come a time shortly when \nwe are going to be blamed. We haven't held anything up. We didn't \nsuggest the quorum call and here we are again. I have no problem with a \nquorum being called, but we have 30-some amendments left to vote on and \nI want to make sure we can't be blamed for not moving the bill forward.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like clarification. I believe I \nsuggested the absence of a quorum. The President asked if there were \nany objections. I believe the quorum call was in order; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is correct.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5422]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment costs billions, and \nSenator Levin plans to pay for it by slashing any rate relief at the \ntop rate. He proposes no estate tax and no capital gains tax on \nestates, and he pays for it with a denial of any tax break at all to \nthe top rate.\n  This simply is not fair. This amendment will require a tax increase \nof billions of dollars, according to the Joint Tax Committee. It will \nincrease taxes tens of thousands on small businessowners, and these \nfolks throughout the country are the ones who create the jobs.\n  I urge everyone to vote against this amendment. Once again, I raise \nthe point that this is probably the second, third, or fourth time we \nhave voted on similar amendments. At some time, we ought to say enough \nis enough.

Mr. President, when one looks at the deduction for college \ntuition in the bill, one finds, at least to my amazement, that it does \nnot get fully phased in until 2004 and then it sunsets; it gets wiped \nout in 2006.\n  We should do a lot better than that for this important deduction, and \nthis amendment will provide the full deduction immediately and pays for \nit by using part of the top tax bracket reduction.\n  An awful lot of people will benefit from this amendment helping to \nget students through college by having a real college tuition \ndeduction, not just rhetoric but real, and be available now and not \nsunsetted 2 years after it is fully phased in.\n  I ask that the Senator from New York be recognized, if I have any \ntime on my minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this is an important amendment for those \nwho care about paying for college.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. We should make it permanent, and I urge support of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition? The Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan described his \namendment. I am not going to go back through that. We have a very good \npackage of educational assistance, tax incentives in our bill, of which \nthe deduction of tuition is a major portion, and that major portion was \nput in to make this a more bipartisan bill, particularly under the \nleadership of Senator Torricelli.\n  What is wrong with this amendment is not that it does not do more but \nthe fact that it increases billions of dollars for small business men \nand women. The revenue loss for the tuition deduction in our bill is \n$11 billion. We don't have this one scored, but this would be much \nhigher.\n\n  Once again, I plead with people. We have a bipartisan bill. How many \ntimes do we have to defeat the same amendment? It has been 37 times \nnow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson).

Mr. President, we hear a great deal during the \ndiscussion that we can afford the tax cut. We can also afford \ninvestments in education. This debate is really about choices. In this \ninstance, we are offering the choice of getting the full funding of the \nPell grants and deferring the reduction at the highest tax rate until \nwe have the full funding.\n  This Nation made enormous progress through the GI bill. That was paid \n$8 paid back for every dollar that was put in. We made great progress \nin the cold war GI bill after the Korean war. In 1972, we enacted the \nPell grant. The average Pell grant goes to a family with an income of \n$14,500. At the beginning of the Pell grant it paid for 80 percent of a \npublic education and 40 percent of a private education. Today it is 40 \npercent of a public education and 18 percent of a private education. \nThis will bring it up to 50 percent and 20 percent, in terms of public \nand private.\n  It is the best investment we can make in our Nation's future. I hope \nwe will have support for expanding the Pell Grant Program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Can we afford? Can we afford? How come we always hear \nthe question, can we afford the tax cut? but we never hear, can you \nafford when it comes to spending money?\n  Mr. President, this may be a very well-intentioned amendment. It is \nvery appropriate to bring up these educational issues. But it is not \nappropriate on a bipartisan tax reduction bill that this Senate \nrequested in the budget resolution adopted 2 weeks ago. I urge my \ncolleagues to reject this amendment.\n  The Kennedy amendment finances the increase in Pell grants by \ndelaying marginal rate reductions if the Secretary of Education \ndetermines that Pell grants are not fully funded.\n  So this is not germane. I raise this point then: The amendment is not \ngermane because it should not be on a reconciliation measure. The point \nof order against the amendment is under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget \nAct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive applicable sections \nof the act on the pending amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To condition the reductions in the 39.6 percent rate in 2005 \n and 2007 on the Federal Government sufficiently funding Head Start to \n          enable every eligible child access to such program)\n\n       On page 9, between lines 14 and 15, insert:\n       ``(4) Reduction in top rate contingent on head start \n     funding.--Notwithstanding paragraph (2), the reductions in \n     the 39.6 percent rate bracket which (without regard to this \n     paragraph) would take effect for taxable years beginning in \n     2005 or 2007 shall not take effect at all unless the \n     Secretary of Education certifies to the Secretary of the \n     Treasury before November 1, 2004, or November 1, 2006, \n     whichever is applicable, that during each of the 2 fiscal \n     years ending in 2003 and 2004 or 2005 and 2006, whichever is \n     applicable, the Federal Government honored its commitment to \n     fund the Head Start Act in an amount sufficient to enable \n     every eligible child access to such program.''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is another amendment about \npriorities.\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\n We are now funding half the eligible children for Head Start. This \namendment says, after we fund the rest of the children who are eligible \nfor the Head Start program, then the top rate can be lowered from 39.6 \npercent to 36 percent.\n  We have had three Carnegie Commission studies that talked about the \nimportance of investing in Head Start. We had a report issued in \nJanuary of last year by the National Science Foundation entitled ``From \nNeurons to Neighborhoods.'' It is an evaluation of all the Early Head \nStart Programs, saying this is the best investment that we can make in \nterms of helping children develop their brains.\n  In a few days, we are going to deal with the education bill. This may \nvery well be more important to the children of this country than that \nlegislation. Let's say we believe in investing in our future, investing \nin our children. Let's fund the Head Start Program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am pleased to stand in for the chairman of \nthe committee.\n  This amendment for full funding of Head Start has no place in this \nbill. The chairman has made the point over and over again that this \nbill is carefully constructed to include a variety of interests on both \nsides of the aisle. Each of these amendments is an attempt to upset \nthat balance, in many cases, as in this one, with no estimate of the \ncost whatsoever. As a result, of course, a point of order lies, a point \nof order which I will make in just a moment.\n  It ought to be clear to everyone that this is boiling down to a \nquestion of who is for tax cuts and who isn't. Time after time, \namendments are presented on that side of the aisle, and they are \ndefeated by this side of the aisle. I think it ought to become clear to \npeople after a while what is really occurring on. It is a stall tactic, \nand it really defines who is for tax cuts and who isn't.\n  Mr. President, because of the point I made, the pending amendment is \nnot germane to the provisions of the reconciliation measure. I, \ntherefore, raise a point of order against the amendment under section \n305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of the Budget Act for the consideration of the pending \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Members of the Senate, this is an \namendment I am offering for Senator Kennedy. The HOPE scholarship tax \ncredit is valuable to students but not to those who are attending \ncommunity colleges and public universities. It is limited to tuition \nand fees.\n  This amendment expands the reach of the HOPE scholarship tax credit \nto include other costs of college, such as transportation, daycare, \ncost of computers, books, and the like. This will mean the HOPE \nscholarship tax credit will help children of limited means from \nfamilies who aren't wealthy receive a college education.\n  I hope Members of the Senate will consider a change in the upper tax \nrates to bring it to the same level as all other tax rate reductions, \nthe benefits of that savings going to the kids in community colleges so \nthey can qualify for the HOPE scholarship tax credit.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, compared to the bill that is before us, this \namendment is a tax increase for a large segment of middle America. \nFamilies making $50,000, $60,000 a year would not see rates reduced.\n  Relative to the bill, the rates are effectively increased. We believe \nit would be a very expensive addition to a $30 billion package of \neducation proposals already included in the bill. As a result, \nobviously, it not only upsets the bipartisan agreement that has been \ncrafted between Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley and the committee \nbut in fact would represent a huge revenue loss --the estimate not \nbeing before us.\n  As I said before, what we are seeing is amendment after amendment \nbeing presented which do not pass but which clearly make the point that \nthere are some folks here who are for tax cuts and some folks who are \nnot for tax cuts.\n  This is the 43rd amendment on which we have voted. Of those presented \ntoday, almost half of them have not even been relevant. It is time to \ncall this to a stop. I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S5425]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] moves to \n     recommit H.R. 1836 to the Finance Committee, with \n     instructions that the Committee on Finance report the bill \n     to the Senate within three days, with the following \n     amendments that:\n       Provide a fully refundable HOPE tax credit beginning in \n     2002; and\n       Strike the reductions in the 39.6% bracket.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this cuts the tax cut from the top .7 \npercent and instead puts the money into the HOPE Scholarship Program \nwhich would make it refundable. It would make a refundable tax credit, \nwhich means your community college students, who are about the hardest \nworking group of students one will ever find--many are going back to \nschool; many of them are men and women in their thirties and forties \nwith children--would then be able to afford this.\n  Right now, if their income is below $26,000, $27,000 a year, they do \nnot get any benefit unless it is refundable.\n  We could not do anything more important for higher education, \nespecially if you care about the working class, these community college \nstudents. I hope there will be great support for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota has well described \nhis amendment. It is very similar to the last amendment, but this is a \nmotion to recommit. There is no estimate of the revenue loss of the \nproposal, though it will be huge.\n  The bill already, as we all know, has a $30 billion package of \neducation tax incentives. Given the amount of money available for the \nvarious pieces of relief within the bill, we think that is quite \ngenerous.\n  The proposal, obviously, will raise the taxes of individuals and \nsmall businesses by the billions that would be necessary to pay for it.\n  It is almost 8:30 p.m. This is the third day we have been taking up \namendments. We have now considered 44. This will be 45. Almost half of \nthem today have not been relevant. Why do we keep having the same \namendments over and over? This is virtually the same amendment as the \nlast one.\n  I appreciate those on both sides of the aisle who have supported the \ncommittee bill. It is important we continue to do that. This all boils \ndown to who supports tax relief and who does not. If you support tax \nrelief, vote no on this crippling proposal.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and the nays, and I \nsay to colleagues, all this does is cut the tax cut for the top .7 \npercent. I do not know where my colleague gets these figures. I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Mr. President, the Health Committee heard testimony last \nweek by 2010 there will be a shortage of 725,000 nurses. This will grow \nto 1.2 million nurses by 2020 as the baby boom generation retires and \nneeds more care.\n  Many other crucial professions are also in short supply. The number \nof unfilled pharmacist positions in community practice nationally rose \nfrom 2,700 vacancies in February of 1998 to over 7,000 by February of \n2000.\n  Relative to education, over the next 10 years we must hire 2.2 \nmillion new teachers to replace those who are retiring or leaving the \nclassroom.\n  My amendment will go a long way to improving the supply of teachers, \nnurses, and other health professionals. It would provide a 50-percent \ntax credit of up to $2,000 a year for the cost of repaying educational \nloans for nurses, teachers, and other health professionals who serve in \nfederally designated health professional shortage areas.\n  It would be paid for by eliminating the huge tax break for the \nwealthiest of Americans provided in this bill. It would strike the \nreduction in the top rate. Again, that is precisely what this amendment \ndoes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe NEA.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 2001.\n     Senator Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the National Education \n     Association's (NEA) 2.6 million members, we would like to \n     express our support for your amendment to the tax bill that \n     would provide a tax credit to offset the costs of teachers' \n     student loan payments.\n       As you know, providing every child the opportunity to excel \n     requires ensuring a highly qualified teacher in every \n     classroom. To meet this goal, America must meet the \n     challenges posed by record public school enrollments, the \n     projected retirements of thousands of veteran teachers, and \n     critical efforts to reduce class sizes. Given these favors, \n     public schools will need to hire an estimated 2.2 million new \n     teachers by 2009.\n       Despite these urgent needs, recruitment of high-quality \n     teachers remains a significant challenge--one exacerbated by \n     low salaries. A recent NEA report found that during the \n     decade from 1989-90 to 1999-2000, average salaries for public \n     school teachers increased by less than one percent, in \n     constant dollars. Often, therefore, talented individuals \n     facing high student loan costs simply cannot afford to enter \n     or remain in the teaching profession.\n       By providing a tax credit to offset student loan payments, \n     your amendment will help attract and retain high-quality \n     teachers. We thank you for your leadership in addressing this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Mary Elizabeth Teasley,\n                                 Director of Government Relations.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is now 8:45. I believe this will be the \n46th amendment we will have considered. This amendment also deals with \nthe subject that about half of the recent amendments have dealt with--\neducation--which I have already discussed we have done a lot about in \nthe bill already.\n  There is a point at which I think our colleagues are going to have to \nconclude that the continued offering of these amendments over and over \nand over again is for the purpose of dragging this out and preventing \nthe Senate from passing an important bill for tax relief for the \nAmerican people. It also depends upon whether you are for tax relief or \nnot. For those who continue to offer these amendments, it is apparent \nthat they are not for the bill, they are not going to support the bill, \nthey continue to try to drag this out so we won't complete this bill \nbefore the Memorial Day recess.\n  The amendment is not germane to the provisions of the reconciliation \nmeasure, and therefore I raise a point of order against the amendment \nunder section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act, \nI move to waive the point of order and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Kohl) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 43, nays 56, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 157 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--56\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kohl\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote the yeas are 43, the nays are 56. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S5427]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the next amendment in order will be that of \nthe Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, the ranking member on the \nBudget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 781\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment improves our debt reduction \nby ending the repeal of the estate tax. The estate tax is ended just \nbefore we begin the second decade, right at the time the baby boomers \nstart to retire and the cost of this tax bill then explodes to about $4 \ntrillion.\n  My amendment is simple. It continues all of the provisions to \nincrease the unified credit so that a couple could pass $8 million with \nno estate tax.\n  In addition, we preserve stepped up basis so that you pay future \ntaxes on the basis of the value of the property when you inherit it, \nnot on the basis of what your grandfather paid or what your father \npaid.\n  I believe this is a sound amendment and one that deserves the support \nof our colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Is the Senator going to send up the amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 781.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: to reduce debt by eliminating the repeal of the estate tax)\n\n       Strike the following sections of the bill: Sections 501, \n     541, and 542.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is a bit confusing when these amendments \nare taken out of order. At the moment, if I could ask for my \ncolleagues' indulgence, we do not have a copy of this amendment. We may \nhave to get it from the sponsor of the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it appears that we have not been given this \namendment. I know that my colleagues on the other side have made it \nclear that it was their intent that we receive all copies of all \namendments prior to the time of their presentation. As of right now, in \nany event, it does not appear we have this amendment.\n  I would ask for my colleagues' indulgence for a moment. If the \nSenator from North Dakota wishes to offer the amendment, then we are \ngoing to have to have an opportunity to review it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to make a \nstatement for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to publicly thank my great friend \nand long-time companion, Senator Inouye, for his kindness in pairing \nwith me on two votes during the last 2 days. I had made a commitment to \nmy granddaughter to be present at her graduation from high school, and \nI decided to keep that commitment. But we knew there would be close \nvotes. I talked to my good friend, and he gave me this commitment he \nwould pair on votes on which my absence might make a difference.\n  There are few friendships in this world that are stronger than my \nlove for my great friend from Hawaii, a committed and dedicated \nAmerican, and one who has been recognized by our country for his \nheroism at war. But he showed last night, once again, that he is a true \nfriend as far as I am concerned.\n  I publicly thank him for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nspeak for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska is certainly one to \ntalk about friendship. I say that very seriously. When I was a Member \nof the House of Representatives, a man by the name of Alan Bible, who \nwas 20 years a Senator here, died. And, of course, the procedure was \nthat an airplane was supplied to Members of Congress to go to Nevada \nfor the funeral.\n  The only person on that airplane, other than me, was Senator Ted \nStevens. He was there as a result of his friendship with Alan Bible. \nParticularly, one vote that Senator Stevens remembers was very hard for \nAlan Bible to cast. As a result of that, Senator Stevens traveled 1 day \n6,000 miles to repay what he felt was a debt he owed to a dead man. So \nSenator Stevens is gracious in extending compliments to Senator Inouye, \nwhich Senator Inouye deserves. But Senator Stevens, in my book, is \nsomeone who knows what friendship means.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there is an amendment pending. I believe \nthat we have a copy of it now. We should be ready to go to the vote \nmomentarily. It would be our intent, on both sides of the aisle, to \nmake this the last vote tonight and resume voting again in the morning \nat 9:30, at which point I am hoping that Senator Daschle and I can work \ntogether and get an agreement as to how we would proceed in the morning \nand as to how we would complete action on this legislation.\n  I am not going to propound a unanimous consent request now, but we \nwant Senators to know this will be the last vote of the night. We will \nbe back at 9:30. Our intent is to work together to find a way to \nsuccessfully complete action on this legislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. May we have order.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to yield to Senator Byrd or to Senator \nReid.\n  Mr. BYRD. May we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please be in order.\n  Cease all conversations.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the majority leader----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order yet.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the majority leader, in the morning at 9:30 we \nwould intend to vote first on amendment No. 780 offered by Senator \nDurbin.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe we have other amendments that would be in order. \nI believe Senator Snowe has indicated that she will have one in the \nmorning.\n  Mr. REID. I believe it is your turn.\n  Mr. LOTT. If we do not have one ready to go at 9:30, we would go to \nthe Durbin amendment, and then one--have we offered one today?\n  Mr. REID. Three days ago.\n  Mr. LOTT. We might want to have one every other day until we can \ncomplete action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to take the minute now in \nopposition to the amendment. We have had an opportunity to review it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, this amendment uses repeal of the death tax to pay \ndown the debt further. We already defeated amendments which would help \nwith HOPE scholarships and Head Start and a variety of other things. \nThis now would use it to pay down the debt. Obviously, it is something \nwe have considered and rejected in the past.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject it again. This would make, I believe, \nsomething like the 46th amendment. There does not appear to be anything \nnew under the Sun here, and, as a result, I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in defeating the amendment.\n\n[[Page S5428]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, during the course of this week's debate, \nseveral amendments have been offered that would direct the Treasury \nSecretary to adjust marginal tax rates in a way that would provide the \nnecessary savings to fund particular tax benefits.\n  I opposed these amendments because the U.S. Constitution explicitly \nvests that power in the legislative branch. It is the responsibility of \nthe Congress--the people's representatives--to determine the \nappropriate level of taxation and, consequently, the proper marginal \nrates. By delegating such duties to the Treasury Secretary, the \nCongress would continue a dangerous pattern of recent years of ceding \ncongressional responsibilities to the executive branch. Placing these \npowers in the legislative branch was part of the Framers' carefully \ncrafted constitutional design, comprised of an intricate system of \nchecks and balances and separation of powers.\n  I hope that the Senate will continue to protect the balance of powers \nby rejecting any amendment that would attempt to transfer its \nConstitutional responsibilities to the executive.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 695\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to speak of my \nopposition to the amendment offered yesterday by Senator Dodd, which \nwould replace the estate tax repeal in order to partially pay for \nnontransportation infrastructure programs and save for debt reduction. \nI strongly support responsible tax cuts and a full repeal of the estate \ntax.\n  Even though paying down the national debt is one of my top \npriorities, I could not support an amendment that does not reflect my \nposition of support for total repeal of the estate tax. I opposed this \namendment because the revenue offset did not meet this criterion.\n\n\n                       vote on amendment no. 747\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was absent for rollcall vote No. 143.

Mr. President, last night, I spoke by phone to Taiwan \nPresident Chen Shui-bian shortly after he arrived in New York on a so-\ncalled ``transit stop'' on his way to Latin America. I told him how \npleased I was the he was able to make this visit and that I regretted \nthat I could not travel to New York to meet with him personally because \nof the tax bill now on the Senate floor.\n  I strongly opposed the restrictions placed on President Chen when he \npassed through Los Angeles last summer and was not permitted to meet \nwith members of Congress. That is no way to treat the democratically \nelected President of Taiwan.\n  We are in a different era than in the 1970s when Richard Nixon opened \nup China, the three Communiques were produced, and the Taiwan Relations \nAct was passed.\n  On the one hand, we still honor the one China policy. The American \nmessage to Beijing and Taipei continues to be that they must negotiate \ntogether to resolve their differences by peaceful means. We are \ndetermined that neither side should be able to take unilateral steps \nthat would fundamentally change the situation.\n  But, on the other hand, we need to understand that Taiwan now has a \ngovernment that is as accountable to its people as is our own \ngovernment. Although Taiwan had an authoritarian system until the late \n1980s, today it is an active democracy based on a market economy. With \nU.S. support, Taiwan made this transformation into a free market \ndemocracy. We should be looking at Taiwan as one of the great success \nstories of America's foreign policy.\n  And that means we need to treat Taiwan differently than in the past. \nIt is the 12th largest economy in the world. Taiwan is our 7th largest \nexport market. In fact, we sold more goods and services to Taiwan last \nyear than we did to China.\n  Once Taiwan joins the World Trade Organization, and I hope it is \nsoon, I believe that we should begin work on a free trade agreement \nwith Taiwan. I will shortly introduce legislation to provide fast track \nnegotiating authority for such a negotiation.\n  Taiwan has taken many measures to liberalize its economy in recent \nyears, especially in response to negotiations with the United States. \nWhile they await formally accession to the WTO, they are working hard \nto bring their laws and regulations into compliance with WTO \nrequirements. They still have a lot of work to do to complete their \nliberalization efforts. Sectors such as telecommunications, financial \nservices, and electronic commerce need to be freed up significantly. \nProtection of intellectual property needs to be improved. But a free \ntrade agreement would help lock in the important economic changes \nalready made, and it would also encourage continuing liberalization.\n  A free trade agreement with Taiwan would provide an even better \nmarket for American goods, services, and agricultural exports. It would \nreward Taiwan for the dramatic political and economic progress it has \nmade. And it would benefit our economy, enhance our security, and \npromote global growth.\n  China would probably object to a US-Taiwan free trade agreement. But \nthere would be no legal or diplomatic basis for such a protest. Taiwan \nis joining the WTO as a ``separate customs territory'' and will have \nall the rights and obligations of every other WTO member, including \nBeijing. We have been negotiating with Taiwan for years on market \naccess, trade, and regulatory issues. Taiwan is a member of APEC, the \nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. We must determine what will be \nU.S. policy toward Taiwan.\n  I recognize that this is an unusual proposal. I don't expect \nnegotiations on a free trade agreement to start right away. But it is a \nvision toward which we should all work.\n\n[[Page S5429]]\n\n  To conclude, I hope that President Chen has a useful stay in New \nYork. I also hope that we will see a meeting between President Chen and \nChinese President Jiang Zemin at the APEC summit in Shanghai in \nOctober. The dialogue that should emerge from such a meeting could help \nensure peace across the Taiwan Strait.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5429-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FOR EAST TIMOR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, the Standard Times of New \nBedford, MA, published an op-ed piece by Senator Kennedy on the \nsituation in East Timor, in which he discussed the legislation on East \nTimor that he introduced with Senator Chafee, which is also cosponsored \nby myself and Senators Feingold, Harkin, Kerry, Jeffords, and Reed. \nThis legislation recently passed the House of Representatives as part \nof the Foreign Relations Authorization Act.\n  Senator Kennedy's legislation would provide additional economic \nassistance for East Timor, which is struggling to overcome the violence \nand destruction perpetrated by Indonesian militias, with the support of \nthe Indonesian military, after the vote for independence in August \n1999. It would also provide for scholarships for East Timorese \nstudents, funding for the Peace Corps to start a program there, and \nother initiatives.\n  This legislation outlines a comprehensive approach to a new, positive \nrelationship between the United States and East Timor, including the \nestablishment of full diplomatic relations as soon as independence \ntakes place.\n  As one who, like Senator Kennedy, has admired the courage and \ndetermination of the East Timorese people and their capable leaders, \nXanana Gusmao and Jose Ramos-Horta, I commend him for this legislation \nand ask unanimous consent that his op-ed piece be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the New Bedford, MA Standard Times, May 16, 2001]\n\n                   Prepare Now for the New East Timor\n\n       Two leaders of the East Timor independence movement are in \n     Washington, D.C., this week for the first time since the \n     people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly for independence in \n     August 1999. Nobel Prize winner Jose Ramos-Horin spent 24 \n     years in exile rallying support for East Timor's independence \n     and will be foreign minister in the new government. Xanana \n     Gusmao led the domestic opposition and will be a prominent \n     figure in an independent East Timor. The goal of their visit \n     is to obtain the support of the Bush Administration and \n     Congress for their new country, and they deserve to receive \n     it.\n       East Timor's road to independence has been long and \n     violent. Portugal ruled East Timor for 550 years before \n     pulling out in August 1975. East Timor was independent for \n     four months before it was invaded by Indonesia in December \n     that year.

General Assembly and Security Council \n     strongly condemned the invasion, and never recognized \n     Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor.\n       After two decades of unrest, former Indonesian President B. \n     J. Habibie finally agreed to a referendum in January 1999. In \n     August that year, the people of East Timor voted \n     overwhelmingly in favor of independence from Indonesia, and \n     they did so at great personal risk. Before, during and after \n     the vote, the Indonesian military and anti-independence \n     militia groups killed more than a thousand people and \n     displaced thousands more, hoping to intimidate the \n     independence movement.\n       Although the militias succeeded in destroying 70 percent of \n     East Timor's infrastructure, they failed to derail East \n     Timor's desire for freedom.\n       On August 30 this year, looking to America as an example, \n     East Timor will elect a constituent assembly to decide which \n     form of democratic government to adopt.\n       It is a process that reminds us of our own Constitutional \n     Convention and would make our founders proud. A few months \n     after that, East Timor, which is currently governed by the \n     United Nations, will formally declare its independence. After \n     years of hardship, violence and death, a new democracy will \n     take its rightful place in the world. The new nation is a \n     great success story, but it is far from complete.\n       East Timor is rebuilding itself from ashes following 24 \n     years of Indonesian rule, and it needs international \n     assistance. It remains one of the poorest countries in Asia. \n     The annual per capita gross national product is $340. As many \n     as 100,000 East Timorese refugees languish in militia-\n     controlled refugee camps in West Timor, which is still part \n     of Indonesia and where there has been a sharply reduced \n     international presence since militias murdered three U.N. \n     workers last September.\n       In the aftermath of the violence in East Timor, the United \n     States has provided important humanitarian aid and assistance \n     for nation-building. But our assistance has been provided on \n     an ad hoc basis. We have made no commitment to a longterm \n     political investment in a newly independent East Timor, and \n     we should do so.\n       We should leave no doubt in the minds of any government \n     officials in Indonesia that the United States will recognize \n     and support the new nation of East Timor.\n       To advance this objective, I, along with Sen. Chafee, have \n     introduced legislation in the Senate to facilitate East \n     Timor's transition to independence.\n       Reps. Tom Lantos and Chris Smith have introduced similar \n     legislation in the House of Representatives. Its purpose is \n     to lay the groundwork for establishing a strong relationship \n     with East Timor, including a bilateral and multilateral \n     assistance program. Our legislation encourages President \n     Bush, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Trade \n     and Development Agency and other U.S. agencies to put in \n     place now the tools and programs necessary to create a \n     reliable trade and investment relationship with East Timor.\n       It provides a three-year commitment of $30 million in U.S. \n     assistance, including $2 million for a Peace Corps presence \n     and $1 million for a scholarship fund for East Timorese \n     students to study in the United States, and supports economic \n     assistance through international financial institutions.\n       To help professionalize the army, it authorizes the \n     president to provide excess defense materials and \n     international military education and training, if the \n     president certifies that doing so is in the interest of the \n     United States and will help promote human rights in East \n     Timor and the professionalization of East Timor's armed \n     forces. Our bill also supports efforts to ensure justice and \n     accountability for past atrocities in East Timor.\n       The bill specifically calls on the State Department to \n     establish diplomatic relations with East Timor as soon as \n     independence takes place. It took President Truman 10 minutes \n     to establish diplomatic relations with Israel in 1948. \n     President Bush should be able to do the same with East Timor \n     in 2001.\n       The people of East Timor have chosen democracy, and the \n     United States has a golden opportunity to help them create \n     their new democracy. We must prepare for that day now. The \n     great faith in the democratic process they showed by voting \n     for independence under the barrel of a gun must not go \n     unrewarded.\n       We should put U.S. governmental programs and resources in \n     place now to prepare for the reality of an independent East \n     Timor. If we wait until East Timor declares its independence \n     before we do the preliminary work, we will lose vital time \n     and do a disservice to both the United States and East Timor. \n     We must not miss this unique opportunity to help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5429-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5429-S5430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MIDDLE EAST VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, on May 18th, yet another \ngrave terrorist attack occurred in Netanya, the fifth such attack this \nyear. Six Israelis were killed and over one hundred wounded in the \nbombing.\n  The target of the attack was innocent civilians, targeted solely \nbecause they were Israelis. The recent bludgeoning to death of 14-year \nold Jewish boys in a cave demonstrates a new level of barbarism and \ninhumanity.\n  The Palestinian Authority is obligated, according to agreements it \nconcluded with the State of Israel, to prevent terrorism and to cease \nincitement in the areas under its jurisdiction.\n  Regrettably, the Palestinian Authority has abandoned its obligations \nand is committing acts of terrorism and inciting violence against \nIsraelis, both in Palestinian controlled media and in the curriculum \ntaught to its school-age children. With such hatred and venom spewed by \nPalestinian Government organs, it is hard to imagine there is any true \ndesire for peace, rather, there appears to be a deliberate attempt to \ndestroy any foundation for peace that is necessary among the \nPalestinian people.\n  The Israeli Government has made a renewal of peace negotiations with \nthe Palestinians its foremost goal. But negotiations cannot take place \nuntil there is a cessation of the violence.\n  The Government of Israel has repeated its desire to move forward in \naccordance with the four phases detailed in the recent report of the \nMitchell Fact Finding Committee:\n  A. A complete cessation of violence; B. A substantial cooling-off \nperiod, accompanied by confidence building measures--together with \nproof on the part of the PA that it intends to maintain the calm \n(arresting terrorists, ending incitement, etc.); C. The implementation \nof signed agreements; D. The conduct of negotiations on all outstanding \nissues.\n\n[[Page S5430]]\n\n  As Secretary Powell and the U.S. State Department prepare to re-enter \nthe difficult world of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, we can make a \nfew observations about the recent brutality and violence by the PA.\n  First, the attack puts the lie to the claim that Palestinian violence \nis directed against so-called Israeli ``occupation.''\n  Second, we can question the effectiveness of peace negotiations with \na group that embraces terrorism--and which belies the U.S. policy, that \nis, policy for the United States, that we do not negotiate with \nterrorists, while the Palestinian Authority was removed from the annual \nU.S. list of terrorists, it continues to commit acts of terrorism and \nwe have helped to reinvent the PA as a ``negotiating partner'' for the \nIsraelis. This looks hypocritical, dishonest and unrealistic.\n  Secretary Powell and the Department of State have an enormous \nundertaking in trying to find common ground between Israelis and \nPalestinians. The conflict appears intractable, and peace, despite \ndecades of efforts, remains elusive. Yet we can only keep trying--\ntrying to stop the bloodshed that seems synonymous with the Middle East \nand trying to seek stability in such an important and strategic part of \nthe world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5430-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION IN ALEXANDER v. SANDOVAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are a great many important policy \nissues that divide Democrats and Republicans. When we find certain \ncommon sense principles that we agree on, however, we should seize the \nopportunity and act on them.\n  I believe that we have such an opportunity today. On April 24, 2001, \nthe Supreme Court issued its latest in the never-ending sequence of 5-\nto-4 ``State's rights'' decisions, Alexander v. Sandoval. I rise to \nurge my colleagues to reaffirm our shared values by passing legislation \nto reverse the Court's decision in this case. By doing so, we can \nreinstate what was always Congress's intent, and reaffirm our nation's \ncommitment to civil rights for all Americans. Let me explain.\n  Let's start with the principle of cooperative federalism. Every year, \nwe in Congress send billions of Federal taxpayer dollars to the States \nto help fund education systems, health care, motor vehicle departments, \nlaw enforcement and other government services that every American is \nentitled to enjoy, no matter which State he or she lives in. That is \nthe essence of federalism: helping to fund the States to perform \ngovernment functions that are best performed at the local level. It is \nnot Republican, and it is not Democratic; it is common sense.\n  The Federal Government and Federal taxpayers count on the States to \nuse those Federal funds in a lawful manner, and most everyone would \nagree that the States should be accountable for doing so. President \nBush has made accountability the central guiding principle of his \neducation proposals. We have some immensely important differences of \nview on how to achieve accountability. But we should not lose sight of \nwhat unites us.\n  Republicans believe in accountability, and so do Democrats. We here \nin Washington owe the American people a duty, when we send their tax \ndollars to State and local authorities, to ensure that the people get a \nchance to hold those authorities accountable for using their money for \nthe public good, for the benefit of all the people, and in accordance \nwith the law of the land. That is not politics; it is common sense.\n  What has all this got to do with the Supreme Court? Well, 37-years \nago, Congress enacted perhaps the most important piece of legislation \nof the post-war era, the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VI of the \nCivil Rights Act is an accountability provision pure and simple. It \nprohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national \norigin, in any program or activity that receives Federal funds.\n  The Congress that passed the Civil Rights Act was committed to full \nand strong enforcement of civil rights. It recognized that \ndiscrimination comes in many forms. Governmental practices may be \nintentionally discriminatory or, more commonly, they may be \ndiscriminatory in their effect, because they have a disparate or \ndiscriminatory impact on minorities. To catch this more subtle but no \nless harmful form of discrimination, Congress authorized the Federal \nagencies that were responsible for awarding federal grants and \nadministering federal contracts to adopt regulations prohibiting \nFederal grantees and contractees from adopting policies that have the \neffect of discriminating.\n  There has never been any serious question about Congress's intent in \nthis matter. Before Sandoval, the Federal Courts of Appeals had \nuniformly affirmed the right of private individuals to bring civil \nsuits to enforce the disparate-impact regulations promulgated under \nTitle VI. The Supreme Court itself, in a 1979 case called Cannon v. \nUniversity of Chicago, had concluded that Title VI authorized an \nimplied right of action for victims of race, color, or national origin \ndiscrimination. And as Justice Stevens noted in his dissenting opinion \nin Sandoval, the plaintiff in Cannon had stated a disparate-impact \nclaim, not a claim of intentional discrimination.\n  I will not attempt in these brief remarks to go over all the reasons \nwhy Sandoval was incorrectly decided as a matter of Supreme Court \nprecedent. Justice Stevens does an excellent job in his dissent of \ndemonstrating how the activist conservatives on the Court rejected \ndecades of settled laws.\n  I will say this: The holding in Sandoval makes no sense as a matter \nof national policy. The lower courts in Sandoval found that the \ndefendant, the Alabama Department of Public Safety, was engaged in a \ndiscriminatory practice in violation of Federal regulations. The \nSupreme Court did not challenge that finding, and also accepted that \nthe regulations at issue were valid. Yet the Court's conservative \nmajority held that the victims of the discrimination had no right to \nsue to enforce the Federal regulations. You do not have to be liberal, \nand you do not have to be conservative, to be troubled by the notion \nthat a State can engage in unlawful discrimination and yet not be \naccountable in any court.\n  The good news is that the Sandoval holding is based on statutory \ninterpretation and not constitutional law. The Congress is therefore \nfree to overturn it, and we should do so at the very first opportunity. \nBy doing so, we will fully preserve what I have called cooperative \nfederalism. We will continue to provide funding assistance to the \nStates. At the same time, we will prove that we are serious about the \nright of the American people to hold their government accountable in \nthe most basic sense, accountable for obeying the law. And we will \nprove that we are as serious about the civil rights of minorities as \nthe groundbreaking Congress that passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  Fixing what the Court has broken should be a bipartisan undertaking. \nThis is not about being a Republican or a Democrat; it is about \nreaffirming the will of the people as expressed by the Congress, \nreaffirming that the American people are entitled to have a government \nthat is accountable, and reaffirming that in America, discrimination is \nnot acceptable, whether it is done openly and crassly, or more \ninvidiously and subtly. The unfair effects are the same and deserve \nredress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5430-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5430-S5431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a heinous crime that occurred April 25, 2000 \nin Germantown, MD. According to the victim, she and her partner and \ntheir 11-year-old daughter have been the victims of repeated anti-gay \nslurs. The victims have had rocks and other items thrown at their home \nbecause they are gay and some neighbors ``wanted us out of the \nneighborhood.'' The incident in question occurred after a verbal \naltercation between the victim's child and the perpetrator's child, \nculminating in the victim's attack by the perpetrator. When police \narrived on the scene, the victim was lying on the ground; her hand was \nbleeding; she had been kicked\n\n[[Page S5431]]\n\nrepeatedly in the head by the perpetrator and his 12-year-old son \n(while the son was allegedly yelling, ``I'm going to kill you, dyke b--\n-h.''); her face was swollen; she had footprints on her shirt; and \nmarks on her neck and chest which required overnight hospitalization. \nDespite this, the police did not handle the incident as a hate crime \nand said that it was against their regulations to arrest the \nperpetrator because they had not witnessed the attack.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5431-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5431-S5433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    KIRK O'DONNELL MEMORIAL LECTURE\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I had the pleasure of attending the Kirk \nO'Donnell Memorial Lecture on American Politics last month to hear our \ndistinguished former colleague, Daniel Patrick Moynihan. No one worked \nharder on public policy or served with a more distinguished record than \nhe. His lecture offered an enlightening perspective on current \ndiscussions about Social Security and I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe reprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n A Thrift Savings Component for Social Security: Bipartisanship Beckons\n\n                      (By Daniel Patrick Moynihan)\n\n       I have entitled this lecture ``A Thrift Savings Component \n     for Social Security: Bipartisanship Beckons.'' I have done so \n     not without a measure of unease. For it was our own Kirk \n     O'Donnell who famously declared Social Security to be ``the \n     third rail of politics.'' But then Kirk was ever one to take \n     a dare. And I would note that the third rail was first \n     installed on the I.R.T. subway in Manhattan, the Big Dig of \n     its day, which Charles Francis Murphy had built as a favor \n     for a friend.\n       But allow me a brief explanation for such reckless abandon \n     at a time in life when serenity ought properly be one's \n     object.\n       The end of the cold war did it!\n       On December 7, 1988 Mikhail Gorbachev went before the \n     General Assembly of the United Nations to declare in effect \n     that the Soviet ``experiment'' was over. The French \n     Revolution of 1789, he said, and the Russian Revolution of \n     1917 had had a powerful impact ``on the very nature of the \n     historic process.'' But, ``today a new world is emerging and \n     we must look for new ways.'' That was then, now was \n     different. ``This new stage,'' he continued, ``requires the \n     freeing of international relations from ideology.'' The world \n     should seek ``unity through diversity.'' Then this: ``We in \n     no way aspire to be the bearer of the ultimate truth.''\n       But of course since 1917 and before the essence of Marxist-\n     Leninism had been the claim to be the bearers of ``the \n     ultimate truth.'' No longer; it was all over. And indeed in \n     short order the Soviet Union itself would vanish.\n       For someone of the generation that had been caught up in \n     the second world war and the cold war that followed, \n     Gorbachev's address could fairly be described as one of the \n     extraordinary events of the twentieth century. All but \n     unimaginable at mid-century. I had been in the Navy toward \n     the end of World War II and was briefly called back during \n     the Korean War. I was in London at the time. Early one \n     morning we mustered in Grosvenor Square and by late afternoon \n     were crossing Holland on our way to the naval base at \n     Bremerhaven. Partly, well mostly, for show, I had brought \n     along a copy of Hannah Arendt's newly published The Origins \n     of Totalitarianism. I opened to the first page, read the \n     first paragraph to myself, then read it aloud.\n       ``Two world wars in one generation, separated by an \n     uninterrupted chain of local wars and revolutions, followed \n     by no peace for the victor have ended in the anticipation of \n     a third World War between the two remaining world powers. \n     This moment of anticipation is like the calm that settles \n     after all hopes have died.''\n       Silence. At length the senior officer present allowed: \n     ``There must be a bar car somewhere on this train.''\n       That war never came and soon there were signs of \n     instability in the Soviet empire. In 1975 I returned from a \n     spell in India convinced that the Czarist/Soviet imperium \n     would soon break up, as had all the other European dominions \n     following that Second World War. Shortly thereafter I was at \n     the United Nations when the Soviet Under Secretary for \n     Security Council Affairs defected to the United States. The \n     diplomat, a man of great intelligence, had simply ceased to \n     believe any of the things he was required to say. Doctrine \n     was receding even as ethnicity was rising.\n       Then there was Moscow in 1987. I was there on a mission of \n     possible importance. Was treated with great courtesy, \n     including a tour of Lenin's apartment in the Kremlin. Behind \n     his desk was a small bookcase, with two shelves of French \n     language and two of English language authors. They could well \n     have been Lenin's or possibly were put there for the \n     delectation of visiting intellectuals in the 1930s. No \n     matter. I found that I had personally met three of the \n     writers. Next day I called on Boris Yeltsin, then Mayor of \n     Moscow. Our excellent ambassador introduced me, recounting \n     the authors I had recognized. It was clear Yeltsin had \n     never heard of any of them. Could care less. After a pause \n     he looked at me, and through a translator declared, ``I \n     know who you are and where you come from. And what I want \n     to know is how the hell am I supposed to run Moscow with \n     1929 rent controls?''\n       Housing. Fairly basic, and in desperate short supply. At \n     the other end of the consumer spectrum, as we were leaving \n     what was still Leningrad, I told our KGB handler that some \n     constituents in New York had given me the names of relatives, \n     hoping I might call them. But it seemed there was no \n     telephone book in our room. Perhaps he could find one for me. \n     He went off; came back. There was no telephone book in \n     Leningrad. None that is available to the public.\n       In the years preceding and the years following this brief \n     adventure it appeared to me that ethnicity was the central \n     conceptual flaw of Marxism-Leninism. The workers of the world \n     were not going to unite. The Red Flag, red being the color of \n     the blood of all mankind, was not going to fly atop the \n     capitols of all the world. I continue to think that, and to \n     suppose that the 21st century will see even more ethnic \n     division. But I have added to my views a further component to \n     the failure of communism which is nothing more mundane than \n     consumerism.\n       It serves to recall the fixed belief of the early Marxists \n     that free markets--capitalism in that ugly French term--would \n     bring about a steady lowering of living standards, from which \n     a politicized proletariat would rise in revolt. In John \n     Kenneth Galbraith's phrase, ``The prospect of the progressive \n     immiseration of the masses, worsening crises and . . . bloody \n     revolution.'' But as a new generation of Soviet leaders \n     ventured abroad, they came to realize that nothing of the \n     sort was happening in the West. While at home . . . In the \n     end they simply gave up.\n       Let us see if these two categories can be related in terms \n     of our future as the one remaining world power, to use the \n     phrase of the moment. Which will not necessarily or may not \n     be current two or three generations hence. Unless, in my \n     view, we ought to tend to certain domestic issues very soon \n     now.\n       Begin with ethnicity. It would be just forty years ago that \n     Nathan Glazer and I finished Beyond the Melting Pot. Our \n     subject was ``The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians and \n     Irish of New York City,'' but we had something more in mind. \n     Marxist theory predicted, you might say, that these groups \n     would meld together as a united and militant mass, as \n     espoused by assorted left-wing organizations. We argued that \n     nothing of the sort had happened, or would; if anything, \n     groups tended to become rather more distinctive with time.\n       We wrote that ours was a beginning book, and after forty \n     years I can report that a more than worthy successor has come \n     along.\n       In yet another remarkable achievement, The New Americans: \n     How the Melting Pot Can Work Again, Michael Barone, drawing \n     in part on our earlier paradigm finds parallels with new \n     immigrant groups, notably Latins and Asians, members of the \n     largest wave of immigration in our history. Demography is a \n     kind of destiny. If there are any parallels in history, and \n     there are, should we not look to a new era of inequality, \n     competition, and conflict of the sort we experienced in the \n     late 19th and early 20th century? I would think we ought, and \n     would further contend that we got through that earlier time \n     in our history in considerable measure through the social \n     provision made by governments of that era, culminating in the \n     New Deal of the 1930s. I would add, gratuitously if you \n     like, that much of that social contract began with New \n     York Governor Alfred E. Smith, who rose out of the \n     quintessential melting pot, the lower east side of \n     Manhattan.\n       Here, then is a proposition. Our response to the end of the \n     cold war has been singularly muted, both in foreign and \n     domestic affairs. In particular there has been no domestic \n     legislation of any consequence. Neither as reward or \n     precaution. (The G.I. Bill of Rights of 1944 was a bit of \n     both. A reward to the veterans, and a measure to moderate the \n     anticipated return of high unemployment.) I can envision a \n     similar combination, albeit in reverse order.\n       In a word, unless we act quickly, we are going to lose \n     Social Security established in that first era as a guaranteed \n     benefit for retired workers, widowed mothers, and the \n     disabled and their dependents.\n       We have just fifteen years before outlays of Social \n     Security exceed income. This after eighty years of solvency \n     and surplus. Again, demography. Social Security began as a \n     pay-as-you-go system. The population cohort in the work force \n     paid taxes that provided pensions for the population cohort \n     that had retired. A Social Security card was issued to each \n     worker, with the faint suggestion that there was a savings \n     account of some sort somewhere in the system. Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt famously told Luther C. Gulick, a member of his \n     committee on government organization, that while it might \n     indeed be a\n\n[[Page S5432]]\n\n     bit deceptive, that account number meant that ``no damned \n     politician'' could ever take his Social Security away. But \n     all understood the reality.\n       Problem is that in the early years there were thirty odd \n     workers providing benefits for one retiree. No longer. Today \n     there are three. By 2030 there will be two.\n       To repeat, as the Trustees now calculate, by 2016 the \n     system will pay out more money than it takes in. There is \n     nominally a trust fund representing surpluses accumulated \n     over the years, but to redeem the bonds will require general \n     revenue. The system is no longer self-financing, with all \n     that implies.\n       Obviously we ought to forestall insolvency. But would it \n     not be well, at the same time, to address the matter of \n     intergenerational transfer. This was well and good when there \n     were so few retirees. No longer. Would it not then be prudent \n     to enable workers within the Social Security system to \n     accumulate savings of their own to be used as they see fit \n     during retirement?\n       I will argue that we have to do the first, and if we do, in \n     the process we would be enabled to do the second.\n       The workings of such a system are not complex, or so I \n     would contend. Mentored by David Podoff, I introduced a bill \n     in the 105th Congress. With some refinements I reintroduced \n     it in the last Congress, the 106th, as S. 21, a first day \n     bill. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a fellow member of the \n     Finance Committee, was a co-sponsor.\n       Four measures are required to ensure solvency:\n       First. Social Security benefits are tied to the Consumer \n     Price Index compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some \n     forty years ago as an Assistant Secretary of Labor I was \n     nominally in charge of the B.L.S. where, in the aftermath of \n     a study carried out for the National Bureau of Economic \n     Research, it was agreed that the C.P.I. overstates inflation. \n     It can't be helped; it is in the nature of the beast. It \n     simply needs to be corrected. A 0.8 percentage point drop \n     would do it nicely. We need normal taxation of benefits; as \n     with other pensions.\n       Second. We need to bring all newly-hired State and local \n     employees into the system. (It is still optional, a holdover \n     from the 1930s when the Supreme Court would probably have \n     ruled that the Federal Government could not tax State \n     governments or subdivisions thereof.) Well down the line \n     we will need to raise the retirement age once again. We \n     did this in 1983, providing a gradual ascent to age 67 by \n     2027. This will one day need to rise by similar small \n     steps to, say, 70 at mid-century. But consider; we \n     estimate that persons who retire at age 70 in the year \n     2060 will on average live another 17 years. Surely a \n     goodly spell. And note that the majority of today's \n     beneficiaries retire before reaching 65. Benefits are \n     lower, but the option is there and most persons take it. \n     (It would be well for the now freestanding Social Security \n     Administration to do some survey research to sort out the \n     different reasons folk take this option.)\n       Third. We should tax benefits in the same way other \n     retirement payments are taxed. We began partial taxation in \n     1983.\n       Fourth. We would increase the maximum computation period \n     over time from 35 to 38 years, and by stages increase the \n     OASDI contribution and benefit base to $99,900.\n       Now to a thrift savings plan. The payroll tax began in 1935 \n     at 1 percent for employee and employer. It rose by degrees \n     until in 1977 it was set at a combined rate of 12.4 percent, \n     scheduled to take place in 2011. However, a combination of \n     miscalculation, the Consumer Price Index, and misfortune, a \n     sharp inflation owing to oil price increases, led to a sudden \n     crisis. In 1982 the revered Robert J. Myers judged that under \n     the existing law ``the OASDI trust fund will very likely be \n     unable to pay benefits on time beginning in July, 1983.'' A \n     Presidential Commission was created, and in the end it \n     succeeded. Deficit was avoided. But the date that the maximum \n     rate of 12.4 percent to kick in was advanced to 1990. Hence \n     the current surplus.\n       We argue, however, that with the adjustments I have \n     outlined, the earlier 10.4 percent payroll tax will provide \n     present retirement benefits for the required 75-year period.\n       This is crucial. We must absolutely guarantee that the \n     present benefit structure will continue in place before we \n     start devising a thrift savings component. To do otherwise is \n     to invite the most shrill protests of raiding a sacred trust \n     for the benefit of Wall Street, and so on.\n       However, we can do both. And oughtn't we? At this point in \n     time our income tax system is remarkably progressive. The top \n     5 percent of taxpayers pay 53.8 percent of income tax. The \n     bottom 50 percent pay 4.2 percent. But Social Security is \n     paid on the first dollar of income however low that income \n     might be.\n       We could, of course, repeal the 1977 increase. It would \n     mean some money in people's pockets, but not so much as you'd \n     notice.\n       Or we could start thrift savings accounts for the work \n     force at large, much along the lines of the Federal \n     government program begun in the 1980s. An add on, not a \n     ``carve out.'' Employees would choose among a number of \n     plans, from government securities to market funds, and switch \n     about from time to time. It is not unreasonable to forecast \n     that such funds would double every ten years; making for a \n     sizable portfolio after, say, forty years. A third to half a \n     million dollars. As much a twice that for two-earner \n     families.\n       An argument up front for doing this is that it would \n     immediately affect the Personal Savings Rate which literally \n     vanished in the 1990s. In 1980 annual personal saving as a \n     percent of disposable personal income was 10.2 percent. By \n     1990, 7.8 percent. By 2000, -0.1 percent. Last February -1.3 \n     percent.\n       I don't claim to understand this, but surely it needs \n     attention. And I assume a national thrift savings plan would \n     help.\n       Why, then, has our proposal been so little welcomed in, \n     well, the Democratic Party and organizations with similar \n     political and social perspectives? A possible partial \n     explanation is that in the early 1970s conservative \n     economists began talking up the so-called ``Chilean \n     model'' in which all social insurance funds are invested \n     in private securities. Not a good idea, I would think. But \n     an idea withal. And we need ideas.\n       I would hope we could be spared a left-right imbroglio \n     here. The risk, as Kenneth S. Apfel, the first Commissioner, \n     1997-2001, of the newly freestanding Social Security \n     Administration, has recently written that if we do we will \n     end up in a ``stand off.'' Which is to say we will do \n     nothing, until there is nothing to be done. The system goes \n     into deficit and becomes politicized beyond recognition.\n       Apfel makes four proposals. First, those ``on the left side \n     of the political spectrum'' have to give up the notion that \n     ``future Social Security benefits can never be reduced even \n     modestly.'' Our bill would have done that modestly. (Although \n     a C.P.I. correction only reduces the rate of growth.) Second, \n     he continues, those on the left must need to give up the \n     stand ``That mandatory retirement savings proposals are out \n     of the question.'' That I fear is now doctrine of the old \n     cadre of Social Security administrators. But why persons on \n     the left would oppose providing workers with a measure of \n     wealth would seem a mystery. (But, alas, may not be.) \n     Respected economists such as Martin Feldstein have proposed \n     investment accounts as an extension of what is already going \n     on with the various private retirement savings plans already \n     in place and widely in practice.\n       As for the ``right,'' Apfel argues that first they must \n     give up the notion ``That private savings accounts should be \n     carved out of Social Security benefits.'' He means that money \n     be diverted from providing the existing benefit schedule. To \n     which I surely agree. To say again, we propose an add on, not \n     a carve out. Secondly, he contends the right must give up the \n     notion ``That future Social Security revenues should never be \n     increased even modestly.'' Again, agreed.\n       As for the current surplus in the funds, Apfel is more \n     adventurous than I might be, or my colleague, David Podoff. \n     President Clinton briefly mentioned the idea of investing \n     some of the surplus in private equities. I suspect that would \n     have been Apfel's idea, and he holds to it. Keep in mind that \n     between now and 2015 we will accumulate a surplus of near $5 \n     trillion. If it is not invested outside government, it will \n     be spent on other things. And so a respectful hearing is in \n     order, withal I would be cautious. We have learned to manage \n     private and public pension funds without interfering with \n     markets. But direct Federal investment poses temptation. Or \n     invites blunder.\n       But what really are the prospects of such a transformation \n     in our Social Security system? I know we could do it, for we \n     have done. In the early 1980s we were on the edge of \n     insolvency. A bipartisan Presidential Commission was \n     stalemated, but solutions were worked out in a final two \n     weeks of intense, albeit secret negotiations. In his account \n     of the events, Artful Work, Paul Light cites my observation \n     at the time: ``Only by defining the problem as manageable, \n     can you manage it.'' It may also be worth noting, as recorded \n     in an article in the current issue of Foreign Affairs, \n     Germany, France, Spain, and Italy are evidently going to have \n     to move from pay-as-you-go state pension systems to \n     investment in securities.\n       The 2000 election campaign may have seen a breakthrough. \n     The Republican candidate called for a thrift savings \n     component. Let it be clear that there was no mention, has \n     been no mention, of the preconditions I set forth earlier. \n     Still. The Democratic candidate dismissed the idea as \n     ``risky.'' And more. William Galston, a professor of \n     government associated with Democratic politics later \n     observed, with professorial candor, ``He [Governor Bush] \n     touched the third rail of politics. We turned on the juice. \n     Nothing happened.'' Indeed polling during the campaign showed \n     voters approved the program by fair to considerable margins. \n     And so in his first address to a Joint Session of Congress, \n     now President Bush called for a thrift savings component to \n     Social Security that would provide ``access to wealth and \n     independence'' for all. Again, no mention of the unpleasant \n     preliminaries. Even so, let it be recorded that the 21st \n     century began with an avowedly conservative president \n     espousing perhaps the most progressive social insurance \n     measure since the New Deal. Come to think, though, Theodore \n     Roosevelt might have liked it. Even those early 20th century \n     British conservatives who called for a ``property owning \n     democracy.''\n       We are not to expect that anything like this will happen \n     soon. But it is scarcely too soon to get serious about the \n     subject.\n       In a typically concise article in The Wall Street Journal \n     of April 26, Albert R. Hunt described ``An Electorate Up for \n     Grabs.'' Looking at recent polls he finds ``The bottom line: \n     Neither party commands a comfortable majority.'' He cites \n     Robert Teeter: ``Right now\n\n[[Page S5433]]\n\n     . . . neither side has the makings of a governing \n     coalition.'' Then James A. Johnson, a Democratic counsel, who \n     concludes: ``If both realize that, it'll drive them to \n     bipartisan solutions.''\n       Could that be a Thrift Savings Component for Social \n     Security?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5433-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMENDING BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER AND DR. BARRY ZUCKERMAN FOR THEIR \n                  ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF POOR CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the past 8 years, the Boston Medical \nCenter has had a unique program in place to give legal help to \ndisadvantaged children and their families. Under the leadership of Dr. \nBarry Zuckerman, the hospital's chief of pediatrics, the Family \nAdvocacy Program was established to fight the legal and administrative \nproblems that doctors often face when trying to improve children's \nhealth in ways that ``pills and surgery cannot.'' Dr. Zuckerman \nbelieves that we must impact the whole child. As he puts it, ``you \ncan't separate out a child's organ functions from the rest of his body \nand the context of his environment.'' That is why at Boston Medical \nCenter, the hospital that treats more poor people than any other in \nMassachusetts, Dr. Zuckerman and fellow pediatricians decided to get \ntheir own lawyers to advocate on behalf of these poor children and \nfamilies.\n  The three lawyers in the program do what they can to pressure \nnegligent landlords to improve living conditions, help families apply \nfor food stamps, pressure insurance companies to pay for baby formula \nand other things to help prevent child illness. Recently, the New York \nTimes did a story on the program, recognizing the good it has done for \nthe disadvantaged families of Massachusetts. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 16, 2001]\n\n           Boston Medical Center Turns to Lawyers for a Cure\n\n                          (By Carey Goldberg)\n\n       BOSTON, May 15--A doctor gets very tired of this kind of \n     thing: sending a child with asthma home to an apartment full \n     of roaches and mold; telling the parents of an anemic toddler \n     to buy more and healthier food when they clearly do not have \n     a cent; seeing babies who live in unheated apartments come in \n     again and again with lung ailments.\n       At Boston Medical Center, the hospital that treats more \n     poor people than any other in Massachusetts, pediatricians \n     got so tired of it that they decided to try a radical \n     solution: getting their own lawyers.\n       That is, a staff of three lawyers, right in the hospital--\n     and on ``walk-in Mondays,'' right in the pediatrics clinic--\n     now fights the legal and administrative battles that the \n     doctors deem necessary to improve children's health in ways \n     that pills and surgery cannot. The program, which goes far \n     beyond the social work that hospitals customarily provide, is \n     all but unique nationwide, but doctors here say they hope it \n     becomes a model.\n       ``We're trying to think out of the box,'' said Dr. Barry \n     Zuckerman, the hospital's chief of pediatrics. ``I want an \n     impact on the whole child, since you can't separate out a \n     child's organ functions from the rest of his body and the \n     context of his environment.''\n       That means that the lawyers of the Family Advocacy Program \n     at the hospitals do things like pressuring recalcitrant \n     landlords, helping families apply for food stamps and \n     persuading insurance companies to pay for baby formula. With \n     more than 300 referrals a year, they cannot go to court much, \n     but they can help poor families navigate the administrative \n     byways. And they can help doctors make phone calls or write \n     letters to get their small patients what they need.\n       Among other things, ``we help doctors put things in \n     legalese,'' said Ellen Lawton, a staff lawyer and project \n     director. ``They don't teach that in medical school.''\n       That helps the doctors, and the doctors help the lawyers \n     through the medical heft they can throw behind a legal or \n     administrative request.\n       When a doctor writes a letter about a child's need for, \n     say, special education classes or a mold-free apartment, \n     ``it's not as confrontational,'' Ms. Lawton said. ``It's \n     like, `This is what the kids need for their health,' and \n     who's going to argue with that?''\n       The Boston Medical Center lawyers knew of just one other \n     full-fledged program like theirs, a new one in Hartford run \n     at Connecticut Children's Medical Center, in partnership with \n     the Center for Children's Advocacy at the University of \n     Connecticut Law School. There, said the advocacy center's \n     director, Martha Stone, ``it took a while for medical \n     personnel to exactly understand the concept of the medical-\n     legal partnership project, because lawyers make people \n     nervous.''\n       ``So,'' Ms. Stone said, ``they had to overcome the bias \n     that we were in there looking at malpractice issues. We were \n     in there doing poverty issues which would affect health \n     outcomes. So it's taken a lot of education on the part of the \n     lawyer to have the medical staff understand.''\n       At Boston Medical Center, where the Family Advocacy Program \n     has run since 1993, the program is well accepted by now but \n     is still exploring ways to help poor families and looking for \n     ways to expand. The walk-in lawyers' hours began just this \n     winter, for example, and have found plenty of takers.\n       One recent Monday, the mother of a diabetic girl stopped in \n     to see Pamela C. Tames, a staff lawyer, about an \n     administrative hearing scheduled for the next day on whether \n     her daughter should qualify for federal disability money. The \n     girl's diabetes was still poorly regulated, said the mother, \n     who would not let her name be used, and she frequently had to \n     miss school and stay in bed when her blood-sugar levels went \n     bad. The mother, who is on welfare, had no lawyer of her own \n     and had been denied requests for disability.\n       ``They say being diabetic is not a disability,'' she said, \n     ``I think it is a disability if a mother has to stay at home \n     and come get the child from school if the child constantly \n     gets sick.''\n       She came to the law clinic, the mother said, ``because I \n     need to know how to represent my case.''\n       Ms. Tames told her how, beginning with the suggestion that \n     she get an extension from the judge so she could present her \n     case better.\n       In many ways, the lawyers at the medical center act as \n     typical legal services lawyers, but they describe various \n     forms of synergy with the doctors they help. For one thing, \n     doctors, they say, have become more willing to ask patients \n     questions like, ``Do you have enough food?'' now that they \n     have lawyers who can help if the answer is no.\n       Before, Ms. Lawton said, ``they didn't want to screen for \n     something they could do nothing about.''\n       The Family Advocacy Program said its director, Jean Zotter, \n     is meant to work as preventive medicine; it can catch \n     problems early because patients' families are more likely to \n     confide troubles to doctors than to agency bureaucrats, and \n     to trust the information they receive in a clinic, she said.\n       ``Traditional medicine can treat the effects of poverty,'' \n     Ms. Zotter said, ``but this is a program that hopes to \n     intervene so that poverty won't have the effects it has on \n     children's health.''\n       The greatest challenge for would-be imitators of the \n     program, its lawyers say, is probably getting financing for \n     such a hybrid organism. The Boston program costs about \n     $175,000 a year; it is paid for mainly by city money for \n     welfare-to-work transitions, because it helps many families \n     trying to cross that bridge. The Connecticut program, which \n     has one staff lawyer, got a three-year, $260,000 grant from \n     the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving.\n       But Dr. Zuckerman has been known to unleash national \n     phenomena before. He founded Reach Out and Read, a program \n     beloved of the Clinton and Bush White Houses alike, which \n     makes books a part of pediatric care. It gives children a new \n     book at each checkup and has spread to hundreds of pediatric \n     clinics around the country.\n       ``I don't see what I'm doing with these nontraditional \n     programs as just add-ons,'' Dr. Zuckerman said. ``What I'm \n     trying to do is change pediatric care so it can have more of \n     an impact.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5433-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5433-S5434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RETIREMENT OF COMMANDER THOMAS K. RICHEY, UNITED STATES COAST GUARD\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my congratulations to \na fine Coast Guard officer, Commander Thomas K. Richey, who is retiring \nthis month after more than 20 years of dedicated service to this \ncountry. Commander Richey served as a Legislative Fellow in my personal \noffice from 1996 to 1998. During that time he was responsible for \nmaritime, transportation and environmental issues that fell under the \njurisdiction of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee. In 1998 he accompanied me to Kyoto, Japan during the \nnegotiations of the Kyoto Protocol for controlling greenhouse gases.\n  Throughout his long and distinguished career Commander Richey has \ndemonstrated superb managerial and leadership skills. Tom has served in \na variety of demanding billets including Operations Officer of Coast \nGuard Group Mobile, Alabama, Commanding Officer of Coast Guard Station \nAtlantic City, New Jersey and Deputy Program Manager for acquisition of \nCutter and station boats. Along the way Tom has been awarded five Coast \nGuard Commendation Medals with Operational Distinguishing Device and \none Coast Guard Achievement Medal with the ``O'' device and numerous \nother team and unit commendations.\n\n[[Page S5434]]\n\n  When Tom left my personal office in 1998 he became the Commandant's \nLiaison to the United States Senate. This is a top billet reserved for \nonly the finest the service has to offer. His performance in both my \npersonal office and the Senate has been outstanding. As many of my \ncolleagues know, Tom was always quick to respond to any of our \nquestions or concerns and was an invaluable tool in helping us respond \nto our constituents whenever a Coast Guard issue arose. I am grateful \nfor having had the opportunity to work so closely with Tom.\n  I offer again my congratulations to Commander Richey and his lovely \nwife Maureen who reside in Maryland with their two children Patricia \nand Tommy. I expect great things of this outstanding officer in the \nfuture. Mr. President, I yield the balance of my time to my colleagues, \nSenators Breaux and DeWine who wish to express their appreciation as \nwell to Commander Richey for his dedicated service to this country.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I am honored to join today Senator Kerry on the occasion \nof Commander Thomas Richey's retirement from the United States Coast \nGuard.\n  Senator Kerry and I both serve on the Oceans and Fisheries \nSubcommittee, and in fact we have sat next to each other for years \nduring committee executive sessions, hearings and other subcommittee \nfora. It was during these occasions that I first came to know Commander \nRichey. I would classify the period of 1996-1998 as a very busy time \nfor the subcommittee. During this period, Tom was instrumental in \nadvising Senator Kerry and subcommittee members in general on crucial \noceans and fisheries, and maritime issues.\n  On a more personal note, I sincerely appreciate Tom's assistance and \ndiligent follow through in support of the issues and concerns of my \nconstituents.\n  It brings me and all Americans great pride in knowing that the Coast \nGuard is represented by individuals with such high ideals, integrity \nand dedication to duty. I know of the sacrifices made by Commander \nRichey and his family and offer my congratulations and personal thanks \nfor a job well done. I wish Tom the best of luck in all future \nendeavors.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I commend and congratulate Commander Thomas Richey of the \nUnited States Coast Guard for his more than 20 years of service to our \ncountry. Commander Richey has had a distinguished career of public \nservice in defense of our great nation. I greatly appreciate all he has \ndone to assist me and my staff over the past three years with maritime \ntransportation issues on the Great Lakes.\n  Additionally, Commander Richey played a vital part in helping me gain \na better understanding of the varied and critical role our Coast Guard \nplays in the war on drugs. I've been fortunate to travel with Commander \nRichey, where I had the opportunity to observe, first-hand, Coast Guard \ndrug interdiction efforts off the coast of the island of Hispanola and \nPuerto Rico.\n  Commander Richey's accomplishments have been great and his presence \nhere on Capitol Hill will be sorely missed.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \nto bring special attention to an area of service that I find \nparticularly important, volunteerism. As we tackle, some of our \nnation's most pressing needs and problems, we should be promoting and \nencouraging volunteer activities in our communities.\n  The importance of volunteering was taught to me as a child. I want to \nensure now that we all are mindful of the lessons that volunteering \nteaches, such as a sense of community and compassion for others. I \nbelieve we should remind ourselves of the important role that \nvolunteers play in the delivery of human services.\n  Volunteers provide an invaluable service to our communities and our \ncitizens. Their presence and contributions put the ``caring'' back into \ncaregiving. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the \ncontributions volunteers make to long-term care for our nation's \nseniors.\n  For example, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a philanthropic \nhealth care organization, has been supporting the creative delivery of \nhealth care and health systems for years. In my home state of Arkansas, \nwe are working with the Johnson Foundation in a program entitled \n``Faith in Action.''\n  ``Faith in Action'' is a faith-based initiative that encourages \nvolunteerism as a strategy for meeting the needs of the chronically \nill. This program provides seed money to fund partnerships between \ninterfaith coalitions and other community organizations, such as Area \nAgencies on Aging, senior centers, and hospitals. All of these \norganizations share a common goal--to provide volunteer care to their \nneighbors in need.\n  These groups provide a variety of services, including organizing \noutreach to the homebound; training group leaders who oversee outreach \nministries; locating homebound people who have lost touch with their \ncommunities; recruiting volunteers from church congregations and \ncommunities; connecting with local medical and social services; and \nproviding emotional support services to community members.\n  The efforts of this dedicated group have brought much-needed support \nback into our Arkansas communities and are changing the lives of \nthousands of Arkansans. We are eternally grateful to leaders like \nBishop Kenneth W. Hicks of United Methodist Church and Mr. Will Dublin, \nwho have made a tremendous commitment to fostering and sustaining Faith \nIn Action programs in Arkansas.\n  Next week, these men and many other Arkansas community leaders and \nvolunteers will join me in Little Rock for a special event entitled \n``Caring Across the Continuum,'' where we will consider new strategies \nto promote and encourage volunteer services to assist the aging. With \ntheir contributions and energy, I believe we can make a real difference \nin the quality of care we extend to our state's population of seniors.\n  I commend these volunteers for their efforts, and I encourage them to \ncontinue setting the example for us as we seek legislative remedies for \nour nation's needs. If there is one thing I have come to appreciate \nabout public policy and planning, it is that we are incapable of paying \nfor everything that we need as a nation. Nor should we expect to do so.\n  Volunteers play a vital role in filling the gaps in our health care \nand social services systems. The mere act of volunteering encourages us \nto look outside ourselves, which in turn nurtures the growth of caring \ncommunities. Let's encourage the rest of our nation to consider such \nefforts as we look to the future and seek to re-weave the moral fabric \nof our country with the qualities of volunteerism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5434-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5434-S5435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO ROBERT H. FOSTER, PUBLISHER AND MODEL CITIZEN\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute\n\n[[Page S5435]]\n\nto Robert H. Foster of Dover, NH, publisher of the distinguished New \nHampshire newspapers Foster's Daily Democrat and the Laconia Citizen, \nand a number of other papers, in honor of his 80th birthday which he \ncelebrated on May 17. The newspaper is the longest continually managed \nand owned periodical by direct descendants of its founder with the \nfamily name in its banner.\n  I have known Bob for nearly 20 years. He is man of impeccable \ncharacter, commitment to his community, and devotion to his family. His \ndedication to journalistic excellence has won him the respect of many \npoliticians in the Granite State, no matter what philosophy or party \naffiliation. Robert Foster is known for his fairness, and for \nimpressing upon his writers and editors that ``integrity matters.''\n  Robert and his wife, Terri, have been the driving force behind the \nsuccess of the newspaper. Foster's Daily Democrat is rich in history \ndating back to the founding father of the newspaper, Joshua Lane \nFoster. On June 18, 1873, Joshua published the first edition of the \nDover area newspaper. Robert assumed ownership of the newspaper upon \nthe death of his father, Frederick Foster, on November 7, 1956. Robert \nhas worked diligently to ensure that the newspaper continually \nmaintains a standard of professionalism.\n  Today, as in 1873, Robert understands the importance of keeping the \ncitizens of his community abreast of information which affects the \nquality of life in the Seacoast and the Lakes Region. Robert and \nFoster's Daily Democrat are a mainstay in the community, providing the \nlatest news and information to their readers.\n  As members of the greater Dover community, Robert and Terri have been \ngenerous benefactors. Among other accolades, they have been honored as \n``Citizens of the Year'' in Dover.\n  Robert, a World War II and Korean conflict veteran, has also served \non the Board of Governors with the New England Newspaper Association \nand is a former Trustee at the University of New Hampshire.\n  Bob and Terri have three children: Catherine Hayward, Patrice Foster \nand Robert F. Foster. They are also proud grandparents of Catherine and \nGregg Hayward and Samuel and Joshua Foster.\n  I commend Robert Foster for his numerous contributions to his \ncommunity and our state. He is an exemplary leader who has gained the \nrespect of those who know him. It is an honor and a privilege to \nrepresent him in the U.S. Senate, and I am proud to call him my friend. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5435-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5435-S5436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION AWARDS\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Susan \nDollenmaier of Tunbridge who was chosen as the Vermont Small Business \nPerson of the Year. She has shown extraordinary innovation and vision \nin building a successful business in Vermont.\n  Ms. Dollenmaier is the president and co-founder of Anichini Inc., an \nimporting and manufacturing company that designs, wholesales, and \nretails linens and textiles from Italy, India, the Far East, and \nEastern Europe. Anichini also has a furniture division and a line of \nproducts for infants. A former social worker for the state of Vermont, \nDollenmaier and her ex-business partner, Patrizia Anichini, launched \nthe company about 20 years ago with only a $600 investment. This year, \nsales of Anichini's linens are expected to top $10 million. Besides its \noutlet store in West Lebanon, New Hampshire--a site she hopes to move \nto the Vermont side of the Connecticut River very soon--and a new one \nslated to open in Manchester, Vermont, Anichini operates retail stores \nin Beverly Hills and Dallas, along with a boutique in New York City. \nSusan makes sure that some of the cash flow from her wealthy and \ndemanding clientele finances flex time, day care stipends, generous \nvacations and holidays, a profit-sharing plan and other benefits--as \nwell as better-than-average wages--for her largely female work force of \n45 employees. We are very happy Susan chose to start and maintain her \nbusiness in Vermont.\n  I commend Susan and all of her employees for receipt of this \nprestigious award.\n  I ask that a copy of an April 15, 2001, article in the Valley News \noutlining Ms. Dollenmaier's achievements be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                 SBA Honors Turnbridge's Anichini Inc.\n\n                           (By Bob Piasecki)\n\n       Turnbridge.--Most people drive right past the yellow \n     farmhouse off Route 110 that contains Anichini Inc.'s \n     offices, and that's just fine with Susan Dollenmaier.\n       Dollenmaier, president and co-founder of Anichini, the \n     importer, manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer of linens and \n     textiles for the rich and famous, prefers to keep a low \n     profile.\n       That explains why there isn't a sign outside Anichini's \n     headquarters or its warehouse farther down the road--and why \n     there never will be, as long as Dollenmaier is running the \n     company.\n       ``I'm not into being a celebrity,'' says Dollenmaier, \n     dressed casually in black leggings and a gray cable-knit \n     sweater. ``I just want us to get recognition because of our \n     products.''\n       That won't be possible for much longer because Dollenmaier \n     was just named Vermont's Small Businessperson of the Year by \n     the state's Small Business Administration.\n       Some of Dollenmaier's employees went ahead and nominated \n     their boss for the prestigious award without telling her, and \n     she ended up winning.\n       The selection put Dollenmaier in the running for being \n     named the national Small Business Person of the Year award, \n     which will be announced next month in Washington D.C.\n       The SBA singled out Dollenmaier and Anichin for \n     ``seamlessly blending economic success with socially \n     conscious business practices.''\n       Deborah Mathews, who has worked with Dollenmaier virtually \n     since the day Anichini was launched, said she was willing to \n     reduce her salary and make other painful cuts when times were \n     tough.\n       ``Susan's focus on the needs of her staff and the community \n     in which she lives and works made her an ideal recipient for \n     this honor,'' added Matthews.\n       ``Susan has a profound gift for recognizing hidden \n     potential, and she knows how to bring it out in the open,'' \n     said Kenneth Silvia, director of the SBA's office in Vermont. \n     ``It's manifest not only in her choice of Anichini's product \n     line, but in the people who work at the company--the majority \n     of whom are Vermonters.''\n       A former social worker for the state of Vermont, \n     Dollenmaier and her ex-partner, Patrizia Anichini, launched \n     the company about 20 years ago with a paltry $600 investment. \n     This year, sales of Anichini's linens are expected to top $10 \n     million.\n       Besides it outlet store in the Powerhouse Mall in West \n     Lebanon, and a new one slated to open this summer in \n     Manchester, Vt, Anichini operates retail stores in Beverly \n     Hills and Dallas, along with a boutique in New York City. Its \n     regular clientele includes celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, \n     Sharon Stone and Tom Cruise.\n       Not bad for the daughter of an electrical salesman who grew \n     up in Libertyville, Ill., a small agricultural town 45 miles \n     northwest of Chicago.\n       Dollenmaier said she always had a thing for beautiful \n     textiles, but doesn't quite know where that fascination came \n     from. ``That's something to figure out with a therapist,'' \n     she jokes. But she suspects it probably has something to do \n     with her grandmother, a dressmaker who also made her own \n     quilts.\n       She sewed her own clothes as a teenager, and began \n     collecting antique fabrics of all styles and types, never \n     thinking it was ever going to turn into a business.\n       After graduating from Southern Illinois University, where \n     she earned a degree in design and studied under R. \n     Buckminster Fuller--the inventor of the geodesic dome--\n     Dollenmaier bounced around for a while.\n       Her life changed in the early 1970s, when she came to south \n     Royalton from Los Angeles to visit her sister, whose husband \n     was attending Vermont Law School at the time, and fell in \n     love with the area.\n       ``It was spring. It was so green and there was so much \n     water,'' Dollenmaier recalled, sitting at an enormous \n     wooden table in Anichini's spacious conference room.\n       ``It was so refreshing, I turned to my sister and said, \n     `this has got to be one of the most beautiful places in the \n     world,' and essentially I never left after that.''\n       She got a job as a social worker for the state of Vermont, \n     and helped set up several programs including Meals on Wheels \n     in Tunbridge and many of the other towns along the First \n     Branch of the White River. At the same time, Dollenmaier \n     continued to go to tag sales, flea markets and estate sales, \n     collecting antique fabrics for her burgeoning collection. \n     After she sold part of her cache in New York City, \n     Dollenmaier decided it was time for a major life change.\n       ``It finally dawned on me that I wanted more challenges, \n     and that I was headed toward running some government program \n     in Washington, D.C., if I continued to be a social worker,'' \n     she says.\n       So she quit after seven years, and with her partner, rented \n     a loft in Manhattan on 20th Street. ``We lived there hand-to-\n     mouth,'' she said buying, selling and swapping antique \n     linens.\n       She remembers driving an old, unheated bread truck filled \n     with their wares back and forth from New York and Vermont, \n     where she also kept an apartment in Tunbridge. The duo got \n     their first big break when Barney's, the upscale New York \n     department\n\n[[Page S5436]]\n\n     store, agreed to sell some of their material in its home \n     furnishings store, which was just opening.\n       During a trip to Venice with her husband, glassblower Robin \n     Mix, Dollenmaier got the idea of making and selling new, \n     heirloom quality textiles, which is essentially what Anichini \n     does today.\n       ``In Italy I found women who were still making the same \n     kind of textiles I was buying and selling,'' she says. \n     ``That's really where the seed of the business was formed.''\n       Soon after that, Anichini caught another break when one of \n     Italy's premier textile weavers took a chance on the \n     fledgling company and agreed to give it $50,000 worth of \n     materials on consignment.\n       The business sold all $50,000, and was on its way. It \n     grossed $100,000 in its first year, and has continued to \n     expand and grow. Dollenmaier and Anichini eventually sold \n     their loft in New York, and used the proceeds to buy the \n     buildings the company still owns in Tunbridge.\n       The partners went their separate ways a few years ago, when \n     Dollenmaier bought out Anichini's share in the business.\n       Today, Anichini has a furniture division, a line of \n     products for infants and is widening its scope to include \n     fabrics and designs from India, the Far East, Eastern Europe \n     and other countries. It no longer bills itself as simply an \n     purveyor of Italian, Dollenmaier says.\n       The company recently worked out an agreement with a weaver \n     in India who is trying to keep some of the country's old \n     techniques alive.\n       Dollenmaier acknowledges that the 2,000 or so women who \n     make textiles for Anichini in India are, at least by Western \n     standards, poor. Asked how this squares with Anichini's Ben & \n     Jerry's-style commitment to social responsibility, \n     Dollenmaier says she has thought deeply about this question.\n       ``I guess I'd say they've got to be working doing \n     something, and they are making a lot more money making stuff \n     for us as opposed to someone else.''\n       One thing is certain, Anichini's 60 employees in the United \n     States are treated quite well. The company provides profit \n     sharing, which has averaged more than 10 percent of the \n     employee's salary over the past five years, 11 paid holidays, \n     five weeks vacation after five years of service, and paid \n     membership in gym.\n       Dollenmaier hopes to eventually move Anichini's outlet \n     store in West Lebanon across the river to the Route 4 \n     corridor in Vermont. Long-range, she also plans to \n     consolidate all of Anichini's operations in a new facility in \n     Tunbridge that will be even harder to find than its existing \n     buildings.\n       Looking back on her life and how she has parlayed a hobby \n     and passion into a highly successful business, Dollenmaier \n     says: ``I'm really doing exactly what I want. I really have \n     very few regrets.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5436-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL MICHAEL W. DAVIDSON\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to a \ngreat American, Major General Michael W. Davidson for his 32 years of \nmeritorious service to our Nation. On June 16, 2001, Major General \nDavidson will retire from the service, and I know my colleagues join me \nin expressing our gratitude for his many contributions.\n  Major General Davidson began his career as an enlisted member of the \nArmy 32 years ago. Since that beginning, he served his Nation in the \nActive Duty Army, U.S. Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. His \ndiligence and commitment to the United States Army did not go \nunnoticed, he was eventually promoted to the rank of two-star General \nOfficer. In this capacity, General Davidson served a three year term as \nthe first ever Assistant to the Chief Joint Chiefs of Staff for \nNational Guard Matters.\n  During his tenure as Assistant to the Chief Joint Chiefs of Staff for \nNational Guard Matters, Major General Davidson provided considerable \ninsight and made lasting contributions regarding the integration of the \nNation's Reserve Component forces into the planning and strategies of \nthe United States Armed Forces. Major General Davidson's comprehensive \nknowledge of the Reserve Component and its capabilities as well as \ninsightful analysis of our national security concerns were invaluable \nassets and set the tone for this new position. I am confident that all \nwho follow Major General Davidson will benefit tremendously from his \nexample.\n  Perhaps even more than his distinguished service, Major General \nDavidson is justifiably proud of his loving family. He and his wife Jo \nAnn have three children, twins Megan and Claire, both 22, and Brian, \nage 15. General Davidson and his family make their home in my hometown \nof Louisville, KY. Although he lives and was educated in Louisville, \nMajor General Davidson's true allegiance is a few miles down the road \nin Lexington, or perhaps more specifically, Rupp Arena. Like so many \nothers in the Bluegrass, The General is a huge supporter and fan of \nKentucky Wildcat Basketball and I can hope that the next phase of his \nlife will afford him many opportunities to enjoy the Wildcats in \nperson.\n  In addition to catching as many Big Blue games as possible, Major \nGeneral Davidson plans to busy himself with consultation work and \nteaching at the college level. Clearly, his commitment to service will \nendure.\n  Michael Davidson's time in uniform may be drawing to a close, however \nhis record of dedicated service will continue for many years to come. \nOn behalf of this body, I thank him for his dedication and \ncontributions to this nation, and sincerely wish him and the entire \nDavidson family the very best in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5436-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5436-S5437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NORTHWEST GEORGIA GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD WINNERS\n\n Mr. MILLER.

The special skills that the girls developed will be a \ntremendous asset to them as they finish their education and progress \nonto greater experiences.\n  Over the previous 3 years, each girl has illustrated tremendous \ndedication, effort, and hard work to achieve this prestigious award. \nHowever their success could not have been achieved without the support \nand encouragement of their family, friends, teachers, and troop \nleaders. On the quest for the Gold Award, each girl has endured \nchallenges and hardships that would not have been overcome without the \nassistance of their community.

Mr. Malone was right 35 years ago, and he's still right today!\n  A good teacher has the power to fundamentally change the course of a \nchild's life. I'm sure that each of us can recall at least one great \nteacher who inspired us, or motivated us and changed our lives. These \nteachers guided us then and continue to influence us today.\n  Douglass Cooper is one of those teachers. He is the kind of teacher \nwho has a life-lasting impact on his students. And, as Ohio Teacher of \nthe Year, Mr. Cooper is being recognized for this and for his \noutstanding dedication and leadership in the classroom, school, and \ncommunity.\n  Mr. Cooper, who received both a bachelor's and a master's degree from \nWright State University, is currently a social studies teacher in \nClinton County, Ohio, and has been teaching in the Wilmington School \nSystem for the last ten years. He serves as the chair of the social \nstudies department at Wilmington High School. Mr. Cooper is a member of \nthe Wilmington Local Professional Development Committee and serves his \nschool as a mentor for entry-year teachers. He is a National Board \nCertified teacher and received the Ohio Governor's Educational \nLeadership Award in 1999.\n  Additionally, Mr. Cooper has spent much of his free time volunteering \nin his community. He is involved in the Clinton County Kids Voting \nSteering Committee and serves as Scoutmaster of Boy Scout Troop 909.\n  I commend Douglass Cooper for his exceptional service and his \nunending dedication to his students and community. He is a great role \nmodel for our young people in school, as well as for his colleagues in \nthe teaching profession. Ohio is honored to have him as a \nrepresentative this year for teachers all over our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5437-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IN CELEBRATION OF SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY'S 150TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to share with the Senate my thoughts on the 150th \nAnniversary of Santa Clara University.\n  Santa Clara University, located in the heart of California's Silicon \nValley, became California's first school of higher learning in 1851. \nThe college is celebrating its sesquicentennial this year on the same \nSanta Clara Valley campus it has occupied continuously since its \nfounding. At the center of campus is the beautiful Mission Santa Clara \nde Asis, the eighth of the original 21 California missions.\n  Santa Clara University brings the intellectual rigor, respect for \nscholarship, and spiritual vision of its Jesuit founders to students of \nall backgrounds and beliefs. In the fall of 1961, women were accepted \nas undergraduates and Santa Clara University became the first \ncoeducational Catholic University in California. The college is \ncommitted to the diversity that distinguishes California and the United \nStates throughout the world and its student body includes more than 35 \npercent minority group members.\n  Santa Clara University's unique community events, undergraduate and \nnationally recognized graduate programs greatly inform and enrich \ncommunities in the Silicon Valley and the State of California. The \nsesquicentennial of Santa Clara University is a time for celebration by \nus all. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5437-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM HAZELETT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate William \nHazelett of Colchester who was chosen as the United States Small \nBusiness Administration National Exporter of the Year. Bill has shown \nextraordinary innovation and vision in building a very successful \nbusiness in Vermont.\n  Bill Hazelett and his wife Dawn are old friends of mine and \nMarcelle's. Bill is the president of Hazelett Strip-Casting Corp., a \nmanufacturing firm that designs and makes continuous metal casting \nmachines designed to produce long sheets of metal and wire for \neverything from pennies to aluminum siding to automobile bodies. \nHazelett Strip-Casting now employs 145 people. Foreign business \naccounts for 70 percent of its $23 million in annual sales, and \nHazelett Strip-Casting has clients all around the world, including much \nof Europe, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, China, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and \nChile. Bill moved his company to Vermont from Connecticut in 1957 \nbecause, as he says, ``I wanted to ski.'' We are very happy he came and \ndecided to stay.\n  I commend Bill and Dawn for receipt of this prestigious award.\n  I ask that a copy of a May 9, 2001, article in the Burlington Free \nPress outlining Bill Hazelett's achievements be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 9, 2001]\n\n        Colchester Man Named SBA's National Exporter of the Year\n\n       R. William Hazelett of Colchester on Tuesday received the \n     U.S. Small Business Administration's National Exporter of the \n     Year award from President George W. Bush in a White House \n     ceremony. Hazelett, 82, president of Hazelett Strip-Casting \n     Corp., was honored for building a manufacturing firm for \n     which foreign business accounts for 70 percent of its $23 \n     million in annual sales.\n       Hazelett had a simple reason for the recognition. ``We have \n     a technology that is superior to any other technology in \n     fabricating sheet metal,'' he said. ``My business was \n     selected (for the award) as being very, very good at creating \n     exporting business for the United States.'' The company \n     designs and makes continuous metal casting machines, \n     behemoths designed to produce long sheets of metal and wire \n     that can weigh as much as 120 tons and cost $15 million. The \n     machines produce sheet metal for everything from pennies to \n     aluminum siding to auto bodies, Hazelett said.\n       Clients are scattered all over the world, including much of \n     Europe, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, China, Saudi Arabia, Brazil \n     and Chile, he said. Earlier this year, a Hazelett \n     representative was part of the trade mission that traveled to \n     Argentina with Gov. Howard Dean. Though no sale was made on \n     the trip, it started a process that will lead to a sale, \n     Hazelett said. ``You don't sell one of these machines \n     overnight because a machine might cost $15 million,'' he \n     said. ``You've got a whole plant that might cost $150 million \n     that they go into. It's a very long-term consideration.'' \n     Hazelett was confident a deal would be signed. ``We will get \n     the business because we are the best in the world,'' he said.\n       Hazelett, which does all of its engineering and \n     manufacturing in Vermont, employs 145 people. The company \n     moved here in 1957 from Connecticut because, Hazelett said, \n     ``I wanted to ski.''\n       In naming Hazelett for the honor, the SBA noted his \n     company's ``stellar success in export marketing.'' ``Bill \n     Hazelett's contribution to Vermont's stature as a world-class \n     exporter center is absolutely outstanding,'' said Kenneth \n     Silver, director of the SBA's Vermont district \n     office.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5437-4", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5437-5", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5437-S5438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S5438]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5437-5", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5437-S5438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S5438]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5438-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:51 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 1696) to \nexpedite the construction of the World War II memorial in the District \nof Columbia.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 495. an act to designate the Federal building located \n     in Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, United States Virgin \n     Islands, as the ``Ron de Lugo Federal Building.''\n       H.R. 1801.

A bill to provide reliable officers, technology, education, \ncommunity prosecutors, and training in our neighborhoods; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, authority for the community policing \nprogram has expired, and I rise today to introduce legislation to \nextend that hugely successful program for another six years.\n  We created this program in 1994 as part of that year's crime bill. \nThe COPS program has worked better than any of us could have hoped. \nCrime has gone down every year since the program has been in existence. \nWe have invested over $7.5 billion to make our streets safer. 115,000 \nofficers will be funded by the end of this fiscal year. 73,600 of those \nofficers are on the beat today, over 200 of them in my own state of \nDelaware. Grants have been issued to more than 12,400 law enforcement \nagencies. Big cities and small towns have benefitted, and more than 82 \npercent of all COPS grants have gone to departments serving populations \nof 50,000 or less.\n  Community policing methods are taking hold across the country. A \nrecent Justice Department study revealed that the number of community \npolice officers nationwide increased by 400 percent between 1997 and \n1999. Schools are benefitting: by the end of this fiscal year COPS will \nhave funded almost 5,000 school resource officers. These are specially \ntrained officers who work in schools to prevent crimes before they \noccur, mentor students, and assist school administrators in creating a \nsafe learning environment. Since COPS started funding school resource \nofficers, their numbers across\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\nthe country have shot up more than 40 percent.\n  When we passed the crime bill in 1994, we set a goal of funding \n100,000 officers by 2000. That goal has been met. But the need for more \nofficers, for technology to help those officers do their job more \nefficiently, and for more prosecutors so the cases investigated by the \npolice can effectively be brought, continues unabated. The Justice \nDepartment reports that in the last two fiscal years, demand for new \npolice hiring grants has outstripped available funds by a factor of \nalmost three to one. To meet this need, the legislation I introduce \ntoday authorizes $600 million per year over the next 6 years, enough to \nhire up to 50,00 more officer. We have made this portion of the program \nmore flexible: up to half of these hiring dollars can be use to help \npolice departments retain those community police officers currently on \npayroll. In another change from current law, portion of these funds can \nbe used for officer training and education.\n  The legislation also provides funding for new technologies, so law \nenforcement can have access to the latest high-tech crime fighting \nequipment to keep pace with today's sophisticated criminals. Also \nincluded are funds to help local district attorneys hire more community \nprosecutors. These prosecutors will expand the community justice \nconcept and engage the entire community in preventing and fighting \ncrime. The statistics we have on community prosecutions are quite \npromising, and we should increase the funds available to local \nprosecutors, a piece of our criminal justice puzzle that has too often \ngone overlooked.\n  We need to pass this bill. Already the administration has announced \nits intention to end the police hiring program, to dramatically scale \nback the community prosecution program, and to cut other critical state \nand local law enforcement programs. That is not the right approach. \nCrime is down, but it will not stay down. Preliminary FBI crime reports \nfor 2000 indicate that we may be reaching the end of our eight straight \nyears of decreasing crime. Last December, the FBI reported that crime \nwas down in most big cities, but up in cities of less than 50,000 \npeople. It was up 1.2 percent in the South, the nation's most populous \nregion. Several of our largest cities have reported increases in their \nmurder rates. Crime will not stay down, unless we dedicate the \nresources necessary for state and local law enforcement to do their job \neffectively.\n  This bill has the support of every major law enforcement organization \nin the country. Fifty senators are original cosponsors of the \nlegislation, including five Republicans. I want to pay a special \ntribute to my friends on the other side of the aisle and thank them for \nlistening to their mayors, police chiefs, and officers who told them \nthis is the right thing to do. We should not play politics with public \nsafety, and I hope we can pursue common-sense crime-fighting proposals \nwithout regard to party.\n  I would like to thank the men and women of law enforcement for their \nservice and heroism in bringing about the longest lasting decrease in \ncrime in this nation's history. Let's build on that success, and let's \ncontinue to give them the support they deserve, by reauthorizing the \nCOPS program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, as well as several \nletters supporting its introduction, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 924\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Joseph Biden, Jr.,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Joe: On behalf of the members of the Police Executive \n     Research Forum (PERF), a national organization of police \n     professionals who serve more than 50 percent of our nation's \n     population, I wish to express our continued support of your \n     plans to adequately fund and reauthorize the COPS Office and \n     its many critical programs.\n       The COPS program has been a highly successful crime-\n     fighting initiative. The vast majority of COPS grant \n     recipients have put those funds to unprecedented good use. \n     With COPS funding, PERF members have hired more officers, \n     purchased critical technology, implemented innovative \n     problem-solving programs, and received valuable training and \n     technical assistance, all of which have played an important \n     role in advancing community policing across the country. But \n     the COPS Office's work is far from over.\n       Providing the citizens in our jurisdictions with safe \n     communities requires resources beyond local reach. The COPS \n     program's sole mission is to respond to the needs of local \n     law enforcement and it has delivered much-needed resources in \n     the fight against crime. Through this partnership with the \n     federal government, we have made tremendous advances in \n     community policing. We have always called for multi-year \n     reauthorization and full funding for this critical program.\n       PERF would welcome the opportunity to work with you to \n     increase the flexibility of COPS hiring funds and otherwise \n     ensure the COPS programs' long-term success. We thank you for \n     your tireless support of law enforcement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Chuck Wexler,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    National Association of Police\n\n\n                                          Organizations, Inc.,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2001.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Joe: Please be advised that the National Association \n     of Police Organizations (NAPO) will be strongly supporting \n     your reintroduction of S. 1760, the ``PROTECTION Act.'' NAPO, \n     representing 4,000 unions and associations and 230,000 sworn \n     law enforcement officers, truly appreciates your effort to \n     reauthorize and continue the success of the COPS program.\n       As you know, NAPO strongly supported the passage of the \n     1994 Crime bill creating the COPS program. Since its \n     inception the COPS program has funded grants for over 110,000 \n     community police officers. Most law enforcement officials and \n     the public recognize the benefits of putting more cops on the \n     street. The steady decline of violent crime over the last few \n     years is evidence of the success of this program.\n       We support your legislation that will extend the COPS \n     program for another six years and put up to 50,000 more \n     police officers on our streets and in our neighborhoods to \n     continue the success of community policing.

Joe Biden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Biden: On behalf of the entire membership of \n     the International Brotherhood of Police Officers (IBPO), I \n     want to thank you for introducing legislation to reauthorize \n     the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program.\n       As the author of the 1994 Crime Bill you understand the \n     significance of the COPS program. Every crime statistic \n     available shows that America is a safer place to live since \n     we implemented the COPS program. The COPS program enables \n     communities to combat crime in the most effective way \n     possible--by putting more officers on the street.\n       I understand that they are opponents to the COPS program. I \n     urge them to talk to police officers in their states. The \n     IBPO believes that public safety is far too important to be \n     caught up in political debate. It would be a tragedy to cut \n     back on any efforts to fight crime at this critical juncture.\n       As the largest police union in the AFL-CIO, we have first \n     hand knowledge of what a success the COPS program is. We look \n     forward to working with you on this most important piece of \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kenneth T. Lyons,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Sheriffs' Association,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, May 21, 2001.\n     Hon. Joseph Biden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Biden: I am writing to you regarding the \n     Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program and your \n     bill, the Protection Act. We at the National Sheriffs' \n     Association (NSA) support COPS and we appreciate the \n     commitment made to law enforcement by Congress.\n       As you may know, sheriffs around the nation depend on the \n     COPS program to supplement their law enforcement \n     capabilities. Sheriffs need the additional funding provided \n     so that they can better protect and serve their communities. \n     The COPS program has been an overwhelming success and has had \n     a tangible and positive impact on crime reduction. Nearly \n     two-thirds of the sheriffs offices in the Nation have \n     benefited from grant funding from this program and the added \n     funding has made a significant difference in how we enforce \n     the law. A sheriff with a COPS grant can fight and control \n     crime while a sheriff without a grant is at the mercy of the \n     criminal. With the added capability that a COPS grant \n     provides, we have reduced crime, streets are safer and honest \n     law-abiding people feel secure in their communities.\n       NSA supports a flexible COPS program that allows sheriffs \n     to determine their own needs and apply for funds accordingly. \n     Sheriffs have overwhelming technology needs that can be \n     addressed through the COPS technology grant programs. These \n     programs have helped sheriffs purchase state-of-the-art \n     computer technology and communications equipment. In this \n     information age, it is more important than ever that we \n     strive to achieve telecommunications and systems \n     compatibility among criminal justice agencies, improve our \n     forensic sciences capability at the state and local level and \n     encourage the use of technologies to predict and prevent \n     crime. All of these will give law enforcement the advantage \n     over criminals. The total package of law enforcement support \n     that COPS provides is an integral part of crime control in \n     America.\n       In our view, COPS is a program that is vital to effective \n     law enforcement and to sheriffs in both rural and urban \n     jurisdictions. Without COPS, I firmly believe our communities \n     would be a little less safe and a little more dangerous. \n     Thank you again for your commitment to reducing crime. Know \n     that NSA will do our part in the fight against crime and \n     given the proper resources, we can truly make a difference.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Jerry ``Peanuts'' Gaines,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 925. A bill to amend the title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide a prescription benefit program for all medicare beneficiaries; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce long overdue \nlegislation that will bring affordable prescription drugs to all \nMedicare beneficiaries. This legislation is the Medicare Extension of \nDrugs to Seniors, MEDS, Act of 2001.\n  For a good period of the time that I have been a Senator, the Federal \nGovernment has operated with budget deficits. The goal during that \nperiod was deficit reduction, while protecting the programs that are \nimportant for people. I had hoped that when the economy began to do \nbetter, and we began to see surpluses, that finally, as a Senator from \nMinnesota, I would be able to do really well for people. It would not \njust be stopping the worst, it would be doing the better.\n  Unfortunately, what we have this year in Washington instead is a \nchoice. Either you are in favor of Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax cuts, with \nas much as 40 percent of the benefits going to the top 1 percent of \nearners. Or you are in favor of making an investment above and beyond \nreducing the debt and protecting Social Security and Medicare. I am one \nwho favors making investments in people, for making sure that there is \nopportunity for all, quality education for all our children and young \npeople, quality and affordable housing, that we honor our commitments \nto our veterans, that we reform mental health and achieve parity for \nmental health and addiction treatment services, that we help women out \nof domestic violence. And that we make sure that the senior citizens \nwho built this country are able to afford prescription drugs.\n  Everyone in Congress knows there is a need for more affordable \nprescription drugs. Everyone in Congress knows that the surplus is \nlarge enough to afford both a fair tax cut and better prescription drug \ncoverage for seniors. The surplus is largely thanks to sound budget \ndecisions made in the early 1990s, which promoted economic growth and \ngreatly expanded tax revenues. Those surpluses now make it not only \npossible, but imperative that we address the prescription drug cost \ncrisis. We must remember that Congress also made mistakes during the \n1990s. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 brought cuts in Medicare \nspending, cuts that I opposed and that will total over $600 billion. It \nis only fair, now that there is a surplus, to return those cuts in \nhealth care spending back into the health care system where there is \nneed. And I don't have to tell colleagues about the need. We all know \nit from our own families and our constituents.\n  When Medicare was first enacted in 1965 the program ``mimicked'' \ntypical private insurance which often did not include outpatient \nprescription drugs. Times have changed, but in that regard Medicare has \nnot. Virtually all employment based insurance now includes outpatient \nprescription drug coverage. Fully 99 percent of state and local \ngovernment employees have this coverage. The federal employees program \nrequires all plans to cover out patient prescription drugs, and \nMedicaid in every state does the same. Its time to bring Medicare up to \ndate with a prescription drug plan available to all beneficiaries.\n  You don't have to tell people that prescription drugs are the largest \nout-of-pocket health care cost for seniors. They know. Over 85 percent \nof Medicare beneficiaries take at least one prescription medicine, and \nthe average senior citizen fills eighteen prescriptions per year. \nNationally, more than half of the cost of these drugs comes directly \nout of seniors' pockets. In Minnesota the number is even higher. \nSeniors who cannot afford drug coverage often do not take the drugs \ntheir doctors prescribe. One of every eight senior citizens at some \ntime is forced to choose between buying food and buying medicine. \nThat's not right.\n  Charles Van Guilder, a Minnesota senior, was faced with the \ndevastating option of having to divorce his wife in order to protect \ntheir assets which might be stripped away by high-rising Medicare HMO \ncosts. Struggling with Parkinson's Disease, she was faced with an $850 \nmonthly charge for prescription drugs and home health premiums.\n  Rose Grigsby was faced with a choice of living in Arizona where \nbecause of disparities in Medicare + Choice reimbursements she payed \n$17.50 a month for her healthcare including prescription drugs and even \na health club membership and moving back home to Minnesota where she \nwould have to pay $270 a month for 80 percent drug coverage. Despite \nwanting to be with family, she couldn't afford to move. Where's the \nfairness in that? It is time we add prescription drug coverage to \nMedicare so it is available on an equal basis to every senior in every \nstate.\n  The drug industry America's most profitable has never wanted a \nprescription drug benefit included in Medicare.\n\n[[Page S5445]]\n\nThe industry is interested in protecting its very large profits. The \nmost recent annual Fortune 500 report on American business showed once \nagain as it has in each of the last 19 years that the pharmaceutical \nindustry ranks first in profits. In the words of the editors of Fortune \nMagazine, ``Whether you gauge profitability by median return on \nrevenues, assets or equity, pharmaceuticals had a Viagra kind of \nyear.''\n  Where the average Fortune 500 industry in the United States returned \n5 percent profits as a percentage of revenue, the pharmaceutical \nindustry returned 18.6 percent. Where the average Fortune 500 industry \nreturned 3.8 percent profits as a percentage of their assets, the \npharmaceutical industry returned 16.5 percent. Where the average \nFortune 500 industry returned 15 percent profits as a percentage of \nshareholders equity, the pharmaceutical industry returned 36 percent.\n  The richest pharmaceutical company, Merck, pulled in nearly $6 \nbillion in profits, more than the entire Fortune 500 airline industry \nand registered twice the profits of the engineering construction \nindustry. The 12 major companies of the pharmaceutical industry made \n$10 Billion more in total profits than the 24 companies of the motor \nvehicle and parts industry, including Ford, GM and others.\n  Those record profits are no surprise to America's senior citizens. \nMedicare beneficiaries without prescription drug coverage are being \ngouged every day of the week by a pharmaceutical industry that charges \nhigher prices in the United States than in any other country of the \nworld. So, America's seniors know where those record profits come \nfrom--they come from their own pocketbooks.\n\n  Year after year, the pharmaceutical industry rakes in record profits, \nmuch at the expense of America's most vulnerable citizens: the elderly, \nfrail and ill. The high price of drugs forces seniors to chose between \nfood and life preserving medications. Last year, when a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit available to all Senior Citizens seemed \nwithin reach, the pharmaceutical industry dipped into its coffers and \nforked over millions of dollars to fund a stealth campaign to defeat \nany such proposal.\n  Nowhere in its campaign against a Medicare prescription drug benefit \ndid the pharmaceutical industry tell people that it was the \nprescription-drug companies that were paying for the campaign. The \nindustry's front organization is called Citizens for Better Medicare. \nThat is like Foxes for Better Chickens. A more accurate description \nwould be Pharmaceutical Companies for Higher Profits. But drug \ncompanies would rather hide behind a false shield, count their profits \nand count the ways they can continue to extract high profits from the \nAmerican public, especially from the elderly.\n  Indeed, according to a report from the Boston University School of \nPublic Health, the pharmaceutical industry has encouraged the spread of \nseven interlocking myths that have ``permeated, paralyzed and \npoisoned'' public discourse of prescription drug policy. Let me just \nshare 2 of those myths:\n  Myth #1: High prices and profits are bestowed on the drug industry by \na legitimate and bountiful free market. In reality, little of a free \nmarket is present in the world of patented prescription drugs. Today's \nprices and profits are therefore not justified by a legitimate free \nmarket.\n  Myth #2: If government interferes with today's high price and \nprofits, ``The lights go out in the labs, and there is no R,'' \naccording to PhRMA, the drug industry's lobbying arm. As the Boston \nUniversity researchers noted, that is like saying ``give us all of your \nmoney or we'll let you die.'' The researchers call that PhRMA's Fog of \nFear. But the reality is the drug makers' profit-maximization is not to \nincrease research. The facts are: Analysis of 1999 data shows that the \nsix major drug makers spent 11 percent of their revenue on research and \ndevelopment, while 16 percent went to profits and 31 percent went to \nmarketing and administration. These data closely parallel those \ncollected in earlier years. Looking at the main task of drug company \nemployees, as of June 1998: Fully 35 percent of drug makers' employees \nwere engaged in marketing, with an additional 13 percent in \nadministration. Producing and developing drugs each occupied only about \none-quarter of employees. Looking at changes in employment of PhRMA \nmembers, from 1995 to 1999: The number of production workers fell, \nresearch workers rose slightly, while marketing employment rose by one-\nthird.\n  The fact is there is plenty of room for the pharmaceutical industry \nto make a good profit without gouging the American consumer.\n  The fact also is that with each passing year, the need for Medicare \nprescription drug coverage has become more acute. The reasons are well \nknown.\n  First, the cost of prescription drugs has skyrocketed in recent \nyears. Direct to consumer advertising has increased demand, and drug \ncompanies have responded by raising prices and putting life saving \ndrugs even further out of reach of the average senior citizen. Last \nyear alone drug prices increased an estimated 17 percent. And there is \nno relief in sight. This year drug costs will increase another 18 \npercent.\n  Second, these increases hit seniors disproportionately: A 1998 study \nby the minority staff of the House Government Reform Committee found \nthat older Americans without prescription drug insurance pay on average \ntwice as much as the discounted prices drug companies offer large scale \npurchasers like HMOs and government agencies. The PRIME Institute, \nheaded by Steve Schondelmeyer, at the University of Minnesota found \nwhat Minnesota seniors already know, that pharmaceutical prices \noverseas are far less then we pay in the United States. Statistics say \nthat for every dollar we spend in the United States, Canadians spend on \naverage just 64 cents; Italians spend just 51 cents; the English 65 \ncents and Swedes 68 cents. They say statistics often lie. Well, from \nwhat I have seen and heard, the drugs seniors need most are even more \nexpensive in the United States than those statistics tell us. Even more \nastounding than the average figures are some specific comparisons: \nSynthroid for thyroid disease costs seniors 14 times the discounted \nprice to favored customers; and Micronase for diabetes costs over 3\\1/\n2\\ times as much. So not only are seniors forced the pay out of pocket \nfor these drugs, but the price they are charged is a national disgrace.\n  Furthermore, prescription drug spending accounts for 19 percent of \nthe out of pocket costs for senior citizens and is the largest spending \ncategory after premium payments. Beneficiaries were projected to spend \nan average of $480 out-of-pocket on prescription drugs in 2000. Average \nout-of-pocket prescription drug spending is even higher for \nbeneficiaries in poor health, $685, those without drug coverage, $715, \nand those who are severely limited in their activities of daily living, \n$725.\n  The high cost of drugs puts Americans in all income groups at risk. \nOf those seniors with incomes below 250 percent of poverty about 38 \npercent, 7.6 million, lack Rx drug coverage. Of those with higher \nincomes 28 percent, 5.4 million, have no drug coverage.\n  The increase in drugs cost and utilization is far outpacing the \noverall increase in the cost of living. A national study by Brandeis \nUniversity and PCS Health Systems published in May 2000 found that \nprescription drug expenditure trends were even higher than previously \nestimated. They found that: Prescription drug costs grew at an annual \nrate of 24.8 percent per year from 1996 to 1999. Prescriptions per \nenrollee grew 14 percent per year. And not surprisingly, the number of \nprescriptions per person is rising fastest in the 65+ age group, from \nan average of 16 prescriptions in 1996 to an average of 23 by 1999.\n  Rural Americans are hardest hit of all. In June 2000 the National \nEconomic Council published a report on prescription drug coverage for \nrural Medicare beneficiaries. Among its findings: Rural beneficiaries \nare over 60 percent more likely to fail to get needed prescription \ndrugs due to cost. A greater proportion of rural elderly spend a \ngreater percent of their income on prescription drugs. Rural \nbeneficiaries use nearly 10 percent more prescriptions. Rural \nbeneficiaries pay over 25 percent more out-of-pocket for prescription \ndrugs than urban beneficiaries but they are 50 percent less likely to \nhave any prescription drug coverage.\n\n[[Page S5446]]\n\n  For Minnesotans, the lack of a Medicare prescription drug benefit \nhits especially hard because there are few alternatives. Only 19 \npercent of Minnesota firms offer retiree health insurance and the \nnumber has been dropping. Medicare's HMO reimbursement in Minnesota is \nso low that no basic Medicare Managed Care Plans can include Rx Drug \ncoverage. Even with the increased Medicare + Choice capitation payment \nfloor we voted in last year, it is not enough for these plans to offer \nprescription drug coverage. When a comprehensive benefit without a cap \nis available, the costs become prohibitive--up to $130 per month, just \nfor the pharmacy benefit. The cost of prescription drug coverage under \nthe average Medigap policy in Minnesota is $90 per month, and that is \nonly for limited benefits. Because of this, in Minnesota, 65 percent of \nseniors have no prescription drug coverage. That's twice the national \naverage. But the fact is over half of the Seniors in the United States \nhave either no prescription drug coverage or totally inadequate \ncoverage.\n  Both the high cost of drugs and lack of coverage have severe \nconsequences. People discontinue their medications against medical \nadvice, thereby placing themselves at risk for problems like heart \nattacks, cancer recurrence, depression and complications of diabetes. \nPeople lower the dose they take to make their prescriptions last \nlonger. When I was in Duluth, Minnesota, meeting with seniors to \ndiscuss this very issue, one of my constituents told me about a \nneighbor who cut his pills in quarters because he couldn't afford to \nrefill the prescription and wound up with an unnecessary \nhospitalization. People take their medicines as prescribed but then \nskimp on food and other necessities. Ray Erlandson, a retired steel \nworker from West Duluth was at that meeting in Duluth. Ray was spending \nabout $300 a month for prescription drugs for he and his wife. He had \nnearly run out of savings. What does Ray say? ``People have to choose \nbetween food and buying their drugs. That shouldn't happen in this \ncountry. It's a dirty rotten shame. I'd like to ask the VIPs of the \ndrug companies, Do you go to church? Do you know what you are doing to \nthe elderly people?''\n  How can the richest country on earth force its senior citizens to \nchoose between the medicines they need to survive and the foods they \nneed to stay healthy? We shouldn't allow it. The answer is to provide a \nprescription drug benefit for all seniors that includes a pricing \npolicy that keeps costs affordable.\n  In the 1960s when barely half the nation's senior citizens could \nafford health insurance, and far more were at risk for the loss of \ntheir life savings, we as a country responded and created Medicare.\n  Today, at the beginning of a new century, when only half the nation's \nseniors--at best--have close to adequate prescription drug coverage, we \nare again called upon as a nation to respond. The beauty of it all is \nthat we have a surplus that allows us to respond with a prescription \ndrug program that we can all be proud of. The tragedy of it all is that \nwe are not doing it. We have an administration that is more concerned \nwith giving huge tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans than \nit is with providing the life sustaining medications our seniors need. \nWe have a pharmaceutical industry that is more concerned with \nmaximizing profits and making campaign contributions than it is with \nmaximizing access to life saving medications and making prescription \ndrugs affordable.\n  The administration's prescription drug proposal is a clear \ndemonstration of just where their priorities are. Republicans want to \ngive $550 billion in tax cuts just to the wealthiest 1 percent of \nAmerican families, leaving a pittance for Medicare prescription drugs. \nAnd the effect of those priorities will be seen in their as yet \nundisclosed plan: high premiums for beneficiaries; high deductibles, up \nto $2000; high co-pay; or a benefit available to only a fraction of the \nseniors who need it. In short, a benefit that isn't worth much. \nMillions of seniors will be left still holding the bag. You can't \nprovide the kind of Medicare Rx Drug benefit that everyone on Medicare \ndeserves with a tin-cup budget.\n\n  Any meaningful prescription drug benefit passed by this Congress \nshould reflect key principles: universality; low cost to beneficiaries; \nand serious efforts to reduce the price of prescription drugs. To \nremedy the high cost of prescription drugs and to provide comprehensive \ncoverage, I am proud to introduce the Medicare Extension of Drugs to \nSeniors, MEDS, Act of 2001.\n  Specifically, under this proposal, seniors and the disabled would \nhave a 20-percent co-pay on all prescription drugs and a small, $24 \nmonthly premium. Every person would receive the same voluntary benefit, \nregardless of income or geographical location. Under the MEDS plan, no \nbeneficiary would ever have to spend more than $2,000 out-of-pocket on \ntheir medications. Low-income beneficiaries would have no out-of-pocket \nexpense. By contrast, other plans that have been proposed would have \nseniors paying up to $6,000 a year. Still, they would not necessarily \ncover everyone currently eligible for Medicare\n  How can the MEDS plan provide such a strong benefit without busting \nthe budget? By including provisions which seriously address the \noutrageously high prices that Americans are forced to pay for \nprescription drugs.\n  First, the MEDS plan includes strong, loophole-free language to allow \nAmerican pharmacists, wholesalers and distributors to purchase FDA-\napproved prescription drugs at the lower prices charged abroad. Last \nyear, a version of this legislation passed both Houses of Congress with \nsolid bipartisan majorities. Unfortunately, at the last minute, the \npharmaceutical industry was successful in adding loopholes to the bill \nthat essentially make it unworkable. With strong reimportation language \nlike that included in the MEDS plan, Americans would save 30-50 percent \non the price of prescription drugs without any government subsidy.\n  Second, the MEDS plan includes a provision, originally proposed by \nRepresentative Tom Allen, that would permit Medicare beneficiaries to \npurchase their prescription drugs at the same price other government \nagencies such as the VA does. MEDS also creates a so-called ``global \nbudget'' which would allow Medicare to negotiate on behalf of all \nMedicare beneficiaries and work to restrain costs in the long term.\n  Finally, the MEDS plan would ensure that when taxpayers foot the bill \nfor research and development of a prescription drug, the pharmaceutical \nindustry must offer that drug at a fair and reasonable price. Today, \nthe federal government spends billions of dollars a year on research \nand development of medicines. Most often, this R is then given over \nto the pharmaceutical industry, which charges Americans any price they \nwant for the final product. If we change this absurd system, we would \nensure that new medicines would be affordable in the years ahead.\n  You can expect the pharmaceutical industry to protest loudly. And you \ncan expect the industry to increase its campaign contributions, which \ntotaled $19 million last year alone, its lobbying spending, which \nreached $91 million in 1999, and its advertising budget.\n  It is interesting. One pharmaceutical company executive recently said \nthat no senior citizen should be forced to choose between his or her \nprescription and other vital needs. But the high prices his company \ncharges and the high-priced lobbyists who do its bidding on Capitol \nHill are forcing that very choice on many senior citizens. While paying \nlip service to seniors, according to a published news story, that same \nexecutive was earning over $6 million in salary, plus stock options \nworth more than $10 million.\n  The drug companies will say that reductions in price will dry up \nresearch. I believe that is nonsense. Drug companies put billions more \ndollars into profits, marketing and administration than they do into \nresearch, based on information in their own annual reports. Just how \nhard would this most profitable of American industries be hit if we \nenacted a universal Medicare prescription drug benefit that required \nthe drug companies to offer seniors the best price they now offer other \nFederal government programs? According to Merrill Lynch, only by about \n3 percent.\n  In a June 23, 1999 report entitled A Medicare Drug Benefit: May Not \nBe So Bad, Merrill Lynch debunked the notion that a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit would seriously damage the\n\n[[Page S5447]]\n\npharmaceutical industry's profitability. Merrill Lynch's analysis \nconcludes that the toughest proposal on the table in Washington, the \nPrescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act, (The Allen Bill), the \nprovisions of which are included in this bill, and which provides a 40 \npercent discount on drug costs for all 39 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries, would cut just 3.3 percent from total pharmaceutical \nindustry revenues because volume increases would offset much of the \nlost revenue due to the lower prices. According to Merrill Lynch: \nVolume is more important than price in driving pharmaceutical company \nsales growth. Between 1994 and 1998, the impact of volume on sales \ngrowth outpaced price by better than a 4-to-1 ratio. Medicare \nbeneficiaries who either lack or have inadequate drug coverage \nunderutilize prescription drugs because they cannot afford them. With a \n40-percent price discount, the one-third of beneficiaries who lack any \ndrug coverage would increase their consumption by 45 percent, and the \ntwo-thirds with some coverage would see a 10-percent increase in drug \npurchases. This increased utilization reduces the lost revenue that \nwould otherwise result from a 40-percent price discount for Medicare \nbeneficiaries by almost one-half. Without adjusting for volume \nincreases, a 40-percent price discount for Medicare beneficiaries would \nreduce total pharmaceutical industry revenues by 5.9 percent. But after \nadjusting for increased utilization, the net drop in sales is just 3.3 \npercent. And that is from just a reduction in price, not an increase in \ncoverage. If you factor in the coverage provided by the MEDS Act which \nall Seniors will have, drug company revenues will increase.\n  It is time to get our priorities straight. Millions of hard-working \nAmericans go to work every day and pay their taxes so that when they \nhit 65, they can retire in a country they can be proud of, a country \nthat offers basic security for all an even better life for their \nchildren. Each day they read in the paper about scientific \nbreakthroughs: the genome project and new advances in the treatment of \ncancer, heart disease, and diabetes, all being carried out at the \nNational Institutes of Health, one of our nation's jewels. They turn on \nthe television and see drug company advertisements that extol new and \nexpensive medications. But what good is that medical research and those \nexpensive drugs if they are unaffordable and out of reach of millions \nof Americans. That is the situation we have today.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Prescription medicine coverage was not a standard part \n     of health insurance when the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act was enacted in 1965. Since \n     1965, however, medicine coverage has become a key component \n     of most private and public health insurance coverage, except \n     for the medicare program.\n       (2) At least \\2/3\\ of medicare beneficiaries have \n     unreliable, inadequate, or no medicine coverage at all.\n       (3) Seniors who do not have medicine coverage typically \n     pay, at a minimum, 15 percent more than people with coverage.\n       (4) Medicare beneficiaries at all income levels lack \n     prescription medicine coverage, with more than \\1/2\\ of such \n     beneficiaries having incomes greater than 150 percent of the \n     poverty line.\n       (5) The number of private firms offering retiree health \n     coverage is declining.\n       (6) Medigap premiums for medicines are too expensive for \n     most beneficiaries and are highest for older senior citizens, \n     who need prescription medicine coverage the most and \n     typically have the lowest incomes.\n       (7) All medicare beneficiaries should have access to a \n     voluntary, reliable, affordable, and defined outpatient \n     medicine benefit as part of the medicare program that assists \n     with the high cost of prescription medicines and protects \n     them against excessive out-of-pocket costs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to prohibit the importation of any article that is \nproduced, manufactured, or grown in Burma; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the people of Burma continue to suffer at \nthe hands of the world's most brutal military dictatorship which \ncynically calls itself the State Peace and Development Council, (SPDC). \nNow more than ever, as a nation committed to internationally-recognized \nhuman rights and worker rights, democracy, and freedom, America must \nheed the call of the International Labor Organization, (ILO), and \nsupport stronger, coordinated multilateral actions against Burma's \nrepressive regime. In the face of overwhelming evidence of continued, \nsystematic use of forced labor, including forced child labor in Burma, \nwe must do all we can to deny any material support to the military \ndictators who rule that country with an iron fist.\n  Furthermore, there is no clear and tangible evidence that the latest \ninformal, closed-door dialogue between the Burmese generals on one side \nand Aung San Suu Kyi and the other duly-elected leaders of the pro-\ndemocracy movement on the other side is bearing fruit. Therefore, we \nmust demonstrate anew to the Burmese people our recognition of their \nnightmarish plight as well as our support for their noble struggle to \nachieve democratic governance.\n  In 1997, a strong, bipartisan majority of the Congress enacted some \nsanctions and former President Clinton issued an Executive Order in \nresponse to a prolonged pattern of egregious human rights violations in \nBurma. At the heart of those measures is the existing prohibition on \nU.S. private companies making new investments in Burma's \ninfrastructure. Many other national governments, as well as scores of \ncity and State governments in the U.S. followed suit and adopted their \nown sanctions.\n  Nevertheless, the ruling military junta in Burma has clung to power \nand continues to blatantly violate internationally-recognized human and \nworker rights. The 1999 State Department Human Rights Country Report on \nBurma cited ``credible reports that Burmese Army soldiers have \ncommitted rape, forced porterage, and extrajudicial killing.'' It \nreferred to arbitrary arrests and the detention of at least 1300 \npolitical prisoners.\n  The following excerpts from the most recent 2000 State Department \nHuman Rights Country Report paint an even more disturbing reality:\n\n       The Burmese Government's extremely poor human rights record \n     and longstanding severe repression of its citizens continued \n     during the year. Citizens continued to live subject at any \n     time and without appeal to the arbitrary and sometimes brutal \n     dictates of the military regime. Citizens did not have the \n     right to change their government. There continued to be \n     credible reports, particularly in ethnic minority areas, that \n     security forces committed serious human rights abuses, \n     including extrajudicial killings and rape. Disappearances \n     continued, and members of the security forces tortured, beat, \n     and otherwise abused prisoners and detainees.\n       The judiciary is not independent and there is no effective \n     rule of law.\n       The Government continued to restrict worker rights, ban \n     unions, and use forced labor for public works and for the \n     support of military garrisons. Forced labor, including forced \n     child labor, remains a serious problem. The use of forced \n     labor as porters by the army--with attendant mistreatment, \n     illness, and sometimes death--remain a common practice. In \n     November, 2000 the International Labor Organization ILO \n     Governing Body judged that the Government had not taken \n     effective action to deal with `widespread and systematic' use \n     of forced labor in the country and, for the first time in its \n     history, called on all ILO members to apply sanctions to \n     Burma. Child labor is also a problem and varies in severity \n     depending on the country's region. Trafficking in persons, \n     particularly in women and girls to Thailand and China, mostly \n     for the purposes of prostitution, remain widespread.\n       As of September, 2000, the International Committee of the \n     Red Cross had visited more than 35,000 prisoners in at least \n     30 prisons, including more than 1,800 political prisoners. \n     The ICRC also has begun tackling the problem of the roughly \n     36,000 persons in forced labor camps.\n       The Government continued to infringe on citizens' privacy \n     rights, and security forces continued to monitor citizens' \n     movements and communications systematically, to search homes \n     without warrants, and to relocate persons forcibly without \n     just compensation or due process.\n       The SPDC continued to restrict severely freedom of speech, \n     press assembly, and association. It has pressured many \n     thousands of members to resign from the National League for \n     Democracy, NLD, and closed party offices nationwide. Since \n     1990 the junta frequently prevented the NLD and other pro-\n     democracy parties from conducting normal political \n     activities. The junta recognizes the NLD as a legal entity; \n     however, it refuses to accept the legal political status of \n     key NLD party leaders, particularly the party's general \n     secretary and 1991 Nobel Laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, and \n     restrict her activities severely through security measures \n     and threats.\n\n  Furthermore, Human Rights Watch/Asia reports that children from \nethnic minorities are forced to work under inhumane conditions for the \nBurmese Army, lacking adequate medical care and sometimes dying from \nbeatings.\n  Last year, the UN Special Rapporteur on Burma, in a chilling and \nalarming account, puts the number of child soldiers at 50,000, the \nhighest in the world. Sadly, the children most vulnerable to \nrecruitment into the military are orphans, street children, and the \nchildren of ethnic minorities.\n  The same UN report also discusses the dire state of minorities in \nBurma who continue to be the targets of violence. Specifically, it \ndetails that the most frequently observed human rights violations aimed \nat minorities include extortion, rape, torture and other forms of \nphysical abuse, forced labor, ``portering'', arbitrary arrests, long-\nterm imprisonment, forcible relocation, and in some cases, \nextrajudicial executions. It also cites reports of massacres in the \nShan state in the months of January, February, and May of 2000.\n  A 1998 International Labor Organization Commission of Inquiry \ndetermined that forced labor in Burma is practiced in a ``widespread \nand systematic manner, with total disregard for the human dignity, \nsafety, health and basic needs of the people.''\n  Last August, California District Court Judge Ronald Lew found in one \nhigh-profile court case ``ample evidence in the record linking the \nBurmese Government's use of forced labor to human rights abuses.''\n  In sum, the Burmese military junta continues to commit such horrific \nand appalling human rights and worker rights violations that we have no \nchoice but to unite with other nations around the world and take \nstronger action.\n  Even though the Burmese military junta has been terrorizing the 48 \nmillion people of Burma since it came to power in 1988 and has vowed to \ndestroy the National League for Democracy, NLD, Aung San Suu Kyi, a \nremarkably courageous leader and very brave woman, manages to stand \nsteadfast,\n\n[[Page S5456]]\n\nlike a living Statue of Liberty, in her undaunted quest and that of the \nBurmese people for democracy. We must never forget that she and her NLD \ncolleagues won 392 of 485 seats in a democratic election held in 1990. \nBut they have never been allowed to take office.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, and countless \nothers are denied freedom of association, speech and movement on a \ndaily basis. Last summer, she came under renewed threats and \nintimidation. For example, her vehicle was forced off the road last \nAugust by Burmese security forces when she tried to travel outside \nRangoon to meet with her NLD colleagues. She sat in her car on the \nroadside for a week until a midnight raid of 200 riot police forced her \nback to her home and placed her under house arrest until September 14, \n2000. Nevertheless, she tried again on September 21st, but she was \nprevented from boarding a train. The pathetic excuse from the \nauthorities for abridging her freedom to travel within Burma, on that \noccasion, was that all tickets had been sold out.\n  This Congress must answer anew the cry of the Burmese people and \ntheir courageous freedom-fighters. That is why I am introducing \nbipartisan legislation today, along with Senator Jessee Helms and \nseveral of our colleagues, to ban soaring imports from Burma, most of \nwhich are apparel and textiles sold by many brand-name American \nretailers. I am equally pleased that U.S. Congressman Tom Lantos from \nCalifornia is introducing the companion bill in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives this week.\n  Most Americans think that a trade ban with Burma already exists. \nNothing could be further from the truth. When I began investigating \nU.S. trade with Burma last summer in concern with the National Labor \nCommittee, I was chocked and alarmed to discover skyrocketing U.S. \napparel and textile imports for example.\n  Last November I requested cable traffic between the U.S. Embassy in \nBurma and the U.S. State Department at Foggy Bottom to see exactly what \nofficials in Washington, D.C. knew about soaring imports from Burma. It \ntook nearly four months for me to get this unclassified cable traffic. \nBut now I know why. Its contents are very troubling. It constitutes \nirrefutable evidence that current U.S. sanctions with Burma are far \nmore apparent than real. They are far more bluster than bite. Consider \nthe fact that the U.S. Government currently provides the Burmese \nmilitary junta with very easy access to the U.S. apparel market because \n95 percent of their exports are under no practical import restrictions \nat all.\n  Due to rising imports of apparel and textiles from Burma alone, more \nthan $400 million dollars are now flowing into the coffers of the \nBurmese military dictatorship. These ruthless military dictators and \ntheir drug-trafficking cohorts are spending this hard currency to \npurchase more guns from China and to buy loyalty among their troops to \ncontinue their policy of extreme repression and human cruelty.\n  In other words, American consumers are unwittingly helping to sustain \nthe repressive military junta's grip on power when buying travel and \nsports bags, women's underwear, jumpers, shorts, tank tops and towels \nmade in the Burmese gulag. It is outrageous that many brand-name U.S. \napparel companies such as FILA, Jordache, and Arrow Golf are making \nmore and more of their clothes in the Burmese gulag where many workers \nearn as little as 7 cent/hour or $3.23/week and where production is \nnon-stop--24 hours/day and 7 days/week.\n  Make no mistake about it. U.S. apparel imports from Burma are \nproviding the SPDC with a growing source of critically-needed hard \ncurrency because the military dictators directly own or have taken de \nfacto control of production in many apparel and textile factories. They \nare further enriched by a 5 percent export tax. As I said earlier, this \nhard currency is used to finance the purchase of new weapons and \nammunition from China and elsewhere, thus helping to underwrite the \nperpetuation of modern-day slavery, forced labor and forced child labor \nin Burma.\n  But you don't have to take my work for it. U Maung Maung, the General \nSecretary of the Federation of Trade Unions in Burma, decried at a \nrecent news conference in Washington, D.C., that ``the practice of \npurchasing garments made in Burma extends the continued exploitation of \nmy people, including the use of slave labor by the regime, by further \ndelaying the return of democratic government in Burma.'' At grave \npersonal risk, he and other NLD leaders have disclosed the growing \nimportance of exports to America and other foreign markets in helping \nsustain the Burmese military junta in power.\n  Some may question whether a ban on Burmese trade, including apparel \nand textile imports, might not harm American companies and consumers? \nNothing could be further from the truth. Currently, U.S. apparel and \ntextile imports from Burma account for less than one-half of one \npercent of total U.S. apparel and textile imports.\n  Others may assert that enactment of this legislation would violate \nWTO rules. Yes, Burma does belong to the WTO. Accordingly, the SPDC \nwould have the standing technically to bring a formal complaint when \nthis legislation is enacted. But our response to such a development \nshould be bring it on. Let the Burmese generals argue before the WTO \nthat they have the right to export products made by forced labor and \nchild slaves and in flagrant violation of other internationally-\nrecognized worker rights. This would clearly bring into focus the folly \nof writing rules for global trade that don't include enforceable worker \nrights, thus compelling workers in civilized trading nations to have to \ncompete for their jobs de facto with forced labor in Burma.\n  America must answer the clarion call of the ILO and take a stronger \nstand in solidarity with the Burmese people and in defense of universal \nhuman rights and worker rights in that besieged nation. A trade ban \nwith Burma will reaffirm the belief of the American people that \nincreased trade with foreign countries must promote respect for human \nrights and worker rights as well as property rights. It will also \nsignal American readiness to join in a new and stronger course of \ncoordinated, multilateral action that is designed to force the Burmese \ngenerals from power once and for all and to satisfy the yearning of the \nBurmese people for democratic, self-government.\n  In closing, I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record and that four recent editorials from the \nWashington Post, the New York Times, and the Boston Globe calling \nattention to the profound and prolonged suffering of the Burmese people \nand the need for stronger action in the U.S. and around the world also \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 926\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The regime \n     was talking with the country's courageous pro-democracy \n     leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and there even seemed to be a \n     possibility that she would be liberated from the prolonged \n     house arrest the government has enforced. But those hopes \n     have all but vanished. If the Bush administration means to \n     speak out against human rights abuses abroad and pressure \n     governments to treat their citizens humanely, Myanmar would \n     be a fine place to start.\n       The military leaders of Myanmar, formerly called Burma, are \n     among the world's cruelest violators of human rights. The \n     junta has tortured and executed political opponents, \n     exploited forced labor and condoned a burgeoning traffic in \n     heroin and amphetamines. In the clearest indication that the \n     regime has little intention of reforming, the United Nations \n     special envoy who acted as a catalyst for the talks between \n     the government and Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has been denied \n     permission to visit the country since January. Also, an \n     anticipated release of political prisoners has failed to \n     materialize, as has a pledge by the junta that Mrs. Aung San \n     Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, would be \n     allowed to resume activity.\n       Earlier this year the junta released 120 mostly youthful \n     members of the party who had been imprisoned the previous \n     year, but it is still believed to be holding as many as 1,700 \n     political prisoners, including 35 people who were elected to \n     Parliament in 1990. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's party won more \n     than three-quarters of the seats in that election, but the \n     junta annulled the results.\n       The United States and the European Union have cooperated to \n     isolate Myanmar, and in 1997 the Clinton administration \n     banned new American investments there. But some Asian \n     countries have been reluctant to join in sanctions. China, in \n     particular, has helped sustain the junta with military aid. \n     Regrettably, last month Japan broke ranks with a Western-led \n     12-year ban on non-humanitarian assistance to Myanmar by \n     approving a $29 million grant for a hydroelectric dam.\n       Last year the International Labor Organization, responding \n     to concerns about forced labor, voted to urge governments and \n     international donors to impose further sanctions on Myanmar. \n     Washington should consider a ban on imports from that nation, \n     including textiles. Myanmar is rapidly increasing apparel \n     exports to the United States. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's allies \n     have argued that the hard-currency earnings primarily benefit \n     the military, not the laborers who make the garments. \n     Washington should certainly be using its influence with Japan \n     and other Asian countries to deter any further \n     nonhumanitarian assistance.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Boston Globe, May 7, 2001]\n\n                         Burma Sanctions' Value\n\n       When it comes to the military dictatorship ruling Burma, \n     President Bush has an opportunity he should welcome to \n     demonstrate the realism his advisers commend and, \n     simultaneously, a firm commitment to America's democratic \n     ideals.\n       The Burmese junta stands condemned by much of the world for \n     its horrendous abuse of human rights, its complicity in the \n     trafficking of heroin and methamphetamines, and its thwarting \n     of the democratic government that was elected with 80 percent \n     of the seats in Parliament in Burma's last free election, in \n     1990.\n       Currently, there are varying sanctions on the junta. The \n     International Labor Organization, for the first time in its \n     81-year history, asked its members to sanction the regime for \n     the continuing, brutal imposition of forced labor on Burmese \n     and minority ethnic groups.\n       There are also European Union sanctions and restrictions \n     imposed by the Clinton administration that prohibit new U.S. \n     investment in Burma and ban senior officials in the regime \n     from obtaining visas to enter the United States.\n       Although it is far from clear that the junta intends to \n     permit a revival of democracy, there is little doubt that it \n     has engaged in talks with Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San \n     Suu Kyi--who is held under virtual house arrest in Rangoon--\n     in large part because of the unremitting pressure of \n     sanctions.\n       As a result of sanctions, the officers in power cannot \n     disguise their bankrupting of what had been one of Asia's \n     most literate and resource-rich countries. Even the junta's \n     principal sponsor for membership in the Association of \n     Southeast Asian Nations, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad of \n     Malaysia, has counseled Burma's ruling officers to ease the \n     embarrassment of their fellow ASEAN members by opening a \n     dialogue with Suu Kyi.\n       In a letter last month to Bush, 35 senators including \n     Edward Kennedy and John Kerry made a strong case for \n     maintaining sanctions, noting that ``the sanctions have been \n     partially responsible for prompting the regime to engage in \n     political dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and her \n     supporters.'' The letter also said there is ``strong evidence \n     directly linking members of the regime to'' the trafficking \n     of ``the heroin which plagues our communities.''\n       Bush should insist that the junta take measurable steps \n     toward the retrieval of democracy in Burma, and not merely \n     for altruistic reasons. Next to the regime in North Korea, \n     the Burmese junta has been Beijing's chummiest ally, \n     permitting China to project its burgeoning power into the Bay \n     of Bengal, to the dismay of India.\n       Were a democratic government to replace the junta, \n     neighboring Thailand, which is now suffering from an influx \n     of drugs from Burma, would join India and the rest of the \n     region in breathing a sigh of relief.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 26, 2000]\n\n                        A Rebuke to Forced Labor\n\n       Not in 81 years had the International Labor Organization \n     imposed such sanctions; but Burma is a special case. The ILO, \n     a United Nations arm in which unions, businesses and \n     governments participate, found that the Asian nation also \n     known as Myanmar has so flagrantly violated international \n     norms that sanctions had to be imposed. In particular, its \n     ruling generals were found guilty of encouraging forced and \n     slave labor in ``a culture of fear.''\n       Burma is a special case in part because its dictators \n     cannot even pretend to reflect the will of their people. In \n     1990, they permitted a national election. A pro-democracy \n     party headed by Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of Burma's hero of \n     independence, won four out of five parliamentary seats. But \n     parliament never met; the generals refused to accept the \n     results. Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel peace prize in \n     1991, is under house arrest; most of her party colleagues are \n     in prison. The generals grow more corrupt while Burma grows \n     ever poorer.\n       The ILO sanctions approved last week are, as AFL-CIO \n     president John Sweeney said, ``only a starting point.'' \n     Nations are ``urged to halt any aid, trade or relationship \n     that helps Burmese leaders remain in power,'' he said. The \n     United States already has imposed restrictions on investment, \n     but that hasn't stopped companies such as Unocal from \n     mounting major efforts in the country. Nor has it prevented \n     trade, much of which enriches only the generals.\n       Companies that do business in Burma now more than ever will \n     have to explain themselves. So will nations that sought to \n     water down the ILO action, including fellow autocracies like \n     Malaysia and China and, more surprisingly, democracies like \n     India and Japan. Those nations, though, found themselves very \n     much in the minority, just as Burma finds itself more \n     isolated than ever.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 19, 2000]\n\n                          The Ruin of Myanmar\n\n       The Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar is a case study in \n     repression and misgovernment. For 12 years a secretive \n     military junta has ground down the liberties and living \n     standards of 50 million people. By banning most contact with \n     the outside world and buying off the leadership of restive \n     ethnic minorities, the junta has deflected serious challenges \n     to its rule, despite the dismal failure of its economic \n     policies and spreading social ills.\n       The military has ruled Myanmar since 1962, when it was \n     known as Burma. After the violent suppression of democracy \n     movement in 1988, an even more ruthless set of generals took \n     charge. They permitted elections in 1990, then ignored the \n     results when democratic forces led by Daw Aung Sang Suu Kyi \n     won an overwhelming victory. She has spent 6 of the past 11 \n     years under house arrest. Other leaders of her party have \n     been relentlessly persecuted, university students have been \n     relocated from the cities, and unions and civic associations \n     have been prohibited. The junta has banned computer modems, \n     e-mail and the Internet and made it a crime for people to \n     invite foreigners into their homes.\n       The Times's Blaine Harden recently reported that Myanmar, \n     which a half-century ago had one of Asia's best health care \n     systems and highest literacy rates, is now near the bottom in \n     these and many other measures of development as government \n     spending has been diverted from schools and health care to \n     the military. Most people now live on less than a dollar a \n     day. Drug smuggling and AIDS have grown explosively and \n     threaten to spill over to neighboring countries like China \n     and Thailand.\n       The United States has led international efforts to isolate \n     Myanmar through economic sanctions, including a ban on new \n     investment. But other Asian countries have been reluctant to \n     apply pressure. China, in particular, has helped sustain the \n     junta through\n\n[[Page S5458]]\n\n     military aid. But an increasing number of countries are \n     losing patience. Last week the 175-member International Labor \n     Organization took the unusual step of condemning the junta's \n     use of forced labor and invited member countries to impose \n     sanctions. A good start would be restricting trade and \n     investment in areas of the economy that profit from forced \n     labor. Washington too should consider additional steps like \n     encouraging disinvestment by American companies. Myanmar's \n     people deserve international support in their struggle \n     against a destructive tyranny.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 927. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide for \na prohibition on use of mobile telephones while operating a motor \nvehicle; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, the Mobile \nTelephone Driving Safety Act of 2001, to enhance highway safety by \nencouraging States to restrict the use of cell phones while operating a \nmotor vehicle.\n  The cell phone is an important and valuable type of technology that \nhas grown increasingly popular throughout our nation. But as cell phone \nuse has grown, so has a related problem, the increasing number of \ntraffic accidents caused by drivers who are distracted by cell phone \nuse.\n  The risks of driving while talking on the phone were made very clear \nto many Americans when on April 29, 2001 a car containing model Nikki \nTaylor crashed into a utility pole. The driver of the car admitted that \nhe had been distracted from operating the car when he tried to answer \nhis cellular telephone. That few second distraction was all that was \nnecessary to cause the crash. As a result, Ms. Taylor suffered severe \nand life-threatening injuries.\n  Unfortunately, Ms. Taylor's case is just the most visible recent \nexample of a much broader problem. Several studies have established \nthat using a cell phone while driving substantially increases the risk \nof an accident. One, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, \nconcluded that ``use of cellular telephones in motor vehicles is \nassociated with a quadrupling of the risks of a collision during the \nbrief period of a call''. The study goes on to say ``this relative risk \nis similar to the hazard associated with driving with a blood alcohol \nlevel at the legal limit''.\n  In response to the growing problem of cell phone use while driving, \ncounties and municipalities around the country, including two \nmunicipalities in my own State of New Jersey, have banned the use of \ncell phones while driving on their roads. Just recently, Governor \nPataki of New York endorsed similar statewide legislation. Yet, at this \npoint, no State has actually enacted such a law. Many cite strong \nindustry resistance to explain the failure of state legislatures to \nact.\n  While some wireless industry representatives may resist cell phone \ndriving safety legislation, the American people strongly support the \nidea. A recent poll by Quinnipiac University showed that 87 percent of \nNew York voters support such a ban. This survey echoes the results from \nother surveys taken nationwide.\n  In addition to preventing accidents and saving lives, a ban on cell \nphone use while driving also would help lower the cost of auto \ninsurance. That is especially important to me because I represent a \nstate in which insurance premiums are among the highest in the nation.\n  The Mobile Telephone Driving Safety Act of 2001 is structured in a \nmanner similar to other Federal laws designed to promote highway \nsafety, such as laws that encourage states to enact tough drunk driving \nstandards. Under the legislation, a portion of Federal highway funds \nwould be withheld from States that do not enact a ban on cell phone use \nwhile driving. Initially, this funding could be restored if states act \nto move into compliance. Later, the highway funding forfeited by one \nstate would be distributed to other states that are in compliance. \nExperience has shown that the threat of losing highway funding is very \neffective in ensuring that states comply.\n  To meet the bill's requirements, States would have to ban cell phone \nuse while driving. However, such a ban need not be absolute. It could \ninclude an exception where there are exceptional circumstances, such as \nthe use of a phone to report a disabled vehicle or medical emergency. \nIn addition, if a state makes a determination that the use of ``hands \nfree'' cell phones does not pose a threat to public safety, such use \ncould be exempted from the ban, as well.\n  This is a necessary bill to keep our streets and highways safe. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 928. A bill to amend the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n1967 to require, as a condition of receipt or use of Federal financial \nassistance, that States waive immunity to suit for certain violations \nof that Act, and to affirm the availability of certain suits for \ninjunctive relief to ensure compliance with that Act; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today to \nintroduce legislation that will restore to state employees the ability \nto bring claims of age discrimination against their employers under the \nAge Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967. The Older Workers Rights \nRestoration Act of 2001 seeks to provide state employees who allege age \ndiscrimination the same procedures and remedies as those afforded to \nother employees with respect to ADEA.\n  This legislation is needed to protect older workers like Professor \nDan Kimel, who has taught physics Florida State University for nearly \n35 years. Professor Kimel testified at a recent hearing before the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that, despite \nhis years of faithful service, in 1992 he was earning less in real \ndollars than his starting salary. To add insult to injury, his employer \nwas hiring younger faculty out of graduate schools at salaries that \nwere higher than he and other long-service faculty members were \nearning. In 1995, Professor Kimel and 34 colleagues brought a claim of \nage discrimination against the Florida Board of Regents.\n  Dan Kimel and his colleagues brought their cases under the Age \nDiscrimination and Employment Act of 1967, ADEA. In 1974, Congress \namended the ADEA to ensure that state employees, such as Dan Kimel had \nfull protection against age discrimination. I stand before you today \nbecause this past year the Supreme Court ruled that Dan Kimel and other \naffected faculty do not have the right to bring their ADEA claims \nagainst their employer. The Court in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, \nheld that Congress did not have the power to abrogate state sovereign \nimmunity to individuals under the ADEA. As a result of the decision, \nstate employees, who are victims of age discrimination, no longer have \nthe remedies that are available to individuals who work in the private \nsector, for local governments or for the federal government. Indeed, \nunless a state chooses to waive its sovereign immunity or the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission decides to bring a suit, state \nworkers no longer have a federal remedy for their claims of age \ndiscrimination. In effect, this decision has transformed older state \nemployees into second class citizens.\n  For a right without a remedy is no right at all. Employees should not \nhave to lose their right to redress simply because they happen to work \nfor a state government. And a considerable portion of our workforce has \nbeen impacted. In Vermont, for example, the State is one of our largest \nemployers. We cannot and should not permit these state workers to lose \nthe right to redress age discrimination.\n  This legislation will resolve this problem. The Older Workers Rights \nRestoration Act of 2001 will restore the full protections of the ADEA \nto Dan Kimel and countless other state employees in federally assisted \nprograms. The legislation will do this by requiring the states to waive \ntheir sovereign immunity as a condition of receiving federal funds for \ntheir programs or activities. The Older Workers Rights Restoration Act \nof 2001 follows the framework of many other civil rights laws, \nincluding the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987. Under this \nframework, immunity is only waived with regard to the program or \nactivity actually receiving federal funds. States are not obligated to \naccept such funds; and if they do not they are immune from private ADEA \nsuits. The legislation also\n\n[[Page S5459]]\n\nconfirms that these employees may bring actions for equitable relief \nunder the ADEA.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 928\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Older Workers' Rights \n     Restoration Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since 1974, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 (29 U.S.C. 621 et seq.) has prohibited States from \n     discriminating in employment on the basis of age. In EEOC v. \n     Wyoming, 460 U.S. 226 (1983), the Supreme Court upheld \n     Congress' constitutional authority to prohibit States from \n     discriminating in employment on the basis of age. The \n     prohibitions of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 remain in effect and continue to apply to the States, as \n     the prohibitions have for more than 25 years.\n       (2) Age discrimination in employment remains a serious \n     problem both nationally and among State agencies, and has \n     invidious effects on its victims, the labor force, and the \n     economy as a whole. For example, age discrimination in \n     employment--\n       (A) increases the risk of unemployment among older workers, \n     who will as a result be more likely to be dependent on \n     government resources;\n       (B) prevents the best use of available labor resources;\n       (C) adversely effects the morale and productivity of older \n     workers; and\n       (D) perpetuates unwarranted stereotypes about the abilities \n     of older workers.\n       (3) Private civil suits by the victims of employment \n     discrimination have been a crucial tool for enforcement of \n     the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 since the \n     enactment of that Act. In Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, \n     120 S. Ct. 631 (2000), however, the Supreme Court held that \n     Congress lacks the power under the 14th amendment to the \n     Constitution to abrogate State sovereign immunity to suits by \n     individuals under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967. The Federal Government has an important interest in \n     ensuring that Federal financial assistance is not used to \n     subsidize or facilitate violations of the Age Discrimination \n     in Employment Act of 1967. Private civil suits are a critical \n     tool for advancing that interest.\n       (4) As a result of the Kimel decision, although age-based \n     discrimination by State employers remains unlawful, the \n     victims of such discrimination lack important remedies for \n     vindication of their rights that are available to all other \n     employees covered under that Act, including employees in the \n     private sector, local government, and the Federal Government. \n     Unless a State chooses to waive sovereign immunity, or the \n     Equal Employment Opportunity Commission brings an action on \n     their behalf, State employees victimized by violations of the \n     Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 have no adequate \n     Federal remedy for violations of that Act. In the absence of \n     the deterrent effect that such remedies provide, there is a \n     greater likelihood that entities carrying out programs and \n     activities receiving Federal financial assistance will use \n     that assistance to violate that Act, or that the assistance \n     will otherwise subsidize or facilitate violations of that \n     Act.\n       (5) Federal law has long treated nondiscrimination \n     obligations as a core component of programs or activities \n     that, in whole or part, receive Federal financial assistance. \n     That assistance should not be used, directly or indirectly, \n     to subsidize invidious discrimination. Assuring \n     nondiscrimination in employment is a crucial aspect of \n     assuring nondiscrimination in those programs and activities.\n       (6) Discrimination on the basis of age in programs or \n     activities receiving Federal financial assistance is, in \n     contexts other than employment, forbidden by the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.). Congress \n     determined that it was not necessary for the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975 to apply to employment \n     discrimination because the Age Discrimination in Employment \n     Act of 1967 already forbade discrimination in employment by, \n     and authorized suits against, State agencies and other \n     entities that receive Federal financial assistance. In \n     section 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 (42 \n     U.S.C. 2000d-7), Congress required all State recipients of \n     Federal financial assistance to waive any immunity from suit \n     for discrimination claims arising under the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975. The earlier limitation in the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975, originally intended only to avoid \n     duplicative coverage and remedies, has in the wake of the \n     Kimel decision become a serious loophole leaving millions of \n     State employees without an important Federal remedy for age \n     discrimination, resulting in the use of Federal financial \n     assistance to subsidize or facilitate violations of the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.\n       (7) The Supreme Court has upheld Congress' authority to \n     condition receipt of Federal financial assistance on \n     acceptance by the States or other recipients of conditions \n     regarding or related to the use of that assistance, as in \n     Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979). The \n     Court has further recognized that Congress may require a \n     State, as a condition of  receipt of Federal financial \n     assistance, to waive the State's sovereign immunity to \n     suits for a violation of Federal law, as in College \n     Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education \n     Expense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999). In the wake of the \n     Kimel decision, in order to assure compliance with, and to \n     provide effective remedies for violations of, the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 in State programs \n     or activities receiving or using Federal financial \n     assistance, and in order to ensure that Federal financial \n     assistance does not subsidize or facilitate violations of \n     the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, it is \n     necessary to require such a waiver as a condition of \n     receipt or use of that assistance.\n       (8) A State's receipt or use of Federal financial \n     assistance in any program or activity of a State will \n     constitute a limited waiver of sovereign immunity under \n     section 7(g) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 (as added by section 4 of this Act). The waiver will not \n     eliminate a State's immunity with respect to programs or \n     activities that do not receive or use Federal financial \n     assistance. The State will waive sovereign immunity only with \n     respect to suits under the Age Discrimination in Employment \n     Act of 1967 brought by employees within the programs or \n     activities that receive or use that assistance. With regard \n     to those programs and activities that are covered by the \n     waiver, the State employees will be accorded only the same \n     remedies that are accorded to other covered employees under \n     the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.\n       (9) The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that State \n     sovereign immunity does not bar suits for prospective \n     injunctive relief brought against State officials, as in Ex \n     parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). Clarification of the \n     language of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 \n     will confirm that that Act authorizes such suits. The \n     injunctive relief available in such suits will continue to be \n     no broader than the injunctive relief that was available \n     under that Act before the Kimel decision, and that is \n     available to all other employees under that Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide to State employees in programs or activities \n     that receive or use Federal financial assistance the same \n     rights and remedies for practices violating the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 as are available to \n     other employees under that Act, and that were available to \n     State employees prior to the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, 120 S. Ct. 631 (2000);\n       (2) to provide that the receipt or use of Federal financial \n     assistance for a program or activity constitutes a State \n     waiver of sovereign immunity from suits by employees within \n     that program or activity for violations of the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; and\n       (3) to affirm that suits for injunctive relief are \n     available against State officials in their official \n     capacities for violations of the Age Discrimination in \n     Employment Act of 1967.\n\n     SEC. 4. REMEDIES FOR STATE EMPLOYEES.\n\n       Section 7 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 (29 U.S.C. 626) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(g)(1)(A) A State's receipt or use of Federal financial \n     assistance for any program or activity of a State shall \n     constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity, under the 11th \n     amendment to the Constitution or otherwise, to a suit brought \n     by an employee of that program or activity under this Act for \n     equitable, legal, or other relief authorized under this Act.\n       ``(B) In this paragraph, the term `program or activity' has \n     the meaning given the term in section 309 of the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6107).\n       ``(2) An official of a State may be sued in the official \n     capacity of the official by any employee who has complied \n     with the procedures of subsections (d) and (e), for \n     injunctive relief that is authorized under this Act. In such \n     a suit the court may award to the prevailing party those \n     costs authorized by section 722 of the Revised Statutes (42 \n     U.S.C. 1988).''.\n\n     SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this \n     Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any \n     person or circumstance is held to be invalid, the remainder \n     of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and the \n     application of such provision or amendment to another person \n     or circumstance shall not be affected.\n\n     SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) Waiver of Sovereign Immunity.--With respect to a \n     particular program or activity, section 7(g)(1) of the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. \n     626(g)(1)) applies to conduct occurring on or after the day, \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, on which a State \n     first receives or uses Federal financial assistance for that \n     program or activity.\n       (b) Suits Against Officials.--Section 7(g)(2) of the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. \n     626(g)(2)) applies to any suit pending on or after the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n\n\n[[Page S5460]]\n\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored today to join Chairman \nJeffords and Senator Feingold to introduce the Older Workers' Rights \nRestoration Act of 2001. Our goal is to restore to older state \ngovernment workers the right to seek remedies for age discrimination. A \nrecent decision by the Supreme Court took that right away. State \nworkers now have fewer federal protections against age discrimination \nthan other employees in the country. This bill will remedy that \ninjustice.\n  In 1967, Congress outlawed age discrimination in employment in the \nprivate sector by passing the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. In \n1974, recognizing that employees of state government agencies were also \noften subject to pervasive and arbitrary age discrimination, Congress \nextended the Act to cover state governments. For more than 25 years, \nstate employees were protected from age discrimination, and had the \nsame remedies as all other employees covered by this law.\n  But in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, decided last year, the \nSupreme Court held that Congress lacked the power to subject states to \nsuits under the federal age discrimination laws. As a result, unless a \nstate agrees to allow suits against its agencies in such cases, state \nemployees cannot seek relief on their own behalf to remedy age \ndiscrimination.\n  In a recent hearing before the Labor Committee, I was privileged to \nhear the eloquent testimony of Dr. J. Daniel Kimel, the plaintiff in \nthe Supreme Court case. Dr. Kimel has been a professor of physics at \nFlorida State University for 35 years and is paid less than younger \nfaculty. Because of the Supreme Court's ruling, Dr. Kimel has been \nunable to seek any remedy at all for this age-based salary \ndiscrimination.\n  Large numbers of State employees, those who work for State colleges \nand universities, State police forces, State departments of \ntransportation, State environmental protection agencies and many other \nState agencies, lack effective Federal remedies for age discrimination. \nThat result is unfair. These State workers are vulnerable to age \ndiscrimination, which wastes valuable talent and adversely affects \nmorale.\n  No worker should be subject to discriminatory hiring, firing, or \nother job action based on age or any other characteristic that has \nnothing to do with job performance. We must act to see that workers are \nadequately protected against this threat.\n  The bill that Chairman Jeffords, Senator Feingold and I are \nintroducing today is in the best tradition of the nation's civil rights \nlaws. It provides that when a State program receives Federal tax \ndollars, the program must permit its employees to seek remedies under \nthe Federal age discrimination law. The courts have long recognized \nthat Congress can act to see that Federal funds are not used to \nsubsidize discrimination, and this is what our bill will do. In fact, \nall of the scholars who testified in our Committee hearing agree that \nthis is an appropriate and constitutional use of Congress' power.\n  This important bill will help to ensure that all Americans are \nprotected from age discrimination in employment. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this needed legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON:\n  S. 929. A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to preserve \ncharitable giving; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Preserve \nCharitable Giving Act. I am proud of this legislation but am profoundly \nsaddened that it has become necessary.\n  Aggressive union organizing tactics have made this legislation \nnecessary because those tactics have forced many of our nation's \nlargest retailers who allow charities to solicit donations on their \npremises to also give unions access to their premises for the express \npurpose of organizing or face a flurry of unfair labor practice \ncharges. When faced with this situation, these retailers are thus \nforced to deny access to everyone, resulting in a loss of charitable \ndonations. The magnitude of this loss cannot be overstated, as \ncharitable donations raised through Wal*Mart alone are over $127 \nmillion annually. This means that there are now fewer hot meals for the \nhungry, fewer toys for poor children, and less clothing and shelter for \nthe homeless.\n  This is unacceptable. Companies should not be forced to choose \nbetween furthering charity or increasing union membership. The Preserve \nCharitable Giving Act will clarity the National Labor Relations Act so \nthat retailers who choose to allow access to their premises for \ncharitable solicitations will not also be forced to give access for \nunion organizing purposes. Thus, I ask my colleagues to preserve \ncharitable giving by helping to enact this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 929\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Preserve Charitable Giving \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROPERTY ACCESS.\n\n       Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act is \n     amended by adding after ``section 7'' the following: \n     ``Provided, That in the case of a published, written, or \n     posted no solicitation or no access rule, an exception for \n     charitable, eleemosynary, or other beneficent purposes shall \n     not be grounds for finding an unfair labor practice''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 930. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to set \naside up to $2 per person from park entrance fees or assess up to $2 \nper person visiting the Grand Canyon National Park to secure bonds for \ncapital improvements, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill authorize the Secretary of Interior to develop and implement a \nbonding program to help finance capital improvement projects at the \nGrand Canyon National Park in Arizona.\n  For the past few years, I have worked on legislation to implement a \nnational parks bonding program to benefit the National Parks system by \nproposing a unique public-private partnership mechanism to finance \ncapital improvements through bond revenues. This legislation has \nreceived substantial support by many of the organizations working with \nthe National Parks system. The legislation I am introducing today is \nsimilar to the National Parks Capital Improvements Act of 2001, but it \nspecifically authorizes a park-specific bonding program for the Grand \nCanyon National Park in my home state of Arizona.\n  This park-specific proposal is similar to actions taken back in the \nlate 1980's to legislate a solution to the air traffic and noise \npollution problems affecting the Grand Canyon National Park caused by \noverflights over the canyon. Congress enacted legislation to require \nspecific measures to mitigate air traffic through the National Parks \nOverflights Act. Once a framework for the Grand Canyon National Park \nwas established, it became clear that broader legislation was necessary \nto address similar overflights issues to promote safety and quiet in \nthe entire national parks system.\n  Much in the same way, I am proposing to allow the Secretary of \nInterior to utilize the bonding mechanism at the Grand Canyon National \nPark, in partnership with a supporting organization. Bonding has worked \nwell in other governmental sectors to leverage additional financing for \nlocal projects where federal or state resources are not otherwise \nsufficient or available.\n  This bonding legislation, as well as the broader national parks \nbonding bill, would allow the Grand Canyon National Park to utilize up \nto $2 of its existing fee structure to dedicate to securing bonds to \nfinance capital improvement projects. For example, based on current \nvisitation rates at the Grand Canyon, a $2 surcharge would enable us to \nraise $100 million from a bond issue amortized over 20 years. That is a \nsignificant amount of money which could be used to accomplish many \ncritical park projects. With approximately 1.2 million acres to \nprotect, this type of financial tool would go far to help redress the \nbacklog of needed repairs, maintenance and other\n\n[[Page S5461]]\n\napproved projects at the Grand Canyon National Park.\n  I remain committed to broader legislation to implement a park-wide \nbonding program. However, I am proposing that we should also consider \ntesting this innovative approach by authorizing its use to help protect \none of the nation's largest and most magnificent parks, the Grand \nCanyon.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the text of this bill in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 930\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Durbin, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 932. A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to establish \nthe conservation security program; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Conservation \nSecurity Act of 2001, a bill that represents a fresh bipartisan farmer-\nfriendly approach to farm policy and agricultural conservation. I am \npleased to be joined by my colleague Senator Gordan Smith from Oregon, \nas well as Senators Daschle, Leahy, Dorgan, Johnson, Dayton, Schumer, \nClinton, Stabenow, Kohl, Sarbanes, Kerry, Kennedy, Wellstone, Durbin, \nand Boxer.\n  America's farmers and ranches produce a bountiful, safe, and \nnourishing food supply, and they also protect our natural resources, \nenvironment and wildlife habitat. Farmers and ranches have a long \nhistory of stewardship of private lands. They are the key to enhancing \nconservation of resources for future generations.\n  Private land conservation became a national priority in the days of \nthe Dust Bowl, leading to the creation in the 1930s of the Soil \nConservation Service, (now the Natural Resources Conservation Service), \nat the Department of Agriculture. With the very foundation of our food \nsupply at risk, the federal government stepped forward with billions of \ndollars in assistance to help farmers conserve their precious soils.\n  Since that time, total federal spending on conservation has steadily \ndeclined in inflation-adjusted dollars. Funds for lands in production \nhave been especially hard hit. Yet today, agriculture faces a wide \nrange of environmental challenges, from overgrazing and manure \nmanagement to cropland runoff and air quality impairment. Urban and \nrural citizens alike are increasingly interested in supporting \nconservation on agricultural lands.\n  Farmers and ranchers pride themselves on being good stewards of the \nland, but they are limited by financial constraints. Every dollar spent \non constructing a filter strip or developing a nutrient management plan \nis a dollar unavailable for other purposes. And even in better times, \nthere is a lot of competition for each dollar in a farm's budget.\n  Who benefits from conservation on agricultural lands? As much or more \nthan farmers, all of us, depend on the careful stewardship of our air, \nwater, soil and other natural resources. Farmers and ranchers tend not \nonly to their crops and animals, but also to our nation's natural \nresources.\n  Since all Americans share in these benefits, it is only right that we \ncontribute to conserving private lands. It\n\n[[Page S5462]]\n\nis time to enter into a true conservation partnership with farmers and \nranchers to help ensure hat conservation is an integral and permanent \npart of our agricultural policy nationwide.\n  In the 1985 farm bill, we required farmers who wanted to participate \nin USDA farm programs to develop soil conservation plans for their \nhighly erodible land. This provision helped put new conservation plans \nin place for our most fragile farmlands. In the most recent farm bill, \nwe streamlined conservation programs and established new cost-share and \nincentive payments for certain practices. These measures have helped \nenhance the environment and natural resources, but we still have more \nto do.\n\n  The Conservation Security Act of 2001 builds on our past successes \nand takes a bold step forward in farm and conservation policy.\n  The Conservation Security Act would establish a universal and \nvoluntary incentive payment program, the Conservation Security Program, \nto support and encourage conservation activities by farmers and \nranchers. Under this program, farmers and ranchers could receive as \nmuch as $50,000 a year in-conservation payments by entering into 5- to \n10-year agreements with USDA and carrying out eligible conservation \npractices. Moreover, the program is designed to encourage \nimplementation of practices that address local conservation priorities. \nPayments are based on the number and types of practices and level of \nconservation carried out on their lands in agricultural production. \nFarmers and ranchers may choose to implement practices from one or more \nof the following three tiers of practices.\n  In Tier I, participating farmers would adopt or maintain basic \nindividual practices, including nutrient management, soil conservation, \nand wildlife habitat management on part or all of their operation. Tier \nI plans are for 5-year periods. Based on enrolled acreage, practices \nand the level of conservation, farmers or ranchers in Tier I would \nreceive annual payments that could reach as much as $20,000. A one-time \nadvance payment could be made of the greater of $1,000 or 20 percent of \nthe annual payment.\n  Farmers or ranchers in Tier II would implement more extensive \nconservation practices on their working lands. They could choose from \nTier I practices and practices II practices, including controlled \nrotational grazing, partial field practices like buffers strips and \nwindbreaks, wetland restoration and wildlife habitat enhancement, for a \nperiod of 5 to 10 years, at the farmer's discretion. The practices \nadopted in Tier II must address at least one resource of concern (i.e. \nwater quality, air quality, soil quality, wildlife habitat, etc.) for \nthe entire operation. For adopting or maintaining Tier II practices, \nfarmers or ranchers would receive up to $35,000 a year with access to a \none-time advance payment of the greater of $2,000 or 20 percent of the \nannual payment.\n  To qualify under Tier III, farmers and ranchers would adopt a \ncomprehensive set of conservation practices on the entire operation. \nThe Practices would address all resources of concern on the operation, \nincluding air, land, water and wildlife. For carrying out a Tier III \nplan of practices, farmers and ranchers would receive up to $50,000 a \nyear with access to a one-time advance payment of the greater of $3,000 \nor 20 percent of the annual payment.\n  Again, I emphasize, the Conservation Security Program would be \ntotally voluntary. Farmers and ranchers would decide if they want to \nparticipate and to what extent they want to participate. The more \nconservation they do, the greater the payment. Many farmers are already \nusing many of these practices, but they receive little or no financial \nsupport. This legislation changes that by rewarding those farmers and \nranchers who have already implemented these practices through payments \nfor maintaining them.\n  In addition, the Conservation Security Act provides a strong \nincentive to go beyond the farm's current level of conservation. And it \ndoes so in a way that is compatible with our international trade \nobligations. The payments received under the Conservation Security \nProgram would fit into the ``Green Box'' under the WTO Uruguay Round.\n\n  Payments received under the Conservation Security Program are not \nlinked to participation in commodity programs, and farmers don't have \nto participate in the Conservation Security Program to be eligible for \ncommodity payments. Further, the Conservation Security Act, which \nfocuses on land in production, complements and does not interfere with \nthe existing conservation programs. A farmer or rancher may participate \nin these programs, including the Conservation Reserve Program, the \nWetlands Reserve Program, and the Farmland Protection Program and still \nparticipate in the Conservation Security Program. We need to support \nthese and the other conservation programs, but to truly benefit \nagriculture and address the public's desire to enhance the environment, \nnatural resources and wildlife habitat on agricultural land we must \nalso address conservation needs on land in production.\n  Farmers and ranchers across our country want to take actions to \nenhance the environment, but they need financial and technical \nassistance. The Conservation Security Act provides that needed \nassistance. Further, the Conservation Security Act was crafted to \ninclude opportunities for all producers nationwide, including producers \nof fruits, vegetables, speciality crops, row crops and livestock to \nparticipate in the Conservation Security Program.\n  Our private lands are a national treasure, and conservation on farm \nand ranchlands provides environmental benefits that are just as \nimportant as the production of abundant and safe food. The Conservation \nSecurity Act will help secure the economic future of our farmers and \nranchers by providing them the means to increase their income while \nconserving our natural resources, the environment, and wildlife habitat \nfor today and for future generations.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 932\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in addition to producing food and fiber, agricultural \n     producers can contribute to the public good by providing \n     improved soil productivity, clean air and water, fish and \n     wildlife habitat, landscape and recreational amenities, and \n     other natural resources and environmental benefits;\n       (2) agricultural producers in the United States have a long \n     history of embracing environmentally friendly conservation \n     practices and desire to continue those practices and engage \n     in new and additional conservation practices;\n       (3) agricultural producers that engage in conservation \n     practices--\n       (A) may not receive economic rewards for implementing \n     conservation practices; and\n       (B) should be encouraged to engage in good stewardship, and \n     should be rewarded for doing so;\n       (4) despite significant progress in recent years, \n     significant environmental challenges on agricultural land \n     remain;\n       (5) since the 1930's, when agricultural conservation became \n     a national priority, Federal resources for conservation \n     assistance have declined over 50 percent, when adjusted for \n     inflation;\n       (6) existing conservation programs do not provide \n     opportunities for all interested agricultural producers to \n     participate;\n       (7) a voluntary, incentive-based conservation program open \n     to all agricultural producers that qualify and desire to \n     participate would--\n       (A) encourage greater improvement of natural resources and \n     the environment;\n       (B) address the economic implications of conservation \n     practices in a manner consistent with international \n     obligations of the United States;\n       (C) enable United States farmers and ranchers to produce \n     food for a growing world population; and\n       (D) encourage conservation practices that provide a public \n     benefit while not infringing on the freedom of an \n     agricultural producer to manage agricultural operations as \n     the agricultural producer chooses;\n       (8) total farm conservation planning can help producers \n     increase profitability, enhance resource protection, and \n     improve quality of life;\n       (9) on-farm practices may help deter invasive species that \n     jeopardize native species or impair agricultural land of the \n     United States; and\n       (10) a conservation program described in paragraph (7) \n     would help achieve a better\n\n[[Page S5463]]\n\n     balance between Federal payments supporting conservation on \n     land used for agricultural production and Federal payments \n     for the purpose of retiring agricultural land from \n     production.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to encourage the \ndevelopment and deployment of innovative and efficient energy \ntechnologies; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with Senators \nClinton, Leahy, Lieberman, and Schumer, the Combined Heat and Power \nAdvancement Act of 2001. This legislation ensures that highly efficient \nsources of electricity, such as combined heat and power systems, are \nable to interconnect nationwide with the electricity grid by \nestablishing uniform and nondiscriminatory interconnection standards. \nEnabling these innovative, clean, and efficient technologies to come \nonline will reduce energy costs and help protect public health and the \nenvironment.\n  Last week, President bush released the National Energy Policy \nDevelopment Group's comprehensive energy plan. I am pleased this plan \nincludes recommendations related to increasing energy conservation and \nefficiency. Specially, the plan recommends the development of well-\ndesigned combined heat and power, CHP, systems.\n  I am heartened that President Bush recognizes the positive impact \nthat CHP systems can have on our nation's energy needs. These \ninnovative systems produce both electricity and steam from a single \nfuel source in a facility located near the consumer. By recovering and \nutilizing waste heat, these systems save fuel that would otherwise be \nneeded to produce heat or steam in a separate unit. CHP systems can \nreach energy efficiency levels in excess of 80 percent. This is well \nabove the 33 percent average for conventional electrical generation \ntechnologies. In short, the U.S. can obtain more than twice the power \nfrom the same amount of energy by widely implementing combined heat and \npower technologies and applications.\n  Unfortunately, several regulatory and policy barriers block the \nwidespread use of these innovative technologies. The bill would ensure \nthat CHP systems and other innovative technologies can interconnect \nwith a local distribution utility and that the costs of such \ninterconnections shall be just reasonable, and not unduly \ndiscriminatory.\n  Currently, there are roughly 50 Gigawatts, GW, of energy produced \nfrom CHP systems annually. If this barrier is removed, 50 GW of \nadditional CHP electrical generating capacity could be brought to \nmarket by 2010. To illustrate the magnitude of potential savings to the \nentire nation, the result of this additional capacity is equal to all \nthe energy needed to power Massachusetts. Most of these systems are \ntargeted for industry, where thermal and electrical needs are most \noften located close together. However, there is also tremendous \npotential for CHP in homes. Fifty GW of CHP could light and heat 50 \nmillion homes, or 43 percent of all U.S. homes, for the same energy \nthat the central station plans could only light the homes. With removal \nof regulatory barriers, these efficient systems may begin to be \neconomical at the small sizes suitable for homes.\n  We cannot solve today's energy problems with yesterday's solutions. \nCHP represents an innovative approach to expanding energy supply by \nmaximizing energy efficiency. These systems will encourage \ntechnological innovations, reduce energy prices, spur economic \ndevelopment, enhance productivity, increase employment, improve \nenvironmental quality, and advance energy security and reliability in \nthe United States.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in my efforts to promote combined \nheat and power by co-sponsoring this important legislation. I ask that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 933\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Combined Heat and Power \n     Advancement Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the removal of barriers to the development and \n     deployment of combined heat and power technologies and \n     systems, an example of an array of innovative energy-supply \n     and energy-efficient technologies and systems, would--\n       (A) encourage technological innovation;\n       (B) reduce energy prices;\n       (C) spur economic development;\n       (D) enhance productivity;\n       (E) increase employment; and\n       (F) improve environmental quality and energy self-\n     sufficiency;\n       (2) the level of efficiency of the United States \n     electricity-generating system has been stagnant over the past \n     several decades;\n       (3) technologies and systems available as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, including a host of innovative onsite, \n     distributed generation technologies, could--\n       (A) dramatically increase productivity;\n       (B) double the efficiency of the United States electricity-\n     generating system; and\n       (C) reduce emissions of regulated pollutants and greenhouse \n     gases;\n       (4) innovative electric technologies emit a much lower \n     level of pollutants as compared to the average quantity of \n     pollutants generated by United States electric generating \n     plants as of the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (5) a significant proportion of the United States energy \n     infrastructure will need to be replaced by 2010;\n       (6) the public interest would best be served if that \n     infrastructure were replaced by innovative technologies that \n     dramatically increase productivity, improve efficiency, and \n     reduce pollution;\n       (7) financing and regulatory practices in effect as of the \n     date of enactment of this Act do not recognize the \n     environmental and economic benefits to be obtained from the \n     avoidance of transmission and distribution losses, and the \n     reduced load on the electricity-generating system, provided \n     by onsite, combined heat and power production;\n       (8) many legal, regulatory, informational, and perceptual \n     barriers block the development and dissemination of combined \n     heat and power and other innovative energy technologies; and\n       (9) because of those barriers, United States taxpayers are \n     not receiving the benefits of the substantial research and \n     development investment in innovative energy technologies made \n     by the Federal Government.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to encourage energy productivity \n     and efficiency increases by removing barriers to the \n     development and deployment of combined heat and power \n     technologies and systems.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to construct \nthe Rocky Boy's North Central Montana Regional Water System in the \nState of Montana, to offer to enter into an agreement with the Chippewa \nCree Tribe to plan, design, construct, operate, maintain and replace \nthe rocky Boy's Rural Water System, and to provide assistance to the \nNorth Central Montana Regional Water Authority for the planning, \ndesign, and construction of the noncore system, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleague \nfrom Montana, Senator Baucus, in introducing the Rocky Boy's/North \nCentral Montana Regional Water System Act of 2001. The purpose of this \nbill is to authorize a regional water delivery system which will serve \nboth the Rocky Boy's Reservation and the surrounding region in north \ncentral Montana. For the last few years I have been working on this \nbill with the members of the Chippewa Cree Tribe, the citizens of the \nsix towns affected, and the users of the eight water districts who have \njoined together to bring clean, safe drinking water to their families. \nMore than 30,000 people would be serviced by this rural water system.\n  This bill is needed now for a number of reasons. First, it will \nprovide a means to import water to the Rocky Boy's Reservation for \ndrinking and for other everyday needs. Over the last decade, the \npopulation of the Rocky Boy's Reservation has grown by 40 percent, \nleaving existing water infrastructure insufficient. Secondly, there are\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\nthree small water systems in the region which are currently operating \nout of compliance with the EPA's Surface Water Treatment Rule. Others \nare nearing non-compliance, and one has been issued an administrative \nrule by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality to begin water \ntreatment as soon as possible.\n  This bill helps us to realize that simply maintaining a small town or \ndistrict's water system can be so expensive and filled with red tape \nthat its users can hardly afford it. Under current law even if small \nsystems are able to be developed, they must be continually monitored \nand the results reported. That may not be a problem in a larger \ncommunity with a sizeable tax base and a labor pool, but in a rural \nsetting those expenses and responsibilities are spread between so few \npeople that it can quickly become a major problem. I know rural \nMontana. I can tell you our very smallest towns are hurting. They are \ndeeply affected by a lagging agricultural economy, and the inability to \nprovide water for any number of reasons could be enough to shut a small \ntown down. Is that what we want? I don't think so. One of the ways we \ncan address that problem is with the development of regional water \nsystems, which are more efficient, and easier to manage.\n  I truly believe it is time to stand up and face our commitments to \nIndian Country and rural America head on. This bill is the perfect \nopportunity for that, because it uses the teamwork of committed \ncitizens and builds on the system they have developed. This is a very \ngood example of cooperation between tribal and non-tribal entities, and \nof what happens when people come to the table ready to find a solution.\n  This project has been a long time coming. The State of Montana \ncommitted to it in 1997 with a promise of $10 million for construction, \nand by providing technical assistance through the Montana Department of \nEnvironmental Quality. Initial federal assistance followed in the form \nof an appropriation of $300,000 for engineering and planning for fiscal \nyear 2000. The report was completed and the preliminary engineering is \ncomplete. With the passage of the water compact settling the water \nrights between the Chippewa Cree Tribe and Montana, P.L. 106-163 signed \nby President Clinton in 1999, the stage was set for this project to be \nbuilt.\n  All the bases have been covered and it is time to authorize this \nproject. There is a real need for a less burdensome way to manage the \nwater needs of the area. The Rocky Boy's Reservation is in need of an \nexpanded water source and system, and smaller water districts and \nmunicipalities are also struggling to stay in operation. The best way \nto solve both these problems at once is to build an efficient regional \nwater system. I propose we do just that and show our commitment to \nrural America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5469-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 93--CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA, ITS \n    FACULTY, STAFF, STUDENTS, ALUMNI, AND FRIENDS, FOR 150 YEARS OF \n  OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO THE STATE OF MINNESOTA, THE NATION, AND THE \n                                 WORLD\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself and Mr. Dayton) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President,I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 1727, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1727) to amend the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \n     to provide consistent treatment of survivor benefits for \n     public safety officers killed in the line of duty.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing the \nFallen Hero Survivor Benefit Fairness Act as part of Economic Growth \nand Tax Relief Reconciliation Act.\n  Last night, I voted for the Smith amendment to add the Fallen Hero \nSurvivor Benefit Fairness Act to the reconciliation tax package, and I \nam proud to cosponsor the Senate companion bill, S. 881, introduced by \nthe senior Senator from Utah. Since the House of Representatives passed \nthe Fallen Hero Survivor Benefit Fairness Act, H.R. 1727, on May 15, \n2001, by a vote of 419-0, I am hopeful that this legislation to support \nthe families of our nation's public safety officers will soon become \nlaw.\n  This legislation extends present-law treatment of survivor annuities \nfor public safety officers killed in the line of duty on or before \nDecember 31, 1996. It is needed to correct a harsh inequity in the tax \ncode that treats some survivors of slain public safety officers \ndifferently than others based on the date of the officer's death. That \nis unconscionable.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 provided that a survivor annuity paid \non account of the death of a public safety officer who is killed in the \nline of duty is excluded from income for individuals dying after \nDecember 31, 1996. The survivor annuity must be provided under a \ngovernment plan to the surviving spouse of the public safety officer or \nto a child of the officer. Public safety officers include law \nenforcement officers, firefighters, rescue squad or ambulance crew. But \nthe family members of public safety officers killed before January 1, \n1997 are fully taxed on their survivor annuities.\n  I believe that survivors of public safety officers killed in the line \nof duty should all receive the same tax treatment. We should do all we \ncan to support the families of public safety officers killed in the \nline of duty. Basic fairness demands it.\n  I look forward to the Fallen Hero Survivor Benefit Fairness Act \nbecoming law. It is only right that our Nation's tax laws support the \nfamilies of public safety officers who gave the ultimate sacrifice to \nmake America a safer place.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we voted on 3 amendments last week, 17 \namendments yesterday, 27 amendments today. That is an awful lot of \namendments on a bill that should have been done after 20 hours, plus a \nfew votes.\n  We have had a flood of amendments, and almost all of them have come \nfrom the other party. Not one amendment from the other party has passed \nyet. That is after 3 last week, 17 yesterday, and 27 today. When is \nenough enough?\n  I ask this question in the spirit of bipartisanship that Senator \nBaucus and I have worked on since the first of the week and the entire \nwork of the Senate Finance Committee, in the spirit of how the Finance \nCommittee has always worked, and also in the spirit of the \nbipartisanship talked about 5 months ago in the new Congress. Why in \nthe new Congress? Because it is the first time in 120 years the Senate \nhas been evenly divided.\n  I hope that bipartisanship is not dead. But if bipartisanship is dead \nand buried within the last 5 months of this new Congress, I have not \nbeen invited to the funeral, and I don't think Senator Baucus was \ninvited either. Senator Baucus and I have been working on this tax bill \nsince January. That was right around the time the leaders of this body \nworked out power sharing. We all knew from the beginning that shared \npower brings shared responsibility. Where is the responsibility to get \nthe people's work done? Where is the responsibility to finish \nlegislation that has been worked upon for months by a committee of this \nSenate, one of the most powerful committees of this Senate? Where is \nthe responsibility to finish legislation that is the product of the \nbipartisanship that is known to be a product of the Finance Committee \nor the bipartisanship that was asked for in January? Where is the \nresponsibility to finish legislation that has ample bipartisan support \nto pass?\n\n  When this bill finally gets to that final rollcall vote, people are \ngoing to be shocked how many people are going to vote for this bill on \nfinal passage. Bipartisan, again.\n  Then, in the meantime, we are putting up with 27 rollcalls today, 17 \nrollcalls yesterday, 3 rollcalls last Thursday. Three long days of work \non this bill, and we still do not see light at the end of the tunnel \nbecause there are stalling tactics that for some reason or another go \nbeyond the protection of a minority within the Senate.\n  I don't argue with that protection of the minority. There is only one \npolitical institution in the United States Government where minority \nviews are protected. Those are in the Senate of the United States. \nThere are all sorts of rules to protect the minority. But there also \ncan be abuse of the protection that is granted the minority, way beyond \nwhat was ever intended by the people who wrote our Constitution or \nestablished the traditions and the rules of the Senate. There is a time \nwhen statesmanship has to be above pure politics meant to kill tax \nrelief for American taxpayers, a tax relief that is the third greatest \nin the last 50 years and the greatest in the last 20 years.\n\n[[Page S5485]]\n\n  There has to be a time when examples of bipartisanship have to be \nfollowed by those who are calling for bipartisanship. I think Senator \nBaucus and I have established a good tradition of bipartisanship, a \ntradition of bipartisanship that I hope will not only help get a \nbipartisan vote on this bill tomorrow or the next day, a bipartisan \nvote on a product coming out of conference but, more importantly, as I \nsaid in my opening remarks last Thursday on this bill, a bipartisanship \nthat will continue for many important issues that this Senate has to \nwork on the rest of this year and next year. There is a long list of \ntrade legislation our committee must produce. There is the issue that \nwas most important in the Presidential campaign of both candidates: \nprescription drugs for seniors and how that impacts upon the whole \nMedicare program. There are the problems of dealing with the uninsured, \nthe people who do not have health insurance. That is something that was \ninvolved in candidate Gore's campaign and Candidate Bush's campaign \nwith which we must deal.\n\n  There are issues of helping with tax incentives for people to save \nand to have better opportunities for pensions. There are the issues \ndealing with tax credits for higher education and the issue of \neducation savings accounts.\n  You can go on and on. But most of the major issues were part of the \nPresidential campaign, and for the most part to some degree or another \nwere part of the campaigns of each candidate for President in the last \nelection. Consequently, they have a right to be on the agenda. We have \na responsibility to make sure they are not only on the agenda but are \ncarried out.\n  So I hope what Senator Baucus and I have been working on since the \nfirst of the year will help produce further agreements. Some of them \nmay be even more important than this tax bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5485-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5485-S5487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               RELIEF ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I know the hour is late. I am deeply \nappreciative of the floor staff of this body. They worked late last \nnight and late again today. We started some 12 hours ago, so I will try \nto keep these remarks relatively brief, if I can.\n  It has been a little frustrating for this Member, and I suspect \nothers over the past day or so, as we have dealt with what arguably \nwould be the most significant piece of legislation we are likely to \ndeal with for the next decade. And that legislation is the tax bill \nthat is before us. So I wanted to take a few minutes to review the \nbidding, if I could, over what has happened over the last couple of \ndays. I'd like to review where we are and why there are so many of us \nwho have expressed our concerns about the direction of this \nlegislation, its substance, and its priorities.\n  It is not that those of us here object to a tax cut. In fact, the \noverwhelming majority of Democrats and Republicans support a tax cut. \nThat is not the issue. The issue is the makeup of this tax cut. The \nissue is the fairness of it, its distribution, and its size. And one of \nthe most significant issues is the inability to predict with any \ncertainty what economic conditions will look like 5 years from now, 3 \nyears from now, let alone 10 years from now, where much of this bill is \nbackloaded and when the effects of it will be felt the most.\n  I want to spend a few minutes and just go over, if I could, some of \nthe amendments we have considered today.\n  First of all, let me point out that it has been said by some that we \nhave had stalling amendments--27 amendments considered today, 17 \nyesterday, 3 the day before. We had a total of 20 hours of debate on \nthis bill, less than 1 calendar day of actual debate on this bill. You \nwere allowed to have 1 minute to explain an amendment and 1 minute to \nrebut that amendment. So as we have considered some 47 amendments over \nthe last 3 days, there has hardly been the kind of deliberative debate \none normally associates with the U.S. Senate.\n\n  There has been this abbreviated, truncated approach because that is \nall you are allocated under a reconciliation bill that gives you 20 \nhours: 20 hours to debate what arguably may be the single most \nimportant piece of economic legislation that this or succeeding \nCongresses will deal with for the coming decade or beyond. Twenty \nhours, less than 1 day.\n  I am one of a handful of people in this Chamber who was present 20 \nyears ago. I see my friend from Delaware in the Chamber. He was present \nin the Chamber 20 years ago when we considered a tax cut of equal \nmagnitude but of far less divisiveness. In fact, I think there were 10 \nor 11 of us who voted against that tax bill for the reasons that it \nwould contribute to expanding the size of the national debt; would \nresult in consumers paying higher interest rates for automobiles, for \ncollege loans, for homes; that we would end up in the red ink; and that \nour Nation would suffer economically.\n  At least back in 1981 we had 12 days of debate--not 20 hours. We had \n12 days of debate on that bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield on that one point?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator, if I am not mistaken, was one of only 10 or \nso who voted no. The Senator from Delaware voted yes on that amendment. \nI have cast over 10,000 votes as a U.S. Senator. It was one of the two \nvotes I most regret ever having cast. The other one was voting for a \nfine, decent man, Supreme Court Justice Scalia. I regret that because \nhis view turned out to be so fundamentally different than my view of \nthe Constitution.\n  One of the reasons why I think what the Senator is saying is so \nimportant is it took the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from \nDelaware--you doing the right thing in the first instance, me making a \nmistake--it took us almost 20 years to bail out. I have the scars on my \nback, as does the Senator. He did not deserve them, I do--for the \nefforts we had to undertake to put the budget back in shape.\n  We did that at a time when we had expanding productivity, when we had \na lot of unmet capacity in the country, when, in fact, we were moving--\nthere was a chance to rectify it. There will be no chance because when \nthis kicks in--and I am going to sit down--when this kicks in, because \nit is the same time guys like the Senators from Connecticut and \nDelaware, the baby boom generation, are going to be retiring.\n  Mr. DODD. That is right.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We are going to be in real trouble.\n  So I hope, I say to the new Senators on the floor, they do not make \nthe same mistake this senior Senator did almost 20 years ago; that is, \nvote for something such as this. We will pay a dear price in this \ncountry for this vote.\n  I compliment the Senator on his comments tonight, as well as his vote \nin the 1980s. I wish I had the foresight he had to know what was going \nto happen.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for those comments. Out of those \n10,000 votes he cast, by far, there were many more good ones. I \nappreciate his comments this evening.\n  Mr. President, I stood in that debate. I remember the debate well. \nWhen you compare this week's debate to that debate of 20 years ago when \nwe had something like 115 or 116 amendments, maybe more, they were \nfully debated amendments. We had the give and take, back and forth over \nthe wisdom or demerits of the various proposals. That is not what has \ntaken place here today.\n  Imagine what it looks like to the American public as they watched \nthese last couple of days. We were placed in a situation of allowing \nonly 20 hours of debate under a reconciliation process that never \ncontemplated that a tax cut proposal would be a part of it. \nReconciliation was used and designed to reduce deficits, not to add to \nthem.\n  So by choosing the limitation of 20 hours, you have then forced \nMembers of this body to offer votes in what they call a vote-arama; \nthat is, no time for debate, just offer the amendment and vote.\n  So it has been tremendously distressing for Members who believe this \nbill needs to be modified substantially before it would enjoy the kind \nof truly broad bipartisan support of which the chairman of the \ncommittee speaks. That has not occurred. So we have had 20 hours of \ndebate, that is it, on a bill of such magnitude and such significance \nthat will crowd out our ability to invest intelligently in the needs of \nthis country.\n  Let me just briefly describe this tax bill. More than one-third of a \n$4 trillion\n\n[[Page S5486]]\n\ntax cut over the next 10 years will go primarily to the top 1 percent \nof income earners in America. The second one-third goes to the top 9 \npercent of income earners in America. But if you are in the 15-percent \ntax bracket, you get no relief. Of all the brackets that exist that is \nthe one that gets no tax cut at all. Mr. President, that is 72 million \nmiddle-income Americans. So if you are watching this evening or \nlistening to this discussion and you fall into that category, this tax \ndebate has nothing to do with you.\n  Two-thirds of this tax debate involves the top 9 percent of income \nearners in America. As a result of wasting $4 trillion, here are the \nthings we are deciding are of less significance, just so you know. Most \nAmericans were working today probably did not have the chance to tune \ninto this debate. So let me just review for them what happened.\n  These are some of the amendments that this body considered today. \nThis is what some of these amendments asked: Can we reduce the size of \nthis tax cut for the most affluent Americans by 1 percentage point in \norder to fund a prescription drug benefit for the millions of seniors \nin this country who are being swamped by the cost of prescription \ndrugs?\n  This body said: No, we think providing a tax cut for the top 1 \npercent of income earners is of a higher priority than providing the \nprescription drug benefit for Americans.\n  We asked how about doing something to protect Social Security and \nMedicare, because as my colleague from Delaware just absolutely \ncorrectly pointed out, the baby boom generation retires when the very \nworst aspects of this bill kick in. This body said no.\n  This bill is like a time-release capsule. You have all heard of time-\nrelease medicines. You take the medication, and nothing happens in the \nfirst 5 hours, or very little happens. Then, in the second 5 hours, the \ntime release produces the kind of benefits that would attack whatever \nproblem you are suffering from.\n  That is what this tax bill is. The first 5 years are relatively \nmodest, in terms of their impact. It is when the second 5 years kick \nin, that this tax cut becomes overwhelming in its impact on our budget. \nThat is exactly the time that you will have an overwhelming majority of \nbaby boomers retiring and who will need Social Security and Medicare.\n  It is not by accident that this tax bill was written that way. It was \ndesigned specifically to create the train wreck between the retiring \nbaby boom generation and this tax cut. This is not coincidental. This \nis what we have been trying to say over and over, with 1 minute \ndiscussions of these amendments. It is not the fault of the American \npublic. How do you get to understand the impact of an amendment when \nyou only have 60 seconds to describe the long-term effects of it?\n  Consider, if you will, the full funding for the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. We have debated over and over the importance \nof full funding for elementary and secondary education.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for an additional \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to respond to some of the things that \nwere said earlier, just to kind of bring this to closure from this \nSenator's perspective, if I may, and I ask for an additional 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will not object.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a very brief question. Will the \nSenator agree with me that if you want to know what a country values, \nyou should take a look at what its Tax Code says--who it makes pay, and \nwhat its budget is. I respectfully suggest that everything the Senator \nis saying--and I hope he continues to speak--reflects a fundamental \ndifference in values--not just priorities, a fundamental difference in \nvalues between those who support this bill--they are not bad votes. It \nis not good and evil; it is a different value judgment. This tax bill \nneither reflects my priorities nor my values.\n\n  The Senator has laid out a number of items. He is going to lay out \nmore. How do we explain that everybody in the Tax Code who is in a \ncertain income tax bracket gets relief except people in the 15-percent \ntax bracket? How do you do that? It is a value judgment.\n  I assume our friends think, if you give the wealthier people a cut, \nand not the middle-income people and the little guy, that somehow that \nis going to trickle down. That is a value judgment, a fundamental value \njudgment.\n  How do we stand around and say, somebody who receives $100 million in \ninheritance should get a tax break when, at the same time, it is going \nto be paid for out of Social Security and Medicare surpluses? This is \nabout values.\n  So I guess it is less a question than a statement. I hope the Senator \nlays out every one of these things because I think it is important the \npublic understand so they can make clear choices. What do they value \nthe most? This is a value judgment.\n  My friends on the other side always talk about values. Well, let me \ntell you, this is where the rubber meets the road. This reflects our \nvalues. I am where the Senator from Connecticut is. I hope he continues \nto educate me and the public about it. Make no mistake about it. It is \nnot just priorities; it is about our basic values, what we value most.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, if I may, I ask unanimous consent for 10 minutes at \nthis point to complete my thoughts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. With great indulgence, the Chair consents.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, to continue with these charts behind me, I mentioned \nthe rate cut for 72 million Americans, from 15 to 14 percent. We cut \nthe top rate of income earners at the very top of the income brackets \nof America, and every bracket on down, except the lowest one, which \naffects 72 million Americans.\n  You go on down the list. College tuition deductibility: The Senator \nfrom New York, Mr. Schumer, suggested, why not provide deductibility of \nthe high cost of college tuition? That amendment was rejected.\n  You go on down the list. Immediate marriage penalty relief: How often \nhave we heard about the penalties of the marriage penalty tax? We want \nto provide immediate relief for that. We are told no.\n  So offering these amendments during the day in this Chamber is not \ndilatory. These are not amendments that are designed to stall at all. \nTwenty hours of debate on a bill of this size, of this importance, is \ninadequate. This is not the House of Representatives. This is not some \nchamber in which just a handful, if you will, even a slight majority, \nshould be able to dictate entirely what they will at the expense of \nthose who have other points of view--even if it were only one. But when \nthe points of view reflect almost 50 percent of this body, shouldn't \nthose points of view be taken into consideration? We have been told \nrepeatedly throughout consideration of this bill that we have to get \nthis done. I don't disagree. But I don't think that we should rush \naction on this important legislation without taking thoughtful \nconsideration of its potential impact on the future health and growth \nof our economy. I do not think that is quite right.\n  Some of the most important debates we have had in this Chamber have \nbeen lengthy. They have been unfettered with time constraints on \noffering amendments over a 60-second period. We had a debate a few \nweeks ago on campaign finance reform. It took 2 weeks. Most Members, I \nthink, recognize it as one of the better debates in this Chamber. We \ndid not do it in 20 hours. We did it in 2 weeks.\n\n  We have had debates in the past on any number of issues that have \ntaken days. That is the unique nature of this body. That is the role of \nthe Senate: not to act as some body where it is only a question of \ngetting it done as fast as you can. This is the middle of May. It is \nnot the end of the session. We have had a new administration in town \nfor 16 weeks. This is a bill that we are considering that will have \nimpacts for 10 years.\n  So when Members bring up these alternative ideas of fair and fiscally \nresponsible tax cuts, the answer has been no. When we say, Social \nSecurity reform and debt reduction are important, the answer has been \nno. When we say\n\n[[Page S5487]]\n\nwe want to take care of spending caps, veterans benefits, middle-class \ntax benefits, the answer has been no.\n  That is not being frivolous. That is not being petulant. That is not \nbeing people who are in a tantrum, as someone said today. This is not \nabout Democrats and Republicans. It is not a battle about the \nPresidency and the Senate Democrats here. It is about the American \npublic. They are the ones who will live with the circumstances and the \ndecisions that we make in this body over the next few days for many, \nmany years to come. They are the ones who we have to keep in mind as we \ndraft this legislation.\n  There is no argument about having a tax cut. There is room in this \nsurplus for a tax cut. But there ought to be room, as well, to reduce \nthe national debt.\n  We pay $220 billion a year in interest payments on the national debt. \nThink how many classrooms could be built, how many people who could be \nmade healthy, how many houses could be constructed, how many water \nsystems or sewage systems could be repaired or built with the $220 \nbillion that goes to interest payments on the national debt. It does \nnot construct anything. It does not help anybody. All it does is pay \ndown on our financial obligations.\n  There is a great risk with the adoption of this tax proposal that we \nwill be back in red ink and in debt again. Interest rates will begin to \nclimb just as we saw in the 1980s. As those interest rates go up, the \ncost of an automobile, the cost of a home, the cost of a child going on \nto college, goes up. Then remember this debate and remember what this \nbody did. This body has acted in a way, in my view, that is \nirresponsible and unmindful of the cost to this society.\n  That is why it is important for us to take some time and think about \nwhat we are doing, and offer some alternative ideas that can improve \nthe quality of life for people.\n  So when it comes to prescription drugs, the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nelementary and secondary education, Medicare, Social Security, the \ninfrastructure of this country, the defense needs of America, the \nenvironmental needs of America, there will be no room in the budget of \nthe United States if this tax proposal is adopted.\n  I am alone in this Senate Chamber this evening, with the exception of \nthe Presiding Officer. It is late. It has been a long day. I am tired, \nas my colleagues are. But I wanted to take these few minutes to review, \nas I said, what occurred here today and yesterday because I think it is \nso fundamentally and profoundly important.\n  My hope is that people might speak up in the remaining 24 or 48 hours \nthat we have before we vote on final passage of this bill and leave for \nthe recess. I hope that people can express themselves and ask their \nMembers to think twice before they adopt a $4 trillion tax cut, the \neffects of which are cloudy at best, and is predicted by many to have \ndire consequences 10 years down the road. Who can say in 10 years what \nthe economy will look like?\n  There is an energy crisis looming on the horizon. What will be the \nimpact of that on this economy? We are told the administration wants to \nincrease defense spending by as much as $100 billion or $200 billion. \nWhat is the impact of that on this economy? And here we are adopting a \n$4 trillion tax cut. All of these events are coming together, and yet \nwe are also told we need to invest in education, in health care, and \nthe infrastructure of America. But where are the resources going to \ncome from?\n  It just doesn't add up. The math isn't there. We are told under the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act that we are going to have a math \ntest for every third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grader. \nI suggest we need a math test here because these numbers don't add up. \nA third, fourth, fifth or sixth grader would tell you that: Add these \nnumbers, and they don't produce a balanced budget or a surplus. They \nput this country in great economic peril.\n  That is why I take the floor this evening, to express my outrage and \nconcern about what we are doing: 20 hours of debate, and then a vote-a-\nrama with 1 minute to describe or offer some explanation of an \namendment that might make a difference on prescription drugs, on \neducation, on Medicare, on middle-income Americans, 1 minute.\n  These amendments and these votes will not be forgotten. They will not \nbe forgotten.\n  It has been said by philosophers that those who fail to remember the \nmistakes of history are doomed to repeat them, or words to that effect. \nNot unlike Cassandra of mythological note, for those of us who were \nhere 20 years ago, I beg and beseech my colleagues who are relatively \nnew: We don't tell you these things out of some sense of nostalgia. \nTwenty years ago, I heard the same arguments being made about the \nwisdom of a tax cut that was too big, too excessive. The overwhelming \nmajority of our colleagues in the Senate and in the other Chamber \ndisregarded those warnings and voted for a tax proposal that ultimately \nput this economy in a tailspin. As the Senator from Delaware has noted, \nit has only been during the last few years that we have recovered from \nit.\n  I deplore what is occurring here. I plead with my colleagues: Modify \nthis tax cut proposal. There is room for a decent, strong tax cut that \nwould provide benefits to almost all Americans while also providing \nroom to pay down the debt and to invest in the needed investments of \nour country in education and health care and the infrastructure of \nAmerica, to mention just three. There ought to be room to do all three \nof those things.\n  Adopting a tax cut that is too big is not unlike adopting a spending \nprogram that is too big. Imagine what we would be saying here today if \nsomeone were talking about a spending program of $4 trillion over the \nnext 10 years. We would be saying: How do you know whether or not we \ncan afford it 10 years from now? What will the economic conditions be \nin America 10 years from now?\n  It would be foolish to commit the resources of this country without \nhaving some idea of what the economic circumstances would be in our \nNation.\n  Is it any less foolish to commit ourselves to a $4 trillion tax cut \nunknowing of what the economic circumstances will be 2, 3, 4, or 5 \nyears from now? The answer is obvious.\n  For those reasons, I hope Americans across this country will raise \ntheir voices, will let Members know how they feel about this proposal, \nwill express their worry that we may be adopting a proposal that will \ncause this country serious harm.\n  I apologize for taking a few minutes this evening, but we have not \nhad time today to engage in debate. All we have had is 1 minute to \noffer amendments.\n  There are now recorded votes on where people stand on the issue of \nhealth care, education, Medicare, Social Security, transportation, and \na variety of other issues about which the American public cares.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to rethink this proposal. It \nis only May. Step back, rethink this, develop a truly bipartisan \nproposal. Come back and ask us to rethink how we might fashion a \nproposal that would provide tax cuts for Americans as well as leave \nroom for the other necessities of this Nation: Its defense needs, its \neducational needs, its health care needs. Those needs contribute to the \nlong-term security of America as well. Leaving them to be crowded out, \nas we are on this day in May, this early on in this new century, is a \nmistake of historic proportions.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/22/senate-section/article/S5487-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
