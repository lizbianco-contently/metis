Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I have spent many hours in the last few weeks looking at \nmatters of national security.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows--he is also a member of that \ncommittee--the hearings we have held, thanks to our outstanding \nchairman, Senator Levin of Michigan, have been invaluable. I also thank \nthe administration for providing us with briefings and meetings to give \nus the best possible understanding of the situation we face.\n  I also serve as a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee. I \nhave\n\n[[Page S9180]]\n\nspent the last couple months on the legislation creating the Department \nof Homeland Security. I pay tribute to the chairman of that committee, \nSenator Lieberman, who is also the author of that legislation. I think \nit is tragic that legislation has been hung up here in the Senate for \nmatters of political grandstanding rather than substantive \ndisagreement.\n  But there has been very little attention paid on the Senate floor or \nin Washington recently to the economic security of the American people. \nFrankly, if this administration has its way, I think there will be no \nattention paid to economic security at all over the next 6 weeks. If \nyou look at the condition of the economic security of this Nation, for \nmost Americans, you can understand why the White House wants to do \nanything possible to change the subject.\n  Yesterday's papers, alone, had one day of economic news that would \nsay we ought to put the economic security of this country on the \nhighest level of alert, a code red, for disaster, disaster, disaster.\n  As the papers reported yesterday, the Nasdaq exchange fell to its \nlowest level in 6 years, 77 percent below its high in the year 2000; a \n39-percent drop in this year alone.\n  The S 500 dropped near its 5-year low, 45 percent below its high \njust a couple years ago, and a 27-percent drop in this year alone.\n  The newspapers yesterday said the stocks were surging in July and \nAugust of this summer. There was hope, optimism for an economic \nrecovery being underway. But what happened? War scare happened. The Dow \nJones has dropped almost 1,400 points since August 22 of this year, a \n14-percent drop in its entire value in just 1 month.\n  Why? Well, yesterday's Washington Times said: ``On concerns about the \neconomy and a war.''\n  The Washington Post said: Uncertainty in the economy and a possible \nwar in Iraq. The Times and the Post agree.\n  According to the chief strategist for Lehman Brothers, the stock \nmarket is now heading toward its third consecutive down year, which \nwould be the first time since World War II--the first time in over half \na century--that the stock market has dropped for 3 consecutive years.\n  That means the 401(k) account or the IRA or the private savings \naccounts of many Americans are worth half, or even less than half, of \ntheir value when President Bush took office.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President and Members, it is more likely to get \nworse than better.\n  A Wall Street Journal headline yesterday said: ``Is Your Portfolio \nReady for War?--Iraq Attack Could Slash S 500 by 10%.'' That is \nanother 10 percent in addition to what has happened already.\n  Crude oil prices were reported yesterday as topping $30 a barrel, the \nhighest level in 19 months. The number of Americans out of work in this \ncountry since February of 2001 has increased by 2,300,000 of our fellow \ncitizens. Let me say that again. The number of Americans out of work in \nthis Nation has gone up since February of 2001 by 2,300,000; and we \ncan't get an extension of unemployment benefits passed in the Senate to \nprotect those who have lost their jobs and are suffering the drastic \nfinancial consequences.\n  Unfortunately, it is not likely to get any better, because the \nleading economic indicators fell in August for the third straight \nmonth.\n  The Wall Street Journal said their consensus economic forecast for \nthe last quarter of this calendar year--2002--has dropped 16 percent, \nand it also has been revised downward for the beginning of next year.\n  The chief economist for Wells Fargo Bank--a good Minnesotan, Mr. \nSuysoh said a war with Iraq could bring oil prices to over $40 a barrel \nand cause a major recession.\n  Some have said the administration decided to make the possibility of \na war with Iraq the main topic this fall, because the economic \ncondition of this country was so bad. Well, they have succeeded in \nmaking the war with Iraq the main topic, and they have succeeded in \nmaking the state of our Nation's economy even worse.\n  Those comments about orchestrating the timing are not mine. They are \nthe words of the White House Chief of Staff, Mr. Andrew Card, reported \non September 7 that the White House waited on its PR offensive about \nthe possibility of war until after Labor Day. He said:\n\n       From a marketing point of view, you don't introduce a new \n     product in August.\n\n  That is one heck of a product. This Senator's judgment, as a member \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee, is that Mr. Card is being \nhonest.\n  I have seen no new information and I am aware of no imminent threat \nto this country. The war scare that is going on now. The hurry-up-and-\nvote pressure on the Senate right now. The pressure to OK the first \npreemptive attack in this Nation's 213-year history. They are the first \ninstallment of a doctrine which the President announced in June, the \nright to a preemptive strike by the United States of America.\n  What would happen in this world if every other nation followed suit \nwith a preemptive strike against a possible future threat? What about \nIndia and Pakistan, who both possess nuclear weapons? What about Israel \nand the Palestinians, China and Taiwan, or North Korea and South Korea?\n  Does anyone stop to think whether this doctrine of preemptive strike \nwould make the world more or less secure?\n  Mr. Card, the White House Chief of Staff, is right. This new product \nhas caused quite a PR sensation. It is taking over the headlines--it \nhas replaced the stock market with Saddam Hussein. Talk about going \nfrom bad to worse. The trouble is that the stock market is also going \nfrom bad to worse.\n  The number of unemployed in America has gone from bad to worse. The \neconomic outlook of this Nation has gone from bad to worse. The Federal \nbudget forecast has gone from bad to worse. The economic security for \nmost Americans has gone from bad to worse.\n  I can understand why the White House might not be aware of all this, \nbecause the contributions to the Republican political committees are at \nrecord highs.\n  Yesterday's headline again: ``GOP Committees See a 40-Percent \nIncrease in Soft Money.'' Their bank accounts outweigh the Democrats by \nmore than 2 to 1. Their contributors have good reasons to be grateful.\n  The Brookings Institute reports that the top 1 percent of American \ntaxpayers--the wealthiest 1 percent of the people in this country--got \n37 percent of last year's tax cut. They pay 26 percent of the taxes, \nand they got 37 percent of the tax cut. The average tax cut for the \nwealthiest 1 percent of the people in this Nation under last year's \nbill was over $45,000. The average pretax earnings of the top 1 percent \nis over $1.1 million, and they got an average tax cut of over $45,000.\n\n  I have to say that this administration does have an economic recovery \nplan. The trouble is it is limited to the wealthiest 1 percent of \nAmericans. For the rest of America, we are in a real-life survival \nshow. They lose their jobs. The losers lose their health insurance. \nThey lose their retirement investments. And the winner of the show is \nsomeone like Jack Walsh, former chairman of General Electric. He has an \nannual pension of $9 million. I hope that was indexed to inflation.\n  General Electric shareholders, which include retirees whose \nportfolios, as I said earlier, dropped by 50 percent in the last 2 \nyears, also pay for Mr. Walsh's car and driver and for his floor seats \nat the New York Knicks basketball games. They pay for his boxes at both \nthe Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees baseball games. They pay his \nfees to four country clubs, and more.\n  I tell you, some corporate executives are no longer satisfied with \ngolden parachutes. They take the whole airplane.\n  American taxpayers ought to be asking themselves: Why does this guy \nneed a tax cut? Why did this administration insist on squandering over \n$2.2 trillion over the next 10 years on tax cuts where over one-third \nof the benefits go to the wealthiest 1 percent of the people in this \ncountry? It will cost the Federal Government $500 billion more over the \nnext 10 years just on the higher interest payments on the Federal debt. \nThat is $500 billion more in taxes to pay for fiscal irresponsibility. \nThat provides nothing for homeland security. That provides nothing for \nspecial education; nothing for anything that benefits the people of \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S9181]]\n\n  In 1 year, the non-Social Security budget of this country has gone \nfrom a 10-year forecast a $3.1 trillion surplus to a $700 billion \ndeficit. That is an almost a $4 trillion drop in 1 year. Not even \nArthur Andersen can hide that number.\n  Yesterday's paper reported that the Vice President is indignant about \nsuggestions that this war scare, this ``warphoria'' has been timed for \npolitical benefits this fall.\n  I wouldn't be indignant. I would be outraged, if the White House \nChief of Staff is correct in what he said--that the White House waited \nto introduce its ``new product'' until the fall of a midterm election. \nOnly the people who were responsible for those decisions know why they \nmade them.\n  But the American people will ultimately hold them responsible for \nthose decisions. The war scare has wiped the economy off the headlines. \nIt has also wiped any economic recovery for this country off the map. \nIt has wiped many Americans' jobs out of existence, and wiped many \nAmericans' prosperity from comfort to despair. If all of this is \nabsolutely necessary, it is unfortunate. If it is not, it is \nunforgivable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. I will be very brief. I was \ngoing to ask the Senator from Minnesota a question.\n  I will be brief because I know my colleague from Wyoming is waiting.\n  I wanted to first compliment him for his remarks and pose a thought \nand a question. I would be interested in what he has to say.\n  The President thinks strongly that Saddam Hussein must go, and go \nquickly. All of us are thinking about that and wrestling with that. I \nam not going to comment yes or no on that. The President should be \nspending time and effort focusing on it. It is a very important issue. \nI don't begrudge him for doing that. He is spending maybe half of his \ntime on it. It seems to me the other half of his time is spent on going \naround the country campaigning--half his time on the war effort, and \nhalf his time going around the country campaigning for candidates, and \nthe economy is not getting any of the President's attention.\n  As my friend from Minnesota has correctly laid out, it is going down, \ndown, down. Every day there is a new headline. We have one in New York. \nThe securities industry is going to lay off many more people at a time \nwhen we can't afford it. In every part of the country, you see this \ndown, that down, and this down.\n  I make a plea to the President. Spend your time focusing on Saddam \nHussein, but what about spending the rest of the time--instead of \ntraveling around the country going to political events--focusing on the \neconomy. We are a great Nation. We can do both. We can examine what we \nought to do in Iraq. At the same time, we can start focusing on the \neconomy and things such as getting people back to work, extending \nunemployment insurance, and lowering the cost of prescription drugs.\n  The President has been absent on every one of those issues. One \ndoesn't exclude the other.\n  I ask my colleague: Does he agree with those sentiments? Am I not \ncorrect when we read that the President is spending one-half of the \nweek going to different parts of the country simply campaigning, and \nthat I haven't heard him pronounce a thing about the economy and what \nwe are going to do about it in all too long a period of time? Then, \nwhen he says with sort of verbiage and nothing substantive, I do not \nknow if they have a single plan.\n  I don't know if they have a single plan, even though they withdrew \nthe tax cuts they proposed for the very wealthy. I ask my colleague, in \nlight of his excellent remarks, would he agree with me that all \nAmericans, Democrats and Republicans, Independents, want the President \nto come back home and spend some time focusing on the economy; that he \ncan do both, we can do both, deal with the war issue and focus on the \neconomy?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I absolutely agree with the Senior Senator from New York. \nWhat I find particularly disturbing is, as I know from experience in \nMinnesota, where the President has been to my State three times in the \nlast year in the midst of my colleague's very difficult election \ncampaign, the President has come in, raised a couple million dollars, \nand has charged part of the cost of this trip to the American \ntaxpayers. He gives one 20-minute policy speech somewhere and then goes \non to raise millions of dollars for campaigns, and the American \ntaxpayer is paying the bill.\n  I agree with the Senator, the President ought to stay at home. He \nshould focus on the economy, in addition to Iraq. And if he does travel \nfor political reasons, the American taxpayer should not be paying the \nbill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield to my friend from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was astounded to see some of the recent news coming out \non the economic front, the gap between the middle class and the \nwealthy, the gap between the rich and the poor, the fact we see in many \ncategories the worst economy in 50 long years in terms of jobs lost in \nthe private sector, in terms of the sluggish growth of the GDP, the \nnumber of foreclosures. It is stunning. One has to be concerned that \nthis administration is giving this no attention whatsoever, which was \nmy friend's point.\n  We look at a President who is spending half his time on foreign \npolicy; that is fine. This Congress is going to help in that area \nbecause we have a lot of ideas on how to meet the threat Iraq poses. On \nour side of the aisle, there will be different opinions on how to meet \nthat threat, which will show the strength of our democracy, and that \nthis party is, in fact, a broad umbrella, which is healthy in the long \nrun for the country.\n  The other half of the time seems to be spent on the road campaigning. \nI agree with my friend. Given the economic statistics--the stock \nmarket, we are looking at maybe a $4, $5 trillion loss, the worst in 50 \nyears, and the fact pensions are down--does my friend believe we ought \nto perhaps come up with something specific to ask the President?\n  For example, he keeps calling us to talk about foreign policy. Why \ndoesn't he call us to the White House to talk about this economy, to \nget the best ideas of Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents? \nThis isn't partisan. People are suffering out there, Republicans and \nDemocrats, Independents, young and old, for different reasons. So would \nmy friend think that might be a good way for this President to show he \ncares as much about the everyday issues our people are facing as he \ndoes about electing Republicans, and perhaps this would be a way to \nbreak through on this economy?\n  Consumer confidence is down. Perhaps that would give a spur to our \npeople and bring us together just as we get together on foreign policy.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for her question and comments. She \nis right on the money. It is a great idea. We are called, our \nDemocratic leadership, along with Republican leadership, to the White \nHouse on numerous occasions to discuss the war effort. That is good. \nThat is how America should work, particularly when it comes to wartime. \nBut in a sense we have an economic war here at home, as my good friend \nfrom California has enumerated: people losing income; people losing \njobs; people worried about the future; pensions way down.\n\n  Why are we not being called to the White House for an economic summit \non what to do there? I speak for all of us: We would be happy to meet \nthe President halfway or a good part of the way in terms of doing \nthings because the people are languishing. To ignore the economy and \nspend all this time running around the country campaigning is a \ndereliction of duty. He is not even up for election.\n  I thank my colleague for the question.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield for the last time.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Could the Chair tell me what the system is this morning? \nAre we going to have one side have all the time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York has the \nfloor. There are 10 minutes allotted to each Senator. The Senator from \nNew York has the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. How much time remains?\n\n[[Page S9182]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. He has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the 1 minute to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York.\n  Every economic indicator we want to go up is going down, and every \none we want to go down is going up. The Senator and I have worked \ntogether on one of the most critical issues that affect Americans, \ntheir pocketbook and quality of life, which is access to prescription \ndrugs. I share the concern that we do not see the focus on the economy \nand what needs to happen in the economy. The Schumer-McCain bill, now \nin the House of Representatives, which would lower prices for \nprescription drugs, is one very important piece of that economic \npuzzle. When we see that more people are lower income, their health \ncare costs are rising, I appreciate his leadership on that issue.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for her leadership as well.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/25/senate-section/article/S9182-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATE AT A STANDSTILL\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

I get a little exasperated, using all this time \nfor political comments when there are no ideas of what to do coming \nfrom the other side of the floor.\n  Actually, that wasn't why I came here, but I have to tell you it is \npretty frustrating to continue to hear that sort of thing--blaming the \nPresident when these folks have no idea what they want to do and no \nsuggestions, no leadership coming from the Senate. What are we going to \ndo about it?\n  What we have done is continue to work on two bills for about 4 weeks \nnow. Homeland defense is one of the most important issues we have \nbefore us, and it has been stalled. Although we have differing views on \nhow it ought to proceed, that is fine, that is part of the system here. \nWe ought to take a vote on those views and move forward, but instead of \nthat, we have had stalling on the other side, no chance to vote on \namendments, simply wanting to always vote on cloture, which is what we \nare faced with today.\n  The unwillingness of the majority leadership to allow votes on \ncertain amendments has created a standoff. We keep hearing about what \nelse you want to talk about over there, but we won't move off where we \nare. It is pretty frustrating. It seems as though that is the political \nmoment. We have to really get down to what it is.\n  The same thing is true of Interior appropriations. It has been on the \nfloor for 4 weeks. Yet we can't seem to move it to get some of the \nthings done. For those of us in the West, it is very important--public \nland fees and, so on, in which we are so involved. Maybe even more \nimportant than that, the more immediate issue, there is some drought \nrelief in this bill. There is something on forest fire suppression. We \ncan do those things. But have we moved? No.\n  We continue to stall and to have votes on cloture, which does not \nresolve the issue. All we need to do is have a vote on the amendments. \nIf you don't like the amendments, have a vote to table them. That is \nwhere we ought to be. That is the system.\n  To get up and start spending all of our time blaming the President \nfor an economic slowdown that began under the Clinton administration, \naccording to all the people who are familiar and knowledgeable about \nit, is to be a little tiresome, when we have an opportunity to move \nforward. There are a lot of things we ought to be doing in the \nrelatively short time we have left.\n  Obviously, homeland defense is one that has to be done.\n  We need to debate the Iraq resolution, which is going to take some \ntime. We need a CR if we are going to adjourn on the 19th of October. \nWe have an energy bill which we ought to move forward. We talked about \npharmaceuticals and Medicare. We could have done something in our \ncommittee, but the majority leader pulled it out of the committee. We \nwill not have time to accomplish these items as long as we remain on \nthe pending bills.\n  It seems to me it would be very frustrating to want to spend the time \nblaming the President for the economy when the Senate is not doing what \nwe can and moving forward.\n  I will not take any more time. We ought to look at what we are \naccomplishing instead of trying to put the blame on everybody else when \nwe have not succeeded in doing what we ought to be doing. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I thank my friend for his courtesy this \nmorning, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak for a few moments \nbefore assuming the Chair. I did want to follow up on the discussion \nthis morning on the economy. A few minutes ago, I indicated that every \neconomic indicator that should be going down is going up: job losses; \nhealth care costs; foreclosures; national debt; interest rate costs; \nSocial Security trust fund raid. Every part of the economy we wish to \nbe going up is going down: economic growth, down; business investment, \ndown; the stock market, down; retirement accounts, down; consumer \nconfidence; minimum wage.\n  We have a very disturbing situation. I wish to speak for a moment \nabout one piece of the economy that is so critical in the quality of \nlife of American families and American businesses which are struggling \nto pay the costs. Let me speak to one piece of the economic record of \nthe last 18 months, and that is that workers' payments for health \ninsurance is soaring.\n  We are seeing that the cost of insurance to cover a family has gone \nup 16 percent, and the cost of an individual has gone up 27 percent, \nover one-fourth increase in their costs. The costs are going up. Their \nsavings are down, their investments are down, and at the same time, we \nare seeing the biggest part of the reason for that health care cost \ngoing up as a result of the cost of prescription drugs.\n  We are seeing overall prescription drugs going up over three times \nthe rate of inflation. This is a critical part of the economic pie, the \ncosts for consumers right now. It is not inconsequential. It is not \nlike buying a new pair of tennis shoes or ``Gee, I would like to have a \nnew coat.'' This is lifesaving medicine, the difference between life \nand death, or whether a person goes into a nursing home or is able to \nlive at home. I am very concerned about this. What is the response?\n  We in the Senate have been focused on Medicare prescription drug \ncoverage and lowering prices for everyone. We have been successful in \npassing a bill that, in fact, lowers prices and creates more \ncompetition in the marketplace once a patent expires. But what is the \nresponse of the pharmaceutical industry within this context, with the \nstruggles that are going on for families, businesses, and farmers \nacross the country? What is their response right now? A new PR \ncampaign, not putting the millions of dollars into lower prices and \nmaking prescription medications available, lowering the premiums for \nsmall businesses. They have gone on a huge PR campaign.\n  We are seeing ads that I find, I have to say, absolutely outrageous. \nOne says: ``Pray for a Miracle.'' It uses the picture of a child who, \nobviously, is deathly ill. It says: ``Pray for a Miracle,'' because \nthey say generic drugs will never cure him.\n\n[[Page S9183]]\n\n  In the small print it says: ``They don't do research.'' Of course \nthey do not do research. They do not do research. They do not have to \ndo research. The idea of generic drugs is to take the formulas and the \npatents after the research has been done, after the American people \nhave helped to pay for that research through NIH funding, tax \ndeductions, and supporting the companies with a 20-year patent so they \ndo not have competition in recovering their costs.\n  The whole point of generics is the American public made a deal that, \nonce the 20 years is up, once those subsidies are up, they will have \nthat formula available so generic companies can manufacture those drugs \nand lower the prices.\n  Instead of working with us to have a system that works both for brand \nname companies to develop these new brand name drugs and also for the \nAmerican people to get the bargain they are supposed to get, which is \nlower prices, the companies are putting millions of dollars into a \nfront senior citizen group, ads on the air, getting involved in \nelections and running ads scaring people that somehow if we let the \nsystem work as we created it over the years in a bipartisan way, if we \nlet the system work, this child, who is obviously seriously ill, will \nsomehow be hurt. I find that absolutely outrageous.\n  I am concerned in the context of this economy and the debate and the \nAmerican people trying to figure out when they sit down in the morning \nwhat they are going to pay for--are they going to be able to afford the \nhealth care premium? Is that senior going to be able to afford their \nmedicine? Are they going to be able to pay for the clothes kids need \nfor school? Are they going to be able to do the other things they need \nfor their family?\n  Instead of working with us, the companies have chosen an outrageous \nPR propaganda campaign. I urge them to work with us to do the right \nthing. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards).

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have been listening to some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle saying the economic problems we have are \nsomebody else's fault. They blame the President. Unfortunately, in this \ninstance, the President cannot pass legislation. The President was \nsuccessful in working with us to pass the beginning of tax relief which \ntook effect in 2001, and most responsible economists I know suggest \nthat helped lessen the impact of the downturn which began in 2000, \nbeginning as early as the first quarter of 2000 and hitting its peak \nthe end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001.\n  We could do some things in this body. We could pass some laws that \nwould make a difference and help the economy get going. Frankly, one of \nthe great frustrations I feel is we cannot get about the business that \nwe are supposed to do on the Senate floor. If the majority leadership \nhad allowed the Senate Energy Committee to work its will on an energy \nbill, the committee would have reported out a proposal to allow \ndrilling on 2,000 acres in the barren northlands above the Arctic \nCircle in Alaska. That is called ANWR.\n  ANWR not only has the potential to replace the oil we must now buy \nfrom the malevolent, deadly dictator Saddam Hussein, ANWR could put up \nto three-quarters of a million people to work throughout the country, \nnot just in the drilling and work in ANWR, but providing the materials, \nmaking the steel and turning it into equipment, pipelines, providing \nthe infrastructure through the private sector that we need to bring \nthat oil down from ANWR.\n  I am still hoping we can get ANWR in the energy bill, a tremendous \nboost for the economy. Where else do we need a boost for the economy? \nIn large construction projects. There are construction projects shut \ndown all around the country because they cannot get insurance against \nterrorism.\n\n  Terrorism risk insurance was dealt with in the Banking Committee on a \nbipartisan basis. I understand they reported out a good bill to provide \nthat the Federal Government would be a backstop, on a sharing basis, \nfor the reinsurance of terrorism risk.\n  The majority leadership took it away. We cannot get a terrorism risk \ninsurance bill through this body because the majority leadership has \nchanged it into something that provides great new opportunities to sue \nthe victims of terrorist attacks for punitive damages. Punitive damages \nare not a way to build the economy. Those are two pieces of legislation \nwe could have gotten finished to help the economy get going. Making the \ntax cut permanent would be a third way of doing it.\n  I came to the floor to express what I believe is a great sense of \nfrustration by all of us. The Senate is stuck in neutral.\n  I have only been in the Senate 16 years, and by some standards that \nis a pretty short time. We honored our distinguished senior colleague \nfrom South Carolina yesterday, and we know of the record of great \nservice of others in this body, but in the short time I have been here \nI have never seen this body so dysfunctional. It is time we talked \nabout why we are dysfunctional. What is happening? What has gone wrong? \nWhy are we here? Quite simply, it is because some do not want to let us \nvote. This is the basic motivation and it is cloaked with all the talk \nabout cloture and filibuster, but we are still on an Interior bill \namendment which was offered 3 weeks ago. We are stuck because the \nmajority leadership does not want us to vote on that amendment.\n  There is plenty of time to vote, but for some reason some are \napparently afraid to vote. It is no more complicated than that. If we \nvote, we could get to the remaining amendments, pass the bill, and move \non in the next day or two. If the majority does not like it, they could \nmove to table it and we could have a vote; might win, might lose. We \ncould at least have a vote.\n  I have worked a long time on appropriations bills. I have worked very \ndiligently with the Senator from Maryland, the excellent chairman of \nthe VA/HUD Committee. We have a bill we would like to present to the \nSenate because it deals with some very important things for veterans, \nfor housing, for the environment, for economic development in our \ncommunities, for science, for space, for emergency management. We are \nready and willing, and there are nine other bills that are ready, but \nwhen we spend more than 3 weeks on one appropriations bill, we are not \ngoing anywhere. We cannot get there until the Senate does what it is \npaid to do, which is to vote up or down, win or lose, and let the will \nof the Senate prevail.\n  Some are suggesting--and this, I believe, is truly outrageous--the \nsponsors of the amendment should pull the amendment so some do not have \nto cast a difficult vote. Yes, this is a political season and it is \ntough, but that is what we get paid to do. We have cast 223 votes this \nyear, and I do not believe another one will make or break or overburden \nany of us.\n  The Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from West Virginia \neach have cast over 15,000 votes. They have shown they are not afraid \nto make hard decisions, and the hard decisions they have made have not \ntaken them away. The sponsors of the Craig-Domenici amendment have had \npeople die in their States. They have had millions of acres of trees, \nincluding old-growth trees, habitat, and wildlife, ruined by fire. \nHouses have burned. A sound and responsible solution has been put \nforward based on good science and sound forestry management. The Senate \nshould have the courtesy, if not the common sense, to vote on it.\n\n  How poorly are we willing to treat the Senators from these Western \nStates? I believe these Senators and their constituencies deserve a \nvote. If Senators want to vote against them, vote against them. They \nwill have to explain it if they vote for them or if they vote against \nthem.\n  Senator Craig does not have an opportunity to slip this provision \ninto a conference report, so he is doing what the Senate should allow \nhim to do and what we are paid to do, which is to offer amendments and \nhave an up-or-down vote. Maybe they want a commitment to drop the \namendment in a conference report. Why can't we vote?\n  There are a lot of reasons why appropriations bills are difficult to \nresolve,\n\n[[Page S9184]]\n\nbut this should not be one of them. This is not a question of how much \nmoney we have available. We should have voted 3 weeks ago. We could \nhave completed four or more bills in this time, but we are at a \nstalemate.\n  Given the choices, this should be an easy call. Should the sponsors \nbe asked to ignore their burning States, the danger of horrific, \ncatastrophic forest fires, and set their amendments aside, or should \nthe people who are preventing a vote decide they should let the Senate \ndo what we are here to do, what our constitutional responsibility is to \ndo, which is to make decisions on hard choices and then vote?\n  We have been in session for over 3 weeks, since Labor Day, and we \nhave cast a whooping 16 votes. Six of these votes were unanimous. So we \nhave cast 10 votes on contentious issues, which is less than 1 vote per \nday. That is not exactly heavy lifting. This time of year, we could \nprobably do two, three, or even four votes a day and not work up a \nsweat, but we are not able to do that. We cast 5 unanimous votes, and \nwe cast a unanimous vote on procedure in 16 days, which leaves 10 \nvotes.\n  Some are saying maybe we ought to come in on Saturdays. Unless we are \npermitted to vote, what good is that going to do? If we cannot vote on \nWednesday, what makes my colleagues think we could vote on Saturday, \nunless the objection to voting was lifted?\n  I do not want to shut off any debate, but when the debate is over, we \nshould vote. If anyone has anything to add after 3\\1/2\\ weeks of \ndebate, then I think they may have missed their opportunity.\n  I have spoken a couple of times. Obviously I have not moved many \nsouls or they would all be stampeding to say, let's restore sound \nforestry management. Maybe they were not listening, maybe I was not \npersuasive, but I have had my shot. I think it is time we get on with \nit.\n  I compliment the Senator from South Dakota for figuring out a way to \nprotect his State. What he did was sound forestry management. I simply \nwant to see other people who live around the forests have the same \nopportunity as the people in South Dakota, which is to be free from the \ndanger of catastrophic forest fires.\n  I have farmers who want farm aid. South Dakota has an interest, I am \nsure. I voted on farm aid. It was not germane or relevant to the bill, \nbut I voted for it. Why can't the Senators whose States are on fire \nhave a vote on something that is directly relevant to the Interior bill \nbefore us? I have not heard one substantive, rational explanation as to \nwhy Senators whose States are on fire should not be entitled to vote, \neven a negative vote.\n\n  I say to our distinguished leadership, explain to the people of the \nWestern States that are on fire why they do not deserve a vote. The \namendment is pending. Let's vote up or down; table it or not. South \nDakota got special protection. Are Colorado, California, Montana, or \nUtah any less important than South Dakota? I think not.\n  Have the national interest groups gotten so powerful--and let me say, \nwhen we are talking national interest groups, I will let everyone in on \na secret. It is the Sierra Club. Have the national interest groups and \nthe Sierra Club gotten so powerful they can prevent Senators from \nstanding up for the safety of people in their own States?\n  I note that the groups that oppose this amendment are very important \nand powerful, but until now I did not think they were powerful enough \nto shut down the Senate. I understand why the authors of the amendment \nwould not want to pull their amendment because their States are on fire \nand in danger of being on fire. Given all the important matters funded \nin Interior, given that $5.9 billion in drought assistance for fire \nsuppression money, I do not understand why we cannot vote. \nSubstantively or politically, what is more important than assistance to \nprevent fires and assistance for drought-stricken ranchers? It is clear \nto those who follow the Senate, there is bad politics for some who may \nnot want to vote.\n  I appreciate some activists do not want this passed--that is their \nright--but we are not obliged to skip votes because an outside group \ndoes not want to see a vote on it. They have their right to voice their \nopposition on the amendment, but they should not have the power to stop \nthe Senate from voting. That is a shame. This matter should be resolved \nin the way it should be resolved, with a vote; move to table and vote \nup or down. I think Senator Craig's effort to prevent forest fires is \nworth the Senate's time.\n  We have lots of forests the size of New Jersey. Firefighters and \ninnocent citizens in South Dakota are protected. But Idaho, New Mexico, \nMontana, and Missouri should be, too.\n  I plead with those objecting to voting to permit us to do what the \npeople have sent us here to do.\n  Before I conclude, I call to the attention of my colleagues in the \nSenate an editorial from yesterday's Wall Street Journal. It says the \nDemocratic leadership is:\n\n       . . . now blaming Republicans for stalling the \n     appropriations bill. In fact, the bill would clear quickly if \n     he'd just hold a vote on the Craig amendment. But the \n     Majority Leader knows a vote would force his party either to \n     side with Mr. Craig (thereby alienating greens), or repudiate \n     forest cleanup (thereby alienating voters this fall). We \n     think it was a famous Democrat, JFK, who once said that to \n     govern is to choose.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article from the Wall Street \nJournal be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Daschle's Burning Senators\n\n       If you want to know why Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle \n     can't get a spending bill for the Interior Department passed \n     this year, look no further than his home state's Black Hills.\n       Those South Dakota mountains are at the center of a growing \n     political debate over forest fires. All summer Senator Tim \n     Johnson, also a South Dakota Democrat, had been taking heat \n     from the state's rural communities for allowing green groups \n     to stymie forest cleanup, a recipe for fires. So in July, to \n     give Mr. Johnson a boost in his tight re-election fight \n     against Republican John Thune, Mr. Daschle slipped a rider \n     into a bill exempting his state from the very environmental \n     regulations he'd long championed.\n       It took about a nanosecond for Western Senators, their own \n     states in flames, to seize on this flip-flop and demand equal \n     treatment. Idaho Republican Larry Craig offered an amendment \n     to the Interior bill that would enact much of President \n     Bush's new fire plan, as well as a South Dakota-style legal \n     exemption for 10 million at-risk acres of forestland. Mr. \n     Daschle--now trying to get back in green good graces--has \n     tried twice to close Senate debate without considering Mr. \n     Craig's amendment, and has lost both times.\n       And no wonder. This year's fires, and Mr. Daschle's rider, \n     have become an enormous political liability for Western \n     Democrats. They've had to explain to angry constituents why \n     Chainsaw Tom was allowed to save his state's forests, while \n     theirs were left to burn. And, with 6.5 million acres in \n     ashes and more than 25 people dead this year, none of them \n     want to oppose Mr. Craig's much-needed forest cleanup plan. \n     California's Dianne Feinstein and Oregon's Ron Wyden, both \n     Democrats, had even been trying to work out a compromise with \n     Mr. Craig.\n       Mr. Daschle is now blaming Republicans for stalling the \n     appropriations bill. In fact, the bill would clear quickly if \n     he'd just hold a vote on the Craig amendment. But the \n     Majority Leader knows a vote would force his party either to \n     side with Mr. Craig (thereby alienating greens), or repudiate \n     forest cleanup (alienating voters this fall). We think it was \n     a famous Democrat, JFK, who once said that to govern is to \n     choose.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow).

Madam President, I rise today to address this third vote \non cloture on the Byrd amendment directing the replenishing of \nfirefighting funds for the Departments of Agriculture and Interior.\n  This vote really hinges on our desire to get drought relief to the \nWest.\n  In my opinion, that is not what this debate is about. Drought relief \nhas already been agreed to almost unanimously by this body. In other \nwords, there were 69 votes for it. There is strong support in the \nSenate. I am a strong supporter for that relief.\n  What is happening here is the majority is saying it is our way, or \nthe highway. America's farmers and ranchers know that is not the way we \ndo business, or get business done. Solving problems takes compromise. I \nworked with the majority to get the ball rolling. I worked with the \nadministration to get the ball rolling. We worked with the \nadministration and the other side--not only the other side--for release \nlast\n\n[[Page S9185]]\n\nweek of money for livestock producers in drought-stricken areas. But \nnow we see no compromise for realistic solutions. Every American has \nwatched our forests burning every night on television. Yet the other \nside is reluctant to do anything about it--they have no conscience.\n  It does not change any law. It allows us to manage forest lands for \nthe prevention of the disasters that we have had since 1998.\n  Come to my State and talk to the farmers and ranchers who have had \ndrought for 4 years. Then, turn around and talk with people who love \nthose forests. They have seen the forests burn for the last 4 years. \nAnd then tell me we should not have a vote in order to clean them up.\n\n  Have people lost their senses? They do not understand what happens in \nthis biological world when we grow a renewable product--a renewable \nproduct. Have we had nothing in our schools that teach us?\n  I am like the old preacher who walked by a ranch one day. It was a \nnice Sunday morning. He said: Nice looking ranch you have got here.\n  The old rancher says: Yes, it is. You should have seen it while the \nLord had it to himself.\n  We have people in this ecosystem.\n  These little groups, I might add, that have very little dirt under \ntheir fingernails--very little--are telling us to leave it alone, and \nMother Nature will take care of it. The American people have seen that \nkind of management for the last 25 years. They have seen the results of \nit. It burned.\n  What is being denied here is a vote. We are being denied a vote on an \nissue that, sort of tongue in cheek, burns in the hearts of Americans. \nThey don't like this. They do not want to see their forests go up in \nflames and have a renewable resource wasted when it can be prevented. \nThat is what it is about.\n  We will reject cloture until the majority is willing to work on a \ncompromise that will actually make a difference to Americans.\n  I want to associate myself with the words of our assistant leader on \nour side. Cloture is a terrible arrow in the quiver during these times \non appropriations bills. It seems as though when we struck the deal for \nSouth Dakota less than 3 or 4 months ago, it was the right thing to do. \nIt exempted all the laws.\n  Do we have a double standard here? Should those of us in other States \nwho represent public lands which produce a renewable product not be \nafforded the same standard? We are not even asking for that much \nchange. We are not exempting any law. We are not exempting anything.\n  What we are saying is make your case. Invoke a double standard, and \nthen premise the argument that this is a vote against drought aid for \nAmerican agriculture? It is absolutely absurd.\n  Any clear-thinking American who has watched the deterioration of our \nforests and who has seen the results can stand there, and who in this \nbody can look them in the eye and say, well, that is the way it is?\n  I will tell you how many votes they will get against their proposal. \nI have heard maybe three or four will come down and give the reasons \nthey are opposed to it to justify their vote, and to answer some of the \nquestions we have.\n  It is not right. It is not only not right, but it is not fair.\n  I have real people living in my State, too, just like everywhere \nelse. But the unwillingness to give us a vote, which is our right and a \nconstitutional need to get the House of Representatives and the \nPresident a vote to actually pass laws, has brought us to a standstill \nin this body.\n  It is not right. It is not fair.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BURNS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. You mentioned drought aid. Am I not correct that drought \naid cannot pass unless the bill passes?\n  Mr. BURNS. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If one wanted to get drought aid to farmers, would it \nmake sense, since that has been agreed to in the underlying bill, to \nhave a vote on the Craig amendment, and it could be an up-or-down vote \nor a motion to table, dispose of the Craig amendment one way or \nanother, and pass the bill?\n  Mr. BURNS. And move on. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. And every Member on this side of the aisle is willing to \ndo that. No one on this side of the aisle is filibustering this bill.\n  Mr. BURNS. That is right. No preconditions. No either/or. If we are \nreally serious about it, give us a vote. That is what we are fighting \nfor, the privilege of voting. That is all. Defeat us if your conscience \nallows. But give us a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute on each side. Our side is up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Feingold). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I have listened to my friend from Montana and my dear \nfriend from Oklahoma. You cannot change the Senate rules. They can say \nall they want that they are not filibustering this bill. This is the \nfourth week we are on the bill. If they want to get disaster aid to the \nfarmers, they should allow us to go forward on this legislation. We can \noffer their amendment on other matters, if they really care about the \nfarmers; 79 Senators said they did. Those people are waiting for relief \nas we speak. They should go ahead and allow us to pass this bill. In \nthe meantime, the farmers get nothing.\n  It is not as if we are not fighting fires. There is $800 million that \nSenator Byrd and Senator Stevens put in this bill for fighting fires. \nIt is a question of their wanting to do away with judicial review, \nwhich we are unwilling to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If people want to pass this bill, the way to pass the \nbill is to do it the way Senator Reid and I used to manage the bill, \nand that is to vote. We get paid to vote.\n  For whatever reason, some people are afraid to vote on the Craig \namendment. If we get on the bill, maybe someone will move to table the \nCraig amendment. We need to vote. The Senators from Montana, North \nDakota, Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, and other States that have fires are \nentitled to have forest management improvements just like South Dakota. \nWhat the Craig amendment is asking for is not as much as South Dakota \nreceived.\n  We are entitled to a vote. You can file cloture all you want, but we \nare going to have a vote. We are going to have a vote. To file cloture, \nso we do not even get a vote on the Craig amendment, will not happen. \nIf cloture is invoked, we can still offer the amendment, so we are \ngetting nowhere fast. We are not going to finish this bill until we get \na vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/25/senate-section/article/S9185-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes of leader \ntime this morning, before we get into the debate on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Texas, to talk about a concern that I have \nwanted to avoid talking about for weeks. I am very saddened by the fact \nthat we have debated homeland security now for 4 weeks. I have noted on \nseveral occasions that there is no reason, on a bipartisan basis, this \nbody cannot work\n\n[[Page S9187]]\n\ntogether to overcome our differences and to pass a meaningful and \nsubstantive bill dealing with homeland security.\n  Some have suggested that the delay has been politically motivated, \nand I have said: I am not willing to believe that. In fact, yesterday I \nsaid: We intend to give the President the benefit of the doubt.\n  Over the course of the last several weeks, as we have debated \nnational security, the issue of war in Iraq has become more and more \nprominent. And again, as I go back to my experience in 1991 and 1992, \nduring a similar period--the fall and winter prior and after an \nelection--I expressed the concern that our politics in this climate \ncould easily create a politicized environment and, in so doing, \ndiminish, minimize, degrade the debate on an issue as grave as war.\n  No one here needs to be reminded of the consequences of war. No one \nhere should have to be admonished about politicizing the debate about \nwar. But, Mr. President, increasingly, over the course of the last \nseveral weeks, reports have surfaced which have led me to believe that \nindeed there are those who would politicize this war.\n  I was given a report about a recommendation made by Matthew Dowd, the \npollster for the White House and the Republican National Committee. He \ntold a victory dinner not long ago--I quote--``The No. 1 driver for our \nbase motivationally is this war.''\n  Dowd said war could be beneficial to the GOP in the 2002 elections. \nAnd then I quote: ``When an issue dominates the landscape like this one \nwill dominate the landscape, I think through this election and probably \nfor a long time to come, it puts Republicans on a very good footing.''\n  I thought: Well, perhaps that is a pollster. Perhaps pollsters are \npaid to say what is best regardless of what other considerations ought \nto be made. Pollsters are paid to tell you about the politics of \nissues. And were it left with pollsters, perhaps I would not be as \nconcerned.\n  But then I read that Andy Card was asked: Well, why did this issue \ncome before Washington and the country now? Why are we debating it in \nSeptember? Where were we last year? Where were we last spring? And Mr. \nCard's answer was: ``From a marketing point of view, you don't \nintroduce new products in August.''\n  New products? War?\n  And then I listen to reports of the Vice President. The Vice \nPresident comes to fundraisers, as he did just recently in Kansas. The \nheadline written in the paper the next day about the speech he gave to \nthat fundraiser was: Cheney talks about war: electing Taff would aid \nwar effort.\n  And then we find a diskette discovered in Lafayette Park, a computer \ndiskette that was lost somewhere between a Republican strategy meeting \nin the White House and the White House.\n  Advice was given by Karl Rove, and the quote on the disk was: ``Focus \non war.''\n  I guess, right from the beginning, I thought: Well, first it was \npollsters, and then it was White House staff, and then it was the Vice \nPresident. And all along I was asked: Are you concerned about whether \nor not this war is politicized? And my answer, on every occasion, was: \nYes. And then the followup question is: Is the White House politicizing \nthe war? And I said: Without question, I can't bring myself to believe \nthat it is. I can't believe any President or any administration would \npoliticize the war. But then I read in the paper this morning, now even \nthe President--the President is quoted in the Washington Post this \nmorning as saying that the Democratic-controlled Senate is ``not \ninterested in the security of the American people.''\n\n  Not interested in the security of the American people?\n  You tell Senator Inouye he is not interested in the security of the \nAmerican people. You tell those who fought in Vietnam and in World War \nII they are not interested in the security of the American people.\n  That is outrageous--outrageous.\n  The President ought to apologize to Senator Inouye and every veteran \nwho has fought in every war who is a Democrat in the Senate. He ought \nto apologize to the American people.\n  That is wrong. We ought not politicize this war. We ought not \npoliticize the rhetoric about war and life and death.\n  I was in Normandy just last year. I have been in national cemeteries \nall over this country. And I have never seen anything but stars--the \nStar of David and crosses on those markers. I have never seen \n``Republican'' and ``Democrat.''\n  This has to end, Mr. President. We have to get on with the business \nof our country. We have to rise to a higher level.\n  Our Founding Fathers would be embarrassed by what they are seeing \ngoing on right now.\n  We have to do better than this. Our standard of deportment ought to \nbe better. Those who died gave their lives for better than what we are \ngiving now.\n  So, Mr. President, it is not too late to end this politicization. It \nis not too late to forget the pollsters, forget the campaign \nfundraisers, forget making accusations about how interested in national \nsecurity Democrats are; and let's get this job done right.\n  Let's rise to the occasion. That is what the American people are \nexpecting. And we ought to give them no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Democratic \nleader for the position he has taken here today. I commend him for the \nrestraint he has shown in his remarks.\n  I, too, was astounded upon reading this story in the Washington Post \nthis morning. It reads as follows in part:\n\n       As he seeks to boost Republican candidates in the midterm \n     elections, President Bush is increasing his emphasis on \n     terrorism and national security, shedding his previous \n     determination to demonstrate his concern about the flagging \n     economy.\n       Four times in the past two days, Bush has suggested that \n     democrats do not care about national security, saying on \n     Monday that the Democratic-controlled Senate is ``not \n     interested in the security of the American people.'' His \n     remarks, intensifying a theme he introduced last month, were \n     quickly seconded and disseminated by House Majority Whip Tom \n     DeLay (R-Tex.).\n       At a fundraiser for GOP House candidate Adam Taff in Kansas \n     Monday, Vice President Cheney said security would be \n     bolstered if Taff were to defeat Rep. Dennis Moore (D-Kan.). \n     ``Cheney talks about Iraq at congressional fundraiser/\n     Electing Taff would aid war effort,'' read the headline in \n     the Topeka Capital-Journal.\n\n  Mr. President, are we to believe this? Are we to believe that this \nPresident said what I have just quoted? This is the President who was \ngoing to change the tone in Washington.\n  I am terribly disappointed. We are entering an election. War clouds \nloom over this country. Yet the President would say the Democratic-\ncontrolled Senate is ``not interested in the security of the American \npeople.''\n  What about Max Cleland? Is he interested in the security of the \nAmerican people? What about Danny Inouye? Is he interested in the \nsecurity of the American people?\n  I am disgusted by the tenor of the war debate that has seemingly \novertaken this capital city. Here is the President of the Senate, the \nVice President of the United States, out campaigning. The President is \ncampaigning using war talk to win the election. The Vice President of \nthe United States is barnstorming for Republican candidates. There, in \nat least one instance, he was telling voters that electing Republicans \nwould aid the war effort.\n  Is the President determined to make his party--that great party of \nAbraham Lincoln--the war party? What would Abraham Lincoln have to say \nif he were here?\n  This war strategy seems to have been hatched by political strategists \nintent on winning the midterm election at any cost, even if that cost \nplaces this Nation on the brink of battle and the Nation's sons and \ndaughters there on that brink. It is despicable. The distinguished \nmajority leader used the word ``outrageous.'' He is exactly right. It \nis despicable that any President would attempt to use the serious \nmatter of impending war as a tool in a campaign war.\n  I am not going to continue to be silent. The blood of our sons and \ndaughters, our soldiers, sailors, and airmen,\n\n[[Page S9188]]\n\nhas far more value than a few votes in a ballot box.\n  There is nothing more sobering than a decision to go to war, but the \nadministration has turned the decision into a bumper sticker election \ntheme. That is what I felt I saw in the beginning of this war on \nterrorism. It was being used politically also. It is clear now. It is \nout in the open. There it is.\n  For the President to suggest the Senate is not interested in the \nsecurity of the American people is outrageous. It is insulting. It is \nwrong, wrong, wrong. To suggest that one is unpatriotic simply because \none is affiliated with a certain party and may oppose a war that may \nhave horrendous consequences is irresponsible--irresponsible. It is the \nworst kind of political opportunism.\n  I have been in this Congress 50 years. I have never seen a President \nof the United States or a Vice President of the United States stoop to \nsuch low level. It is your blood, your sons and daughters. Those who \nare looking at the Senate through the electronic lenses, it is your \nblood, your treasure.\n  For the first time in the history of the Republic, the Nation is \nconsidering a preemptive strike against a sovereign state. I will not \nbe silenced. I have no brief for Iraq, but I am not going to be \nsilenced. I will not give the benefit of the doubt to the President. I \nwill give the benefit of the doubt to the Constitution. I will give the \nbenefit of the doubt to the American people who will soon be called \nupon, if this President has his way, to give their sons and daughters, \nthe blood of this country.\n  I do not defend the Iraqi regime. I do not justify its actions. But I \nalso do not want to commit our sons and daughters to battle without a \nthorough understanding and a thorough debate. You silence me, if you \ncan. There are others in this body who are going to speak up for their \npeople.\n\n  This administration is making the war their battle cry. That is their \nbumper sticker politics. They are putting it front and center. They \ndon't want to talk about domestic issues. They don't want to talk about \nthose things. So they choose to make the war center stage. OK.\n  ``Lay on, McDuff. And damn'd be him that first cries, ``Hold, \nenough!'''\n  My people in West Virginia expect me to speak out. If the Lord lets \nme live, I shall do that.\n  I also do not want to commit our sons and daughters to battle without \na thorough understanding of the motivations, the strategies, the \nrepercussions of that battle.\n  America fights wars, but America does not begin wars. This is my \nbattle cry. This is yours. Each of you has sworn to support and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and \ndomestic. There it is. That doesn't give this President, that doesn't \ngive this Nation, a right to launch an unprovoked attack on a sovereign \nnation. America fights wars, but America does not start wars.\n  The American people have serious questions. The Nation's allies have \nserious questions. Members of this body have serious questions. These \nmust be answered before going to war, and it is not now, nor was it \never, unpatriotic to ask questions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The majority \nleader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nInouye have 5 minutes of my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I certainly do not object to any time \nSenator Inouye wants, but we have come to debate an amendment on the \nhomeland security bill, and I would like to have an opportunity to \nspeak on it. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Senator Inouye.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the gentleman who resides at 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue is the President of the United States of America, \nand although the Constitution does not specifically state it, his most \nimportant chore is to keep our people united, to keep our Nation \nunited.\n  Accordingly, this morning I am saddened by the reports of my leader, \nthe majority leader, and my leader, Senator Byrd of West Virginia, \nbecause it appears that our administration and our President are making \nstatements that only serve to divide our people.\n  I have been honored to serve as chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee. Four weeks ago, this subcommittee reported \na bill unanimously. It is a Democratically controlled subcommittee, but \nit reported a measure unanimously. It went to the full committee, \nchaired by the Senator from West Virginia, and the committee reported \nthat measure unanimously. It was reported to this floor, and by an \nalmost unanimous vote--three Members had questions--it passed the \nSenate. That was 4 weeks ago. That was carried out by a Democratically \ncontrolled Senate.\n  There are a few footnotes in history that I think we should recall. I \nlistened to all the talk shows on Sunday. I am a good listener. I very \nseldom speak on the floor. One statement was made that some of us in \nthe early 1990s questioned the war in the Persian Gulf. I was one of \nthose. This spokesperson said: They questioned the war because they \nsaid a lot of body bags would be returning, and just a few returned. \nBut we should recall that the war ended at the border of Iraq. If we \nhad gone into Baghdad, we would have had many body bags, unless the \nUnited States had decided to do the most inhuman thing and wipe out \nBaghdad--men, women, and children.\n  Some have now suggested: The war in Afghanistan has resulted in 100 \ncasualties. That is not a war.\n  There is another footnote in history that we should recall. In that \nancient war we engaged in 60 years ago, World War II, in the U.S. Army, \n95 percent of the men in uniform had no spouses; there were no \nchildren. Five percent had spouses and children. In my regiment, 4 \npercent had spouses and children; 96 percent were young men, 18, 19, \n20. We were ready. We had no strings attached.\n  Today, in the U.S. Army, over 77 percent of our men and women have \nspouses; they have children. We should be concerned about their \nsensitivities.\n  It is not easy going into combat. No one enters battle planning to \nbecome a hero. You just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong \ntime. If you stepped one foot to the right, the bullet would have \nmissed you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nmay have 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, there are those who plan war, and there \nare those who engage in war. As we have always said in the subcommittee \nand in the Appropriations Committee, in order to avoid war, we should \nbe prepared for war. We voted for a bill to spend over $356 billion. \nDoes that suggest we are not concerned about the security of our \npeople? And when we passed it unanimously--bipartisan, united--does \nthat suggest we are not concerned about the security of this country?\n  I am concerned about the security of this country. I am concerned \nabout what history will say about this Nation 50 years from now. Did we \nbrutalize people or did we carry on ourselves as a civilized people? As \nmy leader from West Virginia stated, to attack a nation that has not \nattacked us will go down in history as something of which we should not \nbe proud.\n  Mr. President, I can assure you that this Democratically controlled \nSenate, and especially the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, will \nsupport the President of the United States because that man is my \nPresident also. Certainly, I did not vote for him, but he is my \nPresident, and it grieves me when my President makes statements that \ndivide this Nation.\n  I can assure you this is not a time for Democrats and Republicans to \nsay I have more medals than you, and I have lost more limbs than you, \nand we have shed more blood than you. This is not the time for that. \nThis is a time in which we should be working together, debating this \nissue. As the Senator from West Virginia said, it is American to \nquestion the President. It is American to debate the issues. I stand \nbefore you as a proud member of the Democratically controlled Senate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S9189]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator from Texas yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Texas has been \nrecognized. The Senator controls 1 hour.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask if the Senator from Texas will \nallow me to speak about 5 minutes before he begins.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, the pending business is homeland \nsecurity. I came over to offer an amendment with the Senator from \nGeorgia. The majority leader has made a statement. The distinguished \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate has made a statement.\n  Our distinguished and beloved colleague from Hawaii has made a \nstatement, and we are here to debate a war which we have an opportunity \nto do something about now. We are here to debate an issue where we have \nan opportunity to prevent anybody's blood from being spilled by having \nan effective homeland security program, and I want to exercise my right \nto speak on that issue.\n  I want to be brief on the subject, but accusing a President of \nstarting a war for political reasons is a pretty serious accusation. \nThis Senate, on several occasions, has passed resolutions that in the \nstrongest terms called on the President, if he so decided, to use force \nagainst Iraq.\n  The United Nations has passed resolution after resolution that Saddam \nHussein has rejected. So the idea that somehow this is a new problem \nand has suddenly been created out of whole cloth as we face the \nelection simply will not bear up to scrutiny.\n  Secondly, there has been a confusion between two wars, and I think \nthis is a very important issue. In listening to all of those quotes, \nmost of what has been said has had to do with a force resolution which \nwe are not debating today, which we will be debating next week or the \nweek after.\n  As Jefferson said so long ago, good men with the same facts are prone \nto disagree. Based on our history in dealing with Saddam Hussein, based \non the threat he poses, based on the new information on that threat \nwhich was made available by the British Intelligence Service and by the \nPrime Minister in today's paper, I reach a totally different conclusion \nthan many of my Democrat colleagues in that I believe the President \nshould be supported, and I believe a resolution of that support should \npass in the Senate.\n  As clearly as I can say, I think internationalism is important, I \nthink the United Nations has a role, but when we are talking about the \nlives and safety of Americans, I am not going to turn those lives and \nthat safety over to the U.N.\n  As much as I love our allies, especially the British, I am not going \nto turn those lives and that safety over to our allies either. When we \nare talking about American lives, the buck stops with us. No matter \nwhat the United Nations decides, we are never, ever, under any \ncircumstances, going to delegate to the United Nations the protection \nof American lives.\n  Hopefully, the United Nations is going to come to their senses and \nsupport the President, but the idea that we ought to change this \nresolution, when we do debate it, to say we should work within the U.N. \nI am not willing to put American lives at risk based on what the U.N. \nmay or may not do.\n  A final point, in response to the debate we just had, we have a \ncommingling of two different wars. The first war is with Iraq, and we \nare going to debate that in 2 weeks. Everybody will have a chance to \nstate their position. I wanted to make mine clear today. The second \nwar, however, is the war on terrorism. That is the war we are fighting \ntoday. That is the debate we are having today.\n  When we started this debate as to giving the President the power to \nprotect America from the horror we saw on September 11, it never \ncrossed my mind we would end up with a Senate that was almost perfectly \ndivided, where Republicans were on one side and Democrats, in the \npreponderance, were on the other.\n  There is one exception, apparently, on each side at the moment. I \nhave not looked into people's hearts. We have not had a vote. I do not \nknow where people are down to the individual Senator, but it certainly \nappears at the moment that we find ourselves in the extraordinary \ncircumstance that we are almost perfectly divided along party lines \nover the issue of giving the President the power he has asked for to \ndefend the American homeland and to defend our people.\n\n  Maybe this should not be a partisan issue, but if one defines a \npartisan issue as an issue that ends up being split along party lines \nthen by that definition the debate we are engaged in right now, has \nbecome divided along partisan lines. The point I want to be sure people \nunderstand is the last statement quoted by the President was not about \nIraq. It was about defending the American homeland.\n  Why has this become a political issue? I do not believe Iraq is going \nto be a political issue, despite the fact some of our colleagues today \nhave expressed reservations about Iraq. I believe in the end the \nPresident is going to get a much stronger vote on a force resolution on \nIraq today than we got in 1991. In the end, I do not believe Iraq is \ngoing to be a partisan political issue.\n  Why has homeland security divided the Senate right down the middle \nalong partisan lines? The reason is, it involves a very tough choice. \nGovernment is about making tough choices. When one gets outside the \ncivics class, it is not about black and white, right and wrong. It is \nabout tough choices. It is about give and take. It is about giving up \nsome things to have others. In fact, this whole idea that everything \ncan be broken down into all positive and all negative completely \nmisrepresents the reality of the world.\n  There seems to be no objection to taking all of these Government \nagencies and putting them into one agency. So far as I know, 100 \nSenators are willing to do that. But remarkably, roughly half the \nMembers of the Senate seem intent on taking away emergency powers the \nPresident had on September 11, but that would be taken away by the \nLieberman bill that is before us.\n  I wonder how many Americans who are listening to this debate \nunderstand the proposal made by Senator Lieberman, on behalf of the \nvast majority of Democrats, would actually weaken the President's \nability to use national security powers to protect America. I do not \nthink people understand that.\n  Our Nation has been attacked. Thousands of our citizens have been \nkilled. The lives of countless thousands have been altered forever. We \nare debating homeland security. We have a proposal before the Senate \nthat says we want to take powers away from President Bush, powers that \nPresident Clinton had, that Bush 41 had, that President Reagan had, \nthat President Carter had, and powers they used.\n  Now, why are we debating such a proposal? How could it possibly make \nany sense that we were perfectly content to give every President since \nPresident Carter the ability to declare a national emergency and set \naside business as usual in the Federal bureaucracy to respond to an \nemergency? But suddenly, as we are creating this Department, the \nmajority proposes we take these powers away from President Bush.\n  In other words, we will put everybody in the Department, but the \nprice the President would have to pay is less ability to use emergency \npowers than four of his predecessors have had. The President has \nrejected that. Does anyone blame him? Can anybody believe that any \nPresident, especially this President, would sit idly by while the \nCongress takes away powers that his four predecessors had?\n  I don't think anybody would think that is realistic. Why are we doing \nit? Why is the Senate almost evenly divided along partisan lines on \nthis issue? The reason is, we are down to a tough choice. The tough \nchoice is the following: To give the President the power to put the \nright person in the right place at the right time to do the right job \nin protecting lives, we have to change the way the Government operates. \nBut there are powerful political interests that are opposed to making \nthat change. And there are people who are committed to that system, the \nsystem we call the civil service system.\n  I remind my colleagues we have had study after study after study, \nstudies headed by Paul Volcker, appointed by President Clinton to be \nhead of the Federal Reserve bank. We have had studies by Lee Hamilton, \na Democrat in the House, and Warren Rudman, our\n\n[[Page S9190]]\n\nbeloved colleague from the Senate. In study after study concerning \nnational security, they have concluded the following, and this is the \nVolcker Commission: ``The current system is slow. It is legally \ntrammeled and intellectually confused. It is impossible to explain to \npotential candidates. It is almost certainly not fulfilling the spirit \nof our mandate to hire the most meritorious candidates.''\n  That is not President Bush talking. That is not Senator Gramm \ntalking. That is Paul Volcker talking. The Rudman-Hamilton bipartisan \ncommission on national security concluded that we needed an agile, \nflexible personnel system. And then they wrote: ``Today's civil service \nhas become a drag on our national security. The morass of rules, \nregulation, and bureaucracy prevent the Government from hiring and \nretaining the workforce that is required to combat the threats of the \nfuture.''\n  What the President has proposed is that he have the ability to \nstreamline the process, and when it comes to a choice between national \nsecurity and the status quo in the Government system, the status quo \nmust yield. When it comes down to union work rules, business as usual, \nor the life and safety of our citizens, the President says that the \nsystem has to yield. Civil service rights are important, but they are \nnot as important as the right of Americans to life and freedom. When \nour people's lives are at stake, business as usual in Washington has to \nyield.\n  The substitute that Senator Miller and I have offered prohibits the \nability to discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, national \norigin, and arbitrary and capricious factors, but allows the President \nthe flexibility to hire without waiting 6 months, to fire without \nwaiting 18 months, to eliminate a system where 99 percent of Government \nemployees get pay raises whether they received good evaluations or not.\n\n  I am not saying one side is right and one side is wrong. Obviously, I \nbelieve the President is right, and I believe my Democrat colleagues, \nother than Senator Miller--and maybe some I don't know about--are \nwrong. Obviously, I believe that or I would not be standing up here. My \nopinion does not make their position morally inferior to my position. \nThe division is about what is more important.\n  That is what the division is about. You have powerful concerns on \nboth sides. You have the concern of national security and you have the \nconcern of Government employees, one of the most powerful political \nconstituencies in America.\n  I am not saying they are wrong and we are right. I am saying we \ndisagree and we disagree almost perfectly along party lines and we have \nto make a choice. You cannot be for the primacy of existing work rules \nof the Federal Government and be for the primacy of national security. \nYou have to make a decision.\n  I have made my choice. My choice is, when Government work rules \nimpede the protection of American lives, they have to yield. That is my \nchoice. Many of my colleagues appear to have made a different choice.\n  What are we talking about when we are talking about changing union \nwork rules? I have heard over and over and over again that we are \neliminating merit and unions.\n  First, the substitute Senator Miller and I have introduced is a \nsubstitute which strictly constrains the President to make decisions \nbased on merit, and it limits it strictly to those areas where lives \nare at stake. I will give some concrete examples. In 1987, the Customs \nService at Logan Airport in Boston tried to change the inspection \nfacility to make it safer and more efficient. But there was a union \nwork rule that said the inspection facility could not be changed in any \nsignificant way without a renegotiation of the union contract. So guess \nwhat. The Treasury employee labor union went to the FLRA and they \noverruled Customs. And Customs was not able to change the inspection \nfacility.\n\n  Look, maybe when you are talking about trying to keep drugs out of \nthe country or illegal aliens, those work rules are more important. But \nwhen you are talking about lives, are they more important? If we can \nincrease the probability of keeping chemical or biological or nuclear \nweapons from coming in through an airport in America by changing the \ninspection facility, are we supposed to wait around 18 months to \nnegotiate with the union about the ability to change the room in which \nthe workers are working? Some of our colleagues think so, but I do not \nthink so. I do not believe the American people think so.\n  Let me give another example. You all remember Barry McCaffrey, the \ngeneral who was appointed by President Clinton to be drug czar. He made \nnote in the San Francisco Examiner about the different work rules of \nthe different Government agencies that were protecting America's \nborders:\n\n       Officials at one agency were actually forbidden to open the \n     trunks of cars, a policy well known to drug dealers.\n\n  Look, maybe it makes sense to some people that a union work rule says \npeople working for this agency or in this classification can not open a \ntrunk at a border inspection, and so dope gets into the country or an \nillegal alien gets into the country. But if it is a nuclear weapon, \ndoes it make sense? Do we really think preserving that work rule that \nGeneral McCaffrey pointed out was being gamed by drug dealers--do we \nreally believe that is more important than keeping a nuclear weapon \nfrom getting into the United States?\n  That is the issue we are debating. I could go down the list and go on \nand on. In terms of deployment of the Border Patrol special task \nforces, the union work rule says you cannot deploy somebody where there \nis not a barber shop, a place of worship, or a dry cleaners. If we are \njust trying to keep dope out of the country, or keep out illegal \naliens, maybe that is not so unreasonable. I do not agree with that, \nbut maybe I am wrong.\n  But when you are trying to keep weapons of mass destruction that can \nkill thousands of our people out of the country, do we really want to \ngo to the FLRA and spend months and months and months trying to \nrenegotiate this? Or do we want to give the President the power to say: \nLives are at stake. As long as that is the case, under the emergency \npowers as President I am going to send the Border Patrol where there is \nno dry cleaner.\n  That is what we are talking about. That is what this issue is about--\nthe ability to deploy on merit, when lives are at stake, instead of \nseniority. We are talking about the ability of agencies to set gun \npolicies--something today they cannot do because of union work rules--\nand search policies. When we are worried about drugs getting into the \ncountry or contraband of various kinds, maybe we want to say the union \nwork rules are more important than the search policy. So you have to go \nto FLRA to renegotiate with the union and spend 18 months doing it. But \nif lives are at stake, and we are talking about a nuclear weapon \ngetting into New York Harbor, surely people see the difference. These \nare the kinds of things we are talking about.\n  Let me try to sum up where we are and what the issue is. We are \ndivided almost perfectly along partisan lines with the exception of one \nMember on each side. Is preserving this old horse-and-buggy system from \nthe 1950s--that was designed primarily to protect workers, not to get \nthe job done--more important than enhancing the probability that we can \nprotect lives? I say no. Some others say yes. That is the issue.\n\n  It ends up being contentious because we cannot have it both ways. You \ncan't serve two masters. You have to make a choice, and the choice I \nchoose is national security.\n  Madam President, how much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 27 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I ask for 10 minutes off the leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing no objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. This time would not count toward our hour.\n  Madam President, Senator Miller and I have spent 4 weeks listening \nand participating in this debate. We have looked at the House bill, a \nbill that the President says he would sign. We have looked at the \nPresident's proposal, a bill the President would sign. And we have \nlooked at the bill before us, a bill the President has said he would \nveto. I do not know how we promote homeland security by giving the \nPresident a bill he would veto.\n  We have made some 25 changes in the President's proposal. Quite \nfrankly, the\n\n[[Page S9191]]\n\nPresident has compromised more than I would have compromised had I been \nin his position. But the President wants to try to work on a bipartisan \nbasis, and he wants this bill because lives are at stake.\n  We have limited, very narrowly limited, the President's power to use \nhis emergency waiver in civil service. We have limited it by setting \nout parameters which he cannot violate in terms of his personnel \nflexibility. We have adopted some 95 percent of the Lieberman bill. We \nhave adopted provisions of the House bill that represented bipartisan \nconsensus. And we have talked to some 25 Members of the Senate and we \nhave adopted some 18 measures that have been influenced by Members. The \nPresident has said this is as far as he can go.\n  What does that mean? Is it as far as he can go because he is mad \nabout something? Is it as far as he can go because he is tired of the \nDemocrats being successful, the Democrat leadership being successful in \nstopping him from doing what he wants? No. The President has said this \nis as far as he can go because he does not believe that he can \neffectively do the job if he gives up any more power. He doesn't \nbelieve if he gives up more power that he is getting the tools he needs \nto fight and win the war on terrorism. And I agree with him. I think he \nis right.\n  What are the issues we come to? The biggest issue we come down to is \nthe issue I have already talked about at great lengths, and that is the \nissue of letting the President keep the powers that every President \nsince Jimmy Carter has had. The Lieberman bill takes away power to \ndeclare a national emergency and to take extraordinary action that \nPresident Carter had, that President Reagan had, that President Bush \nhad, and that President Clinton had. The President has said he is not \ngoing to let power that he had on September 11 be taken away in a bill \nthat is supposed to be responding to September 11.\n  Interestingly enough, the President has offered a compromise where he \nwill do things that President Clinton did not have to do when he used \nthat power. He will have to notify Congress in advance, he will have to \nmake public a declaration as to why he did what he did and his \njustification, something that President Clinton did not have to do. \nThat is how much our President wants to get this job done. But has that \nbeen met by reasonable compromise on the other side? No.\n  We have a bill before us that takes that power away from the \nPresident. That is not going to happen. It is just not going to \nhappen. We are not going to let it happen. The world may come to an \nend, but we are not going to take powers away from this President that \nfour other Presidents have had when we are trying to fight and win a \nwar on terrorism. It is just not going to happen.\n\n  The idea that it should be asked for is an idea that I would hate to \nhave to defend. I would hate to have to go back to Mexia and stand up \nin front of the print shop of my dear friend Dicky Flatt and explain to \npeople that we are going to take some of power the President has to \nprotect us and we are going to do it in a bill that is supposed to be \nresponding to the death of thousands of our citizens in Washington and \nNew York.\n  Maybe you can make that sale in Mexia. But I cannot. I am not that \ngood at it. I am talking about political ability. I could not make that \nsale, and I don't believe anybody else can make that sale in Mexia. \nMaybe they can make that somewhere else. I don't think they can make \nthat sale in Young and Harris Counties, either.\n  But that is the first issue. What we have gotten from our colleagues \non the other side of this issue is a series of proposals that all boil \ndown to one thing: The power of the unions, and the power of doing it \nthe same old way it has been done since the 1950s will be preserved, \nand the power of the President in the name of national security will be \nreduced.\n  That is the first major issue where we are at an impasse. We have \nlanguage now that was written by the Public Employee Labor Union. It \nwas offered in the House. It was rejected in the House. Yet that is \nbeing proposed once again. The answer is no. I don't know what part of \nthat old country and western song they do not understand, What part of \n``no'' don't you understand? But the answer is no.\n  The second issue is: When lives are on the line, should the President \nhave the ability to hire people and have the flexibility to do it \nwithout waiting 6 months? Should he have the power if somebody comes to \nwork drunk in a national security department to fire him without having \nto go through 18 months of rigmarole? I think the answer is yes. I \nthink the answer is yes. But, obviously, the people on the other side \nof this issue think the answer is no.\n  Those are the two issues. You might say this is a great big, old, \nthick bill, and you sent a great big, old, thick amendment.\n  Let me make it clear. I sent that amendment for myself, for Senator \nMiller, for Senator Thompson, for the President, and for some 40 \nMembers of the Senate. That was our best effort at a real compromise \nwhere the President gave up powers he really, honestly to God, believes \nhe needs. But he did it to try to solve this problem and to get this \nDepartment established and to get on with defending national security.\n  The terrorists are not waiting for this debate. I don't know what \nthey are doing. But it scares me.\n  When you look at these great big, thick bills, we are really apart \nonly on two issues. What should come first? Business as usual, or \nnational security? And should the President have the power when lives \nare at stake to hire, to promote, and to operate in the most efficient \nmanner possible this part of the Federal Government when the goal is to \nprotect the lives and safety of our people? That, I think, is the \nchoice.\n  Final point: Senator Miller and I have worked hard with the White \nHouse for 4 weeks to provide what we believe is a compromise. It is the \nfirst real compromise that has been proposed, in my opinion. We want a \nvote on it. There is going to be an effort later by people on the other \nside of the issue to defy us that vote by amending our bill in these \ntwo critical areas so we never get an up-or-down vote on the \nPresident's program.\n\n  I am not crying foul by saying it is against the Senate rules to do \nthat. I am not saying it is wrong to do it in terms of the way the \nSenate operates. I am saying I think the President deserves an up-or-\ndown vote on his program. If you want to vote no, you have the right to \nvote no. But don't you think we ought to let the President have an \nopportunity to have his program voted on in the way he would like to \nsee it voted on?\n  When that amendment is offered, we are going to use our rights under \nthe Senate rules to hold out for a vote on our substitute. I believe in \nthe end we will get it. I am sure some people on the other side of the \naisle will stand up and say, you are delaying, you are delaying, you \nare doing this, you are doing that.\n  All we want is to vote. We have about 40 Members of the Senate who \nwant to speak on it. They want to be heard. They will be heard. But, in \nthe end, the President is going to be heard. In the end, the people are \ngoing to be heard. We want an up-or-down vote on the President's \nprogram.\n  I hope we are going to win. If we don't win, then we are going to be \nin a situation of trying to pass a bill the President will veto, and \nmaybe we will have to wait until after the election and try again. That \nwill mean that for 3 months we are not going to have the program in \neffect to protect national security. I think that is a risk. As a \nresult, I want us to pass a bill.\n  I don't think any Member of the Senate can stand up and say they \nwanted to talk about this issue but Senator Miller, Senator Thompson, \nor I have not been willing to try to work this thing out. But so far, \nwe have seen no effort to work it out. So far it has been that we are \ngoing to take power away from the President, and if you don't like it, \nthat is all right. Well, we don't like it, and it is not all right. It \nis not going to happen.\n  Ultimately, the debate ends here and the public has to make a \ndecision. Is this a partisan issue? God knows that it should not be \npartisan. But, if you define partisan as being divided roughly along \nparty lines, it is a partisan issue. It shouldn't be. I don't want it \nto be. There are many people on the other side of the aisle who don't \nwant it to be, but it is.\n  In saying that, it is simply telling the truth. It is a terrible \nindictment of\n\n[[Page S9192]]\n\nus, a terrible indictment of the Senate, but it is telling the truth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Illinois \nsuch time as he requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Madam President. And I thank the chairman of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Lieberman.\n  Let me say for the record, this bill--the creation of a Department of \nHomeland Security--is a bill that has had two births.\n  It was first born in our committee under Senator Lieberman's \nleadership before President Bush proposed its creation. We worked for \nthe creation of this Department--believing the concept was sound--to \nbring together, in reorganization, agencies that are necessary to \nprotect America.\n  When we had a vote in the Governmental Affairs Committee on Senator \nLieberman's proposal, I was happy to support it, but not a single \nRepublican member of the committee supported it.\n  Not 2 weeks later, President Bush came forward and said: I now \nsupport a Department of Homeland Security. And Senator Lieberman said: \nWe will work with you. Let us put together a plan to bring it forward \nin a bipartisan fashion because, harkening back to an earlier statement \non this floor: There is no partisanship when it comes to protecting \nAmerica or its security or its freedom.\n  Senator Lieberman, working with Senator Thompson, tried to bring out \na bill, a bipartisan bill, to address the President's concern about a \nDepartment of Homeland Security. I think we have done a good job. I \nthink we have brought this bill to the floor in good faith. We had a \nlengthy hearing, many witnesses. Amendments were considered; some \nadopted and some rejected. The orderly process of Congress was \nfollowed. My hat is off to Senator Lieberman for his leadership.\n  But to think we have spent 4 straight weeks on the floor of this \nSenate unable to bring this bill to closure is clear evidence that \nthere are people on this floor who do not want to see this bill passed \nin any form.\n  When the Senator from Texas comes up and says: Well, you have to \nunderstand, we are going to bring an amendment, and a few of our \ncolleagues would like to speak on it on the floor, perhaps 40 Senators \nwould like to speak on it on the floor--well, be prepared, that just \nmeans a filibuster by another name.\n  It means, frankly, there are forces at work on this floor that do not \nwant to see this bill passed. They want to drag it out not 4 weeks or 6 \nweeks but 8 weeks and beyond. They have some other agenda other than \ngiving the President a Department of Homeland Security. That is \nunfortunate.\n  I think Senator Lieberman and the members of the committee have shown \ngood faith from the start. We have come to the floor day after weary \nday, many times with absolutely nothing happening, except the threat of \nanother filibuster. And here we stand. Here we stand this day without \nthe Department of Homeland Security bill passing the Senate. I think it \nis unfortunate. I think it is sad.\n  Earlier, the Senator from Texas said: Now, some of those who spoke \nearlier, such as Senator Daschle, Senator Byrd, and Senator Inouye, \nabout their concern over the President's statements that raised a \nquestion as to whether the Democrat-controlled Senate was, in fact, \ncommitted to the security of America--the Senator from Texas said: \nUnderstand, he was not referring to the war on Iraq. He was only \nreferring to this bill, the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Well, I am glad the Senator from Texas made the distinction. But it \ndoes not allay my fears that what we have emerging is partisanship when \nit comes to the security of America and the rhetoric that is coming out \nof the campaign forces, the campaign machine of the White House. It is \nno comfort to me to be told: Oh, they are just questioning your \npatriotism when it comes to the war on terrorism, not on the war on \nIraq. I am sorry, that is unacceptable.\n\n  When September 11 occurred last year, President Bush did not even \nhave to make the appeal to Congress. Within hours, Congress came \ntogether on a bipartisan basis. We came together and not only sang \n``God Bless America,'' we also came together, within a few days, to \ngive this President the authority and resources he needed to wage the \nwar on terrorism.\n  There was never any question that this Nation would stand together--\nDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents--and we did, as did Capitol \nHill. We have stood with this President.\n  For those who are trying to fire up the campaign rhetoric for this \ncoming election, questioning the patriotism of anyone in the Senate who \nwould even offer an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security \nbill goes too far. Whether this questioning of patriotism is over the \nwar on terrorism or the war on Iraq, it is entirely inappropriate. It \nis an afront to the many veterans in this Senate on both sides. It is \nan afront to many of us who believe this country is something we hold \ndear, and who try, in every single vote we cast, to keep that in mind.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Did the Senator hear the statement of Senator Daschle, the \nmajority leader, today?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I did.\n  Mr. REID. Did the Senator hear the statement of the Presidential \npollster, and also that of Karl Rove? And did the Senator hear, as I \ndid, the direct quotes that they wanted a strategy for the campaigns \nthat dealt with the war? Did the Senator hear that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I did.\n  Mr. REID. That didn't seem to say anything about homeland security, \ndid it?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Not a bit. It suggested to me, I say to the Senator from \nNevada, coming back to this bill, when we go to the merits of this \ndebate, let's be very honest about what this concerns.\n  This is a question about moving some 150,000 or 170,000 employees of \nthe Federal Government under a new roof called the Department of \nHomeland Security. I support it. I supported it when Senator Lieberman \noffered it. I supported it when the President suggested it. I still \nsupport it.\n  But the question before us today is, for 40,000 or 50,000 of these \nemployees, when they come under that new roof, will they bring with \nthem collective bargaining rights that they have had, have earned, have \nworked for, perhaps, all of their adult lives?\n  There are those who argue--and you have heard it from the Senator \nfrom Texas--once they come into this new Department, we can't afford to \nrun the risk that someone who belongs to a labor union can really rise \nto the challenge of defending America.\n  Pardon me, Madam President. Do I recall correctly those profiles in \ncourage of September 11, 2001, of which so many of us are so proud? Did \nyou stop and think for a moment that those New York firefighters, going \nup those stairs in those burning buildings to rescue people did not \nknow--complete strangers--doing their duty to their country, meeting \nthe duty of their profession--did we stop and reflect, for a moment, \nthat they were carrying, perhaps in their wallet, next to the picture \nof their family, a union card? Did anyone question their patriotism, \ntheir loyalty to our country, their devotion to so many people?\n\n  Oh, and yet today we hear speech after speech: We just can't run the \nrisk of letting people who are members of labor unions in this \nsituation, public employees----\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield? If the Senator is going to quote \nme, he ought to do it accurately.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask that order be restored in the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield to the Senator from Nevada for a question.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator would agree, would he not, that the debate over \nthis labor issue is one that we should have, and it has nothing to do \nwith patriotism? I see on the floor one of the sponsors of the \namendment, the Senator from Georgia, who is a distinguished American. \nHe has written a book about the Marine Corps. No one can question his \npatriotism, his qualifications.\n\n[[Page S9193]]\n\n  Wouldn't you agree a debate on labor-management relations is \nsomething we should have, and it has nothing to do with patriotism?\n  I have listened to the Senator from Georgia and how strongly he feels \nabout Federal employees, and how we have to change, in his opinion, the \nway employees are treated. But that is an issue, would the Senator \nagree, that has nothing to do with patriotism?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree completely with the Senator from Nevada. For the \nVice President, the President, or their campaign advisers to suggest \nthat if we disagree on a labor-management issue in this new Department, \nwe really are not committed to the freedom and security of America goes \nway too far. And I am afraid that is the point that was raised on the \nfloor today and needs to be revisited.\n  I will yield to the Senator from Texas, if he has a question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes. The only point I was going to make is, never in my \nremarks did I say anything about people being a member of a union. And \nif I am going to be quoted--and I like to be quoted; and I think it \nimproves the Senator's speech to quote me--I would like him to do it \naccurately.\n  I never said anything about a member of a union. I simply said that \nwhen you have work rules that prevent you from deploying more patrol \nagents where there is no laundry, or where you are not able to change \nan inspection room without renegotiating a union contract, and lives \nare at stake, there needs to be some give. That is all I said. I did \nnot say anything about joining a union or never mentioned a union in \nterms of the right of people to belong to it or their union membership \nor lack thereof having any relevance to do with this whatsoever.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Texas, but that is a distinction \nwithout a difference. To say, on one hand, I am not against labor \nunions, I am just against collective bargaining rights, is to get to \nthe heart of the issue.\n  Let me give you an illustration that makes my point.\n  After September 11, 2001, we discovered that most of the terrorists \nresponsible for the World Trade Center were coming over the northern \nborder of the United States from Canada. We said that we were going to \nbeef up efforts at the border to check people coming in so that others \ndid not come in to threaten the United States. This administration said \nit. The Border Patrol said it. And do you know what. We did not do it. \nTwo Border Patrol agents came forward and testified before a committee \nof Congress that it was all talk, we weren't putting the resources and \nthe manpower in the right place to protect America after September 11, \n2001.\n\n  These were Federal employees, members of labor unions with collective \nbargaining rights. Do you know what happened to them, I ask the Senator \nfrom Texas? Do you have any idea? They were fired from their jobs for \ntestifying before Congress, terminated from their employment. Of \ncourse, there was a hearing because they had collective bargaining \nrights, and these whistleblowers were restored to their positions.\n  If we are going to talk about what is at stake, let me tell you this.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will after I have made my point. The point I am making \nat this juncture is that collective bargaining rights make a \ndifference. It is not a question about how bright the light is over the \ncoffee pot for the employees taking their break and what color uniforms \nthey are wearing. That is, I am afraid, a ridiculous extreme when we \nlook at collective bargaining rights. It is the right of an individual \nemployee at our Border Patrol to be able to stand before a committee of \nCongress and say: I don't care what my boss is telling you; I don't \ncare what they are saying in their press release; they are not doing \nthe job to protect America.\n  For these Border Patrol agents to stand up and tell us the truth \nunder oath before a committee of Congress should not be grounds for \ntermination. But they were. Thank goodness they had collective \nbargaining rights and their jobs were restored. I don't believe being a \nmember of a labor union automatically qualifies you to be ready to \nfight for our Nation's security and be involved in intelligence \ngathering, but it certainly does not disqualify you. There are good, \nloyal, patriotic Americans who have collective bargaining rights.\n  Make no mistake, the bill reported to the Senate gives this President \nthe authority, which he needs; if any individual employee, because of \ntheir new job assignments or because of the sensitivity of their \nassignments, needs to be removed from a bargaining unit, there is a way \nto do it, a legitimate, honest way. That is the point we are debating. \nTo suggest that that has something to do with love of America and \npatriotism--I don't see it.\n  What we have before us and what concerns the Senator from Texas is, \nwe have a bipartisan group that has come together and said: We have \ncome up with a compromise. Let's deal with it.\n  As Senator Bumpers of Arkansas used to say: The Senator from Texas \nhates this bipartisan compromise like the devil hates holy water. He is \nafraid if we bring this to the floor and get a vote supporting the \nbipartisan position, all of his arguments and the President's arguments \nare weakened and disappear. That is what concerns him about this \nprocess and why he is promising 40 Senators who will speak interminably \nand drag this bill on for another 4 weeks.\n  If the President needs a Department of Homeland Security--and I \nbelieve he does--let's have this up-or-down vote. Let's decide where \nthe will of the Senate is going. Don't be afraid of the will of Senate. \nDon't be afraid of the will of the people. Don't be afraid to say that \ncollective bargaining does not disqualify people from defending America \nand from serving their Nation proudly.\n  Many of the people in these agencies are veterans who have served \nthis Nation with pride and have risked their lives for the flag. To say \nas they come to a new Department that they somehow have to give up \ntheir rights to collective bargaining is unfair.\n\n  It has been said that it takes up to a year to fire an employee under \ncivil service. That is a total myth. During their first year, employees \ncan be terminated without notice, and 36 percent of new employees were \nremoved during their probationary period in the year 2001. Any employee \ncan be terminated with 30 days' notice.\n  Incidentally, in fiscal year 2000, it was said that out of 1.8 \nmillion Federal employees, only 6 were fired because they were found \nincapable of doing their job; and in 2001, only 3 out of 1.8 million \nwere fired. These statistics grossly underestimate the number of \nFederal employees fired each year. The Republican claim that only three \npeople were fired in 2001 refers to the three employees who were \nimmediately removed for national security reasons only. In fiscal year \n2001, 8,920 Federal employees were terminated and removed for \ndisciplinary reasons.\n  The fact is, under civil service, employees can be removed. The fact \nis, under the bill that came out of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nthere is a procedure in national security for the President to make \nthat determination. That is an issue.\n  I respect the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Georgia for \nwhat they are bringing as a substitute measure. Let me tell you this: \nThey are leaving out some very critical elements of the bill brought \nout of the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  After September 11 of last year, I focused on one particular issue \nthat troubled me. I learned in the months leading up to it of the gross \ninadequacy of the information technology of the agencies of our \nGovernment relating to law enforcement and intelligence, the FBI being \nthe classic example of an agency dealing with the most primitive \ntechnology.\n  I have worked for over a year to try to bring modernization of \ncomputers and information technology into intelligence gathering and \nlaw enforcement. I have spoken to everyone--Attorney General Ashcroft, \nFBI Director Mueller, the Vice President, as well as the President of \nthe United States--about what I consider to be one of the glaring \nexamples of our inability to deal with terrorism.\n  As a result, I prepared and offered an amendment which was on the \nGovernmental Affairs bill that came to the floor and is still pending \ntoday. This amendment establishes that at the\n\n[[Page S9194]]\n\nFederal Government level, we will start blending together the computer \narchitecture of different agencies of the Federal Government so that \nthey are not only modern but they are interoperable, so they can \ncommunicate with one another, pass information along. If the FBI has a \nmost wanted list or danger list, they can pass that along to the \nFederal Aviation Administration and the Immigration and Naturalization \nService.\n  I am sorry to report that does not exist today. I worked long and \nhard on this amendment. It had the support of all of my colleagues on \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee. They believe, as I do, that this is \na critical element in the defense of America.\n  But the substitute amendment being offered by the Senator from Texas \ndoesn't include this provision. They have decided it is unnecessary, or \nat least they have not addressed it. I sincerely hope they will at \nleast reconsider that if we do bring this forward and this substitute \nbecomes the bill we are going to amend, they could introduce a motion \nof cloture, for example, raise germaneness questions.\n  If we don't include it, some element of information technology in a \nDepartment of Homeland Security, we are fooling ourselves. We are \nsaying we are creating a new Department that has a brandnew nameplate \non the door with 170,000 employees but with computers that are \ninadequate to the job.\n  When I spoke to Gov. Tom Ridge about this amendment, he said: I \nsupport this. It is a force multiplier. That means it takes the \nexisting resources of our Government and makes them that much more \neffective in fighting terrorism.\n  The substitute offered by the Senator from Texas does not include \nthat. That is sad.\n  Frankly, it may be a political victory for his substitute to prevail, \nbut it will not be a victory in the war against terrorism. We should \nput the weapons in place, the arsenal we need to protect America on a \nbipartisan basis, looking not only to employees of the Department but \nalso the resources and technology available in the Department.\n  It has been made clear on this floor that when it comes to the \nsecurity of the Nation, there should not be any partisanship \nwhatsoever. We can stand here as Americans and Members of the Senate \nand debate the provisions of this bill and others, and no one should \ncall into question our patriotism.\n  There is no reason we should take the roles and lives of 40,000 or \n50,000 new employees of this Department and say it is basically going \nto be impossible for them to serve their Nation and to have their \nrights as employees respected. We can do both. They have already proven \nwe can do both. To try to eliminate their rights to collective \nbargaining or to reduce them dramatically to a point where they are \nmeaningless is unfair to the men and women who have served us so well \nin so many different ways, who are proud to have these collective \nbargaining rights and be members of labor unions.\n  Before we adopt this substitute, consider the elements it does not \ninclude. One of the elements is the fact that it does not deal with the \ninformation technology that is essential to fighting a war on terrorism \nin the 21st century. Their bill is silent on what I consider to be one \nof the most important elements of this war and one of the most \nimportant weapons we can use to bring it to a successful conclusion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I yield myself a moment or two or as \nmuch time as I require. I will yield in a moment so Senator Miller may \nspeak.\n  While he was on the floor, I wanted to thank Senator Durbin for the \nsubstantial contribution he made to the committee's proposal for a \nDepartment of Homeland Security overall and the specific, unique, very \nvaluable proposal he made regarding information technology.\n  This is really a key to all sorts of activities in our world today, \nincluding homeland security; the ability to interconnect levels of our \ngovernment, different agencies that will be part of the new Department \nand Federal, State, county, and local governments. I appreciate it.\n  Senator Gramm and I have had discussions, and at some point, as the \nmost controversial parts of this discussion work their way to either an \nagreement or the Senate works its will, I hope we can sit and talk \nabout sections of our committee bill, such as Senator Durbin's, which \nare not partisan; they are good Government, with a capital G, good. We \nought to be able to reach a bipartisan agreement to include that in \nwhatever Department of Homeland Security we create.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, will the Senator yield for 2 minutes? I \ndo not want the Senator to lose the floor.\n  Mr. MILLER. I yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I would like to make a couple responses. \nFirst, let me give you the actual figures of people being fired from \nthe Federal Government. There are 1.8 million people on the Federal \npayroll. In the year 2001, three of them were fired outright. The \nprevious administration, the Clinton administration, found that 64,340 \nFederal workers were poor performers.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me finish my point. Only 434 of them went through the \nremoval process, and that process takes as long as 18 months, and many \nof them remained on the payroll. That is the first point.\n  The second point, the Senator talks about INS. In 1990, at the \nHonolulu Airport, the Immigration and Naturalization Service was \nworried about a surge in flights and the long lines, and they wanted to \nhire more INS agents to enforce the law.\n  The American Federation of Government Employees filed a complaint \nwith the National Labor Relations Board saying, under their contract, \nINS could not hire more agents without renegotiating its union \ncontract. Guess what. The National Labor Relations Board ruled in favor \nof the union, prohibiting the people from being hired.\n  The Senator talks about a vote. I ask unanimous consent that on \nFriday morning at 10 o'clock, we have an up-or-down vote on the \nsubstitute I have offered with Senator Miller. That way, there will be \nno doubt about the fact we are ready to bring it to a vote at that \npoint. We would like an up-or-down vote on our amendment at 10 o'clock.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, the point I want to make--and I am sorry \nI had to put our colleague in a position like that to object.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will yield, but the point I want to make is we want an \nup-or-down vote on our amendment. This is the President's substitute, \nand the President's supporters should have a chance to speak on it. We \nhave gone on for 4 weeks on this bill, not because of what supporters \nof the President have done, but because we have had amendments offered, \nprobably 90 percent of that time taken up by people who do not support \nthe President's position. That is where we are.\n  I will be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, of course, we want to have a vote on \nthe substitute amendment. What is the basis for denying Senators the \nnormal privilege, which the Senator from Texas has exercised and \nutilized on so many occasions, to offer a second-degree amendment to \nhis substitute so the Senate can work its will, dispose of it, and then \ngo to an up-or-down vote?\n  Mr. GRAMM. The question is a totally fair question. As I said \nearlier, people have a right to offer amendments, but the point is, \nthis is the President's best effort to reach a compromise with the \nSenator and with those who oppose his proposal, and he would like to \nhave an up-or-down vote on his compromise as we have written it, not as \nit would be rewritten by others. The Senator has every right to offer \nan amendment. We have every right to resist it and not let the Senator \nhave a vote on it. But we would like at some point to have people vote \nyes or no on the President's proposal. That is all.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, in responding, I want the record to\n\n[[Page S9195]]\n\nshow--and I yield myself a moment more--we are fully prepared to have \nan up-or-down vote on Senator Gramm's substitute, but after we have the \nright to offer an amendment. That is the way the Senate works. That is \nwhy I objected.\n  Mr. GRAMM. There is the rub. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Texas. Is the \nSenator from Texas aware of the fact he is mistaken again in saying \nonly 3 Federal employees out of 1.8 million were terminated, when the \nofficial figures show in fiscal year 2001, 8,920 Federal employees were \nterminated, and in fiscal year 2000, 8,400 Federal employees were fired \nfor reasons related to poor performance? Is the Senator aware of those \nnumbers?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me respond--\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me complete my question and then I will sit down. Is \nhe aware, as he continues to use the INS example at the Honolulu \nAirport, that after the ruling he referred to, they did work out \ndifferences with the workers and established the 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. \ngraveyard shift once they worked out negotiations?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Does the Senator know how long it took to work it out?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sure the time it took for the lawsuit. It took a \nlong time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. While they were working it out, what if somebody brought a \nchemical weapon in to Hawaii where my kinfolk live. What if they had \nbeen killed?\n  I am constantly capable of misstating facts and figures. I always \ntell my children: Do not get into a debate about facts, look them up. \nAll I am saying is, the facts I have--and I do have as much faith in \nmine as anybody else's--say the Clinton administration found 64,340 \nFederal workers to be poor performers; 434 went through the process to \nbe terminated, and that can take as long as 18 months.\n  Maybe it does not matter unless somebody's life is at stake. That is \nall I am saying. If somebody's life is at stake, you do not do business \nas usual. You can defend business as usual, but when it puts somebody's \nlife at stake, when a man, woman, or child has their life at stake, \nbusiness as usual is not usual. I think there is some urgency here. \nThat is all I am saying. I am not trying to indict any of these work \nrules or say they are crazy. I would hate to have to run my business \nunder these work rules. I would go broke. All I am saying is, when \npeople's lives are at stake, there is some urgency. I yield back to the \nSenator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, how much time is remaining for our side \nof the argument?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 23\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. MILLER. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise to speak not on the subject of the war \nagainst Iraq--that is for another day--but I rise to speak on the \nhomeland security substitute that Senators Gramm, Thompson, and I, and \nabout 40 other Senators, have sponsored that the President says he \nsupports and will sign.\n  We do not teach our children the lessons of Aesop's Fables as much \nanymore. The wisdom of Sesame Street and the Cat in the Hat have taken \ntheir place. There is one fable I learned at my mother's knee, sitting \naround an open fireplace, that I believe is pertinent to this debate on \nhomeland security that has so divided this Senate along party lines.\n  It goes like this: A certain man had several sons who were always \nquarreling with one another, and try as he might, he could not get them \nto live together in harmony. So he was determined to convince them of \ntheir folly. Bidding them fetch a bundle of sticks, he invited each in \nturn to break it across his knee. All tried and all failed.\n  Then he undid the bundle and handed them the sticks one at a time, \nwhich they had no difficulty at all in breaking.\n  There, my boys, said he. United you will be more than a match for \nyour enemies, but if you quarrel and separate, your weakness will put \nyou at the mercy of all those who attack you.\n  That is a lesson for today. That is a lesson for the ages. That is a \nlesson for this Senate and the House, for Democrats and Republicans, \nfor the executive and legislative branches of Government. I am one of \nthe most junior Members of this body. I do not have the experience and \nI have not seen the number of bills most other Members have, so my \nhistorical perspective, admittedly, is limited. But in the short time I \nhave been here, I have never seen such a clear choice as there is on \nthis issue.\n  For me, there are no shades of gray. It is clear cut. Why, in the \nname of homeland security, do we want to take the power away from the \nPresident that he possessed on 9/11? It is power Jimmy Carter had, \npower Ronald Reagan had, power the first President Bush had, and power \nBill Clinton had. Do we really want to face the voters with that \nposition, that vote written large on our foreheads like a scarlet \nletter, and even larger on a 36-inch television ad two weeks before the \nelection?\n  We must give the President the flexibility to respond to terrorism on \na moment's notice. He has to be able to shift resources, including \npersonnel, at the blink of an eye. When the Civil Service was created \nwell over a century ago, it had a worthy goal, to create a professional \nworkforce free of cronyism. Back then, it was valid. But all too often \nin Government, we pass laws to fix the problems of the moment and then \nwe keep those laws on the books for years without ever following up to \nsee if they are still needed.\n  The truth of the matter is a solution for the 19th century is posing \na problem for the 21st century, especially when this country is \nthreatened in such a different and sinister way.\n  I do not want to belabor the point about how long it takes to hire a \nperson or how long it takes to fire a person. I just know it is too \nlong. I also know that a Federal worker can be caught knee-walking \ndrunk and he cannot be fired for 30 days, and then he has endless \nappeals. Productivity should be the name of the game, and we lose \nproductivity when we have such a law. That is no way to wage a war.\n  Do we not realize there is another disaster looming just around the \ncorner, where American lives are going to be lost? And another one \nafter that? And that those attacks against Americans and against our \ncountry will occur for the rest of our lives? Would anyone dare suggest \nthat is not going to happen? Would anyone suggest 9/11 was some kind of \nisolated phenomenon never to happen on American soil again? Surely no \none, even the most naive optimist, believes that. Surely no one in this \nbody believes that.\n  Over 60,000 terrorists worldwide have already been identified. \nTerrorist cells in some unlikely places, such as Lackawanna, NY, have \nbeen discovered. They are all around us, they are everywhere, and when \nthese other attacks come, as certainly they will, do you not think \nAmericans throughout this great land are going to look back at what \nwent on at this time in the Senate? And when they do, do you not think \nsome hard questions and some terrible second-guessing will take place?\n  I can hear them now. The talk show lines will be clogged, and the \nblame will be heaped on this body. Why was the Senate so fixated on \nprotecting jobs instead of protecting lives?\n  The Senate's refusal to grant this President and future Presidents \nthe same power four previous Presidents have had will haunt those who \ndo so, like Marley's ghost haunted Ebenezer Scrooge. They will ask: Why \ndid they put workers' rights above Americans' lives? Why did that 2002 \nSenate, on the 1-year anniversary of 9/11, with malice and forethought, \ndeliberately weaken the powers of the President in time of war? And \nthen, why did this Senate, in all its vainglory, rear back and deliver \nthe ultimate slap in the face of the President by not even giving him \nthe decency to have an up-or-down vote on his own proposal? This is \nunworthy of this great body. It is demeaning, ugly, and over the top.\n\n  What were they thinking of, they will ask? What could have possessed \nthem? Do not ask then for whom the bell tolls. It will toll for us.\n  Few leaders have understood the lessons of history as well as Winston \nChurchill because he was not only a soldier and a politician, but he \nwas also a Nobel Prize-winning historian. Perhaps then at this time we \nshould remember the question Churchill framed to the world when he made \nthat famous\n\n[[Page S9196]]\n\nIron Curtain speech at Fulton, MO, at Westminster College in 1946. He \nfirst reminded the audience:\n\n       War and tyranny remain the great enemies of mankind.\n\n  Then he asked this question:\n\n       Do we not understand what war means to the ordinary person? \n     Can you not grasp its horror?\n\n  Some of the remarks earlier this morning on this floor reminded me of \nsomething else about that speech and its aftermath. Churchill, being so \nblunt, did not go over very well. The American media and others did not \nwant to hear that kind of talk. They called Winston Churchill a \nwarmonger, and even the usually gutsy Harry Truman denied knowing in \nadvance what was in the speech and even suggested that Churchill should \nnot give it.\n  The old soldier went on and said some other very sensible and \nthought-provoking things in that speech, like war used to be squalid \nand glorious, but now war is only squalid.\n  I want to repeat that line that is at the heart of what I want to say \ntoday: Do we not understand what war means to the ordinary person? Can \nwe not grasp its horror? Has scoring points with some labor boss become \nmore important than the safety of our citizens? Can you not grasp its \nhorror?\n  I wonder if you would feel the same way if the Golden Gate Bridge was \nbrought down and 95 cars plunged into the San Francisco Bay. Could we \nthen not grasp its horror? Would we then in the name of homeland \nsecurity still want to take powers away from the President?\n  Or would you feel the same way if that beautiful little city of New \nRoads, LA, on the False River, with the Spanish moss dangling on those \nlive oaks, were to go up in a mushroom cloud? Could you then not grasp \nits horror?\n  We rev up our emotions so easily to fight superhighways from leveling \nethnic neighborhoods. So it would seem to me we should be able to get \nup the same kind of rage when terrorists want to level entire cities \nsuch as Baltimore or Atlanta or the manicured mansions of Newport, RI. \nIf those beautiful cities were the target of a terrorist attack, could \nyou then not grasp its horror? Or the Space Needle in Seattle, filled \nwith tourists, crashing to the ground. Or a smallpox epidemic, in days, \nwiping out completely the Twin Cities of Minnesota or spreading across \nthe forest plains of South Dakota. From the great Atlantic Ocean to the \nwide Pacific shore, from the Blue Ridge of Tennessee to Beacon Hill in \nMassachusetts, I guarantee then the country would grasp that war is \nhorror. And as sure as night follows the day, when catastrophes occur, \nthe Senate, us, we will be held accountable if we fail to give the \nPresident the tools to do his job.\n\n  Why are people back home always ahead of the politicians? Because \nmost politicians, most at our level, do not get out among them anymore. \nWe think we do. And some of us do. A town hall meeting here, a senior \ncenter there, a focus group or two, but we don't really. We do not talk \nto real people anymore. We are too busy in that room dialing up \ndollars. The only horror we can grasp from that experience is some fat \ncat telling us that he is already maxed out.\n  Why are we even in this debate? How will it be recorded in years to \ncome when the historians write their accounts of the days of a Senate \nin September of 2002? How will our actions be judged by the people who \ngo to the polls this year on November 5? Frankly, I think it will be \none of our sorriest chapters, certainly the worst time in my short time \nhere, a chapter where special interests so brazenly triumphed national \ninterests.\n  Herodotus, who lived in Athens in the 4th century B.C., is usually \ncalled the father of history. He wrote about the Persian wars, and \nabout the Battle of Marathon, which later historians called the seminal \nevent in the history of freedom. Herodotus wrote that the Persians lost \nthat battle, even though their army was bigger and better equipped, \nbecause the Persians committed the sin of hubris; hubris, best defined \nas outrageous arrogance. If you study the lessons of history, \nespecially the lessons of the history of freedom, you will find that \nhubris would time and time again bring down many other powerful \ncivilizations.\n  Hubris, outrageous arrogance, is so prevalent in this debate. The \nhubris of some labor bosses and their purchased partridges in a pear \ntree. Outrageous arrogance. What else can you call it when the \ninterests of the few are put above the welfare of the whole country?\n  For the rest of our lives, we will have to live with what we do on \nthis issue. Will we choose to protect the special interests or will we \nchoose to protect the lives of Americans? Will we hog-tie the hands of \nour President or give him the same unfettered flexibility other \nPresidents have had before him? Do not let this be one of those votes \nyou will look back on and ask yourselves for the rest of your lives, \nwhat was I thinking? For as we are reminded in the ``Rubaiyat'' of Omar \nKhayyam: The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on. All your \npiety nor wit shall lure it back to cancel half a line, nor all your \ntears wash out a word of it.\n  I ask one last time, do we not understand what war means to the \nordinary person? Can we not grasp its horror?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I yield myself up to 5 minutes from \nmy time.\n  I will answer the question the Senator from Georgia has raised. Of \ncourse we understand what war means to our country and average \ncitizens. That is why our committee has labored so long and so hard to \nbring forth this bill creating a Department of Homeland Security, \nconsulting with Members on both sides, working with the White House, to \nhave what is, for the most part, a bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  Senators have spoken this morning about the Senate being divided on \nthis bill. The fact is, the Senate is not divided on this bill. The \nGramm-Miller substitute, by Senator Gramm's own reckoning, is 95 \npercent the same as our Senate Governmental Affairs Committee bill. And \nit ought to be. We have a common ground desire to go ahead and create a \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  We have a few areas we disagree on, the most significant of which, \nthe most controversial of which, is the one that the Senator from \nGeorgia has focused on. But I cannot let stand the question that \nsomehow the committee bill, supported by nine Democrats and three \nRepublicans--Senator Stevens, Senator Voinovich, Senator Collins--\nsomehow puts the protection of Federal workers ahead of national \nsecurity. We have a different way we have tried to achieve fairness for \nFederal workers. We can debate that. There is a compromise achieved by \nSenator Ben Nelson, Senator Chafee, Senator Breaux, that we will have a \nchance to vote on, the amendment we want to put on to this bill. \nHowever, there has been so much misstatement and mythology that has no \nrelationship to reality.\n  Let me state it clearly, national security always must trump and \nprevail over any other aspect of law in the cases that are described. \nLet me be very specific why I say that. I will quote the law, United \nStates Code, Title 5, collective bargaining law, section 7106(a)(2)(A) \nwhich says, first:\n\n       Nothing in a collective-bargaining law shall effect the \n     authority of any management official of any agency in \n     accordance with applicable laws to assign and direct \n     employees in the agency.\n\n  Second, section 7106(a)(2)(B) says:\n\n       Collective bargaining shall not effect managers' authority \n     to assign work and determine the personnel by which agency \n     operations shall be conducted.\n\n  This is the directly relevant statute section of law which will \ncontinue to prevail and expresses the clear desire--I presume the \ndesire of every Member of the Senate--to give maximum authority, \nlatitude, to managers at a time of national emergency; section \n7106(a)(2)(D) of the United States Code, Title 5, provides that \ncollective bargaining shall not affect the authority of managers ``to \ntake whatever actions may be necessary to carry out the agency mission \nduring emergencies.''\n  In an emergency situation, the agency has statutory authority to act \nimmediately. It does not have to take any time to collectively bargain. \nThe agency actually has authority to act, even if a collective \nbargaining agreement would ordinarily require some other course of \naction. All the agency head has to do is to invoke a national \nemergency.\n\n[[Page S9197]]\n\n  Therefore, the claims we have heard in the Senate today about how \nunion contracts tie the hands of managers with ``silly union work \nrules'' and about how managers cannot order employees to do what is \nnecessary to protect the security of the American people in an \nemergency are simply not true.\n  In a Federal agency, there is no such thing as a union work rule that \nimpairs a managers' authority to assign work, to direct employees, or \nto take whatever action that manager deems necessary in an \nemergency. That is the law. That is not my opinion; that is United \nStates Code Title 5. When lives are at stake in the kinds of \ncircumstances the Senator from Georgia has described, a Federal manager \ncan impose any changes in assignments immediately, without dealing with \nunions at all. And the unions get to bargain over ways, if they choose \nto, to affect the impact of those decisions long after the fact.\n\n  So we have some disagreements about the specific wording of civil \nservice protections, management flexibility, collective bargaining \nrights. But, please, make no mistake about it, in a case of national \nemergency, the law of the United States, unchanged by the committee's \nproposal, makes clear that national security prevails over any other \nsection of the law and over any provision of a collective bargaining \nagreement.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, are we going back and forth? We do not \nhave to, but we normally have.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. In this case, because I have used very little time, I \nwant to hold it to allow the Senators from Maryland both to have the \nchance to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Parliamentary inquiry: How much time remains on either \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 32 minutes. \nThe Senator from Texas has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So there are 7 minutes on the other side and 32 minutes \nleft with the Senator from Connecticut?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. So I yield up to 10 minutes--let's say I yield up to \n20 minutes for both Senators from Maryland as they wish to use that \ntime.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I know others are \nanxious to speak.\n  Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Gramm-Miller amendment. \nI rise to support the efforts of Senator Joe Lieberman to create a \nframework for homeland security. I had hoped, when we were working on \nthis legislation, we were not going to be Democrats or Republicans, we \nwere going to be the red, white, and blue party. And I really deeply \nregret that this argument has been so deeply politicized.\n  I am here to stand up to protect America and vote for a Department of \nHomeland Security. But I also have to stand up for those who are \nprotecting the United States of America, our brave, our gallant Federal \nemployees who are out there every day on the front line wanting to do \ntheir job, whether they are Customs workers, in the Coast Guard, the \nFBI, or the G men at the Department of Treasury, trying to do their \njob. I resent that my standing up for them, to have their \nconstitutional right to organize, have freedom of assembly, would be \ncalled arrogant and hubris.\n  I listened to an argument that said: Battle? You don't know about it.\n  You are exactly right. I have never gone into battle. I do not bear \nthe permanent wounds of war like some of our dear colleagues, names \nsuch as Dole and Inouye. But I do know this. When we are going to send \npeople into battle, I know we are going to think long and hard about \nit, because I know what it means. When I stand up for America, I also \nwant to stand up, not for a Department, but for what America believes \nin.\n  Why was it OK to have a union in Poland that brought down the whole \nCommunist empire and not to have a union here?\n  When our firefighters ran up into that burning building at the World \nTrade Center nobody asked if they were in the union. They didn't look \nat their clock and wonder if they were working to the rule.\n  When our emergency workers from Maryland dashed over to be part of \nthe mutual aid at the Pentagon, they were mission driven. They weren't \nthere because they were union members--Oops. I am wrong. They were \nthere because they were union members. They belonged to a union. They \nbelonged to a union called the United States of America. That is the \nunion that they belong to, and that is the union they put first.\n  Why are we abusing them as if they are the enemy? I hope we will \nstart to be as hard on terrorists as we are on these union members. It \nhas been over 1 year--where is Bin Laden? We haven't found Bin Laden, \nbut we are going to nitpick over whether or not you have a union.\n  We had an anthrax killer who attacked the Senate and used the post \noffice as a weapon. I have Marylanders dead and I have Marylanders \npermanently ill because of the anthrax killer. Let's make sure that our \nworkers can go out and do the manhunt they need to do, or to do the \nmoney hunt for those who fund them. Let's not worry about whether they \nbelong to a union or they don't. They don't hide behind the union not \nto do their job. But I tell you, there are those hiding behind a right-\nwing agenda to get rid of unions in this country or to make unions the \nproblem.\n  The words ``labor boss,'' what do they mean? It is OK to be a CEO and \nhave more perks than a potentate--that is OK, we can have the imperial \nCEO. But when people organize, they are called labor bosses, as though \nsomehow or another it is the goon squad? I really resent that. I resent \nthat for my customs workers. I resent it for the postal workers after \nwhat happened at Brentwood. The postal workers didn't sit down and go \non strike because we failed to protect them. They showed up every day, \nand because they showed up every day and did their job, as I say, two \nare dead and many are sick. And we are sick at heart because it \nhappened to them.\n\n  So I am kind of tired of this. I am tired of the politicization of \nthe process. I am tired of the cynical manipulation of this process. I \nfeel as though I am being set up. If we stand up for the workers, we \nare somehow or another slowing down the debate on homeland security.\n  This national leader, Joe Lieberman, the Senator from Connecticut, \nhas been working on homeland security and an agency to do it long \nbefore the White House has. Just like he was calling for a national \ncommission to look at what went wrong on September 11 long before the \nWhite House. We have been ahead of the White House, but now we are \ngoing to work with the White House.\n  I think we have to defeat the Gramm-Miller amendment--put that aside \nand no hard feelings. I think we have to then move on to the Lieberman \nbill, pass it expeditiously to show the world we can organize and \nmobilize to protect America, and then let's get on to the other debate \nrelated to Iraq. And then let's also get back on another debate, such \nas what is happened to the economy.\n  The stock market has plummeted. It is about as bad as it was when \nGerald Ford was President, in 1974. We do not want to go there again \nand then need a Democrat to bail us out--or maybe we will need a \nDemocrat to bail us out, but I don't want to go there. I want to stand \nup for this country, but I want to stand up for the people who built \nthis country, and it is the trade union movement. If we don't start \nprotecting the protectors, to make sure they have the right equipment, \nthe right training, and also have the right legislative framework where \nthey can have their constitutional rights, then we have other issues.\n  I want to go back to the bill Joe Lieberman is presenting. I think it \nis an excellent framework. I will go back to being part of the red, \nwhite, and blue party. Let's put the politics of hard feelings behind \nus, let's get Iraq together, and let's show America we can govern, and \nlet's show the bullies of the world we are going to take them on.\n  God bless the Federal employees who stand sentry every day to protect \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S9198]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I rise, first of all, to commend the \nvery able chairman of the committee, the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, for the very fine work he has done on this legislation, \nparticularly on this issue of Federal employees, and the care and \nsensitivity with which he has struck the balance.\n  Obviously, on the one hand we have national security concerns. But as \nthe Senator indicated in the quotes he took right from the legislation, \nthe actual words of the legislation, the flexibility that is necessary \nto deal with national security questions or emergency situations is \ncontained in this legislation. Those would be stripped out by the \namendment. The Gramm-Miller proposal would then move the balance. \nReally, it would eliminate the balance. It would provide no significant \nor meaningful protections for the Federal employees.\n  In one sense it raises the question: What is the nature of the \nsociety we are trying to protect? What is the nature of the society we \nare trying to protect? How far are we prepared to go in denying the \nessential freedoms and essential protections in the name of national \nsecurity? Not in the reality of national security because the Senator \nfrom Connecticut has protected that reality.\n  Their proposal would give unfettered authority to the Executive in \ndealing with their employees--the very employees we have to draw upon \nto protect the Nation and to respond to the challenges we face.\n  I want to assert in unequivocal terms that, in my judgment, our \nFederal employees are loyal and committed workers who are dedicated to \nproviding a high level of service. Legislation creating the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security should protect the rights of those \nworkers to engage in collective bargaining and to protect their rights \nunder the current civil service system unless critical questions of \nnational security or emergency are presented. And those questions have \nbeen dealt with carefully, skillfully, and thoughtfully by the able \nSenator from Connecticut. I commend him for those efforts.\n  I don't understand why some are engaged in beating up on the Federal \nemployees. Why is this happening? Have the terrorist strikes driven \nsome to this point? Do they not recall the Federal office building in \nOklahoma that was blown up by a terrorist, albeit a domestic terrorist? \nDo they not recall that, and those dedicated lives that were lost? \nPeople all across the country who were working in similar office \nbuildings went back in the next morning to do their job on behalf of \nthe country to serve the public interest--all across America--despite \nthe fact that some of their colleagues had just suffered this grievous \nblow.\n  Why do we have this assault taking place? The Federal managers have \nmuch of this flexibility. The legislation has the emergency flexibility \nin it. The civil service law was originally put in place to protect \nagainst politicizing the public service. It has been adjusted and \namended over the years.\n  These arguments that it impedes productivity have been addressed \nagain and again by the chairman's committee. Adjustments have been made \nin the light of changing circumstances. But no one has ever come before \nthe committee and said we ought to take away all of those protections \nwhich have given us a public service with some integrity to it, and \nwhich is not subject to political whim.\n  How are you going to call upon people to serve above and beyond the \nbasic requirements of their job description if you do not treat them \nwith some dignity and respect?\n  I don't know. Some around here may find that they draw the best out \nof those who work for them by sort of beating up on them; that if you \nare sort of whipping them all the time and driving them without any \nprotections, completely at your whim, that enables you to bring out of \nthem the best response. That has never been my experience. I don't know \nof any labor-management text or treatises by noted experts in the field \nwho say that is the best way to get a stellar performance out of your \nworkers. I haven't seen that treatise yet. In fact, the ones I have \nlooked at say that is exactly the wrong thing to do if you want to draw \nout a quality and stellar performance from your workers.\n  There are a lot of very dedicated employees across the country. I \nthink employee rights and the civil service protections which we have \nare essential to the effective workings of our Government.\n  Some come and try to portray this as some special interest. The \npublic interest is served by having these arrangements because those \narrangements enable us to get better people into the public service, \nand to draw on them and their full capabilities.\n  I rise in very strong opposition to the provisions in this amendment \nthat have been offered by Senator Gramm and Senator Miller which would \nstrip away from our Federal employees these important collective \nbargaining rights and these important civil service protections. In my \njudgment, given the balance which the chairman has already struck on \nimportant national security questions, to do what this amendment does--\ntaking away those bargaining rights and those civil service \nprotections--will harm our national security, not help our national \nsecurity. It will harm our national security.\n  For that reason, I very strongly oppose the provisions that are \ncontained in this amendment that deal with our committed and dedicated \nFederal employees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my colleagues from Maryland, \nSenators Mikulski and Sarbanes, for their very eloquent and passionate \nand compassionate statements. I appreciate the way Senator Sarbanes and \nSenator Mikulski talked about the impulse of the people who are working \nfor the Federal Government.\n  I cited the law before which talked about the primary status of \nnational security. But the people, the loyal patriotic Americans, does \nanybody really think in a case of national emergency they are going to \nbe citing subsections of the collective bargaining agreement? They are \ngoing to do what any American did. In fact, that is what they did on \nSeptember 11.\n  I was in a meeting of a group of Federal employees who happened to be \nfrom FEMA. They rushed from where they were to the Pentagon. A whole \ngroup of them were flown up to New York. They worked long hours. They \ngot very little sleep for days and days. Obviously, the firefighters in \nNew York are unionized. It is a remarkable story. I don't remember the \nexact number. I talked to a battalion commander of a unit of New York \nfirefighters a couple of weeks ago. He said on September 11, when they \nheard about the planes hitting the World Trade Center, several hundred \nfirefighters who were off duty just rushed to the scene to help. They \nweren't thinking about a collective bargaining agreement. They were \nthinking about America and their duty. These are public servants in the \nbest meaning of the term.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Given this display of dedication on the part of these \npublic employees, why now all of a sudden are we seeking to take away \nfrom them these basic rights and protections?\n  If someone came in and said what a dismal performance we have, and, \ntherefore, we ought to give the management more leeway to sort of beat \non these people or something of that sort, I don't know that I would \nbuy that argument. But at least it would be something of an argument.\n  Instead, you have this exemplary performance, this manifestation of \nreal dedication. And despite that, some now are coming along and, in \neffect, wanting to beat on people who have behaved in the most \nextraordinary, dedicated, and selfless fashion.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator from Maryland is absolutely right. There \nis no justification for it. At some level, it is not only wrong, it is \noffensive. And I thank the Senator for his substantial contribution to \nthis debate.\n  May I ask the Chair how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I am very pleased to see in the \nChamber my friend from Hawaii, Senator\n\n[[Page S9199]]\n\nAkaka, a very significant member of our committee, who has contributed \nsubstantially, in so many ways, to our legislation that came out of \ncommittee. I yield the Senator up to 10 minutes for his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Madam President. I rise to address the amendment offered by Senators \nGramm and Miller as it relates to whistleblower protections. Contrary \nto press accounts, the Gramm-Miller amendment, as well as the House-\npassed bill and the President's initial bill, do nothing--do nothing--\nto protect whistleblowers. As Congress debates the creation of the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security, we must remember the role that \nwhistleblowers play in protecting this great Nation. We commend the \ncourage of FBI Special Agent Coleen Rowley, who blew the whistle on the \nserious institutional problems at the FBI which impacted the agency's \nability to effectively investigate and prevent terrorism. We commend \nFederal Border Patrol Agents Mark Hall and Bob Lindemann, who risked \ntheir careers by alerting Congress to Border Patrol and INS policies \nthat compromised the security of our borders.\n  Their actions alerted us to flaws in the current system and allow us \nto fix such problems in order to have a more secure Nation. Because \nwhistleblowers play such an important role in protecting our country, \nwe must do our part to protect them from retaliation for disclosing \nGovernment waste, fraud, and abuse. The Lieberman substitute is the \nonly amendment before us that provides real whistleblower protection.\n  During the Committee on Governmental Affairs hearings on the creation \nof the proposed Homeland Security Department, I asked Governor Tom \nRidge about whistleblower protections for Federal employees in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. He said that all employees in the new \nDepartment would have whistleblower protections because the bill would \nrequire the new personnel system to be grounded in the public \nemployment principles of merit and fitness.\n  However, requiring that a human resources system be grounded in the \npublic employment principles does not equate to whistleblower \nprotection. Congress has worked hard, and continues to work, to provide \nreal whistleblower protection to Federal employees. Claiming that \nwhistleblower protection will be provided based on such principles does \nnothing to assure Federal employees of their rights and protections or \nassure Congress that their bipartisan efforts on behalf of \nwhistleblowers would not be frustrated.\n  Adding to my concern over the lack of protections afforded to \nemployees in the new Department, H.R. 5005 and the amendment offered by \nSenators Gramm and Miller fail to provide the same level of \nwhistleblower protection that Federal employees have in most Federal \nagencies. Although the House bill and the Gramm-Miller amendment \nallegedly maintain whistleblower protections and other merit system \nprinciples for employees of the new Department, both allow the \nSecretary to waive due process procedures and the remedies an employee \nneeds to assert those rights.\n  The Gramm-Miller amendment bars the Secretary from waiving the \napplicability of several chapters of title 5 covering a variety of \ncivil service issues. The list of nonwaivable chapters conspicuously \nfails to include protections against unwarranted disciplinary actions \nand performance appraisals, access to third party investigations by the \nOffice of Special Counsel, or independent hearings at the Merit Systems \nProtection Board. Those agencies provide vital third party review and \ntransparent enforcement for whistleblower and other merit system \nrights.\n  When Federal employees allege that they have been subject to a \nprohibited personnel practice, including violations of the \nWhistleblower Protection Act, OSC has authority to receive and \ninvestigate such allegations. If the special counsel finds reasonable \ngrounds to believe that a violation has occurred and corrective action \nis required, she must report the determination to the MSPB, the \naffected agency, and the Office of Personnel Management, OPM. If the \nagency fails to act to correct the prohibited personnel practice, the \nspecial counsel may petition the MSPB for corrective action.\n  Since these procedures are not specifically included in H.R. 5005, it \nis doubtful that the protections afforded to other employees are \navailable to Homeland Security employees.\n  In 1995, Congress gave wide latitude to the Federal Aviation \nAdministration to create its own personnel system. Although this system \nwas to afford whistleblower protections, the Justice Department found \nthat Congress incorporated only selected provisions of title 5 into the \nFAA personnel management system, thus leaving OSC without authority to \ninvestigate or otherwise pursue cases of whistleblower retaliation \nalleged by FAA employees.\n  The reasoning of the Justice Department is supported by Supreme Court \nprecedent, which states that:\n\n       [w]here Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions \n     to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be \n     implied.\n\n  Moreover, Congress has repeatedly demonstrated that if its intention \nis to exempt certain entities generally from title 5, but to apply the \nsubstantive whistleblower protections and all the ancillary enforcement \nprocedures, it knows how to do so unambiguously. For example, when \nCongress applied only selected provisions of title 5 to the Panama \nCanal Commission, it provided for application of the whistleblower \nprotection provisions as follows:\n\n       Section 2302(b)(8) (relating to whistleblower protection) \n     and all provisions of Title 5 relating to the administration \n     or enforcement or any other aspect thereof, as identified in \n     regulations prescribed by the Commission in consultation with \n     the Office of Personnel Management.\n\n  It is fair to conclude that whistleblowers in the new Department do \nnot have the same protections as other employees in the Federal \nGovernment due to the absence of any similar reference to the \nwhistleblower protection enforcement provisions of title 5 in the House \nbill or in the Gramm-Miller amendment.\n  The Lieberman substitute, however, maintains all of the title 5 \nprotections for whistleblowers to ensure that they have the needed \nprotection to come forward and alert us to serious problems in the \nFederal Government that can hamper our efforts to secure our homeland. \nIt also ensures the continuation of union representation which allows \nthird party arbitration for whistleblowers. The Lieberman substitute \nalso contains two provisions, sponsored by myself and Senator Levin, \nwhich enhance the protections afforded to Federal employees.\n  The Akaka-Levin provisions grandfather the whistleblower rights of \nemployees transferred into the new Department and provide full \nwhistleblower protections for TSA baggage screeners. Whistleblower \nprotections for TSA employees had unanimous bipartisan support from the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and the provision mirrors the language \nof S. 2686 which was introduced by Senator Grassley. Despite such \nwidespread support, the Gramm-Miller ``compromise'' amendment does not \ninclude this bipartisan protection for whistleblowers.\n  Under the terms of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that \nwe passed last year, the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security \nhas the authority to employ, terminate, and fix the conditions of \nemployment for the Federal screening workforce while the rest of the \nemployees of the Transportation Security Agency are governed by the \npersonnel system established by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  While the FAA personnel system now provides full whistleblower \nprotection to employees, TSA security screeners are denied such \nprotection. In May, TSA and OSC reached an agreement to provide limited \nwhistleblower protection to TSA baggage screeners. Under this \nnonstatutory agreement, security screeners were not afforded appeal \nrights. However, the right to appeal to an independent third party is a \nnecessary part of providing real whistleblower protection. Such \nprotection is necessary to ensure that screeners feel secure in coming \nforward with information of government waste, fraud, and actions that \nare dangerous to public health and safety.\n  Recognizing the need for full whistleblower rights, Congress resolved \nto provide OSC enforcement authority and\n\n[[Page S9200]]\n\nfull whistleblower rights to FAA employees in 2000.\n  I urge my colleagues to once again protect our Federal whisleblowers \nby providing full and explicit whistleblower protection to employees in \nthe Department of Homeland Security. I urge my colleagues to oppose the \nGramm-Miller amendment and support the Lieberman substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, could the Chair indicate how much \ntime is remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute to the Senator from Connecticut, \nand 7 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, let me conclude in the moment I have \nremaining. I have the feeling this will not be the last moment I or \nother Members will have to discuss the Graham-Miller substitute or the \nquestion of protections for Federal workers.\n  There is a significant disagreement about the protections for \nhomeland security workers. I do think, as we talk about the Nelson-\nChafee-Breaux compromise, which I support, that it will be seen that it \nnot only gives some protection to Federal workers, particularly those \nwho are currently unionized and will be transferred to the new \nbuilding, but it leaves the President with the last word on matters of \nnational security. Let not the debate on that matter obscure the fact \nthat, as Senator Gramm himself has said, 95 percent of his substitute \nis the same as our committee bill. So let's settle the small point of \ndisagreement and get the rest that we agree on done.\n  I believe my time has expired.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton).

Madam President, I call up my amendment at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Nelson], for himself, Mr. \n     Chafee, and Mr. Breaux, proposes an amendment numbered 4740 \n     to amendment No. 4738.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I am pleased to join with my \nfriends, Senator John Breaux of Louisiana and Senator Lincoln Chafee of \nRhode Island, in helping break the stalemate on the labor-management \nissues that have held up the homeland security legislation. We need to \nmove forward and pass a bill that provides real security for all \nAmericans without the distractions of labor-management issues.\n  This legislation is a huge undertaking, and the reorganization will \ncertainly not be accomplished overnight.\n  That being said, we need to get to it right now because the later we \ncome back to try to do this, the more difficult it will be. We need to \ndo it right because unscrambling the eggs is impossible.\n  The new Department will not begin well if it begins with a staff who \nfeels their concerns have been ignored. We now have the opportunity to \nbreak that logjam. This compromise addresses the concerns of both \nsides. The agreement preserves the Presidential authority to exempt \nunion employees from collective bargaining as employees of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. It also grants the President historic \npersonnel flexibility, giving him the authority to hire, fire, promote, \ndemote, and to rewrite civil service laws in the area of performance \nappraisals, classifications, pay rates and systems, and adverse action.\n  The agreement provides binding arbitration on personnel flexibility. \nAll sides will have a seat at the table during the development of the \nnew personnel rules and any disagreements over the rules will be \nreferred to the Federal Service Impasse Panel, which will have the \nauthority to set the rules and resolve disputes. This is modeled after \nthe IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, which is current law.\n  The Federal Service Impasse Panel has discretion to impose new rules \nto break this agreement. This is existing law. It is the way in which \nwe ought to proceed.\n  I know this amendment will receive broad bipartisan support, and I \nhope those of us who seek to complete action on this important \nlegislation will support this effort to clear one of the major hurdles \nthat has been currently blocking our progress so we can move forward on \nthis important and vital security matter currently before us.\n  I ask for the support of my colleagues, and I hope we will move \nforward on this as soon as we possibly can. There is no reason to delay \nthis legislation any longer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I support the amendment to the Gramm-\nMiller amendment which has been offered by our good friend and \ncolleague Senator Nelson, and by my colleague Senator Lincoln Chafee. \nIt is very clear the Senate, as we debate homeland security, has \nreached a point where we are at a logjam. I, for one, and I think the \nvast majority of our colleagues, strongly support the creation of a \nHomeland Security Department, and why is very simple.\n  In light of today's terrorist threat to this country, we can no \nlonger continue to operate and protect our Nation's security in the way \nwe always have. In the past, too often the right hand did not know what \nthe left hand was doing, and vice versa. It is clear, from the evidence \nthat has now been presented, we have agencies within our own Government \nthat had certain amounts of information that was important information, \nbut information they did not adequately share with other Departments \nand agencies within our Government.\n\n[[Page S9201]]\n\n  It is nice to have individual agencies know a little bit about the \nintelligence of an international threat, but if they do not share that \ninformation with other Departments within our Government, and they do \nnot put all of the information gathered into one single place where \npeople can look at it and analyze it, it is really not very effective \ninformation. It is certainly not as effective as if we have the \ncollective wisdom of all of the various intelligence-gathering agencies \nwithin our Government.\n  The point has very accurately been made if the CIA has information \nthe FBI does not have, if the Immigration Service has some information \nneither one of the other agencies has, that is not a very effective \nsituation. If you throw in information that agencies such as the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, \nand local police and State police have, if each one of them keeps that \ninformation to themselves, we are not providing the service we should \nto the American people. For the first time, the creation of a Homeland \nSecurity Agency is going to say to all of these collecting agencies \nthat gather the information that is so important, we should absolutely \nshare it and involve each other in what that information is all about, \nand that is what the Homeland Security Agency does very effectively.\n  All of those, Republicans and Democrats together, who have worked \nvery hard to bring this legislation to the floor have done a good job. \nThis is good legislation. It is important legislation. What this \nlegislation does is simply say to the American people after 9/11, we \nare going to create a new agency in our Federal Government to ensure \nour ability to better protect the rights and freedoms of all American \ncitizens than we have in the past.\n  There are actions that have to be taken in times of national \nemergencies that are not normal, such as during this period of special \nconcern. One of the powers that is necessary for a President to have is \nthe ability to move agencies, departments, and individuals as quickly \nas possible, to the best position to serve the American public.\n  The President currently has the authority to say if it is important \nfor national security that some of the collective bargaining rights of \nsome of these employees of the Federal Government have to be \ntemporarily set aside. He can exercise that authority now, and he has \nexercised it in the past. It has not been only this President but it \nhas gone back, I think, all the way to President John Kennedy. We are \nin that type of a situation.\n\n  With the creation of a new Homeland Security Agency, however, we are \ntalking for the first time about creating a new agency where thousands \nof employees may be taken out of one position and put into the Homeland \nSecurity Agency.\n  Somewhere between 40,000 and 50,000 who have collective bargaining \nrights where they are currently working, if they are transferred to a \nnew Homeland Security Agency, for the first time may have those \ncollective bargaining rights taken away.\n  How ironic it would be if the agency we are creating to protect the \nrights and freedoms of Americans is the agency that is utilized to take \naway the rights of American citizens to collectively bargain without \nthe appropriate justification for doing so. I do not think anyone would \nwant to say that is their desire.\n  This Homeland Security Agency is designed to protect the rights and \nfreedoms Americans have gained. Some may argue about the wisdom of \nhaving collective bargaining rights, but it is a right American \ncitizens have. So the question before this body now is: How do we give \nthe President the authority to do what is necessary in this new \nHomeland Security Agency, which I support very strongly, while at the \nsame time ensuring while we take rights away from American citizens, it \nis only done under the most unusual circumstances, and if it is \nnecessary it be done, it be done very carefully so everyone will \nunderstand how this transaction is taking place?\n  What brings us to the floor today is this suggestion my good friends, \nSenator Nelson and Senator Chafee, and myself, have worked on to try to \nsay, yes, we support homeland security, but we also want to make sure \nwe protect the rights and freedoms of our own American citizens.\n  It is interesting to note, if people would only take the time--and I \nhave said this so many times. I have said this to my good friend, the \nchairman, Senator Lieberman--if all of us had the time to read the \nlegislation and see the actual differences between the two versions, \nthey would find the differences are far less than the similarities, \nparticularly when it comes to this very issue which is causing this \nproblem right now.\n  If we look at the current authority of the President of the United \nStates with respect to what he can do to remove collective bargaining \nrights of American workers when he transfers them, it is almost \nsimilar, if not identical, to what our suggestion is to break the \nlogjam. For instance, under the current law of the United States, under \n5 U.S.C. section 7103, this is what people are saying, do not take away \nthe President's authority. The current law says the President may issue \nan order excluding any agency or subdivision thereof from coverage \nunder this chapter--meaning take away their collective bargaining--if \nthe President determines, first, that the agency or subdivision has as \na primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or \nnational security work; and, second, the provisions of this chapter \ncannot be applied to that agency or subdivision in a manner consistent \nwith national security requirements and considerations. What that says \nis the President can take away their collective bargaining rights now \nonly if he makes a determination that these two things are present.\n\n  How do we handle it in our amendment, which I think can generate more \nthan a majority? Simple. Our legislation says no agency can have their \ncollective bargaining rights taken away, unless it is shown that the \nmission and responsibilities of the agency or subdivision materially \nchange, and, second, that a majority of the employees within the agency \nhave as their primary duty intelligence, counterintelligence, or \ninvestigative work directly related to terrorism investigation.\n  I will argue with anyone who wants to say that this somehow hampers \nthe ability of the President to take away collective bargaining rights. \nUnder our suggestion, the President, as under current law, has to make \na determination that these people are important to intelligence \ngathering. That is easy for the President. And also that the mission \nand responsibilities of the agency from which he wants to take these \nrights away have materially changed. I think that is a very easy thing, \nunder the circumstances that exist today for the President to be able \nto reach that standard.\n  It is interesting that under the current law there is no appeal from \nthe workers to go to the NLRB or any kind of labor agency. But there is \nno appeal under our provision to go to any kind of NLRB or agency at \nall.\n  Some of my friends on the Republican side say, yes, but those workers \ncould take the agency to court. That is true. But that is also true \nunder current law. If someone under current law thinks the President \nhas not made this determination correctly, they have the right to go to \ncourt. I don't know that it has ever been done. If so, I think maybe \nonce it was not successful. But they have that right today. It is not \nappropriate to say we are going to create this new agency but we are \ngoing to give workers less rights than they have today.\n  Some have also suggested they show that mission and responsibilities \nof the agency have materially changed. That would never fit today's \ncircumstances. The example they give is, we may have an immigration \nagency working in south Texas that is all of a sudden going to be \ntransferred to the new agency to look after immigrants who are coming \nfrom suspected terrorist areas of the world and that their mission will \nnot materially change. They will be doing the same work in a different \nagency and, therefore, not meet the test of having their work \nmaterially change because they will be doing the same type of work.\n  That does not create a problem. It is the intent of the authors of \nthis to clearly say it is our intent when you are transferring people \nwho are doing immigration work in border towns,\n\n[[Page S9202]]\n\nprotecting our States under normal circumstances, that they have to do \nthat type of work to stop international terrorists at a time we have \nbeen attacked by terrorists from other countries is materially changing \nwhat they are doing. They are now looking out after foreign terrorists \nwho are trying to attack the United States and do grave harm to this \ncountry. Their work has materially changed. The President makes this \ndetermination under our amendment, as he does under current \ncircumstances. There is no appeal from the workers to be able to go to \nany NLRB-type of organization and plead their case.\n\n  I plead with folks at the White House who have looked at this, take \nanother look at it. Read what the current law says. Read what our \nsuggestion is on collective bargaining. You will find there is not any \ndifference that is worth objecting to if we are able to get this \nthrough the Senate with a large majority. It is not a good idea, I \nsuggest, to have a 50/50 vote on homeland security and have to ask the \nVice President of the United States to come to this Chamber to break \nthe tie, to barely get this through the Senate. What type of unanimity \ndoes that show the American people as we pass homeland security? This \namendment should pass with 75, 80, or 90 votes at least. Our suggestion \nin the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment would allow us to have a huge \nvote in support of this proposition.\n  The second area we have addressed in our amendment is important. The \nquestion is, Do you give the President flexibility to move people \naround, to change, perhaps, how they get paid, or to change their \nfunctions because now there is a question of national security? We have \ndone that in our amendment. We have clearly spelled out the fact that \nthey have the authority to have management flexibility. We have taken \nthe larger part of the so-called Portman-Quinn amendment offered in the \nHouse which gives management flexibility to the President.\n  I happen to think he should have management flexibility, but \ncertainly not unlimited. He should have it in the areas he needs it. We \nhave offered that. The Portman language in the Senate gave him \nmanagement flexibility in six different categories. We have said that \nwe will take four of those six categories and give him the flexibility \nhe needs to make the decisions he would like to make in moving these \npeople around.\n  The President should have that in terms of the national emergency. We \ngive him the authority that he needs, like in Portman-Quinn. The only \nsuggestion is, you should not be able to do it, like you cannot today, \nwithout some involvement of the workers. You ought to at least sit down \nwith them and discuss with them as you do in other agencies--such as \nthe IRS, the FAA. Under current law, you sit down and talk with the \npeople you are going to be moving around to get their support, to get \ntheir ideas, to get their suggestions about how it can be made to work \nin a more efficient manner.\n  What type of managers want to dictate to the employees that he will \ndo this, that, and the other, and oh, by the way, I want you to be a \nloyal worker after I do this? Our legislation requires that in making \nthese management changes, they shall be worked out with the \nrepresentatives of the workers and the Secretary, that they would enter \ninto a written agreement to approve the management flexibility that the \nSecretary thinks he needs.\n  The point is, if they do not reach an agreement, do the workers have \na veto? Absolutely not. As under current Federal law, as under the \nInternal Revenue Service when we gave them management flexibility, this \nbody and the other body voted and approved when they cannot agree on \nmanagement flexibility, you bring in the Federal Service Impasse Panel \nand they will have the authority under the Federal Service Impasse \nPanel--if the parties cannot arrive at an agreement, they have the \nauthority under our amendment, as under current law, to take whatever \naction is necessary to resolve the impasse. That means if they want \nmanagement flexibility, they sit down with both sides and discuss it. \nIf the two sides cannot agree, they bring in the Federal Service \nImpasse Panel and they make the decision. It is a binding decision.\n  What is this Federal Service Impasse Panel? Is this an arm of the \nAFL-CIO? A new creation? No, it exists in Federal law today. There are \nseven people on it. Guess who appoints the seven. The President of the \nUnited States. He appoints every single member of the Federal Service \nImpasse Panel that will look at what the President is trying to do, and \nif the people cannot agree, his appointees, all seven of his \nappointees, unanimously appointed by the President of the United \nStates, put into effect what they think is appropriate and improper. I \ndon't think that is something that is bad at all. That is current law \nfor the Federal service workers right now when they are being moved \naround.\n  I suggest if we could adopt the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment we \ncould put this aside. This bill has to go to conference with the other \nbody. There will be further negotiations on this issue. Hopefully, we \ncan come back with something that leaves the Senate, first, with a very \nlarge vote, instead of 50/50, and then come back in a fashion that will \nalso generate the type of support that I think is critically important.\n  I ask for a ``yes'' vote on my amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, creating the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is an enormous undertaking. In fact, it is the largest Federal \nundertaking since the creation of the Department of Defense. Senator \nBreaux, Senator Nelson, and I offer this amendment to address the \nconcerns, not only of the President, of course, but also concerns of \nthe many thousands of Federal employees to whom we are entrusting our \nnational security. As Senator Breaux and Senator Nelson have pointed \nout aspects of this amendment, I think it is important to note that \nwhat we have done is taken Republican amendments, I say to my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle, we have taken Republican \namendments from the House, the Republican amendment offered by \nRepresentative Morella from Maryland, Republican amendments offered by \nRepresentative Portman and Representative Quinn, from Ohio and New \nYork, and offered them into this amendment. This is an honest attempt \nat bipartisanship.\n  Most important, as Senator Nelson has said, this amendment will \nfinally enable the Senate to move the process forward by getting this \nbill to conference with the House. Without this compromise, there will \nbe no Senate bill. There will be no Department of Homeland Security. \nBut with this compromise we can empower the conference committee to \nwork with the administration to finalize a bill that will meet the \nPresident's legitimate concerns and protect employees' legitimate \nrights. I do urge passage of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Madam President--I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I renew my request the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Just to clarify my intent, Madam President, this is not to \nget recognition to try to offer an amendment or affect the procedure on \nthe pending issue. Talking with Senator Reid, he wanted to make sure \nthat at the conclusion of my remarks there would be an opportunity for \nsomeone to seek recognition on the other side. I am sure that would be \nthe case, although Senator Bunning is here and wishes to speak on the \namendment at hand.\n  I would like, rather than just to speak on the amendment, to use \nleader time, as was done by Senator Daschle this morning, to speak on \nthis critical area.\n\n[[Page S9203]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, the Senate now has been on this important \nissue over 3 weeks. The creation of the Homeland Security Department, \nsomething that clearly is very important, needs to be done. Perhaps it \nneeded to be done earlier--without being critical of anybody. There \nneeds to be some way to bring these different groups together and get a \nfocus, get some direction, to give them the directions they need and \nthe funds and the people to deal here at home with the threat by \nterrorists and by others. We need this Homeland Security Department.\n  I had thought we could probably do a Homeland Security Department in \na few days--probably less than a week. But here we are, now. Obviously, \nwe are going to take a month on this issue.\n  What is at stake? What has delayed this issue is the President's \nauthority to impose national security interests, the security of the \nAmerican people in their homes and their streets and their businesses, \ninnocent men, women, and children here at home--for the President to be \nable to act in the national security interest, to have some flexibility \nin management authority to make sure this Department runs efficiently. \nYet we see we are still arguing over work rules in the workplace. We \nare still arguing over whether the President should have the authority \nto say, for national security reasons: I am going to be able to move \npeople and money around, and we are going to be able to override work \nrules to look after the security of the American people.\n  I think it is ridiculous that we have come to this point. I oppose \nthe pending amendment because, once again, this is an effort to try to \nfind a way to make it difficult or even impossible for the President of \nthe United States--and not just this President, Presidents--to be able \nto do the job on homeland security.\n  The President has said that the Senate needs to act on homeland \nsecurity. There is beginning to be doubt about the Senate's commitment \nin this area because we are putting special interests of certain groups \nover homeland security. That is a legitimate debate. The debate has \nbeen gentlemanly. We have not had many amendments because we have had \nmore talk than we have had amendments. But now we have the President's \nproposal that has been offered by Senator Gramm and Senator Miller--a \nbipartisan bill with some changes that have been agreed to. And now we \nhave an amendment that will be offered. That is all well and good. That \nis fine.\n  Then there is the separate issue of the Iraq resolution. What are we \ngoing to do about Saddam Hussein? Let me read to you what the President \nof the United States said on that issue.\n\n       I want to thank Members of both parties of the U.S. \n     Congress for working to develop a strong resolution and a \n     strong signal to the world that this Nation is determined.\n\n  That is what the President actually said. Now, I am deeply saddened \nby the tenor and the tone of the remarks of my friend, the majority \nleader, this morning on the administration's conduct and Iraq. We live \nin grave times, when this body should be carefully and deliberately \ndebating the threat that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction pose \nagainst the United States. Instead we heard accusations that a \nPresident of the United States is using the possibility of war for \npolitical purposes.\n  Who is the enemy here? The President of the United States or Saddam \nHussein? That is who was attacked this morning here on the floor of the \nSenate. I think we would be better served debating Saddam Hussein and \nthe threat he poses for the world. He is a brutal dictator. He has \nalready used chemical and biological weapons against his own people.\n  We know he has the ability to deliver these weapons. We know he has \ninvaded his neighbors.\n  We had better be asking ourselves what we are going to do about this \ntyrant. He has for 11 years ignored 16 U.N. resolutions and has been \ninvolved in the killing of thousands of innocent people.\n  For anyone who seems surprised that we are engaged in this debate, I \nask a very simple question. Where were you, 9 months ago, when the \nPresident of the United States came before a Joint Session of Congress \nand said, ``Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and \nto support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and \nnerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that \nhas already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens--\nleaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is \na regime that has something to hide from the civilized world?\n  Where were you, 9 months ago, when the President continued, ``States \nlike these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, \narming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass \ndestruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could \nprovide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their \nhatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United \nStates. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be \ncatastrophic''?\n  Where were you 6 months ago, on the half year anniversary of \nSeptember 11, when the President said, ``Here is what we already know: \nsome states that sponsor terror are seeking or already possess weapons \nof mass destruction; terrorist groups are hungry for these weapons, and \nwould use them without a hint of conscience. And we know that these \nweapons, in the hands of terrorists, would unleash blackmail and \ngenocide and chaos''?\n  The President continued, ``These facts cannot be denied, and must be \nconfronted. In preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction, \nthere is no margin of error, and no chance to learn from mistakes. Our \ncoalition must act deliberately, but inaction is not an option.''\n  Again in May, the President said:\n\n       The evil that has formed against us has been termed the \n     ``new totalitarian threat.'' The authors of terror are \n     seeking nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Regimes \n     that sponsor terror are developing these weapons and the \n     missiles to deliver them. If these regimes and their \n     terrorist allies were to perfect these capabilities, no inner \n     voice of reason, no hint of conscience would prevent them.\n\n  The President of the United States has been actively laying out the \ncase against Iraq in a deliberate and focused way for nearly 1 year.\n  Just a month ago, Democrats in the Senate and Republicans in Congress \nwere saying to the President: Mr. President, make your case to the \nAmerican people. Come to the Congress. Make your case to us. Let us be \nengaged in the dialog and the debate, have some resolution prepared, \nand vote. Go to the United Nations. Make your case to the world \ncommunity. Reach out to our allies around the world, and those not \nnecessarily our allies, and show them the danger. Talk to them. Have a \ndialog.\n  The President did that. He has been going to the American people. So \nhas his administration. He came to the Congress and said: You are \nright. I am going to consult with you and communicate with you.\n  Let us have a dialog. Let us have a debate. Let us have a vote.\n  A number of Democrats have stood up and said: Yes, this problem is \nserious, and we must address it. We must address it now.\n  The President went to the United Nations. He showed commitment and \nleadership. He turned the whole debate there around and put pressure on \nthe United Nations to decide if they were just going to be a League of \nNations or if they were going to really enforce their resolutions that \nhad passed several times.\n  The President gave a bill of particulars about why we must act, and \nwe must act now, because with ever passing day, week, month, and year, \nthe threat grows, it doesn't diminish.\n  This is about the people in Iraq who are being oppressed and who have \nbeen killed. This is about security in the region. This is about \nsecurity here at home.\n  Some people have said: He can't deliver nuclear weapons yet. He may \nnot have them.\n  He has the delivery systems. He is working to make them longer range. \nWe know that. He is trying to get materials he needs to have these \nnuclear weapons. But put aside the nuclear weapons. We know he has \nbiological and chemical weapons right now. We know that. Some of these \nweapons can be delivered with an aerosol can--right here; not somewhere \nelse; right here.\n\n[[Page S9204]]\n\n  Have we forgotten the events of 9/11 so soon, which was so \ncatastrophic and so big? Are we ignoring what we are learning from the \nhearings that are underway and from the realities of the threats from \nterrorists all over the world, and particularly from Saddam Hussein?\n  Once the President came to the Congress, some people said: Wait. We \ndidn't mean now. Some people said: Let us do it instantly. Now some \npeople say it is being politicized; we shouldn't do that. We should \nreduce the shrill of rhetoric. We should try to find a way to do this \nin the right way and in a broad bipartisan way.\n  But let us go beyond the situation right here at home. Is somebody \ngoing to accuse Prime Minister Tony Blair of politicizing the issue? He \nis not up for reelection. In fact, he is going against a lot of the \npeople in his own party. I think the British people support what he is \ndoing. But he has shown real courage. He went before the House of \nCommons this week and laid out the information he had. He deliberately \npointed out the danger and why we need to act now. Nobody can accuse \nhim of politicizing the issue.\n  This is what he said.\n\n       [The British Joint Intelligence Committee] concludes that \n     Iraq has chemical and biological weapons, that Saddam has \n     continued to produce them, that he has existing and active \n     military plans for the use of chemical and biological \n     weapons, which could be activated within 45 minutes, \n     including against his own Shia population; and that he is \n     actively trying to acquire nuclear weapons capability.\n\n  The Prime Minister continues:\n\n       Since the departure of the inspectors in 1998, Saddam has \n     bought or attempted to buy: specialized vacuum pumps of the \n     design needed for the gas centerfuge cascade to enrich \n     uranium . . . an entire magnet production line . . . and has \n     attempted, covertly to acquire 60,000 or more specialized \n     aluminum tubes which are subject to strict controls due to \n     their potential use in the construction of gas centerfuges.\n\n  All this, and Iraq has no civil nuclear powerplants. So they are not \ndoing it for that purpose.\n  The Prime Minister concluded:\n\n       Two things about Saddam stand out. He has used these \n     weapons, thousands dying in chemical weapons attacks in Iraq \n     itself. He used them in the Iran-Iraq war, started by him, in \n     which one million people died. And his is a regime with no \n     moderate elements to appeal to. Read the chapter on Saddam \n     and human rights. Read not just about the one million dead in \n     the war with Iran, not just about the 100,000 Kurds brutally \n     murdered in northern Iraq, not just the 200,000 Shia Muslims \n     driven from the marshlands in southern Iraq; not just the \n     attempt to subjugate and brutalize the Kuwaitis in 1990 which \n     led to the Gulf War. Read about the routine butchering of \n     political opponents; the prison ``cleansing'' regimes in \n     which thousands die; the torture chambers and hideous \n     penalties supervised by him and his family and detailed by \n     Amnesty International. Read it all again and I defy anyone to \n     say that this cruel and sadistic dictator should be allowed \n     any possibility of getting his hands on more chemical, \n     biological or even nuclear weapons.\n\n  That was the British Prime Minister.\n  This is not about politicizing the issue. We shouldn't do that. But \nit is a very important issue. The American people's security is at \nstake.\n  I think what maybe has happened here is a desire to try to find some \nway to put this issue off or to in fact make it political.\n  But let me correct the Record just in case some of the comments here \nwere inspired by misinformation.\n  Today's Washington Post story on President Bush and Vice President \nCheney has remarks in it that are flat wrong. The partial quote cited \nin the Post was specifically referencing the current debate over \nmanagement flexibility of the Department of Homeland Security--not the \nwar on terror in Iraq. I think that is a very important and critical \ndifference.\n  I took the time to look at the Vice President's remarks. I know Dick \nCheney. I have the utmost respect for him. I have heard him speak to \nseveral different groups--political meetings and nonpolitical. He is \nalways low key, very studied in what he says, very careful, and it is \nnever inflammatory. He does talk about the need for the right actions \nin the economy, national and homeland security, and trade promotion \nauthority. He has talked about the things we have done.\n  Then he said:\n\n       President Bush and I are very grateful for the opportunity \n     to serve our country. We thank you for your support, not just \n     for our efforts, but for good candidates like Adam Taff, who \n     will make a fine partner for us in the important work ahead.\n\n  What is the problem with that?\n  When I looked at what was said today, I must confess, I was shocked \nand even horrified. I have taken a moment here to talk to some of the \ncolleagues on the floor about the important work ahead of us.\n  At a press conference this very morning, I was saying: We are going \nto work this language out. We are going to find language that will give \nthe President the authority he needs but language that will have broad \nbipartisan support in both bodies. We can find a way to do that.\n  But the accusations leveled against the President of the United \nStates today cannot stand. This is not about unity. That is the worst \nkind of division. I am going to try to remain calm and attribute the \nreaction I heard today to perhaps misunderstanding. We are not going to \nquestion anybody's patriotism here, but we are going to question the \ncommitment and what we need to do to protect the American people.\n  It is not about questioning it; it is about doing it. We are not \ngoing to pass a homeland security bill that ties the President's hands. \nIt is not going to happen. And he will not sign it.\n  We are going to take action against Iraq to make sure their weapons \nof mass destruction are located and destroyed. If it takes regime \nchange, this Congress, this Senate is already on record saying we \nsupport that.\n  I think it is time we get a grip on things. We have a lot of work to \ndo. Here in the Senate, we are not moving anything. We are becoming \ntotally dysfunctional. And now we are going to add to that the type of \naccusations we had here this morning?\n  We have 2 weeks and 2 days or so to do a lot of important work: the \ndefense of our country, homeland security, economic security issues \nthat we need to address--terrorism insurance. There is so much we need \nto do. I hope we will find a way to do those issues and get this \ndiscussion back on the right track.\n  I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have been hoping to move this process \nalong. And I would hope that we would continue to have debate \nthroughout the day on the Gramm and the Nelson amendments.\n  The Senator from Texas had noted earlier that he was desirous of an \nup-or-down vote. I would be prepared to provide that up-or-down vote. I \nam going to propound a unanimous consent request to accommodate that, \nso I will do so at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on Senator Nelson's \namendment at 10 o'clock in the morning, tomorrow, and that immediately \nafter it has been disposed of, Senator Gramm be recognized to offer a \nfurther second-degree amendment that is the text of amendment No. 4738, \nand that the Senate then vote immediately in relation to Senator \nGramm's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, all we have \nasked for, from the very beginning, is to have an opportunity to have \nan up-or-down vote on the President's proposal, not having an up-or-\ndown vote on it as amended by somebody else.\n  The Senator has every right to amend it. It just seems to me, in a \nwartime situation, when the President has proposed a compromise and has \nasked that we vote on it, that we ought to do that. And on that basis, \nI will object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have a hard time understanding the \nbasis for\n\n[[Page S9205]]\n\nthe Senator's objection. We have offered him an up-or-down vote on his \namendment, just as he has suggested.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the majority leader yield?\n  I am going to help the majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will yield in just a moment.\n\n\n                            Motion To Commit\n\n  Mr. President, I do not see that we have any other option, then.\n  To ensure that we keep in place the current parliamentary \ncircumstances that we have legislatively, I move to commit the bill to \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee and that it be reported back \nforthwith with the Lieberman amendment No. 4471, as amended, pending. \nAnd I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is before the Senate.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n  Amendment No. 4742 To The Instructions Of The Motion To Commit H.R. \n             5005 To The Committee On Governmental Affairs\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4742 to the instructions of the motion to \n     commit H.R. 5005 to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4743.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be listed as a \ncosponsor of the bipartisan Gramm-Miller substitute and rise to speak \nin favor of that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4738\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I believe the proposal of Senator Gramm \nand Senator Miller represents our best hope of passing legislation this \nyear to put a new Homeland Security Department in place.\n  The Gramm-Miller substitute addresses the legitimate policy concerns \nof many Senators on both sides of the aisle while also giving the \nPresident the flexibility and the authority he needs to put together \nand run a Homeland Security Department that fulfills its primary \nmission--defending our people and our Nation.\n  This amendment is a good, bipartisan compromise. It contains a number \nof provisions from the original bill reported out of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. It also contains the bulk of what the President has \nasked.\n  As a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I would like to \ntake a few minutes to talk about what I see as the strengths of this \nproposal as well as the weaknesses of the Democratic proposal and why \nit is imperative that we pass Gramm-Miller now.\n  One of the most important things this bipartisan amendment does not \ndo is, it does not take away important Presidential national security \nauthority when this country is in the middle of a war. Going back to \nthe markup of the homeland security bill in committee, many of us \nargued that the President needs to have the maximum flexibility to \neffectively administer a Homeland Security Department. We are fighting \na new type of war. The Department is going to have to be nimble. \nOfficials there are going to have to be able to react to events at home \nand abroad on a moment's notice. The President must have the ability to \nmake decisions and move resources around to fight an enemy that has \nspread throughout the world and could attack us from any point.\n  Every President since Jimmy Carter has had more discretion in running \nagencies that were involved in national security. For instance, over \nthe past 30 years, every single President, Republican or Democrat, has \nbeen able to declare, and actually has declared, that some civil \nservants are exempt from collective bargaining rules that apply to \nother agencies. The Democratic bill would change that when it comes to \nhomeland security.\n  Let me be clear: The employees at the new Department are going to \nhave a very important job to do. They deserve our respect and our \nsupport. But to go as far as to give the President less authority over \nthem and to put more bureaucratic rules into place is to distract from \nthe reason we are debating this legislation in the first place.\n\n  We need to make sure these employees have the resources to do the \njob. We need to make sure the President has the same ability. To give \nhim less authority is the exact opposite of what we need to do.\n  In short, that means the Democratic proposal would actually give the \nPresident less flexibility than he already has under current law. That \nis crazy. There is no reason to have this debate if we are only going \nto talk about making it harder, not easier, for the President to lead \nus in the war on terrorism.\n  This debate is supposed to be about crafting rules and building a new \nDepartment to help fight the war on terrorism. It is not supposed to be \na debate about rolling back the clock to an outdated way of thinking \nabout labor and management relationships.\n  I have said throughout this debate that if the choice comes down to \nnational security versus more redtape and rules, national security must \nwin every time.\n  Instead, what the Gramm-Miller proposal would do is give the \nPresident necessary management and personnel flexibility to allow him \nto integrate the pieces of many standing agencies into a new Homeland \nSecurity Department. This is going to be an awesome task we are \nundertaking. We are talking about taking bits and pieces from literally \ndozens of current agencies and quickly fitting them together into an \neffective unit called the Department of Homeland Security.\n  That job is going to be an even harder one if we continue to focus on \nold rules and redtape instead of how to fashion a new and flexible \nagency to fight a war in the 21st century.\n  Another reason to support Gramm-Miller and to oppose the Democratic \nbill or any substitute for it is the forward-thinking parts of the \nbipartisan bill when it comes to civil service and personnel issues. \nFor instance, Gramm-Miller gives the President flexibility when it \ncomes to management decisions relating to hiring, evaluating, and \ncompensating. Democratic opponents look at this and see the glass is \nhalf empty. They claim it is a pretext for cracking down on workers. I \nsee the glass as half full and view these reforms as a way for the \nPresident and the others to reward those employees who do a good job \nand provide the flexibility to hire the best and brightest for this new \nDepartment. After all, we are talking about defending our Nation and \nour people. Employees who do a good\n\n[[Page S9206]]\n\njob as part of that should be rewarded. Those who do not should either \nbe disciplined or fired.\n  At the same time, Gramm-Miller also retains whistleblower protection \nand a full range of employee benefits and protections. I understand it \nmight not be everything the Government unions want, but it is still a \nvery good deal.\n  Gramm-Miller is also on the right track when it gives the President \nextra authority to transfer funding and responsibilities to the \nHomeland Security Department. Right now his hands are often tied by \nredtape, but if we were to have another 9/11 disaster, if we were to \nsee another attack, the President would need more authority to act \nquickly when it comes to moving around funds and responsibilities to \nmake sure we respond as rapidly as possible.\n  I know some of my colleagues worry about this new authority. They \nthink we are going too fast and that Congress would be giving away some \nof its constitutional authority. I totally disagree. Gramm-Miller \nspecifically says that as to the biggest changes, the President would \nask Congress for permission by submitting a resolution to the House and \nto the Senate and that we would have 90 days to act. That is the type \nof consultation with which I am comfortable.\n\n  Obviously, we have to respect the separation of powers as well as \nCongress's power of the purse and our powers to declare what role they \nare going to play. We can do this while at the same time giving the \nPresident more tools to effectively administer the Federal bureaucracy.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle who oppose Gramm-Miller \nhave also thrown out a couple of other red herrings when it comes to \nlabor and personnel issues. They have tried to fall back on the notion \nthat the proposal would undercut the Davis-Bacon rules covering \nprevailing wage on Government construction projects. But the fact is \nthat Gramm-Miller is neutral on this issue and explicitly does not \naddress it.\n  They also try to make the claim that supporters of Gramm-Miller are \nusing it as some devious way to undercut, in a broad manner, rights \nunder the Federal Labor Relations Act. Again, this just is not true.\n  The President does have the right under Gramm-Miller to exempt \napplications of the rules on a limited basis but only--but only--if \nnational security is involved. That sounds reasonable, and I believe \nmost of the American people, if given a choice between tying the \nPresident's hands with labor negotiations or giving him the ability to \nact for national security, would give him the benefit of the doubt.\n  When you get beyond the debate about broad policies and personnel \nissues, Gramm-Miller also makes sense when it comes to the nuts and \nbolts of making changes to specific departments and agencies.\n  For example, when reorganizing the Customs Service under the new \nHomeland Security Department, the Democratic bill would provide for the \ntransfer of Customs to the Homeland Security Department but at the same \ntime also requires it to be maintained as a distinct entity within the \nBorder and Transportation Security Directorate.\n  That also makes no sense. Customs cannot be in two places at one \ntime. It is either a part of homeland security or it is not. There is \nno other way I can see how it can function effectively by splitting its \nresources and focusing among two agencies.\n  The only reason I can see that the Democratic bill does it this way \nis to protect turf, but all this would do is to protect the same old \nstovepipe system and personnel we have now, but under different names. \nIf anything, moving Customs into two different agencies might make \nthings worse.\n  Instead, Gramm-Miller would transfer Customs to homeland security and \nreserve at Treasury the limited right to issue regulations covering \nsome of the Customs' revenue functions. That seems like a much more \nsensible and workable solution to me.\n  I know it might not be popular in the bureaucracy, and there might be \nsome at Treasury and Customs who are resisting this change, but if it \nis a choice between keeping the status quo or some sort of warped \nversion of it to save the bureaucratic face to protect turf, then I \nhave no problem in upsetting the applecart and supporting a new \nstreamlined approach to Government.\n  Another example of what I am talking about is how the competing \nproposal deals with FEMA. The Democratic bill moves FEMA to a new \nDepartment as a ``distinct entity'' that cannot be reorganized or \nmerged.\n  The Gramm-Miller bill simply moves FEMA to the Homeland Security \nDepartment.\n  I do not even understand what the Democrat bill is trying to do here. \nIt claims to move FEMA to Homeland and to give the Secretary some \nauthority over it. But at the same time it says that FEMA cannot be \nreorganized or improved.\n  This is a distinction without a difference. Either FEMA is part of \nHomeland or it isn't.\n  Either the new Secretary has the authority over FEMA and the ability \nto put its resources to work or he doesn't.\n  The Democrat bill tries to tiptoe around the issue so that it does \nnot step on toes. But when it comes to war and fighting terrorists, it \nis time to step boldly.\n  Instead of talking about shades of gray and playing word games, we \nneed to start looking at the world in black and white and acting \nboldly.\n  In other areas, Senator Gramm and Senator Miller have gone out of \ntheir way to adopt workable sections of the Democrat bill and to \ncompromise.\n  For instance, Gramm-Miller adopts the Democrat bill's language when \nit comes to Freedom of Information Act issues and the law enforcement \npowers of inspector agents.\n  These might seem small, but especially with FOIA I know that many of \nmy colleagues were worried about accountability of the new Department, \nand I appreciate the bipartisan efforts to reach across the aisle from \nSenator Gramm and Senator Miller.\n  Gramm-Miller also borrows from the Democrat bill when it comes to \nprovisions covering Federal workforce improvement and adopting reforms \nworked out in the Governmental Affairs Committees by Senator Voinovich \nand Senator Akaka.\n  It accepts all of the Democrat proposal when it comes to emergency \nprocurement authority.\n  On the subject of Administration of the Centers for Disease Control, \nit also accepts all of the Democrat proposal.\n  Gramm-Miller proposes effective immigration reforms by adopting the \nDemocrat bill's proposal to create an Immigration Affairs directorate \nwithin the new Department and to transfer the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service to it.\n  Senator Gramm and Senator Miller also accept, with only minor \nchanges, the Democrat's proposal to modify the Coast Guard's mission \nand reforms the rules that cover how we issue visas.\n  In short, Gramm-Miller has tried to take the best and most acceptable \nparts of the Democrat bill while also maintaining the flexibility and \nsome of management proposals that the President says he needs.\n  For instance, the President's plan provides for unified intelligence \nanalysis and infrastructure protection in one organization.\n  This would have a single agency responsible for providing both threat \nassessments and vulnerability analysis. Nowhere in the Government does \nthis currently take place. This plan would fill that gap.\n  As the current Joint Intelligence Committee hearings have shown the \nlast several days, our intelligence community needs some work.\n  Most importantly, information about what is going on in this country \nneeds the most work, and information about what our own weaknesses are \nis largely nonexistent. This amendment would allow these two types of \nanalysis to come together and provide the most accurate information \nabout what we need to do as a Nation to protect ourselves domestically.\n  This flexibility and reform is not part of the Democrat bill.\n  We have been at loggerheads on this legislation for almost 4 weeks \nnow.\n  I think we know it is getting down to crunch time and it is time to \ncompromise. That is what Gramm-Miller does.\n  No one is going to get everything of what they want and the time \nbefore adjournment is shrinking rapidly.\n  I think it is time to move beyond confrontation and toward a workable\n\n[[Page S9207]]\n\ncompromise that will allow us to put an effective Homeland Security \nDepartment into place now.\n  I know that some Members think we are moving too fast and they want \nto spend more time debating the bill.\n  I think that is the wrong way to look at this situation.\n  Obviously, we have to get things right in building the new \nDepartment. But at the same time, we all know that if we can come up \nshort we come back and fix things down the road. I do not think anyone \nseriously doubts that if we pass a bill that needs to be tweaked down \nthe road that the Congress is going to drag its feet on such an \nimportant national security issue.\n  We owe it to ourselves and the American people to finish work on this \nbill. We have been debating it for close to a month. Before that, it \nwas subject to some public debate during the August recess and during \nthe Government Affairs Committee markup in July. We have had over 15 \nhearings on this bill.\n  We are not reinventing the wheel. We have had a good debate. I think \nwe have a good handle on this bill and now it is time to vote.\n  If we are worried about making mistakes or not passing a perfect bill \nwe will be here until doomsday--literally.\n  This is a complicated issue. There are bound to be mistakes. But I \nthink we are on the verge of getting much of it right, and on many \nlevels we will not know for sure how to make the Department work until \nwe get it up and running and see where the shortcomings are.\n  So let's get started. The people who will staff this new Department \nare already out there, trying their best to protect America.\n  They are dedicated public servants who make many sacrifices to serve \nthis Nation and their fellow citizens, but right now they are spread \nthroughout the Government.\n  It is time to bring them together and to harness their collective \ntalents for the national good.\n  There is an old phrase that says one should either leads, follow, or \nget out of the way. Right now we are doing none of those things. We in \nCongress need to start leading\n  The President has been pretty clear about what he needs to administer \nthe new Department.\n  He has told us what he can accept and what he has to veto.\n  The House has acted, and now I think a bipartisan majority in the \nSenate ought to be ready to act.\n  We can continue talking or try to pass a political bill that the \nPresident will send right back to us.\n  Instead, we should adopt Gramm-Miller. It is a good starting point--a \nsolid, consensus bill.\n  It borrows the ideas from competing bills, and as the only bipartisan \nbill it offers common sense solutions when it comes to building the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Kentucky leaves the \nfloor, I, as all Senators, I am sure, feel very fortunate to be able to \nserve in the Senate. One reason is the associations we develop with our \nfellow Senators. One of the things I haven't had a chance to say \npublicly, or even privately, to the Senator from Kentucky is how much I \nenjoy serving with him.\n  As a boy, I used to listen to baseball games--no television; we used \nto listen to the games. Of course, Jim Bunning was one of the people \nwho pitched those great ball games. Then, of course, I watched him do \nall the great things he did later on. And now, to serve in the Senate \nwith a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, for somebody who wanted to \nbe a baseball player--that was what I wanted to be until I found out I \nwasn't good enough--is really one of the pleasures of my life--to say I \nserved with somebody who is in the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n  Mr. President, I will send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Will the Senator yield?\n  Now you have switched your allegiance to a fellow who lives in your \nhome State?\n  Mr. REID. I have to admit I did give a statement on the floor the day \nbefore yesterday about another great pitcher who certainly will be a \nmember of the Hall of Fame, Greg Maddux. In my statement, I said Greg \nMaddux is less than 6 feet tall, weighs maybe 10 pounds more than I \ndo--not very big, clearly not as big as the Senator from Kentucky. The \nSenator from Kentucky hasn't gained much weight, if any, from the time \nhe pitched. Greg Maddux is one of the great ones. On Sunday he won his \n272nd game. He has an ERA lifetime of about 2.5. He tied Cy Young's \nrecord of winning 15 games 15 years in a row.\n  One of the interesting things I learned was that, as a 20-year-old, \nwhen he came up to the majors, the second game he won, he pitched \nagainst his brother Mike, and beat him. Mike played for the Cincinnati \nReds at the time when he beat him.\n  I haven't switched my allegiance. I can have allegiance for more than \none great baseball player.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nRule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Gramm-\n     Miller amendment No. 4738 to H.R. 5005, the Homeland Security \n     legislation.\n         Harry Reid, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Hillary Rodham \n           Clinton, Debbie Stabenow, Mark Dayton, Patrick Leahy, \n           John Breaux, Tom Carper, Tom Daschle, Byron L. Dorgan, \n           Jack Reed, Jim Jeffords, Tim Johnson, Mary Landrieu, \n           Max Baucus, Daniel K. Inouye.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Because of the parliamentary matters we have been going \nthrough this afternoon, a number of Senators have come to the floor and \nhave wanted to speak and have been prevented from doing that. \nTherefore, I hope things will run a little more smoothly this \nafternoon.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, be \nrecognized for up to 15 minutes, Senator Nelson be then recognized for \nup to 10 minutes, and Senator Nickles for 10 minutes. He told me that \nis what he wanted. Then, Senator Voinovich waited here all morning and \npart of the afternoon. I ask that he then be recognized for up to 35 \nminutes to speak and that then Senator Lieberman, the manager of this \nbill, be recognized after that for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. In that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I personally want to express my regard for \nthe distinguished Senator from Kentucky and his excellent remarks \ntoday. I think he covered the problems quite well. I personally \nappreciate the friendship we have together and the great leadership he \nprovides in the Senate. I think he did a very good job. I agree with \nhim.\n  Mr. President, every Member of this body, and every citizen in this \ncountry, knows that the most critical issue facing our Nation today is \nthe task of securing our homeland and protecting our country from \nfurther terrorist attacks. The enormousness of this task cannot be \noverstated; and its implementation is equal measures vexing and \ndaunting. But we must rise to the challenge. And we must do so \ntogether. No less than the lives of our citizens and the security of \nour nation hangs in the balance.\n  With regard to this, I pay my compliments to the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia who gave a speech this morning that was really \nvery good. Senator Miller, it seems to me, has made a real effort to \nbridge the gap between Democrats and Republicans on the floor and \notherwise. His remarks were just absolutely right on the money. I \npersonally express my regards for his remarks and express my love and \naffection for him as a Senator. He is a good man, and we ought to \nlisten to him.\n  I speak today out of a spirit of bipartisanship. I am proud of the \nway that Congress has come together on issues of national security \nsince the horrific\n\n[[Page S9208]]\n\nattacks of September 11. In the wake of these tragic events, members of \nthe Judiciary Committee and Congress worked tirelessly to provide the \nAttorney General with the tools necessary to fight terrorism worldwide \nand protect our country. Specifically, we passed the PATRIOT Act, a \ncritical set of reforms needed to unleash our government's ability to \ndetect and prevent terrorist attacks, by an near-unanimous vote of 99-\n1. It is my hope that enough of that robust bipartisan spirit remains \ntoday as we consider the landmark legislation to create the Department \nof Homeland Security. As we have just passed the anniversary of the \nterrorist attacks that killed thousands of innocent Americans, such a \nsentiment is not just sorely welcome; it is also fundamental and \nnecessary and appropriate.\n  Today, we face a significant new type of military threat, one far \ndifferent than post-World War II communism. We face today the danger of \nnumerous, well-financed, well-trained and completely ruthless terrorist \ngroups who will stop at nothing to cross our borders and attack our \ninstitutions, infrastructures, people and freedoms with all types of \nweapons. They engage in unconventional warfare and are bound by no \nrules. I speak not of just al-Qaida but many other terrorist groups. \nThe creation of the new Homeland Security Department is a massive task \nprecisely because the terrorist threat is so pressing and pernicious.\n  The proposal to create a new Homeland Security Department is the next \nlogical and necessary step in our country's war against terrorism. In \nmy view, there are several components that are critical to ensuring its \nsuccess.\n  One of these involves our intelligence practices. In the aftermath of \nSeptember 11, it is abundantly clear that we must improve the \ngathering, sharing, and analyzing of information within and among our \nFederal, State and local agencies. Our nation clearly needs to have a \ncentralized office that is responsible for reviewing all of the \nterrorism-related information that collected by any agency, be it the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the \nNational Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, or one of \nthe others. The Homeland Security Department is a critical step to \nensuring that intelligence information is comprehensively collected, \nanalyzed and disseminated. We must be sure not to handcuff the new \nDepartment's ability to do its job in this area. In particular, we must \ntake pains to ensure that we do not unnecessarily limit the use of this \nintelligence within the new Department. The stakes are simply too high \nto place artificial constraints on this important function.\n  Another critical area involves managerial flexibility. The new \nDepartment of Homeland Security must be given the ability to hire and \nretain the very best people to do the work of keeping our country safe. \nWe need to give the Secretary of Homeland Security such fundamental \nmanagement powers as the ability to remove poor performers and reward \nexemplary employees with merit-based pay raises. Believe it or not, \nunder our antiquated system of Federal employment rules, it can take \nfive months to hire a new employee and 18 months to fire a terrible \nworker. Most Federal employees also get annual pay raises based on how \nlong they have worked for the government, not how well they do their \njobs. The vast majority of ordinary Americans don't have such outdated \nrules in their workplaces. There is absolutely no sound reason to move \nsuch inefficiencies to the new Department of Homeland Security. That is \nthe current law. The bill before us even expands that.\n\n  Let me be clear: I am convinced that the vast majority of Federal \nworkers do an outstanding job for our country. That is why I am not \nconcerned with giving the Department of Homeland Security more \nmanagerial flexibility. Indeed, because most Federal workers do great \nwork, they have nothing to fear and everything to gain from an improved \nsystem that allows their work to be rewarded through merit-based \nbonuses and raises. Only poor workers need be concerned, and they \nshould be. Frankly, there is no place for underperforming or \nincompetent workers in the agency charged with protecting our safety. \nThe new Department has the Herculean task of preventing terrorist \nattacks and keeping our country safe. I cannot imagine any reason why \nwe would handicap it by imposing a system of rules that protect bad \nFederal workers at the expense of good ones and, more importantly, at \nthe expense of our nation's safety. That is what the amendment to the \nbill by Senator Gramm and Senator Miller changes.\n  The need for flexibility, in my view, must run through every corner \nof the Department of Homeland Security. The very nature of our enemy is \nquick and deliberate action; terrorists are quick to change their \nmembers, associations, plans, training bases, and destructive methods. \nTerrorists, moreover, come in many different shapes, colors and \nideological bents. We must equip our security forces with the ability \nto be similarly adaptable. The Department simply must have the ability \nto adapt itself to a constantly changing enemy threat. We will fail our \ntask miserably if all we end up doing is reorganizing dozens of \ninflexible agencies into a new titular Department of Homeland Security. \nIf the Secretary of Homeland Security is required to keep intact within \nthe Department each of the individual agency's personnel, components, \nbudgets and rules, then we don't have a new department--just a \nhodgepodge of independent agencies. We will have created just another \nlayer of bureaucracy. That cannot be our goal. That cannot constitute \neffective governance. For this reason, I think it is absolutely \nessential that we give the Secretary of Homeland Security the ability \nto move personnel, assets and money to best meet the rapidly shifting \nterrain of terrorist threats.\n  We all recognize that the war against terrorism cannot be won simply \nby reorganizing existing government agencies into a Department of \nHomeland Security. That Department must be equipped with the tools to \ncomplete its task. Moreover, it is essential that we tap into the \nresources and expertise of America's private sector. The new Department \nmust enlist the aid and expertise of America's businesses to enhance \nour nation's security, and I am committed to making sure that the new \nDepartment is able to receive the uninhibited advice and counsel of our \nbusiness leaders. It is private businesses which own and operate most \nof our infrastructure--our telecommunications, energy and financial \nsystems. Our government cannot effectively fight this war against \nterrorism without their support. We must arm our agencies with the best \ntechnologies available, and our private sector is a critical player in \nthis process, as it has been in our national defense and military. Our \nwar against terrorism would be hopeless without the active innovation \nand support of private industries. We must also recognize that the \nprivate sector cannot realistically step up to help wage our fight \nagainst terrorism without some reasonable protection from frivolous \ntort litigation.\n\n  Congress must act and must do so quickly and carefully without \npolitical gamesmanship. Our task is too important; we cannot afford to \nsacrifice our country's safety in the process. The threat of terrorist \nattacks on our homeland, as well as abroad, is here to stay. Our \nresponse to this threat requires a singleness of focus. All of us in \nGovernment have a duty to do all we can to protect the American people \nfrom future terrorist attacks.\n  I have spent considerable time considering the tools that the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security simply must have to create an effective \nsystem of protecting our borders from terrorism. Having done so, I have \nreluctantly concluded that I cannot support Senator Lieberman's \nproposal, which simply cobbles together dozens of disparate agencies \nwithout any mechanism for adapting their personnel and missions to meet \nthe challenge of the new Department. On the other hand, I find myself \nin great agreement with the central proposals of the Gramm-Miller bill. \nIt is a bipartisan measure. And, as all bipartisan bills, it represents \na series of compromises. But, I am convinced, the compromises will not, \nin my view, detract from the core ability of the Department to do its \njob and protect American lives. Critically, the Gramm-Miller bill \nprovides enough flexibility for the President and the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to respond to an ever-changing, multi-headed threat.\n\n[[Page S9209]]\n\n  The task of guarding against terrorism is immense; the risk of \nfailure is enormous. We simply cannot be bound by partisan interest \ngroups in this time of war and crisis. Let us join together to pass the \nbipartisan Gramm-Miller bill so that we can feel certain that we have \ndone all we possibly could to protect the mothers, fathers and children \nfor whom each of us work.\n  The same considerations that compel me to support the Gramm-Miller \nbill cause me to oppose the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment. While this \namendment is a slight improvement from the Lieberman substitute, it \nstill ties the President's hands much too much. Like the Lieberman \nsubstitute, the proposal cuts back on the President's existing \nauthority to decertify the union affiliation for workers in the new \nDepartment in the interests of national security. This would be a step \nback under any circumstances; it certainly is not a forward-thinking \nway of creating a successful new Department of Homeland Security. \nMoreover, the amendment allows the unions to arbitrate any attempt by \nthe President to loosen the civil service rules governing promotions \nand dismissals. I think I need to be entirely candid on this issue: how \nmany members of this body would feel good about these rules if it took \nus 5 months to hire a staffer and 18 months to fire an incompetent one? \nHow many of us would stand up and support such a system if it affected \nthe way we do business?\n  There is not one of us who would do that. And that is what we will \nget if we have the underlying bill.\n  In all honesty, I think it is time to bring this matter to a close.\n  I personally have seen how the majority has loaded up the tree with a \nbunch of Democrat amendments in an attempt to prevent a vote on the \nGramm-Miller amendment. We intend to have a vote on the Gramm-Miller \namendment, and the sooner the better. It may be that the majority will \nwin on that amendment; it may be that they won't. But that is the \nnature of the process around here. We can't keep playing parliamentary \ngames with homeland security. That is what is going on around here. \nThat is the reason I have come to the floor. I don't come to the floor \nthat often to raise Cain. And I am not raising Cain here, I am just \nspeaking frankly.\n  I think it is time for us to get about voting on these two different \naspects of the bill. We ought to vote on the Gramm-Miller bill. There \nwill have to be a vote on it. We ought to vote on the underlying bill, \nif that is the case--the Lieberman bill. I am not objecting to that. I \ndon't think our side is objecting, nor is our side filibustering. We \njust want to be treated in a decent, honorable fashion; that is, give \nus a vote on the Gramm-Miller amendment, or the Gramm-Miller \nsubstitute, to put it in better terms.\n  I get a little tired of politics around here, especially now that we \nare dealing with homeland security. That is what the President was \ncriticizing. I hate to say this, but I saw the remarks of the \ndistinguished majority leader earlier. It was on all three cable \nnetworks, as far as I could tell. Those remarks implied that the \nPresident was politicizing Democrats. That is not the case. The \nPresident did say we are muddling around here. He didn't say it in \nthose terms. I will put it in these terms--muddling around with this \nhomeland security bill instead of voting up or down and getting the job \ndone.\n  That is what we need to do. We don't need to have any distortions of \nwhat the President said or what Vice President Cheney said.\n  That is what I think, unfortunately--I am sure it was sincere and \nwell intentioned--was a distortion, but it is still a distortion.\n  I think it is time we get rid of those types of attempts to have \npolitical games at the expense of a bill of this importance. That is \nwhat the President is driven by.\n  After seeing all the weeks that we have been on this bill, I think \nthe President is justified in his criticism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity \nto rise in support of the Nelson-Breaux-Chafee amendment which is a \nbipartisan compromise on homeland security.\n  I believe perhaps some clarification is in order because there seems \nto be some misinformation or misunderstanding about what this bill \ndoes.\n  My good friend from Utah said the amendment ties the President's \nhands. We have looked very carefully at existing authority that the \nPresident has in similar circumstances at this very moment. And it \ndoesn't tie the President's hands.\n  I must say Nebraska is going to be playing Texas at Texas A My \ngood friend from Texas is my hunting partner. Senator Gramm is not \ngoing to move the goalposts down in Texas when we play A We are not \ngoing to move the goalposts on Texas when Texas plays in Lincoln. I \ndon't think it is about moving goalposts in athletic events. But I \nbelieve on this amendment we have had the goalposts moved on us.\n  Just recently, while I was presiding, Senator Gramm, in talking about \nthe Lieberman bill, referred to the fact that it was too restrictive on \nthe President's authority in the area of collective rights and \nbargaining rights, or in terms of civil service protection. At that \npoint, he believed it tied the President's hands in dealing with these \nvery important issues when it comes to national security.\n  It was partly as a result of his comments at that time that I thought \nwe would try to find a compromise that could deal with the situation.\n  Let me read from some of Senator Gramm's comments that he made on the \nfloor, I believe, just last week.\n  He was talking about the fact that when we decided to federalize \ninspectors at airports, in that bill we gave the President power in \nterms of personnel flexibility to hire and fire, and we gave him the \nability to get around the normal procedures that require up to 6 months \nto hire somebody. Then he goes on to say we have done that same sort of \nthing in the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  Then he goes on and references the Internal Revenue Service. I quote:\n\n       I ask my colleagues: If we believed that the current system \n     was failing us in the Internal Revenue Service and that we \n     had a problem which required a different approach and more \n     flexibility with regard to our sensitivity at the Internal \n     Revenue Service with people who know our intimate financial \n     information and who look at our tax returns. If we believed \n     that flexibility to administer that Department was \n     necessary--and we did, and we adopted it and it is the law of \n     the land today--I wonder what people back home would think \n     when we said we thought flexibility was required at the \n     Internal Revenue Service. . . .\n\n  In other words, he says what we did in the Internal Revenue Service \nreorganization was OK.\n  That is what he said last week.\n  Well, lo and behold, because of his commitment to that particular \nflexibility, that is exactly the kind of language and that is the \nreference we have in this amendment.\n  If it was good enough for last week, it seems to me it ought to still \nbe good enough for this week and next week and the week thereafter.\n  So if this isn't moving the goalposts, it is at least shifting around \non the answers. And I believe that what was good enough last week, and \nwhat is good enough for the Internal Revenue Service to deal with \nflexibility, is good enough for homeland security.\n  Then the White House, through various spokespersons, has raised a \nquestion about whether the President's hands would be tied with what we \nare proposing.\n  But lo and behold, Governor Ridge--who took advantage of me with a \nbet on the Penn State-Nebraska game, which I shall pay him very vividly \nfor--went ahead and said something in his letter to Senator Lieberman \nthat I thought was important.\n  This is in his letter dated September 5, 2002:\n\n       Senator, the President seeks for this new Department the \n     same management prerogatives that Congress has provided other \n     departments and agencies throughout the Executive Branch. For \n     example:\n       . . . personnel flexibility is currently enjoyed by the \n     Federal Aviation Administration--\n\n  And guess what--\n\n       the Internal Revenue Service, and the Transportation \n     Security Administration.\n\n  I do not know what has changed since September 3 or last week, \nbecause we thought this would be acceptable,\n\n[[Page S9210]]\n\ngiven the fact that the President needs the kind of historic personnel \nflexibility he is seeking.\n  So for those who said we are changing the laws, or we are somehow \nrestricting the Presidential authority, or tying the President's hands \nby changing the law, apparently they have not focused on what the \ncurrent status of the law is because they are asking for what we are \ntrying to provide them at the present time.\n  Now, I don't know whether someone hasn't read the amendment, but some \nof the criticisms I have heard of the amendment would indicate they saw \na previous iteration. It seems to me the current state of affairs with \nour amendment would be directly on point or on all fours with what has \nbeen asked.\n  So I am very anxious to see if we can get a clarification because I \nthink it has to be some sort of a simple mistake. I cannot believe that \nwe have been asked to do something, or it has been suggested that this \nwould be OK, and then, when we offer it, that somebody cannot take yes \nfor an answer. I hope this will be clarified.\n  It is also important to say that binding arbitration and personnel \nflexibility is part of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, \nwhich both Governor Ridge and Senator Gramm have suggested was OK. So \nit seems to me that whether it was binding arbitration, personnel \nflexibility, or, in the case of Presidential authority, in terms of \nexempting union membership, union employees, from collective bargaining \nmembership, we have done exactly what others have been asking us to do.\n\n  So it seems to me that if the people are as anxious as they seem to \nbe, both in the administration and on the other side of the aisle, to \nget the Gramm-Miller amendment considered, the first step is to pass or \nat least have a vote on Nelson-Breaux-Chafee because it will, in fact, \ngive us an opportunity to have that vote, and I think another vote \nshortly thereafter, if necessary, on Gramm-Miller.\n  I do not know what more a person can do today than give the other \nside the kind of answers they are seeking and the kind of solution for \nwhich they have been asking. I hope this will be clarified. If there \nare some misunderstandings--as I think it may be a simple \nmisunderstanding--I hope some other people will show up and respond to \nwhat we have put out there at this point in time.\n  Very often, misinformation, a lack of information, \nmischaracterizations, and things such as that can drive the day. I hope \nthey do not drive this day. National security is too important, and \npassing this homeland security legislation is of the utmost importance.\n  So for those who are suggesting there is any effort to delay it or in \nsome way tie the President's hands, this simply does not do it. It is \nconsistent with existing law, and it gives the President ample \nauthority to do what the President needs to do for personnel, for \ncollective bargaining, and for breaking the logjam in the homeland \nsecurity debate, which is so important to the future of our country.\n  Passion runs deep: passion about Iraq, passion about homeland \nsecurity, passion about getting something done as quickly as possible. \nI hope we can use that passion as a basis to accomplish something.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a little bit of time \nuntil Senator Nickles from Oklahoma arrives, and ask unanimous consent \nthat he then be permitted to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I simply want to respond, very briefly, to \nwhat I saw this morning on the television when I was observing the \nactivity on the floor.\n  I saw the majority leader come to the floor and give what I thought \nwere very intemperate remarks suggesting that--not suggesting--\ndemanding that the President of the United States apologize, allegedly \nfor politicizing the war effort.\n  My belief, after looking at all of the transcripts of the comments \nthat were attributed to the President and the Vice President--and I \nhave them all right here, as well as the newspaper accounts of the \nsame--it suggests to me that it is not the President but the \ndistinguished majority leader who needs to apologize.\n  I say that because it is very clear the President has not politicized \nanything with respect to this war. The comments in which he criticized \nthe Senate--and I believe rightly so--have to do with our failure to \nadopt a homeland security bill. And he referred to the special \ninterests that have been involved in impeding action on the bill, and \ncomplained about the fact that the Senate has not followed the \nleadership of the House and passed a bill.\n  As a matter of fact, earlier today the Senate precluded a vote on the \nPresident's plan. When Senator Gramm sought to have an opportunity to \nvote on the President's plan, that was turned down.\n  So we have a situation in which the Senate, for the fourth week now, \nis debating the homeland security bill--has not passed it, will not \neven let the President have a vote on his proposal--and the majority \nleader suggests the President is politicizing national security.\n  The President is right to complain about that. But what the President \ndid not do was to connect any activity of the Senate, or Democrats in \nthe Senate--or anybody else, for that matter--to the war effort, as was \ninferred by the majority leader.\n  The majority leader attempted to take quotations that dealt with \nhomeland security and transform them somehow or other into criticism of \nDemocrats in the policy with respect to Iraq. And that simply is not \ntrue. It did not happen. For that reason, as I say, it seems to me the \nmajority leader ought to be the one offering the apology, not the \nPresident.\n  I had been talking, just before watching this, about the damage that \nwas being done to the attempts by the President to reach an \ninternational consensus in developing a plan for dealing with Iraq by \nthe comments of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder during his \nelection. And both Dr. Rice and Secretary Rumsfeld have noted the fact \nthat those comments were not helpful and poisoned the atmosphere.\n  They poisoned the atmosphere internationally by, in effect, \nconfirming what Saddam Hussein is saying, that the President is acting \nout of political motives rather than out of a desire to achieve peace \nin the world. When the distinguished majority leader comes to the \nSenate floor and seemingly validates those same criticisms of the \nPresident, he is further poisoning the atmosphere.\n  That is another reason why he owes the President an apology. He is \nliterally politicizing the issue in a way that is destructive to the \nPresident's attempt to achieve an international consensus.\n  I find it ironic because it is the other party that has sought to \nassure the President would gain that consensus internationally, many of \nthem suggesting that is necessary before we act, and then that very \nattempt is being undermined as a result of the comments made here.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask the Senator from Arizona if he is aware, along the \nsame vein of comments that were made by the distinguished majority \nleader in reference to the Vice President--I share the same concern he \nhas mentioned--is the Senator aware when the Vice President was in \nKansas, basically they are accusing the Vice President of politics in \nregard to the Iraq debate in urging an audience in Kansas to vote for a \nGOP congressional candidate?\n  Mr. KYL. I am aware of the fact the majority leader alluded to that. \nBut he was only looking at a headline in a newspaper. I know the \nSenator from Kansas was actually at the event.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would respond to the Senator by simply indicating, \nthere is nothing that hurts the truth more than stretching it.\n  I understand if somebody reads a headline and gets upset about it. I \nwould, too. But the headlines I have\n\n[[Page S9211]]\n\nfrom the Kansas press--and the Senator is correct; I was at the meeting \nand introduced the candidate. The candidate introduced Lynne Cheney, \nthe wife of the Vice President. The Vice President gave a very standard \nspeech. Here is the headline, ``Cheney Talks About Iraq at \nCongressional Fundraiser.'' He said that our candidate would be ``an \neffective voice for Kansas, a fine addition to your State delegation, \nwhich is already one of the best in the country,'' which I appreciated. \nBut I find nothing here that has anything to do with politics.\n  And then here is another one, ``Fundraiser for Taff Draws 500.'' From \nthe Kansas City Star, ``Cheney Talks Tough at Taff Fundraiser.'' But \nthe two things were separated. It was a very sobering discussion on the \npolicy of preemption and what we face in Iraq.\n  As a matter of fact, the Vice President, in a private session, said \nthe Congress ought to be asking tough questions, which we are, and \nurged bipartisan support. I heard every word. For the life of me, I \njust did not hear that kind of inference at all. I wanted to come to \nthe floor--I thank the Senator for yielding to me--to indicate that \nsimply was not the case. If we are into a situation where we are \ninferring we are trying to politicize this effort, that is not the case \nwith the Vice President. We can't be in the business of the security of \nthe American people and sending wrong messages to Saddam Hussein unless \nwe get the facts straight.\n  In doing that, I am not trying to perjure the intent or the concern \nof the distinguished majority leader. It just did not happen. I wanted \nto set the record straight.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate that from the Senator from Kansas. I know the \nmajority leader this morning a little bit later, in talking to \nreporters in response to a question, said he was relying upon the \nnewspaper accounts of what had been said. But I suggest that while that \nmight ordinarily be all right, the press can make mistakes, and when \nyou are accusing the President of politicizing a war effort, you better \nbe correct. We have gone back and actually looked at the stories, and \nthe Senator from Kansas makes a point, too. The Vice President is a \nvery careful person. He is not prone to politicizing things.\n  I will conclude by saying it is very important for us to keep our eye \non who the enemy is. The enemy is the terrorists. The enemy is Saddam \nHussein. The enemy for none of this is President Bush. I don't think we \nshould be raising questions or throwing around allegations that \nundercut what ought to be a common effort from everybody in this \ncountry as well as this body to ensure we have the kind of consensus \nthat will enable us to prosecute whatever war we prosecute in a way \nthat enjoys both support in the United States and abroad. The kind of \ntirade entered into here this morning undercuts that effort. It does \nnot assist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add 10 \nminutes to the time allocated to me under the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the \nLieberman homeland security bill, the Gramm-Miller amendment, and the \nNelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment to that amendment.\n  Before I do that, I will comment on the fact I am really disturbed at \nwhat I see going on here in the Senate in terms of the President of the \nUnited States. Our President has more on his plate than perhaps any \nPresident in my memory. He has the Middle East situation. I have been \nstudying that for 20 years. That is more fragile than I have ever seen \nit during my lifetime.\n  We are in Afghanistan. We have forgotten we are there. That is a \nmajor undertaking. We are trying to work diplomatically to make sure \nPakistan does not go after India and India after Pakistan, which could \nembroil us in a nuclear situation.\n  We have a problem with Saddam Hussein in Iraq. We have a domestic \neconomy in bad shape today. People in this country are losing faith in \nour financial markets. We are in a very fragile, shaky period.\n  What we should be doing in the Senate is rallying to the cause to try \nand be as supportive as we can of the President, who is trying to rally \nthe world and the United Nations and our allies in dealing in a \nresponsible way with Saddam Hussein, who has thumbed his nose at us for \nso many years and has set up a new paradigm in terms of the United \nNations where they will work together to make it very clear they will \nnot tolerate people such as Saddam Hussein.\n  I was going to say it is business as usual in the Senate; I just wish \nit were business as usual. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle will start to understand the American people are watching what we \nare doing here, and it is important that we behave in a way that gives \nthem confidence that we are more interested in moving our country ahead \nthan we are in partisan politics.\n\n\n                HUMAN CAPITAL AND THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, since my election to the Senate in \n1998, I have given top priority to a public policy issue that seldom \ngets the attention it deserves: The challenges of our Federal \nGovernment's civil service system.\n  For nearly 4 years, I have used my position as a member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and chairman and ranking member of the \nOversight of Government Management Subcommittee, to focus the spotlight \non this critically important issue. As I learned more about the \ncondition of our Federal Government's personnel system, it became \ncrystal clear we are in the midst of a human capital crisis in the \nUnited States Government, one which will only get worse unless this \nCongress acts decisively to address it.\n  What is it? Is it real? Why do we have it? The human capital crisis \nis, simply stated, the inability of the Federal Government to properly \nmanage its workforce. Robust personnel management includes the ability \nto recruit the best candidates, hire people in a timely manner, award \nperformance bonuses and other motivational tools to encourage \nretention, provide training and professional development opportunities, \nand the flexibility to shape a balanced workforce.\n  Good management includes the flexibility to act quickly and to \ncompete as an employer of choice in the fast-paced 21st century \nknowledge economy.\n  Unfortunately, at present, the Federal Government's ability to use \nsuch tools is not what it could be. By now, we have all heard the \nstatistics, and maybe some of my colleagues have not heard them. The \naverage Federal employee is 47 years old. By 2005, more than 50 percent \nof the 1.8 million person Federal workforce will be eligible for early \nor regular retirement.\n  Even more incredible is the fact that by 2005, 67 percent of the \nSenior Executive Service will be eligible for regular retirement, and \nan additional 21 percent will be able to retire early. This is an \nastounding 88 percent of our top-level workers, managers, department \nheads, and division chiefs.\n  I was talking to businesspeople this morning, and they said: \n``Explain to us what this is about.''\n  I said: ``Consider your own businesses. Say during the last 10 years \nyou were eliminating employees without any regard for how that would \naffect your mission, or how high-tech manufacturing and information \ntechnology has changed your business. Then imagine half the remaining \npeople working in your plant are going to retire soon. Then imagine \nthat about 88 percent of your top managers are going to retire also. \nWhere would you be today?'' They got it.\n  I remind my colleagues, this dire predicament refers to what could \nhappen in the next 2 to 3 years, but it is virtually impossible to \npredict accurately the amount of experience and institutional knowledge \nthat is literally going to walk out the door at the end of this decade.\n  Some may ask: Is the human capital situation really that important? \nIs it really a crisis in the Federal Government?\n  Consider some additional evidence we have learned from officials in \nsome of the agencies that handle national security and finances, such \nas the CIA, FBI, FEMA, Social Security Administration, and Department \nof Commerce.\n  CIA Director George Tenet, in recent congressional testimony, said \nwithin 3\n\n[[Page S9212]]\n\nyears, between 30 and 40 percent of his workforce will have been there \nfor less than 5 years.\n  According to a recent GAO report, more than 70 agencies have foreign \nlanguage needs, and staff shortages at those agencies, such as the FBI, \n``have adversely affected agency operations and hindered U.S. military, \nlaw enforcement, intelligence, counterterrorism, and diplomatic \nefforts.''\n  Mr. President, do you remember after 9/11? The call went out: We need \npeople who can speak Arabic and Farsi. Incredible. Ten years after the \nPersian Gulf war, we remain actively involved in the Middle East, yet \nwe do not have enough people who speak Farsi and Arabic in the FBI, the \nState Department, or the CIA.\n  At FEMA, retirements have accelerated since 9-11-2001 as employees \nhave reevaluated priorities, and nearly 50 percent of the remaining \nworkforce will be eligible for retirement in the next 18 months.\n  According to a recent Federal Times survey of more than 2,200 \nmanagers at our Social Security Administration, dramatic downsizing in \nthe ranks of managers and front-line employees has hurt training, \ncaused burnout, strained resources, reduced managers' effectiveness, \nand created disconnects between headquarters and field offices, all at \na time when the agency's workload is skyrocketing.\n  According to GAO, the Department of Commerce is unable to effectively \nmonitor U.S. trade laws with foreign countries due to a shortage of \nstaff with the right expertise.\n\n  Mr. President, the evidence is clear. The Federal Government has a \nserious human capital crisis. That is why I have sought information \nfrom some of the best minds in the country over the past few years in \npublic policy and management, and why I have spent so much time \nlistening to the people closest to the problem.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, I believe that if a Federal agency or \ndepartment is important enough to receive the hard-earned tax dollars \nof my constituents and yours, we have a moral responsibility to see to \nit that the people's money is spent wisely. Outdated personnel \npractices and lack of training not only put agencies at risk of not \nbeing able to fulfill their mission and provide needed services to the \nAmerican people, this also represents wasteful Federal spending. We \nsimply must provide the flexibility agencies need and give them the \nright tools to do their work.\n  I have sought to attract attention to this issue at every \nopportunity. My subcommittee held 10 hearings from July 1999 to March \nof 2002. Two of those hearings were held by Chairman Durbin, and I \nthank him for his willingness to work with me on this issue.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Akaka held 2 days of legislative hearings \non civil service reform. I also recognize his leadership and \npartnership on this issue. I sincerely appreciate their assistance in \nraising the profile of our pressing human capital challenges.\n  Also, in December of 2000, just before our new President took office, \nI released a comprehensive report on this subject ``The Report to the \nPresident: The Crisis in Human Capital'' which summarized our \nsubcommittee's activities during the 106th Congress and made \nrecommendations to the incoming administration on how to address the \nGovernment's human capital challenges.\n  Mr. President, I want you to know I have not been alone in my \nassessment of the situation. In 2001, Comptroller General of the United \nStates David Walker designated human capital on the General Accounting \nOffice's ``High-Risk List.'' In the past, other areas that were on the \nlist, such as the Y2K problem, the 2000 census, the Superfund Program, \nand the Department of Agriculture's farm loan programs, received \nattention and priority, and they no longer threaten the operations of \nthe Federal Government. As Congress did with these issues, we must \nprioritize human capital; otherwise, this crisis will persist.\n  Dr. Joseph Nye, Dean of Harvard University's Kennedy School of \nGovernment, one of the top public policy schools in the Nation, also \nidentified the Federal Government's human capital crisis as a critical \nissue. The problem truly hit home for his academic institution. During \nthe nineties, increasing numbers of Kennedy School graduates, despite \ntheir top-notch graduate level training in public policy, chose \nemployment in the private and nonprofit sectors rather than work for \nthe Federal Government.\n  Dr. Nye noted he did not want the Kennedy School to be known as the \nsecond best business school in Cambridge! As a result, he organized a \nseries of executive sessions during the 2001-2002 academic year, \nbringing together approximately 30 leaders on human capital management \nfrom the public, private, and nonprofit sectors: For example, \nprofessors from Harvard, Stanford, Wharton, CEOs, and former senior \nofficials at the Departments of Treasury, Labor, Office of Federal \nProcurement Policy, and Office of Management and Budget. I attended \nthree of the four sessions and found them productive and insightful.\n  In addition, the U.S. Commission on National Security in the 21st \nCentury, a bipartisan group chaired by former Senators Gary Hart and \nWarren Rudman, released a series of reports providing a comprehensive \nevaluation of our national security posture.\n  We have been talking a lot about national security, haven't we? Their \nreports included many recommendations on homeland security which we are \nconsidering in this bill that is before the Senate. The Commission's \nfinal report concluded as follows:\n\n       As it enters the 21st century, the United States finds \n     itself on the brink of an unprecedented crisis of competence \n     in Government.\n\n  Unprecedented crisis.\n\n       The maintenance of American power in the world depends on \n     the quality of the U.S. Government's personnel, civil and \n     military, at all levels. We must take immediate action in the \n     personnel area to ensure the United States can meet future \n     challenges.\n\n  Furthermore, in his testimony before our committee, former Defense \nSecretary and member of the Commission James Schlesinger added:\n\n       It is the Commission's view that fixing the personnel \n     problem is a precondition for fixing virtually everything \n     else that needs repair in the institutional edifice of U.S. \n     national security policy.\n\n  Mr. President, yet another poignant illustration was offered by FEMA \nDirector Joe Allbaugh when he testified before a Senate committee \nearlier this year. I note FEMA is one of the key agencies in the \nproposed Homeland Security Department. In describing his workforce \nneeds, Director Allbaugh said:\n  We have not been spending enough time internally on our employees. \nBefore 9/11, retention was a problem and there was essentially no \nrecruitment. Over the next 18 months, nearly 50 percent of our agency \nis eligible for retirement, and since 9/11, retirements have \naccelerated. The people who worked at Ground Zero came to my office \nwith a different perspective on life. They want to spend more time with \ntheir kids, grandkids, and spouses.\n  I think these comments represent the feelings of many Federal \nemployees, and Director Allbaugh's testimony calls attention not only \nto the urgent need for reform of our civil service laws, but also for a \ncompletely new mindset for considering the Federal Government's \npersonnel requirements and workforce culture.\n  Mr. President, if that is not a compelling call to address this \nissue, I do not know what is. Despite all the evidence that significant \nhuman capital challenges exist in the Federal Government, this issue \nhas not received the attention it deserves. To its credit, the Bush \nadministration has taken steps to raise the profile of this issue. In \nfact, strategic human capital management is one of the five \ngovernmentwide issues targeted for reform in the President's management \nagenda, which was released in August of 2001.\n  Having recently marked the 1-year anniversary of the horrendous and \nunprecedented terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, \nthe Senate is considering legislation designed to reorganize our \nFederal Government in a way that will help our Nation prevent future \nsuch attacks.\n  Suddenly, in the context of this debate, civil service reform is the \nissue du jour. It is an issue which for years has not been \nsubstantively addressed except when agencies become dysfunctional. It \nis now front and center in the consideration of the most important\n\n[[Page S9213]]\n\nGovernment reorganization to take place in our Nation in half a \ncentury. It is about time.\n  In the debate over homeland security, we have backed into this \npersonnel issue that has demanded attention for so many years. At least \nwe are finally taking the first step to address the problem by having a \ndebate on the subject. We are talking about personnel practices and the \npeople who make a difference for the Government and deliver the \nservices.\n  Unfortunately, however, this debate is limited to the proposed \nDepartment and not to the needs of the entire Federal Government. The \nentire Federal Government needs new flexibilities. Congress last \nenacted major civil service legislation for the entire Federal \nGovernment 24 years ago in 1978. In today's fast-paced, high-tech \nworld, the 1970s represent almost prehistoric times when people were \nstill using typewriters and the only computers were mainframes. To \noperate effectively, the Federal Government cannot afford to revise its \npersonnel laws only every quarter or half century. The basic \nclassification and compensation system for the Federal Government dates \nback to World War II, when the professionals in the civil service had \njobs as clerks and typists and were at GS levels 2 and 3. Today's civil \nservice professionals are typically GS-12s and GS-13s. So much has \nchanged over the years, and changing times require new thinking and new \nlaws--policies that allow flexibility in our Federal Government \ncivil service system.\n\n  The intellectual basis for one of the areas I have sought to reform, \ncompetitive hiring, dates back to the Grant administration! Back then, \nour soldiers were using single-shot, repeating rifles, the telegraph \nwas cutting-edge communications technology, and the primary mode of \ntransportation was the horse! That was when we started the ``rule of \nthree.''\n  I know of no successful business anywhere in the world that is using \na personnel system based on management theory that is more than 50 \nyears old, or which dates from the Industrial Age.\n  During the 107th Congress, I have worked with some of the Nation's \npremier experts on public management to determine what new \nflexibilities are necessary to create a world-class 21st century \nworkforce, and to draft legislation based on their insights. These \nindividuals include some of our colleagues in Congress, including \nSenator Akaka; officials of the Bush administration such as OPM \nDirector Kay Coles James; former OMB Director Sean O'Keefe, who now \nheads up NASA; Clinton administration appointees who spent a lot of \ntime on this, including Steve Kelman, the former Administrator of the \nOffice of Federal Procurement Policy; and Elaine Kamarck, a domestic \npolicy adviser to then-Vice President Gore--this is a bipartisan \neffort; Federal employee unions such as the American Federation of \nGovernment Employees, with their president, Bobby Harnage, and the \nNational Treasury Employees Union, NTEU, and their president, Colleen \nKelley; representatives of public policy organizations such as the \nCouncil for Excellence in Government, Partnership for Public Service, \nPrivate Sector Council, Brookings Institution, National Academy of \nPublic Administration, and the Volcker Commission; and subject experts \nin some of our country's top educational institutions, including Dr. \nJack Donahue of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.\n  I was especially attentive to the concerns of unions, making several \nsignificant changes to my draft legislation since last summer to allay \ntheir uneasiness with some of its flexibilities. I felt it was \nimportant. As someone who dealt with 25 unions when I was mayor, and \nwith 5 unions when I was governor, I know it is important that unions \nbe at the table and that their input be taken into consideration.\n  We made changes that include new language to clarify that the intent \nof my proposed early retirement and buy-out authority is workforce \nreshaping, not the downsizing of the 90s; as well as the revision of \nremoval of provisions that enjoyed strong support from other \nstakeholders, including the establishment of a public/private exchange \nprogram to cross-pollinate good management ideas between sectors of the \neconomy.\n  In other words, we tried to accommodate the concerns of our union \nrepresentatives.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I note that my bill was the subject of a \nletter to Chairman Lieberman and other members of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, a letter of support for the legislation was signed \nby 29 Kennedy School executive session participants. By combining my \nreform proposals with those of the administration, both of which I \nintroduced last fall, I was able to develop a package of consensus \nhuman capital reforms that I believe will have a positive impact on the \nFederal Government's personnel management.\n  On June 20, along with Senators Thompson and Cochran, I introduced \nthat consolidated bill, S. 2651, the Federal Workforce Improvement Act, \na measure that is designed to get the right people with the right \nskills in the right jobs at the right time.\n  In July, during its consideration by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, working with Senator Akaka, I successfully amended key \nprovisions of this bill to the homeland security legislation, and I \nreally appreciate the bipartisan support we received for those changes. \nI am grateful to Senator Akaka for that. I only wish we had put more of \nS. 2651 into the homeland security bill.\n  I hope as we wrap up homeland security--at least I hope we wrap it \nup, my colleagues will conclude we should adopt the rest of the \nprovisions of S. 2651 in this important legislation.\n  Let us get it done all at once. The provisions we have already \nincluded will have an impact not only on the new Department but on all \nFederal agencies. The Voinovich-Akaka language will help the Federal \nGovernment begin to address its human capital challenges, challenges \nthat extend far beyond the corridors of the proposed Department of \nHomeland Security. These flexibilities are not as comprehensive as what \nwe were proposing for the new Department, but they represent a good \nstart on the path of reform in this critical area that has not received \nadequate attention by past administrations or Congress.\n  It does the following: Creates Chief Human Capital Officers at the \nFederal Government's 24 largest departments and agencies, officials who \nhave responsibility for selecting, developing, training and managing a \nhigh-quality workforce; establishes an Interagency Chief Human Capital \nOfficers Council chaired by the OPM Director, to advise and coordinate \nthe personnel functions of each agency and meet with union \nrepresentatives at least annually; requires OPM to design a set of \nsystems, including metrics, for assessing agencies' human capital \nmanagement, something that has been largely ignored; reforms the \ncompetitive service hiring process, allowing agencies, consistent with \nmerit principles, to use an alternative category ranking method for \nselecting new employees instead of the ``Rule of 3,'' making the \nprocess more efficient and fair, a practice that has been very \nsuccessful at the Department of Agriculture for the past decade; \nprovides governmentwide authority for offering voluntary separation \nincentive payments and voluntary early retirement, buyouts and early-\nouts, for the purposes of workforce reshaping, not downsizing. This \nauthority, which I was able to secure with legislation 3 years ago, is \ncurrently being used effectively on a limited basis for civilian \nemployees at the Department of Defense.\n  It also lifts the total annual compensation cap for senior \nexecutives, allowing performance bonuses to be paid in full in a single \nyear; and it reduces restrictions on providing academic degree training \nto federal employees, thereby emphasizing the importance of individual \nprofessional development.\n  In light of the fact that there has not been government-wide civil \nservice reform in a quarter century and, as the Hart-Rudman Commission \nnoted, personnel is the basis for maintaining national security, it is \nabsolutely appropriate that this legislation be included in the bill to \ncreate the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I thank Senators Gramm and Miller of their willingness to consider my \nproposals which represent extensive efforts to address the Federal \nGovernment's personnel challenges during my 4 years in the Senate, and \nfor including the Voinovich-Akaka language in their substitute \namendment. I believe it is a\n\n[[Page S9214]]\n\nstrong addition that also has the administration's support.\n  As I said, I hope we'll be able to add the balance of S. 2651 to the \nhomeland security bill before we conclude this debate, because these \nreforms are badly needed.\n  The Homeland Security Department is not the first, and not the last, \nagency that needs to have greater flexibility. Even more comprehensive \nflexibilities and reforms, similar to those proposed in the Gramm-\nMiller substitute for the Department of Homeland Security, which I will \ndescribe in a moment, are needed at other agencies as well, including \nthe Department of Defense and NASA. These agencies may provide the \nimpetus for Congress to return to this issue next year.\n  In fact I asked Senator Warner and Senator Levin, when they were \nconsidering the Defense Authorization bill, to give consideration to \naccepting some personnel flexibilities that the Department of Defense \nwanted. I know from Secretary Rumsfield that they will be coming back \nasking for those flexibilities.\n  It is my hope that the incremental provisions I have developed with \nmy colleagues and a diverse group of stakeholders over the course of \nthe last year will assist the rest of the federal government while we \nconsider next steps.\n  I would like to take a few moments now to discuss the personnel \nprovisions in the Gramm-Miller substitute that apply specifically to \nthe new department. I have worked with Senators Gramm and Miller on \nthese provisions and believe this language will provide the Department \nwith the tools it needs to get the job done, and at the same time \nrespects the rights of those union workers being transferred into the \nnew department.\n  I say this because I am close to the leadership in both of our major \nunions. They have some concerns. I tried to get the administration to \nsign an Executive order continuing partnerships between unions and the \nFederal Government. Unfortunately, this did not happen. The \nadministration also included competitive sourcing on the President's \nManagement Agenda, setting targets that each department had to meet in \norder to receive a green light on the Management Scorecard. I said, if \nyou tell an agency head that he must outsource 10 percent, 15 percent, \n20 percent--instead of trying to shape his department with the people \nhe has and give them training, he will spend all his time figuring out \nhow he is going to outsource those jobs.\n  The proposed Department of Homeland Security will merge nearly \n170,000 employees from more than 20 Federal agencies. This is a \nmomentous undertaking. Although the creation of the Department of \nDefense in 1947 combined a larger number of civilian and military \nemployees, the consolidation we are now contemplating would require \nmore than a score of different workplace cultures and personnel systems \nto be effectively harmonized, all while the Nation entrusts this new \ndepartment with the one of Federal Government's most urgent and \nimportant missions: to preserve the homeland and protect American \ncitizens from harm. In order to accomplish this very tall order, the \nPresident and the new Secretary of Homeland Security will need new \nflexibility, and I believe Congress should authorize it.\n  In recent years, however, Congress has engaged in management by \nscandal, only granting more flexibilities when agencies under-perform! \nFor example, the FAA, IRS and SEC each received special personnel \nauthorities over the last decade, but only after each of these agencies \nwas singled out for its failure to achieve its mission.\n  The Bush Administration has correctly pointed out that we cannot wait \nfor a similar occurrence at the Department of Homeland Security, and it \nhas justifiably sought broad flexibility for the new department before \nany mission failures occur.\n  On a related matter, Mr. President, it is interesting to note that \nthe recommendations of the Hart-Rudman Commission form the intellectual \nbasis for large portions of the underlying legislation we are debating \ntoday. Yet, while we are paying close attention to the Commission's \nrecommendation to establish a new Department of Homeland Security, we \nare not seriously considering its recommendations to modernize the \ncivil service system. We simply must take these necessary steps now.\n  The personnel provisions in the Gramm-Miller substitute represent a \ngood-faith effort to modernize the personnel system for the new \ndepartment.\n  The Quinn-Portman amendment would preserve employee rights, including \nhiring and promotion based on merit and equal pay for equal work, and \nwould protect employees from improper political influence and reprisal \nfor whistle-blowing. Employees would still be protected from prohibited \npersonnel practices, such as illegal discrimination, politicization of \nthe hiring or promotion processes, and violation of veterans' \npreference requirements. I notice my friend, Senator Akaka  was talking \nabout the fact that whistle blowing is not involved in the amendment. \nWe specifically talk about protection of employees against reprisal for \nwhistle blowing.\n  Furthermore, employees would still have the right to organize, \nbargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations of \ntheir own choosing in decisions that affect them.\n  First, the substitute features House-passed language proposed by \nRepresentatives Jack Quinn and Rob Portman. In June, the President sent \nto Congress a blueprint for the personnel system he envisioned at the \nnew department. The President realized that Congress would flesh out \nmany of the issues in his proposal, and that is just what happened. The \nHouse-passed version is less flexible than what the Administration \noriginally requested--it is really important to understand that--but it \nis designed to deal with the personnel flexibility sought by the \nPresident, and to address the collective bargaining rights that many of \nour colleagues seek to protect.\n  The Quinn-Portman amendment retains most of title V's provisions. \nThis is not as broad as Transportation Security Administration to which \nCongress gave blanket exemptions from title V last November.\n  The language also requires that the new department collaborate with \nunions and other employee organizations in creating its personnel \nsystem. In addition, it includes procedures to ensure that exclusive \nbargaining units are represented by individuals designated by the union \nitself. It also provides certain safeguards for employees as the \nproposed department develops a new system for employee appeals.\n  In order to ensure that the new human resources management system is \ndeveloped in collaboration with the unions, the Quinn-Portman amendment \nprovides for direct involvement by employee representatives in three \nstages of the development process.\n  In the first stage, as the human resources management system is being \ndesigned, the Secretary and OPM Director must provide a written \ndescription of the proposed system or adjustment to the system; allow \neach employee representative at least 60 days to review and make \nrecommendations on the proposal; and give any such recommendations full \nand fair consideration in deciding whether or how to proceed with the \nproposal.\n  At the second stage, when the Secretary and OPM Director decide to \nimplement a human resources management proposal, they must, prior to \nimplementation: give each employee representative details of the \ndecision along with information upon which the decision was based; give \neach employee representative an opportunity to make recommendations; \nand give such recommendations full and fair consideration. If any \nemployee representatives' recommendations are not proposed to be \nimplemented, the Secretary and Director must explain why.\n  During the third stage, once a human resource management system \nproposal is implemented, the Secretary and OPM Director must develop a \nmethod for each employee representative to participate in any further \nplanning or development.\n  The Quinn-Portman amendment also fleshes out the Administration's \noriginal proposal by providing necessary flexibilities in six key \nareas: performance appraisals, classification, pay rates and systems, \nlabor-management relations, adverse actions, and appeals. Each of these \nareas would be open to modernization, subject to the explicit \nlimitations included in the language to protect employees, which, as I \nhave\n\n[[Page S9215]]\n\njust delineated, are comprehensive, and rooted in current civil service \nlaw.\n  We currently have pending a second-degree amendment to the Gramm-\nMiller amendment from Senators Ben Nelson, Chafee and Breaux.\n  They would like to reduce the six areas of flexibility to four. I \nhappen to believe that the administration, in order to create this new \nDepartment, is going to need those six areas of flexibility to get the \njob done.\n  Based on my experience as mayor and Governor, I thought it also would \nbe a good idea to have the Secretary negotiate as opposed to consult \nwith union representatives in the six areas in which the administration \nis seeking flexibility. My belief in that regard comes about as a \nresult of my experience over the years. In other words, after the \nconsultation and the negotiation occurred, there would be an impasse \npanel that could be appealed to for a final decision.\n  I thought that would be helpful because it would make the negotiation \nmore robust and there would be fewer areas of disagreement. Once it was \nover, the parties could say the matter was taken to a third party and \ndecided. That is the way it should be decided.\n  In other words, and I want to point out to my colleagues, the success \nor failure of the administration to get the job done is going to depend \non the relationship they develop with our labor unions and other \nFederal employee organizations. If there is consensus, if there is \nopenness and a sense of fairness, this will be a great success. On the \ncontrary, if it is an adversarial relationship, one that is not open, \none where we don't have the discourse that we need, it will be a \nfailure.\n  I have reorganized as Governor. I have combined departments as \nGovernor. And I have found that the only way you can be successful is \nto work with organized labor on a consensus basis and work things out. \nWithout working things out, it will not be a success. I have brought \nthis to the attention of the administration several times. I am \nconfident that with the process that is in the Gramm-Miller amendment, \nthe process will be open and fair.\n  I have talked to Kay Coles James, Director of the Office of Personnel \nManagement; I have talked to Mark Everson, Deputy Director for \nManagement at OMB, and many other people. They understand that they \nhave to build trust with the unions if they expect to have a successful \nDepartment. If they don't work together and achieve a consensus, we are \nin big trouble.\n  Finally, the Gramm-Miller substitute includes the House-passed \nlanguage proposed by Representatives Connie Morella and Chris Shays--\nwith an additional provision that I have recommended. This language \nwould, for the first time, limit the current authority of the President \nto exclude an agency or agency subdivision from participation in a \ncollective bargaining unit.\n  Under current law, the President may exclude participation in a \ncollective bargaining unit upon determining that the entity has as a \nprimary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or \nnational security work and that permitting the entity to have union \norganizations would be inconsistent with national security requirements \nand considerations.\n  Under current law, the President may exclude participation in a \ncollective bargaining unit upon determining that the entity has a \nprimary function of intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or \nnational security work, and that permitting the entity to have union \norganization would be inconsistent with national security requirements \nand considerations.\n  I want to make this clear to my colleagues.\n  The Morella-Shays language would limit the President's current \nauthority only with regard to the new department. It would prohibit the \nPresident from using the exclusionary authority unless the mission and \nresponsibilities of a transferred agency materially change and a \nmajority of the employees within such an agency have as their primary \nduty intelligence, counterintelligence, or investigative work directly \nrelated to terrorism.\n  The language does provide, however, that the President could waive \nthe above limitations on his authority if he determines in writing that \ntheir use would have a substantial adverse impact on the department's \nability to protect homeland security.\n  Senators Gramm and Miller have agreed to add language that I proposed \nrequiring that, when the President executes his authority under the \nMorella-Shays language, he must notify Congress of the reasons for his \ndetermination at least 10 days prior to the issuance of his written \norder.\n  What our unions are worried about is arbitrary and capricious action \non the part of the President exempting members from membership in their \nunions.\n  This language basically says that we, for the first time, in the \nHomeland Security Department, will limit that power of the President, \nand if he exercises it under Morella-Shays, it means his decisionmaking \nwill be subject to a filing in Federal court as to whether he has \nabused his discretion in exercising that power.\n  This is very important. If he decides to waive it and says, no, I \ndon't want to do it by Morella-Shays, I want to go ahead and exercise \nmy power, that basically says the President has to put it in writing, \nand send it to Congress. The unions will see it, the majority will see \nit, the minority will see it, the media will see it, and public \npersonnel experts will see it. I have tried to convince some of my \ncolleagues that this process is open to public scrutiny.\n  I have to say to my colleagues, how can you ask this President of the \nUnited States--at a time when we have a national security crisis--to \ngive up the same authority held by all other Presidents since 1962--\nwhen we create this new Department of Homeland Security?\n  The fact that this administration has agreed to set up criteria and \nlimit the President's authority to certain specific reasons for \nexercising it--to then say to the President, by the way, you can't do \nthat now. To say, 'you have to send it to Congress 10 days in advance' \nis more than enough limitation on this historic executive authority. I \nsay to my friends on the other side of the aisle, I say to my friends \nin the unions, that, first of all, I don't believe this President is \nanti-labor or trying to short-change or treat our employees improperly.\n  Second of all, even if he thought of doing something like that, or \nsomebody recommended it, he would have to explain the rationale in \nwriting, and allow it to be held up to public scrutiny 10 days prior to \nhis order taking effect.\n  Mr. President, I have been one of the leaders on civil service reform \nduring the last two sessions of Congress. I believe I have probably \ndedicated more time than any Senator to addressing the Federal \nGovernment's personnel interests. I have tried to raise the profile of \nthis issue and then work in good faith with all interested parties to \ndevelop solutions. Based on my work, I want my colleagues to know I \nbelieve the personnel provisions in the Gramm-Miller substitute can go \na long way towards putting personnel management in the executive branch \nback on track.\n  I just hope that somehow in the next couple of days we can work \nsomething out on both sides of the aisle so that people feel \ncomfortable that we can protect the rights of organized labor and at \nthe same time give the President of the United States the authority and \nthe flexibilities he needs to get the job done.\n  I hope that after this debate is over, the well is not so poisoned \nthat when the administration and the unions begin to sit down and talk \nwith each other, they can work together to arrive at a consensus so \nthat this reorganization can be successful and fruitful, and we can \nachieve what we all want to achieve to secure our homeland.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Ohio, who I think is \nsuch a good legislator--\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Could the Senator speak a little louder? I am wearing \na hearing aid.\n  Mr. REID. I was saying nice things about the Senator. I will be happy \nto speak louder.\n  I was telling my friend from Ohio, who is such a good legislator, I \nwould like to at a subsequent time today make a unanimous consent \nrequest that we vote on cloture on Gramm-Miller tomorrow. It is now set \nfor Friday.\n\n[[Page S9216]]\n\nWe want to move this legislation along. I think that is what we need to \ndo.\n  The Senator doesn't need to respond to that at all. I just wanted to \nlet him know that we hope to work something out in the next couple of \ndays. I hope we can work something out tomorrow. We want to move this \nlegislation along.\n  I have to say this: Having been on this bill for the fourth week, I \nam concerned that maybe people down on Pennsylvania Avenue don't want \nthis bill. We have done everything we can to move this legislation. It \ndoesn't appear that people on the other side of the aisle want it \nmoved.\n  For example, Senator Byrd's amendment was pending for several days. \nAt any time, Senator Byrd's amendment was subject to a motion to table. \nEveryone knew there were enough votes to table that amendment. But for \ndays, the minority chose not to do that.\n\n  So I hope that I am wrong. I hope that I am wrong. I hope that there \nare as many on your side of the aisle as on our side of aisle who want \nthis legislation to pass. But I have the feeling now, I say to my \nfriend from Ohio, is that the minority does not want to move the \nhomeland security bill.\n  We will see in the next----\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I beg to differ \nwith the Senator from Nevada. We do want to move forward with this \nhomeland security bill. We do want it to pass. We know how necessary it \nis for the President to have this new Department, with the flexibility \nhe needs to merge more than 20 agencies.\n  From my perspective, I cannot figure out why the Majority has been \nfiling cloture motions on some of these amendments, when I think they \ncould make a motion to table instead. I am still trying to figure that \nout. I may need to get the Parliamentarian to explain what this is all \nabout.\n  But I can assure you, that after the time I have spent on this issue \nwith many of my colleagues, including many on the other side of the \naisle, we want this to move forward.\n  We would like to have a vote up or down on the President's amended \nproposal, which is contained in the Gramm-Miller amendment. We would \nlike to have a vote on the recommendations from Senators Nelson, \nBreaux, and Chafee, and see where the Senate stands on that amendment.\n  We have to move this along. We cannot go home, I think, without \ngetting this done. I know this has gotten to be pretty partisan. But I \nhonestly believe that if we can sit down and start talking about some \nof this a little bit more, we could work something out and move ahead.\n  I assure the distinguished Senator from Nevada that we are not \ndelaying this. We want to move forward. And I will certainly do \nanything I can to help cooperate in this regard.\n  But we want a vote on the Gramm-Miller amendment. We also want a vote \non the amendment of Senators Nelson and Chafee and Breaux.\n  Mr. REID. I would simply say--the majority leader is here, and I \ndon't want to take a lot of time--the majority of the Senators over \nhere want a bill. I am confident a majority of the Senators want a \nbill. This is the fourth week we have tried to do it.\n  We are trying very hard. We should be able to do it. It appears to me \nthat some people cannot take yes for an answer. We are willing to give \na vote on the amendment offered by the Senator from Texas, but he says \nhe does not want a vote unless he can have the first vote. It is just a \nlot of what appears to me, and I am sure to the people in Nevada and \nthe public, to be a lot of silliness.\n  We want to move forward with this legislation. As the Senator from \nOhio has said, you want it passed. We want it passed. Hopefully, we can \ndo something. But it appears we are not getting impetus from the \nleadership on your side of the aisle and the White House to get this \ndone.\n  I am sorry to have taken the leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Who controls the \nfloor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nobody controls the floor at this time.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I do not want to interrupt the statement \nof the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I don't see anybody else seeking \nrecognition on my side of the aisle. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I came to the floor for a couple of \nreasons. One was to reiterate what I think I heard the assistant \nDemocratic leader say with regard to our desire to have a vote. As we \nhave indicated publicly and privately, we are prepared for an up-or-\ndown vote. We want a vote on the Nelson-Breaux amendment. And once that \nvote is taken, we are more than willing to vote on the Gramm amendment. \nSo there should be no question about that.\n  I think I heard the Senator from Nevada say that there are some who \ncannot take yes for an answer. We are prepared to offer that vote any \ntime. I would hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwould take our offer in the manner in which it was intended. We hope to \nhave a vote up or down on that particular amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/25/senate-section/article/S9216-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9216-S9218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NO ``CONTEXT'' JUSTIFIES QUESTIONING THE PATRIOTISM OF OTHERS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the other matter I wanted to come to the \nfloor to discuss is the reaction to some of the comments that I made \nthis morning.\n  A number of our colleagues have come to the floor and, as I \nunderstand it, the administration has stated that if I had understood \nthe context in which the President made those remarks--the remarks that \nSenate Democrats are not concerned about national security--that I \nprobably would not have been so critical. In fact, they criticized me \nfor having criticized the President.\n  Mr. President, what context is there that legitimizes an accusation \nof that kind? I don't care whether you are talking about homeland \nsecurity, I don't think you can talk about Iraq, you can't talk about \nwar, you can't talk about any context that justifies a political \ncomment like that.\n  This is politicization, pure and simple. I meant it this morning and \nI mean it now. I don't know what may have motivated those in the White \nHouse to make the decision to politicize this debate, but it has to \nstop. There is no context within which anybody can make that accusation \nabout people on this side of the aisle on an issue relating to homeland \nsecurity, or Iraq, or defense, or anything else.\n  So let's get that straight. I would hope that we can finally bring \nthis debate to a level that it deserves.\n  I can recall in 1991 and 1992--especially in 1992--when President \nBush made the decision he did. I can recall several of my staff coming \nto me, suggesting that we say this or that. But never once did I have \nsomeone on my staff, someone here in the Senate, refer to the politics \nof the war with Iraq.\n  I remember sitting at my desk, handwriting my speech, explaining to \nmy people in South Dakota, and to whomever else might be listening, why \nI made the decision I did. I did not make that decision for political \nreasons. And I don't think there is a person in this Chamber who did.\n  We need that same level of debate this time if we are going to have a \ndebate, if we are going to do it this close to an election.\n  So I want all the apologies at the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue, \nall of these explanations about ``context'' to be taken for what they \nare worth. They are not worth the paper they are printed on.\n  The time has come for us to quit the explanations, to quit the \nrationalizations, to quit the politicization, and do what we should do \nas Americans: Make our statement, make our judgment, have a debate, and \nsend as clear a message to Saddam Hussein as we can. We are not going \nto tolerate his actions. And we, as a country, will build on a \ncoalition to do the right thing.\n\n  I hope this will be the last word. I look forward to talking directly \nwith those in the White House, those on this side of the aisle, as we \nfashion our response, as we take this matter as seriously as we should, \nas we do it in a way that lives up to the expectations of the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n[[Page S9217]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in many ways, this has been a very hard \nday. I thank the majority leader of the Senate, Tom Daschle, for the \nremarks he just made and for the remarks he made earlier today. He \nactually spoke in defense of the Senate.\n  Anyone who knows Tom Daschle--and I think most people around here \ndo--knows that Tom Daschle is a very soft spoken man. They know that \nTom Daschle does not rise to anger or fights, if ever, very often. \nTherefore, one has to really look at why this occurred.\n  In my mind, this is not an isolated example of what has been \nhappening. It is a continuum of what has been happening, starting with \nAndrew Card, the President's chief of staff, who, when asked, why \ndidn't you start discussing this this summer, if you were ready to move \nsuch a resolution in October or September, answered, in essence: You \ndon't roll out a new product in the summer.\n  This kind of thing just seems to continue. We have the Vice President \ncampaigning and essentially saying to the campaigns of the Republican \ncandidates: Gee, we really need you because the Democrats won't help \nour war effort.\n  I don't know where this President has been, but I have heard many \nDemocrats, including, for example, the individual presiding in the \nchair, indicating their support. We are an umbrella party. We do \nrepresent different views. Frankly, it makes our party stronger. \nEveryone wants to go after Saddam Hussein. Everyone wants to get rid of \nthose weapons of mass destruction. We may have a different path to get \nthere. Some of us may want to go it alone and give the President the \nauthority he asks for. Some may want to go with our allies. Some may \nwant to see more U.N. resolutions, as the British have said they want.\n  The bottom line is, this makes us a strong party. Frankly, it makes \nus a strong Nation. I have heard members of the President's party \nexpress some concerns.\n  What Tom Daschle did was essentially come to the floor and defend the \nhonor of the Senate and this democracy. Why did he have to do it? In \ntoday's paper, and also on television, we have seen this quote \nreiterated over and over. We have the President of the United States \nsaying that the Senate is ``not interested in the security of the \nAmerican people.''\n  I know of no one in the Senate, Republican or Democrat, who has slept \nwell after 9/11. I know of no colleague on either side who doesn't \nthink about it every day: How do we protect our people; how do we make \nthe airlines safer; how do we protect this country from chemical \nwarfare; how do we protect ourselves from a possible smallpox epidemic; \nhow do we protect our nuclear powerplants; how do we protect our people \nnight, day, in the air, on the ground? I don't know many Members in \nthis Chamber on either side who have ever slept as well as they did \nbefore 9/11, who don't wake up in the middle of the night thinking \nabout it or turn on the radio at 6 or 7 a.m. and pray that there isn't \nsomething there.\n  This kind of statement, that the Senate ``is not interested in the \nsecurity of the American people,'' is very hurtful. It is hurtful to \nthis institution. It is hurtful to our democracy. It is, in particular, \nvery hurtful because I have talked to my colleagues who served in \nVietnam or who served in World War II or even some in Korea. Nobody \nasks in the military, Are you registered Democrat or Republican?\n  This is a horrible turn of events. If we don't express ourselves, it \nis dangerous for our country to put partisanship ahead of being unified \nas a nation, standing for the rule of law, for free debate, for \ndiscussion, for tough debate. That is good for this country. We have a \nlot of points of view out there. Everyone in this country needs to know \nthat somehow, some way, somewhere their voice is being heard, not being \nstifled. Because if you dare to say something that questions anything, \nwhether it is this homeland bill, which is a major reshuffling, the \nbiggest reshuffling of the Federal Government in many years, since the \ncreation of the Department of Defense, if you dare say, are we doing \nthe right thing, are we taking our time, if you dare say that, you will \nfind yourself being criticized in the middle of a campaign.\n  That isn't right. Of course, we will disagree on certain issues. That \nis the strength of this Nation. People died for that right. When \nSenator Daschle came down here and said he thought it was important to \nget an apology, I believed that apology should have been given. Not \nsaying, well, we didn't mean this had to do with Iraq. It had to do \nwith something else.\n  The statement stands on its own--it could be applied to anything--\n``the Senate is not interested in the security of the American \npeople.'' That is why Senator Daschle came to the floor. That is why \nSenator Daschle for a moment even lost his voice, because he was so \nfilled with emotion.\n  He looked behind him at Senator Inouye who lost a limb in World War \nII. He thought of other colleagues who lost their limbs fighting for \nthis country, who faced the posttraumatic stress of Vietnam, who came \nhome and had to deal with that. Are the Vietnam vets Democrats? Are \nthey Republicans? Are they Independents? I can't tell you that. But \nsome of them are homeless. We need to stand united because they faced a \nwar at a time that our country was divided. We need to make sure we \ngive full debate, not some open-ended resolution.\n  I sat through a hearing today at the Foreign Relations Committee. It \nwas a very important hearing. We had Ambassador Holbrooke there and \nRobert McFarlane. We had a Democrat and a Republican. We had a very \nimportant debate.\n  Many different viewpoints were reflected on both sides of the aisle. \nSome were saying: We are ready. They were ready to give the President \nwhatever he needed, whatever he wanted, now, ready, today, go. Others \non both sides of the aisle said, as I said: Where are our allies? Would \nwe be in better shape to go in after another U.N. resolution? I asked: \nIs there a path to peace? Is there some way we can avoid the bloody war \nthat may ensue? Is there a path to that peace? Let's talk about it. If \nwe must have a war, what is this President's intention following that \nwar? These are important questions.\n  One question that never was raised by anyone in that committee was: \nIs anyone on this committee motivated by anything other than patriotism \nand wanting to do what is right for this country, whether they support \nthe resolution or they do not; whether they support the resolution of \nthe White House or a resolution that may be written by some other \nRepublican or Democrat? No one ever suggested that anyone of either \nparty sitting in that hearing did not have the best motivation at heart \nfor our country.\n  It is extremely disheartening when we hear the statement of Andrew \nCard that basically says: We did not want to roll out our new product--\nmeaning resolution--in the summer, talking about it as if it was \ntoothpaste or a new car. It is about life and death.\n  If anyone says: Excuse me, what is it going to cost us in lives, in \nblood, in treasure, that person ought to be respected, not told they do \nnot believe in the security of the people, whether it is questioning \nthe homeland security bill or maybe a better way to do that or \nquestioning an open-ended, blank-check resolution which I think has \ncome over and I personally cannot support. The people in my State are \ntelling me they do not want me to support it. They do not want me or \nSenator Daschle to come here and not speak what is in our hearts, in \nour souls, in our minds.\n  Senator Daschle did a very brave thing today. He did something I \nbelieve we do not see often enough in politics today. He spoke from his \nheart. He spoke the truth, unvarnished. He did not go through a \ncommittee. He did not bring it to a political adviser.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the junior Senator from California for her \nremarks which I think are right on point.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator a couple questions. \nFirst, she was there, as I recall, as I was, when Senator Daschle came \ninto our meeting this morning--there were maybe seven or eight \nSenators--and read the remarks. All of us were stunned and furious. We \nwere just so upset that not a policy debate but, rather, a sort of \nbelow-the-belt hit was being made not only by political operatives but \nby the President himself when he said people are not for national \nsecurity.\n\n[[Page S9218]]\n\n  I have been asked by reporters: Was this a calculated move?\n  I said: No; you should have been there and just seen the reaction.\n  I remember the junior Senator from California, the senior Senator \nfrom New York, and some others of us urged him to go to the floor and \nto just speak his mind. He was saying to others: Maybe I ought to \nreflect on it. No, you should speak what you think.\n  I think it is clear, and I have been talking with people in my State, \nthat the President has stepped over the line with these remarks. This \nweekend, I was asked by many people way to the left of me: Isn't the \nPresident, when he wants to go into Iraq, using politics?\n\n  I said: No, I don't think so. I think he has been wanting to go into \nIraq from the very beginning.\n  Then for him to accuse Democrats of using politics, in my judgment--\nand I wonder what the Senator from California thinks because she has \nspoken in a heartfelt, compassionate way--I think the American people \nare fundamentally fair, and ugly tactics like that will backfire on \ntheir own, but I also believe it has to be pointed out because war is \nserious stuff and we need unity. We do not need political games.\n  Senator Inouye said it best. I just ask the Senator if she is finding \nthe same thing in her State as mine; that people are not sure, they \nwant some questions asked before we go into war, and people do not like \none party accusing the other of not being patriotic or being less \nconcerned about national security simply because they ask questions. I \nwonder what the Senator's opinion is.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from California yield for a parliamentary \nrequest?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I certainly will.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are on H.R. 5005; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me respond to my friend from New York. \nThe phone calls, letters, and e-mails we have been getting have been \none-sided against an open, blank-check resolution, as they are phrasing \nit, as was sent over. They are very much against what the President \nsent over.\n  More importantly are my conversations with my constituents. They \nclearly are very pleased that Senator Feinstein has made remarks \nregarding Iraq, and I have spoken out. I have received calls now \nbecause I raised a number of questions in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee regarding working with our allies, working through the U.N., \nasking: Is there a path to peace here?\n  What I pointed out is in recent years, I have voted for two \nresolutions to go to war: One was to stop the genocide by Milosevic, \nthat was with a Democratic President, and one with current President \nBush to respond to the brutal, inhumane terrorist attack on 9/11 for \nwhich every single Democrat in this particular body voted.\n  To me, it is not a question of will I ever vote for such action. It \nis a question of what is the best way to proceed. My constituents want \nto hear what I am thinking. I have been in Congress for 20 years. They \ndo not want to see debates where one party is saying to another: You do \nnot care about the American people. My friend is so correct. They look \nto us to engage in a rational debate, not to have one-line zingers as \nthe President put out. This is not what they want.\n  Then Ari Fleischer, who is the press secretary for the President, \nsaid this today:\n\n       It's time for everyone to work well together to protect our \n     national security.\n\n  That was his remark after he was questioned about the President's \nstatement.\n  That is the point that Senator Daschle was making, but not as \nrhetoric, as fact. There is an expression, I believe it was John Adams \nsaid: Facts are stubborn things. The facts are this President said very \nclearly: The Democrat-controlled Senate ``is not interested in the \nsecurity of the American people.'' My people at home are appalled at \nthat.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will continue to yield to both my colleagues.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I want to reinforce what the Senator from New York said. \nBy the way, this statement about not being interested in the security \nof the American people was made in Trenton, NJ, on Monday at a \npolitical rally. It is hard for me to understand what special interests \nare being reflected in the President's comments and its repeated \nnature.\n  I wonder if the junior Senator from California actually knew this was \nmade in Trenton, NJ, at a political rally for the competitor to our \nside of the aisle? Is that not political in and of itself?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, I learned of this quote reading the \nfront page today of the Washington Post, and I am going to read what it \nsays. It says four times in the past 2 days Bush has suggested that \nDemocrats do not care about national security, saying on Monday that \nthe Democratic-controlled Senate is ``not interested in the security of \nthe American people.''\n  His remarks, intensifying the theme he introduced last month, were \nquickly seconded and disseminated by Republican House majority whip Tom \nDeLay of Texas.\n  I was unaware of this, although it is interesting to me, because that \nparticular race, of course, in New Jersey, which is pivotal to the \nfuture of this Senate, and adds to the political nature of this \ncomment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the junior Senator from California continue to \nyield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I believe my friend was here when I was back in 1991. \nThere was a long debate. I think it was a debate on the merits.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Both sides debated strongly in a heartfelt way. The \nNation voted to go to war. Whatever side you were on, it seemed to me \nby having the debate, by keeping the invective aside--I do not remember \nthe previous President George Bush ever using lines like that. After \nthe debate, the vote was close, I believe, in both bodies. It certainly \nwas in the House. The American people were more unified. There was a \nfeeling that everyone had their point of view, that everything was \nexplored.\n  I would say to my friend from California, at every townhall meeting \nabout Iraq, and I have had a bunch of them around the State, they say \nyou must know something we do not know. There must be some secret.\n  I have attended a few of the classified briefings and obviously would \nnot want to disclose what is in there, but I say to them, no, as to the \nbasic broad facts, not any kind of detail that would involve security, \nbut the basic broad facts are known to every American because they are \nin the newspapers. There are no hidden, deep, dark secrets, at least \nthat I am aware of. Maybe there are that we do not know about. But in a \ndemocracy, you cannot go to war this way. You cannot say if you are a \nleader of the country, I know something you do not know, when you are \nsending the sons and daughters of America to be put in harm's way.\n  I do not know how I would come out if we had to vote today, but \nwhether I would end up voting yes or no--and I do not know what the \nresolution would look like--I sure would feel bad if we did not have a \ndebate, if we did not have a discussion, if a whole variety of \nquestions were not asked.\n  I would like to hear my friend's opinions on this. This is the most \nawesome, humbling decision that a Member of the Senate or the other \nbody can make, because you are putting the beautiful young people of \nAmerica in harm's way. You have to be careful.\n\n[[Page S9219]]\n\n  I am not a pacifist. I can think of a whole number of wars in our \ncountry's history where I would have enlisted. I would have been lined \nup the next day.\n  I would not say that first strikes should always be ruled out, but I \nsure want to ask some questions and I sure want to know some answers. \nThis idea of trying to impugn the patriotism, in the interest of \nhelping the American people, of anyone who wants to ask questions, I \nfind, well, too low for words.\n  I ask the junior Senator from California if she has the same feeling. \nI come from New York. I know what terrorism does. I knew people who \nwere lost. I put this flag on September 12, and I have worn it every \nday since then in memory of those who were lost. God willing, I am \ngoing to wear it every day for the rest of my life.\n  I know what terrorism is all about. Nobody wants to beat back \nterrorism more than I do, but I want to make sure we do it and we do it \nright. I want to make sure if we go to war in Iraq we are not going to \nignore or take resources away from, for example, fighting al-Qaida or \nother terrorist groups. Perhaps we can do both, but I have not had a \nchance yet to get all the answers about that. I wonder what the Senator \nthinks.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, he is absolutely right.\n  I want to say for the benefit of my senior Senator for California, I \nwill be talking another 5 minutes and then I will yield.\n  I want to underscore that what the Senator says is so right. After \nthat debate that took place on the first gulf war, about 80 percent of \nthe American people said they were so proud. Clearly, they may not have \nagreed with my position, your position, or any other Senator on the \nother side of the debate, but they saw debate free and open, respectful \ndebate, among colleagues, asking questions, posing ideas, other \nsolutions, other paths to resolve the issue.\n  In some cases, there was strong support for the President. They \nrealized then that we are a representative democracy. They were calm.\n  When I went home this past weekend, I found out the people in my \nState are not calm. They are very agitated, and it is because they are \nworried that debate is being stifled. They are worried that a \nresolution is----\n  Mr. MILLER. The Senator has used her 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. When Senator Reid made the request, he did not apply the \n10 minutes to this speaker, but I ask unanimous consent to continue for \n5 additional minutes before Senator Feinstein proceeds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The people at home are agitated, I say to my friend, \nbecause they expect to see this respect go both ways between the \nparties and even, frankly, within the parties. We have Republicans who \nare asking questions and others who are not. We have Democrats who are \nready to vote today for the Bush resolution and others, such as myself, \nwho frankly could not because I believe it is a blank check.\n  I thank my friend for his engagement in this colloquy. Let me \nconclude in this way: I have thought to myself, why is this happening? \nI believe there is a political decision that has been made to keep this \ncountry focused on the foreign policy questions and not focused on the \neveryday kitchen table issues, the domestic issues that need to be \naddressed. I am going to go to some charts very quickly.\n  We have seen long-term unemployment more than doubling since this \nadministration came in. We have seen the worst performance of the stock \nmarket since Hoover. That means pensions are going down the tubes, as \nwell as 401(k)s, and people's hopes and dreams for their retirement. We \nhave seen an average rate change in the real gross domestic product, \nwhich is the worst in generations. It is the worst of all Presidents \nfrom Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, the \nfirst George Bush, and President Clinton. It is the worst growth rate. \nThat is what we have seen.\n  In summing up the economic record, we have seen record job losses, \nweak economic growth, declining business investment, falling stock \nmarket, shrinking retirement accounts, eroding consumer confidence, \nrising health care costs, escalating foreclosures, vanishing surpluses, \nhigher interest rates on the horizon, raiding Social Security, record \nexecutive pay and a stagnating minimum wage.\n  So I believe that a decision was made to deal with a foreign policy \nissue at the exclusion of what is happening on the ground with our \nfamilies. Mr. President, that is distressing. We need to do both.\n\n  We need to rise to the foreign policy challenges we face. On the war \nagainst terrorism, we have a long way to go. In Afghanistan, in \nPakistan, right here, with the cells that exist in our country, we have \na long way to go. We need to step to the plate on that fight. We need \nto step to the plate on the Iraq challenge and handle it correctly with \nour allies, with a plan that will lead us perhaps to a peaceful end \nwithout having to shed blood. Maybe there is a chance. We should at \nleast explore it. We have to step to the plate on the economic issues \nand we need to do that across party lines. We have to do it with the \nRepublicans, with the Independents, with the Democrats--together.\n  One course we do not want is for one party to say about the other: \nThey don't care about the security of the American people. If one party \ndoes that, as the Republicans did today, as the President did, as \nreported today, we will lose all these other battles. We will have a \ndivided country. We will not be able to work together in good will.\n  My leader, Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senate, was right to say \nwhat he said, was right to express himself in the way he did. I hope \nthe answer will be that in the future we will join hands as Americans \nand, even where we might disagree on a strategy, on an amendment, on a \nbill, work together as Americans. That is when the people are most \nproud of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n20 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/25/senate-section/article/S9219-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9219-S9221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, \nSenator Boxer, for her excellent remarks, and those Senators from New \nJersey and New York who joined her. She has made a very impassioned \nmessage. It is a correct message. I hope people listen.\n  I also am deeply saddened by recent comments made by the President \nand Vice President which imply that Democrats are not protective of our \nNation's security. Nothing is further from the truth.\n  There is no shortage of courage and bravery and patriotism on this \nside of the aisle. We, too, have our heroes who prove that: Senator Max \nCleland, Senator Daniel Inouye, former Senator Bob Kerrey, and Senator \nJohn Kerry, people who fought with bravery and distinction in major \nconflicts this Nation has had.\n  Even to imply the Democrats are not interested in the security of the \nAmerican people is not only wrong, but in the present pre-election \nperiod I believe it is also base.\n  Last night, it was reported the Vice President went so far as to \nstate that American security would be enhanced if a certain GOP \ncandidate was elected to the House of Representatives. This very \nstatement, carried by major newspapers, jaundiced any fair discussion \nin this pre-election period.\n  One might ask why? The reason is both the President and the Vice \nPresident have an extraordinary bully pulpit with a very long reach. It \nmakes up about 95 percent of everything that reaches the American \npublic; the remaining 5 percent is scattered among whoever is able to \nreceive it.\n\n  If this debate is politicized in the heat of an election and the \ndecision is made for the wrong reasons--out of fear; if we do not carry \nout the public trust that is invested in us and make the decision for \nthe right reasons, then we betray our trust. And no election is worth \ndoing that.\n  I share the concern of the majority leader, and I hope it is not too \nlate to end this politicization. But there is only one way. Shortly, we \nin Congress will begin debate on whether to authorize the President the \nauthority to use force against Iraq. It is, in effect, a declaration of \nwar. The President has sent a draft resolution. He made his case before \nthe United Nations. Today he\n\n[[Page S9220]]\n\nseeks the support of the international community. Now it is our job, \nour constitutional duty, to debate this resolution. But we must do so \nin an atmosphere that is true. The decision to go to war is perhaps the \nmost grave and significant decision any nation makes. It is a decision \nthat must be made on its own merits, with a timetable determined by the \ncause and the case and not based on political considerations and \nupcoming elections. I believe that deeply.\n  A declaration of war against Iraq is the most serious decision many \nMembers will ever make as Senators. It is a life or death decision for \nthe American men and women we put into harm's way, for the innocent \nIraqi people who will be killed, for the repercussions it will have \nthroughout the Persian Gulf, the Middle East and the Arab world, and \nthroughout our own country and the rest of the world.\n  Congress must not rush to judgment before it has had ample \nopportunity to answer the many questions that still remain regarding \nwhy a war, a preemptive war, should be fought at this time against \nIraq. For example, what is the immediate threat to American security to \njustify an attack on another sovereign nation? How would such a war be \nconducted? How would we respond to Iraq's use of chemical or biological \nweapons, to an attack on Israel, or to a ricochet of terrorist \nincidents in our country and around the world? And what are our \nresponsibilities for postwar stability once Saddam Hussein is ousted? \nHow do we prevent civil war between the Sunnis and the Shias?\n  No one questions that Saddam Hussein is an evil man, or the potential \nof Iraq acquiring the nuclear capability within the next 5 to 7 years \nis a possibility. We believe it is. There is reason to believe that \nSaddam Hussein has squirreled away biological and chemical weapons. But \nthey are most likely close to civilians: in tunnels, under mosques, \naround schools and hospitals, and inside palaces or in mobile vehicles.\n  This is not sufficient reason to preemptively attack another \nsovereign nation--for the first time in this Nation's history--without \nfirst being provoked by an attack against our homeland, our people, or \nour interests. It is not sufficient reason to put our service men and \nwomen in harm's way when there are real, viable options short of war \nleft on the table. There is no question this country should take steps \nto disarm Iraq. Saddam Hussein, with chemical and biological weapons, \nrepresents a real threat to his own people, to the Middle East region, \nand to the international security. The question is, Is use of force the \nfirst option or the last option? In my view, it should be the last. In \nmy view, working with the international community, doing all we can to \ndisarm Iraq before jumping to military force, remains an option.\n  If Saddam Hussein balks at inspectors, if he starts playing games, if \nhe continues to thwart the will of the international community, then \nthe use of force by the United States has a moral imprimatur and is the \nonly remaining viable answer.\n  There is no question that Iraq is in direct violation of \ninternational law, numerous U.N. Security Council resolutions, and that \nhe poses a threat in the region. Nobody debates that. But there is no \npersuasive evidence that Iraq is prepared to unleash its biological or \nchemical weapons today. Although he used them against the Kurds in 1987 \nand 1988, and against Iran in their decade-long war, he has not used \nthem in over 10 years, and he knows what will happen to him if he does. \nHe may be homicidal but he is not suicidal.\n\n  Likewise, there is no persuasive evidence that he possesses nuclear \nweapons today. He may be trying to gain these weapons, but he remains \nyears away. So instead of rushing to war, I believe we should proceed \nin a calm, methodical, and nonpolitical manner. The United States \nshould work through the United Nations Security Council--as the \nPresident himself suggested in a September 12 speech to the United \nNations and as Secretary of State Colin Powell is now trying to do to \nobtain full and unconditional access for arms inspectors, and hopefully \naccompanied by a United Nations military force.\n  We should seek the complete destruction of Iraqi weapons of mass \ndestruction and the means to deliver them. This approach should be our \nfirst option, not window dressing or an option to be dismissed out-of-\nhand. And we should do this not for idealistic reasons but because it \nis in our national security interests to do so.\n  Indeed, the benefit of pursuing a multilateral approach was seen \nclearly when Saudi Arabia suggested that, if the United States were \nworking through the United Nations, it would grant U.S. forces access \nto its bases. Action against Iraq becomes much more complicated, from a \nmilitary perspective, if there are no landing or flyover rights in \nother Arab countries; and managing the aftermath becomes much more \ndifficult if we find the entire Arab world against us.\n  So I believe that if the United States fails in its efforts to compel \nIraqi compliance with a United Nations inspection, verification, and \ndestruction regime--either because other countries threaten a veto in \nthe Security Council or the United Nations is unable to muster the \nmuscle and will to enforce its own resolutions--then the United States, \nwith or without willing partners in the international community, must \nbe prepared to go it alone.\n  But we must be clear. If we go to war, it should be to force Iraq to \ndisarm.\n  This time, too, it is critical that the United States stays the \ncourse on the war on terror.\n  In every book you read on Osama bin Laden, you see that he believed \nthat we would never stay the course in a war against him. We would hit \na camp once and then disappear. As happened before, we would go to \nSomalia, get into trouble in Mogadishu, and we would turn tail and run. \nBin Laden bet on that. He cannot be right about that. We have much to \ndo to win this war.\n  Many of those who perpetrated the September 11 terrorist attacks \nremain at large, including two-thirds of the al-Qaida leadership; the \nTaliban and its leader, Mullah Omar; not to mention thousands of \nterrorists sympathetic to al-Qaida worldwide, including in our own \ncountry.\n  Afghanistan remains a fragile and unstable country. The United States \nmust continue our efforts to rebuild this country. We cannot repeat \nwhat was done to it since 1979. We must continue our efforts to rebuild \nAfghanistan, the Afghan economy, to assure that the Taliban and al-\nQaida do not return to power there--because they will if they can. We \nmust protect and stabilize the Government of Hamid Karzai. And any \neffort in Iraq must not detract from our war on terror.\n  The President has rightly pointed out that the war on terror will be \na long and hard-fought battle, and it is not just against al-Qaida. It \nis Hezbollah, which equals al-Qaida in its reach, in its viciousness, \nin its malevolence, and its evil. We must not take our eye off this \nball. The President must come forward to explain not only how we fight \nthis two-front war without allowing one front to jeopardize our \ninterests in the other, but also what we would do in the event of a \nmajor strike against Israel.\n\n  I have come to this floor before and indicated that there is ample \nevidence that rockets are being shipped out of Iran, through Syria and \ninto southern Lebanon--Katyusha rockets with extended range anywhere \nfrom 8,000 to 10,000, to hit Israel's industrial zone north of Haifa, \nshould we attack Iraq.\n  What do we do then? What is our commitment, and what will the other \nArab States do? I think we ought to know this. I think as prudent \nleaders, as part of a debate in the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld, we ought to know these things before going into it, so there are \nno surprises.\n  Finally, it is critical that if and as we consider any use of force \nagainst Iraq that we have a clear understanding of the aftermath. Who \nwould do the rebuilding? Who would pay for it? Who would run any new \ngovernment? And could that government provide security? Could it \nprevent a bigger and more brutal battle between the Sunni and the Shia.\n  That is not a question to overlook. Read the history on Iraq. You \nwill see the brutality and the viciousness, the attack of one tribe on \nthe other that has characterized Iraqi history from the time of ancient \nMesopotamia. There are a lot of grievances out there to be settled, big \ngrievances between the Shia majority and the ruling Sunni Baath party \nminority.\n\n[[Page S9221]]\n\n  As General Shalikashvili made clear in his recent testimony before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, planning for a post-conflict \nsituation, winning the peace, is every bit as important as planning for \nthe conflict itself.\n  And until the planning for post-war Iraq is in place--and it is not \nnow--we should not rush to initiate combat. In fact, every general with \nwhom I have talked--and I have talked with several--has urged caution. \nEvery general with whom I have talked, privately, believes this war \ncould end up being much more difficult than some expect it to be.\n  So to simply rush ahead and authorize the President to use force now, \nbefore these questions are answered, and without an imminent threat--\nsave what some hope to gain from this issue in the elections--would be \na grave error.\n  Congress must debate these issues fully, thoroughly, on a schedule, \nand with a timetable driven only by the merits of the issues. We must \nthen move forward to pass a resolution tailored to the specific \ncircumstances and giving the President the proper authority he needs to \nsafeguard U.S. national interests.\n  So much is at stake here. American lives are at stake. We do not know \nhow many, but I know one thing: It is not going to be like the gulf \nwar. This war will be in cities. This will be street to street and \nhouse to house. We might send in the B-2s, the B-52s and the 117s, and \nthey might drop huge numbers of laser-guided missiles and precision \nbombs. We will kill a lot of people. And then do we risk what may \nhappen with the chemical and biologicals squirreled away? Do they go up \nin those attacks? Or are they released over innocent people? I have \nnever heard one person discuss this, and it is time that we do so.\n  We are not a mercenary nation. This is not our heart. It is not our \nsoul. And we have never engaged in a preemptive attack on another \nsovereign nation.\n  It may well be that untold numbers of lives are at stake elsewhere in \nthe Persian Gulf, in the Middle East, and yes, right here in the USA.\n  Matters of war and peace, of life and death, must not be held in the \ngrip of shortsighted, partisan rancor. I for one refuse to make them \nso. I respectfully suggest the Administration do the same. The stakes \nare simply too high.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue that has \nbeen in the press much today, and I think there is a great deal of \nmisinterpretation taking place about the President's and the Vice \nPresident's comments regarding homeland security and the war on \nterrorism.\n  I make specific reference to a speech that Vice President Cheney gave \nin Kansas on Monday. I was at that event. I heard the speech. I was \nthere supporting the candidate for whom the speech was given. Adam \nTaff, a fine candidate, is running for Congress in the Third \nCongressional District in Kansas. I want to make it very clear--and I \nwant to enter into the Record a copy of the Vice President's words \nverbatim.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Vice President's speech \nwhich he gave on Monday in Kansas be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRemarks by the Vice President at Lunch for Congressional Candidate Adam \n             Taff, September 23, 2002, Kansas City, Kansas\n\n       The Vice President: Well, thank you very much, Adam. And \n     thanks for the kind words, and for the opportunity to be here \n     with all of you today. It's good to be back in Kansas, and \n     standing next to the next Congressman from the Third \n     District. (Applause.)\n       I'm also delighted today to get the opportunity to spend a \n     little bit of time with Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts, two \n     great United States senators. (Applause.) I know--of course; \n     Pat was up here talking before we came on, and somebody came \n     in and said, you know, you've got to get right down there, \n     Senator Roberts is running out of things to say. (Laughter.) \n     I knew better. (Laughter.)\n       It's always fun to get a chance to travel with my bride, \n     and spend a little bit of time out on the campaign trail, \n     doing important work. I often explain to people that we have \n     a Republican marriage, that if it hadn't been for that great \n     Republican victory in 1952, when Dwight Eisenhower was \n     elected President, that our lives would have come out very \n     differently. In 1952, when Eisenhower got elected, I was \n     living in Lincoln, Nebraska, with my parents, just a \n     youngster of some, I guess 11 years old at the time. But he \n     came in and reorganized the Agriculture Department--my dad \n     worked for the U.S. Soil Conservation Service. Dad got \n     transferred to Casper, Wyoming. We moved to Wyoming. I met \n     Lynn--we went to high school together, grew up together, got \n     married, celebrated our 38th wedding anniversary last August. \n     (Applause.)\n       But I explained to a group of people the other night that \n     if it hadn't been for that Republican election victory, that \n     Lynne would have married somebody else. She said, right, and \n     now he'd be Vice President of the United States. (Laughter.) \n     There's no doubt in my mind that what that's true. \n     (Laughter.)\n       Of course, my job now as Vice President--my only job, \n     actually, as Vice President--is to preside over the Senate. \n     And when they wrote the Constitution they decided they needed \n     a Vice President, somebody to back-up the President in case \n     something happened to him. But at the end of the \n     constitutional convention they realized they hadn't really \n     given the Vice President anything to do. So, finally, they \n     settled on making him the President of the Senate, so that he \n     could preside over the Senate and gave him floor privileges, \n     as well.\n       And John Adams, of course, was our first Vice President, \n     the first President of the Senate. And he presided and he \n     also used those floor privileges--got up and could actually \n     participate in the debate and speak to the issues of the \n     moment and argue for and against the majors on the floor. And \n     then he did that a couple of times and they withdrew his \n     floor privileges. (Laughter.) And they've never been \n     restored. (Laughter.)\n       But one of the things I do get to do is to swear in the new \n     Senate every January. And I'm enthusiastically looking \n     forward to next January, when I can swear-in Pat Roberts and \n     the new members of a Republican-led Senate in January.) \n     (Applause.)\n       We've got a lot of races here in Kansas this year. Of \n     course, a new Secretary of State, Ron Thornburgh, I think \n     will do very well. Congressman Jerry Moran, who has proved to \n     be a great member of the House of Representatives. And, of \n     course, the next Governor of Kansas, Tim Shallenburger. \n     (Applause.)\n       And I bring greetings to the people of Kansas from \n     President George W. Bush.\n       We're all here today because there's an important race for \n     Congress in the third district--and we've got a tremendous \n     candidate. This seat belonged for many years to a great lady \n     and a close friend of Lynne's and mine. We all admire Jan \n     Meyers for her integrity and devotion to duty. (Applause.)\n       I served for ten years in the House, most of that time with \n     Jan and explained to people, of course--it was a special kind \n     of arrangement to be the congressman from Wyoming, since \n     there was only one congressman from Wyoming. It was a small \n     delegation. (Laughter.) But it was quality. (Laughter.)\n       But our nominee that we have for the third district today \n     follows very much in the tradition that January established \n     for this district. Adam is a first-class candidate; a \n     distinguished Naval aviator who has carried out missions in \n     many parts of the globe; a citizen actively involved in the \n     life of his community; and a person who understands the need \n     for limited and effective government.\n       He'll be an effective voice for Kansas, and a fine addition \n     to your Republican delegation--already one of the most \n     talented we have in Washington. The election is just six \n     weeks away, and there's a lot of work ahead. And I am here \n     today to make absolutely certain that Adam Taff is the next \n     congressman from the third district in Kansas. (Applause.)\n       The President and I look forward to welcoming Adam to the \n     nation's capital come January. He'll be vital in helping us \n     meet the key priorities for the nation--in terms of winning \n     the war on terror, strengthening the economy, and defending \n     our homeland.\n       For the economy, this administration's goal is for faster \n     growth and for more jobs for American workers. Even in the \n     face of the major challenges--from the terrorist attacks to \n     recession--the economic picture is nonetheless promising. \n     Worker productivity has grown. Interest rates remain low. \n     Inflation is under control. Personal income has continued to \n     rise. And the economy continues to expand.\n       All of these factors set us on a path for long-term growth \n     and prosperity. And if we\n\n[[Page S9222]]\n\n     continue the positive direction President Bush has set for \n     the nation--with solid, pro-growth, pro-job reforms--\n     Americans will enjoy even greater prosperity in the years \n     ahead. But we will not be satisfied until every sector of the \n     economy--from agriculture to high-tech--is vigorous and \n     growing. And we will not rest until every person in America \n     who wants to work can find a job.\n       We'll see more growth and new jobs when Congress passes the \n     President's energy policy--a policy that encourages efficient \n     technology and conservation, and increases production here at \n     home. Especially in times like these, we must pass a \n     comprehensive energy bill, and reduce America's dependence on \n     foreign oil.\n       We'll see more growth and new jobs when people around the \n     world have more opportunities to buy things that are made and \n     grown here in America. Under President Bush's leadership, \n     Congress has passed trade promotion authority, signed into \n     law just recently. The President will use that tool to open \n     up new markets to our country's farmers, ranchers, and \n     manufacturers.\n       Congress has also followed the President's lead in passing \n     a new law to protect investors, to bring more accountability \n     to corporations, and to ensure tougher oversight in the \n     accounting profession. Our country has the most productive, \n     creative, and promising economic system the world has ever \n     known. The President's reforms will bring out the best in \n     that system, and make it even stronger and better than ever \n     before.\n       Americans can also count on President George W. Bush to \n     continue working to reduce the federal tax burden. Last year \n     we passed the biggest taxpayer relief package in a \n     generation. As enacted, however, those reductions stay in \n     place only for a time, and then expire in the year 2011. Even \n     the death tax is scheduled to rise from the dead that year. \n     For the health of the economy--and for the well-being of \n     every taxpayer--we need to make the Bush tax cut permanent, \n     and enforce spending discipline in Washington, D.C. \n     (Applause.)\n       Some in that city need reminding that every dime the \n     government spends was earned and sent in by someone else. And \n     we have a responsibility to help keep spending under control. \n     In a time of war and recession-induced deficits, we need to \n     show extra care in our spending priorities, and the \n     discipline that fits the times. The President's budget \n     commits most new spending to national security and to \n     homeland defense, and seeks to hold the rest of government to \n     an increase of two percent. Were spending to grow without \n     restraint, billions more would be diverted from families and \n     entrepreneurs, limiting the economy's ability to expand in \n     the future. President Bush is going to insist on spending \n     discipline in Washington--and, if necessary, he'll use the \n     veto power to protect the American taxpayer.\n       Another responsibility the President takes very seriously \n     is the job of placing qualified, common-sense judges on the \n     federal bench. (Applause.) The Senator has a responsibility \n     of its own--to give every nominee a prompt hearing and a \n     vote. The Democratic leadership has refused to do so. Dozens \n     of judgeships sit empty, while many of the President's \n     judicial nominees have waited for more than a year for the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee to even give them the courtesy of \n     a hearing.\n       In nominating judges President Bush chooses men and women \n     of experience, judicial temperament, and good judgment--\n     people who respect the Constitution, and understand the \n     limits of judicial power. The Senate should move to confirm \n     the President's nominees for the federal courts, and they \n     should do so without wasting another day. (Applause.)\n       As we look to the agenda for the fall, we are keeping first \n     things first. The most important responsibility we have, as \n     Adam mentioned, is to protect the American people against \n     future attack and to win the war that started on September \n     11, 2001.\n       This has been a period of testing for the United States. \n     The American people have met that test. We are united. We \n     understand the threats that have formed against us. We are \n     determined to protect our country. And we will prevail.\n       In the past year, we have captured many terrorists, and \n     frozen the assets of many terror groups and front \n     organizations. Our people in law enforcement and \n     intelligence, working under the most urgent and sometimes \n     dangerous circumstances, have disrupted terrorist plots here \n     and abroad. At home, we are reorganizing the federal \n     government to strengthen our ability to guard against further \n     attacks. And of course in Afghanistan--where so many \n     terrorists were housed, armed, and trained--we have shut down \n     the camps, and liberated an entire nation from the Taliban \n     regime. In the case of Osama bin Laden--as the President said \n     recently--``If he's alive, we'll get him. If he's not alive--\n     we already got him.'' (Laughter.) That's a Texas phrase, I \n     guess. (Laughter.)\n       Every bit or progress we've achieved, all of us appreciate \n     that we are still closer to the beginning of this conflict \n     than to its end. The President and I begin each day with a \n     briefing on the threats facing the country. There is little \n     doubt that our enemies are determined to do further \n     significant harm to the American people. Nine-eleven and its \n     aftermath have given us a clear picture of the true ambitions \n     of the global terror network, as well as the growing danger \n     of weapons of mass destruction.\n       In that changing environment, as always, we must take the \n     facts as they are, not as we wish they were, and we must \n     think anew about the requirements of national security. In \n     the days of the Cold War, we were able to manage the threat \n     with strategies of deterrence and containment. But it is a \n     lot tougher to deter enemies who have no country to defend. \n     And containment is not possible when dictators obtain weapons \n     of mass destruction and are prepared to share them with \n     terrorists.\n       We have already found confirmation that the al Qaeda \n     terrorists are seriously interested in nuclear, chemical and \n     biological weapons. At the same time, there is a danger of \n     terror groups joining together with regimes that have or are \n     seeking to building weapons of mass destruction. In the case \n     of Saddam Hussein, we have a dictator who is clearly pursuing \n     these capabilities--and has used them previously, both in his \n     own against Iran and against his own people.\n       The government of the United Stats must not look the other \n     way as threats gather against the American people. We are \n     consulting with Congress and with our friends and allies \n     around the world about the course of action. In his speech to \n     the United Nations General Assembly, President Bush made \n     clear to the international community the kind of challenges \n     we must face together.\n       The President reminded the U.N. that Saddam Hussein made a \n     series of commitments after his defeat in Desert Storm--and \n     that he has broken every one of them. Saddam agreed to cease \n     at once his repression of his people--yet the systematic \n     violation of human rights continues in Iraq to this day. He \n     agreed to return all prisoners from Kuwait and other lands--\n     yet more than 600 are still unaccounted for, and one American \n     pilot--a Kansan named Scott Speicher--is among them.\n       Saddam Hussein agreed to renounce all involvement with \n     terrorism, and to permit no terrorist organizations to \n     operate in Iraq. Yet Iraq continues to shelter and support \n     terrorist organizations. Dissidents abroad are targeted \n     for murder. The Iraqi regime has attempted to assassinate \n     the Emir of Kuwait and a former President of the United \n     States.\n       Saddam Hussein promised the United Nations that he would \n     destroy and cease further development of weapons of mass \n     destruction and long-range missiles--and that he would submit \n     to unrestricted inspections. He has flatly broken these \n     pledges, producing chemical and biological weapons--\n     aggressively pursuing a nuclear weapons program--and working \n     to develop long-range missiles. And for four years now, he \n     has refused to admit U.N. inspectors--four years during which \n     he has been able to plan, to build and to test in secrecy.\n       Last week's letter from the Iraqi government to the United \n     Nations, now pledging to allow inspectors back into the \n     country, is another attempt to avoid strong action by the \n     Security Council. We have seen this kind of tactic before. In \n     the letter, the regime says it has no weapons of mass \n     destruction. We know this is a lie. The entire world knows, \n     beyond dispute, that Saddam Hussein holds weapons of mass \n     destruction in large quantities, and is seeking to acquire \n     more. This is not a matter of inspections. The only issue is \n     the disarmament of Iraq, the elimination of the weapons of \n     mass destruction, as required by Security Council \n     resolutions.\n       False statements from the Iraqi regime will not cause us to \n     ignore history or reality. Saddam Hussein has spent more than \n     a decade in complete defiance of all the demands of the \n     United Nations.\n       The question for the international community is whether the \n     Security Council resolutions will be enforced, or disregarded \n     without consequence--whether the United Nations will be \n     effective, or irrelevant. As for the United States, the \n     President has made our position abundantly clear: we want to \n     work with the United Nations to meet the common challenge. \n     The Security Council resolutions are to be enforced, or \n     action will be unavoidable. We must, and we will, take \n     whatever steps are necessary to defend our freedom and our \n     security. (Applause.)\n       In the challenges to America we will be expecting a lot \n     from our military--and those who serve have a right to expect \n     a lot from us. If we're going to ask young men and women to \n     defend our country, our allies, and our freedom, if we're \n     going to send them into harms' way, on dangerous missions to \n     fight determined enemies--they deserve the best tools, the \n     best training, and the best support we can possibly give \n     them.\n       We are investing in our military so that we can deploy \n     swift and agile forces--any place, any time they're needed. \n     We are building precision weapons that can spare the lives of \n     American soldiers, and innocent civilians in foreign lands. \n     We will multiply every advantage in order to prevail over any \n     enemy. And to have this capability, President Bush has asked \n     for the most significant increase in defense spending since \n     Ronald Reagan lived in the White House.\n       The conduct of our military does more than bring credit to \n     the country; it reflects the basic character of the American \n     people. This is a good, and decent, and generous land. We \n     fight not for revenge against our enemies, but for the \n     freedom and security of our own people--and for the peace of \n     the world. At times in our history the price of freedom has \n     been very high, but Americans have always been willing to pay \n     that price--even when the odds weighed heavily against us.\n\n[[Page S9223]]\n\n       I was reminded of this the other day as I read David \n     McCullough's biography of our first Vice President, John \n     Adams. When Adams and his fellow delegates voted to approve \n     the Declaration of Independence, they knew precisely what \n     kind of trouble they were bringing on themselves. To sign the \n     Declaration, one of the founders said, was like signing your \n     own death warrant. As of July 4, 1776, they would be \n     considered traitors to the king, at war with the army of an \n     empire.\n       Large numbers of enemy soldiers were already positioned on \n     American soil, intent on crushing the rebellion in short \n     order. In mid-August, 32,000 British troops landed at Staten \n     Island--an army greater in size than the entire population of \n     our then-largest city, Philadelphia. The American force was \n     far smaller, had very little in the way of equipment and \n     supplies, and was comprised almost entirely of poorly-trained \n     volunteers. All they had was the courage of human beings \n     determined to live in freedom.\n       Before they prevailed the Americans endured not weeks, not \n     months, but years of hardship and struggle. The American \n     victory at Yorktown didn't come until the fall of 1781. The \n     Treaty of Paris, which John Adams helped negotiate and which \n     ended the Revolution, was finally concluded in September of \n     1783--more than seven long, difficult years after the \n     Declaration was signed.\n       From that day to this, the people of the United States have \n     understood that the freedom that we enjoy did not come \n     easily--and we have no intention of letting it slip away. \n     History has called generations of Americans to defend our \n     country and to defeat some of the gravest threats known to \n     mankind. We have accepted that duty once again, because we \n     know the cause is just--we understand that the hopes of the \n     civilized world depend on us--and we are certain of the \n     victory to come.\n       In this critical time I have the honor to stand beside a \n     President who has united our nation behind great goals. For \n     all the challenges we face, the United States of America has \n     never been stronger than we are today--and even better days \n     are ahead of us. President Bush and I are very grateful for \n     the opportunity to serve our country. We thank you for your \n     support--not just for our efforts, but for good candidates \n     like Adam Taff, who will make a fine partner for us in the \n     important work ahead.\n       Thank you very much. (Applause.)\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I think it is important that we work \noff actual words and not headlines, off actual words and not \ninterpretations, and off actual words and not feelings towards words.\n  That is the reason I wanted to enter into the Record the specific \nwording the Vice President used in the speech that is being commented \nupon a great deal by a number of Members. The headline that was out was \nnot something that was said by the Vice President. I think it is \nimportant we get the actual words he used on Monday.\n  I want to also make something very clear. The Vice President did not \nat all challenge the patriotism of any Member of Congress--House or \nSenate, Republican, Democrat, or Independent. He did not challenge any \nof that. He didn't mention any member by name other than the one he is \nsupporting, and who is running for the House of Representatives.\n  He spoke at length about Saddam Hussein, about the need for homeland \nsecurity, and about the need to move these bills forward.\n  There was no accusation whatsoever about any lack of patriotism on \nanybody's part. He is supporting, in this case in Kansas, the Third \nDistrict candidate, Adam Taff, a man who is a former military man, an \nF-18 pilot, who fought in the gulf war the first time around, and who \nis running for Congress. This particular individual actually served as \nan F-18 pilot in the military when Vice President Cheney was then \nSecretary of Defense.\n  Here is a person, a candidate, Adam Taff, who actually worked for the \nVice President when he was Secretary of Defense, in a military \ncapacity, and he does push forward his military credentials, as any \ncandidate for office would push forward his credentials for office. And \nAdam Taff claims his military credentials. I think that is fully \nlaudable and appropriate.\n  I think it is important to make clear that the Vice President didn't \nchallenge any patriotism whatsoever and did not reference the Senate in \nany of his comments. Again, as I stated, I have here his actual \ncomments that have been submitted for the Record.\n  I think there has been far too much protesting about this when what \nwe really need to do is get homeland security passed and get an Iraqi \nresolution dealt with and I hope passed. I hope we can get a \nresolution, work together in a bipartisan fashion, and get an \noverwhelming majority for the Iraqi resolution. If we need to adjust \nwords on it, I think that is fully appropriate because we need to show \nto the world a united front and that this distraction today is just \nthat--a distraction.\n  Homeland security we should have passed some time ago. We have been \non it now for 3 weeks. We have been on it primarily because of special \ninterest issues and not because of interests for the country. I think \nwe need to get that bill posted and cleared in this Congress. It would \nbe an important thing for us to do. It is the time for us to get that \ndone. We have dawdled too long on it.\n  But these allegations coming forward today that somehow there has \nbeen a challenge to the patriotism of other Members of this body are \nsimply not supported by the facts. They are not supported by the facts \nanywhere. They are not supported by what the Vice President said in \nKansas.\n  We clearly need to deal with the facts instead of trying to divert \nattention by saying there is an accusation going on which is not built \nupon the facts--allegations that are coming forward challenging the \npatriotism of people who have served in the military and in this body. \nNobody is challenging that.\n\n  There is a clear challenge that we are not getting homeland security \npassed. We have been 3 weeks at it. There is a clear challenge that we \nhave to get an Iraqi resolution passed before this body goes out for \nthe election period--possibly an extended recess, or coming back in a \nlame duck session, whichever actually takes place.\n  We really should get this bill moved forward. I think if people want \nto do away with these accusations, the best thing we can do is pass the \nhomeland security bill and pass an Iraqi resolution that we work and \nmold together here as a body, and get that passed by an overwhelming \nmajority in this body.\n  I urge my colleagues; I think it would be wise for us to lower our \ndecibel level on this, look at the factual material, and not go after \nmisleading headlines but actually examine the record and move forward \nwith these two very serious pieces of business. It is important that we \ndo that.\n  The Vice President has not--and I don't think in the future will--\nchallenged anyone's patriotism. People disagree on political issues. \nThey disagree on issues of policy. That is clear. That is why we have a \nbody that debates these issues.\n  Some people view homeland security one way, and some people think we \nought to support giving the President the authority to take whatever \nmeans necessary to remove Saddam Hussein. The former Vice President \narticulated a couple of days ago, saying no, that this is something we \ndon't need to do and shouldn't do at this time. That is the former Vice \nPresident's opinion. Others have a different opinion on that.\n  But we would be wise to debate what those issues are, and the \nspecifics, and not allege issues of character which are not being \nchallenged by the President or by the Vice President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/25/senate-section/article/S9223-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9223-S9224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS OF THE CUSTOMS SERVICE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate agreed \nlast night, by unanimous consent, to adopt an amendment that Senator \nGrassley and I offered to the homeland security bill. Our amendment \nwill reinforce the commercial operations of the Customs Service within \nthe new Department of Homeland Security.\n  A key objective of the homeland security bill is to create coherence \nin law enforcement at our nation's borders. The Customs Service is \nvital to that endeavor. For the vast majority of people entering the \nUnited States, their first encounter with the U.S. Government is when \nthey are cleared by a Customs officer.\n  The Customs Service is the principal U.S. Government agency at most \nports of entry. It enforces a multitude of commercial and other laws on \nbehalf of itself and some 40 other Federal agencies. In addition to \ncollecting duties, fees, and taxes on imports, Customs assists the \nCensus Bureau in collecting trade data; enforces our environmental laws \nby ensuring that products of endangered species are not brought into \nthis country; protects U.S. intellectual\n\n[[Page S9224]]\n\nproperty owners and consumers by barring entry to counterfeit and \n``gray market'' goods; prohibits illegal drugs and other contraband \nfrom coming into the United States; and enforces numerous other laws.\n  It was a Customs inspector who apprehended the so-called millennium \nbomber in Port Angeles, WA in December 1999. Customs also has played a \nmajor role in putting an end to the scourge of child pornography on the \nInternet and to fighting the war on drugs. Unquestionably, Customs is \nan essential player in law enforcement at our borders and, for this \nreason, ought to be integrated into a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. At the same time, we must not forget that the core mission of \nthe Customs Service is a commercial mission. Customs is first and \nforemost responsible for the collection of duties, taxes and fees on \nimports. This is one of the oldest functions of the Federal Government. \nIt was authorized by the second act of Congress, in July 1789.\n  Today, duties collected by Customs constitute the second most \nimportant source of federal revenues, after the income tax. In fiscal \nyear 2001, Customs processed over 25 million formal entries of cargo, \nworth over $1 trillion. Duties, fees, and taxes on that cargo amounted \nto about $20 billion. Thus, Customs' performance of its core commercial \nfunction is critical as a source of revenue to the U.S. Government. \nCustoms' performance of its core commercial functions also is extremely \nimportant to the U.S. businesses that rely on imports and exports. The \napproximately 25 million formal entries that Customs processed in \nfiscal 2001 represented a 60 percent increase from only 5 years \nearlier. The volume of international trade is increasing significantly. \nTo keep that trade flowing, Customs must perform its job with ever \ngreater efficiency.\n  For these reasons, we must ensure that in moving from the Department \nof Treasury to a new Department of Homeland Security, Customs is able \nto do its commercial job as capably as it does today. I commend \nChairman Lieberman for recognizing this imperative and for working with \nthe Finance Committee to secure the Commercial side of Customs within \nthe new Department. I would like to point out that in mid-July, the \nFinance Committee held a very enlightening hearing on the issue of \nCustoms' integration into a Department of Homeland Security. Following \nthe hearing, Senator Grassley and I transmitted a set of \nrecommendations to Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Thompson. I am \nvery pleased that a number of the key recommendations are part of the \npending bill. In particular: The bill preserves the Customs Service as \na ``distinct entity'' in the new Department. The bill provides that \nappointments required to be made by the President, by and with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate shall continue to be subject to that \nrequirement. I understand that this will include the Commissioner of \nCustoms. The bill preserves for the Secretary of the Treasury certain \nlegal authorities regarding ``customs revenue functions.'' Thus, even \nthough Customs will move to the Department of Homeland Security, the \nSecretary of the Treasury will remain the ultimate decision maker in \nissuing most commercial regulations administered by Customs. this is \nimportant, because it ensures that the national economic interest will \nguide the issuance of regulations affecting Customs' commercial \noperations.\n  We must bear in mind that this bill will move a commercial agency--\nCustoms--from a Department whose primary focus is on the national \neconomic interest, to a Department whose primary focus is on national \nsecurity. The provisions I cited will help ensure that Customs' \ncommercial mission does not get diluted in that process. The amendment \naccepted yesterday bolsters that objective.\n  The amendment contains three provisions.\n  First, it makes clear that certain user fees that Customs collects \nfrom passengers and conveyances entering the United States will be \navailable for use by the Customs Service exclusively.\n  Second, it sets up a special account at the Treasury to support \ndevelopment and implementation of Customs' Automated Commercial \nEnvironment, known as ``ACE.'' ACE is a modern computer system that \nwill replace Customs' antiquated system for the processing of imports. \nOf the fees collected by Customs for processing merchandise, $350 \nmillion per year will be deposited into the ACE account.\n  Third, the amendment makes clear that the Advisory Committee on \nCommercial Operations of the United States Customs Service--known as \nthe ``COAC''--will remain in existence following Customs' move to the \nnew Department. The COAC was created by statute in 1987. It is a \nbipartisan group of 20 representatives of individuals and firms \naffected by commercial operations of Customs. Over the years, it has \nprovided valuable advice to the Secretary of the Treasury. Under this \namendment, ti will continue to do so, and will advise the Secretary of \nHomeland Security as well.\n  I firmly believe that these provisions, along with the customs-\nrelated provisions in the underlying bill will ensure that Customs \nremains a strong and effective trade agency, as well as a strong and \neffective law enforcement agency, in the new Department.\n  Finally, I would like to say a word about another aspect of the \nLieberman bill for which the Chairman should be commended. I am \nreferring to the provisions protecting the rights of employees in the \nnew Department. The most valuable resource of our government is the \npeople who work for it. We must give every incentive for the best and \nthe brightest to serve and to continue serving.\n  I understand that the President has asked for enhancement \n``flexibility'' in dealing with employees of the new Department. \nHowever, it is not at all clear to me that depriving federal workers of \ncollective bargaining rights, merit systems protections, and whistle-\nblower protections, among other protections, is necessary to achieve \nimproved homeland security. In fact, I believe that just the opposite \nis true. To improve homeland security, we need a top-notch workforce. \nGetting and keeping that top-notch workforce means assuring employees \nthat they will be treated fairly and enjoy the same protections that \nother federal employees enjoy. I applaud Chairman Lieberman for \nrecognizing this and embedding it in the bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/25/senate-section/article/S9224-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9224-S9225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EXPLANATION OF VOTES\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my intent on four \nrollcall votes where I was necessarily absent due to my required \npresence in my home State of Montana. These votes are directly \nimportant to Montana and the Nation. I would like the opportunity to \nfurther the debate on these timely issues.\n  The cloture vote on Senator Byrd's amendment to the fiscal year 2003 \nInterior Appropriations legislation has a direct and fundamental impact \non Montana for three reasons. First, the amendment reimburses the \nUnited States Forest Service for funding expended fighting fires this \nyear. This funding is essential because of the high fire danger that \nstill exists in the West due to the prolonged drought and funding \nalready spent on fires cannot be used for existing USFS obligations and \nduties on our national forests.\n  Second, my good friend from West Virginia's amendment has already \nbeen modified to include the most important funding that could be \ndispersed this year for Montana's economy. I'm speaking, of course, \nabout natural disaster funding for our farmers and ranchers. Montana is \nsuffering through its fourth year of drought and conditions could not \nbe worse. If we do not move forward with a disaster package, there will \nsimply be fewer family farms and ranches around next year. Period. This \nis a debate that has gone on far too long and the House and President \nBush need to come to the table and accept the work of the Senate. A \nnatural disaster proposal has now passed the Senate twice by a large \nbipartisan margin. Now is the time to get this funding out to the \npeople who need it, who need certainty about their future.\n  Finally, the reason that a cloture vote is required stems from the \ncontroversial nature of the pending amendment of Senator Craig \nregarding forest health. The issue of forest health is a huge problem \nin the West and has the most direct of conditions with not\n\n[[Page S9225]]\n\nonly the increased fire risk, but the drought that this legislation \naddresses. While the proposals vary, forest health is an issue that \nneeds to be dealt with immediately. Further delay in the Senate does \nnot serve Montanans or anyone in the West that is trying to make a \nliving and a life under these conditions.\n  Because we need to deal with all three of these issues as soon as \npossible, I fully support cloture on Senator Byrd's amendment. I am \ndisappointed that it did not pass.\n  With regards to the amendment proposed by my colleagues from \nConnecticut, Senators Dodd and Lieberman, I am forced to disagree with \nthe basis of their amendment. My colleagues from Connecticut have \nrepresented their amendment as only codifying existing procedures. But, \nfrom what I understand based on the hearing held in the Indian Affairs \nCommittee on September 18, this amendment in fact requires the \nimplementation of new procedures, including adversarial hearings at the \nrequest of any interested party, raises the burden of proof that a \npetitioning group must satisfy in meeting the seven mandatory criteria, \nand requires the Department to provide notice to officials of every \nState and local government and municipality where a tribal group may \nhave ever been historically located or any geographic area a tribal \ngroup may have ever occupied.\n  In my home State of Montana, the Little Shell Band of the Chippewa \nIndians have been battling for over a decade for their Federal \nrecognition. They have had to jump through many hoops as it is and they \nhave yet to receive their official recognition. My Colleague's \namendment would not only prolong the Little Shell's recognition, but \nwould only add to the burden they have already carried for over a \ndecade. Based on the outcome of the Indian Affairs hearing and \nthe impact on my tribe at home, I respectfully disagree with my \ncolleagues on this matter and believe it is in the best interest of the \nrecognition process that their amendment was rejected.\n\n  Moving on to the Homeland Security votes, I would like to address the \namendment introduced by my esteemed colleague from West Virginia once \nagain. Senator Byrd has urged that the Senate take its time to \nthoroughly debate and analyze the proposed legislation to create the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. He has introduced an amendment to \nensure that the Congress continues to play a role in the creation of a \nnew Federal Department of Homeland Security. I agree with the good \nSenator that Congress should debate and analyze this proposal, but I \ndisagree with his proposal on how that debate should proceed.\n  The Byrd amendment would require that the department be established \nin three phases. Each phase would be initiated by a proposal sent to \nthe Congress by the President. Each proposal sent to Congress would be \nreferred to the appropriate congressional committees. The appropriate \nCongressional Committees should be involved in this process. But there \nare no deadlines or fast track procedures for legislative consideration \nand no guarantee the proposals would ever emerge from Congress and be \nsigned into law.\n  This amendment would force Congress to reopen every battle over which \nagencies should be transferred into the new Department and on what \nterms they would be transferred. Moreover, by dividing the development \ninto five separate legislative proposals, this amendment makes it \nimpossible for legislators to consider the Department as a whole.\n  I regret to say that I cannot support my colleague's amendment and \nbelieve it was in the Nation's best interest that the amendment was not \nagreed to.\n  Finally, ever since the devastating attacks of September 11, \nAmericans have been asking how the attacks happened, why they weren't \nprevented, and what corrective measures could be taken to prevent \nsimilar tragedies from ever occurring again. The American people \ndeserve answers to these very legitimate questions. It's important that \nwe find out just what happened through a non-partisan commission.\n  The amendment introduced by Senator Lieberman represents a bipartisan \ninitiative to help answer the many remaining questions in a \nconstructive, methodical, and nonpartisan way. I support the amendment \nand am pleased that it passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/25/senate-section/article/S9225-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9225-S9226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SALUTE TO TAIWAN'S FIRST LADY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I take great pleasure in welcoming \nTaiwan's First Lady, Wu Shu-chen, to Capitol Hill. Madam Wu Shu-chen is \na unique and remarkable woman. She is the Republic of China's youngest \nfirst lady, yet she has the poise and charm equal to those much older \nthan she is. Men and women of all political parties admire her as a \ngenuine person, totally unaffected in manners. When she addresses an \naudience, she speaks from her heart and writes her own speeches in a \nsimple and direct style. She is what you see, a natural gem, without \nartificial polish.\n  Like her husband, Chen Shui-bian, Madame Wu, has overcome a great \ndeal of adversity. And like her husband, they have both been \nstrengthened by their struggles. In 1985, Madame Wu was struck by a hit \nand run driver. Her injuries left her permanently paralyzed from the \nwaste down and confined to a wheel-chair. Soon after Madame Wu was \ntragically wounded, her husband was imprisoned for political reasons. \nMadame Wu did not shrink from her duties to her family or her country. \nWhile her husband was in jail, she not only served as a pillar for her \nfamily, but she ran for a seat in the national legislature and won. No \nobstacle affecting her body or her heart could deter her.\n  Such a woman deserves our praise. Madame Wu is a natural leader; a \nmatriarch in her family; and a matriarch to her country. I salute her \nfor her selfless devotion to the people of Taiwan. We can all take \nstrength from Madame Wu, and she is a role model for young women \neverywhere.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I extend my warmest welcome to the First \nLady of Taiwan, Chen Wu Sue-jen, wife of President Chen Shui-bian, who \nis in Washington this week to visit with some of her and her husband's \nmany friends here.\n  I am among the many admirers of President Chen. He is a courageous \nleader of his country at a very difficult time. The courage of his wife \nhas earned for her great respect. In 1985, while supporting one of her \nhusband's campaigns, Mrs. Chen Wu was hit by a vehicle that left her \nparalyzed from the waist down. That regrettable episode, believed by \nmany to have been politically motivated, left this dear lady \npermanently confined to a wheelchair.\n  The following year when her husband was imprisoned by his political \nfoes, Mrs. Chen Wu sought election on his behalf for a seat in the \nnational legislature. She won and served in the legislature in spite of \nher serious injury. This courageous lady thereby kept Chen Shui-bian's \npolitical cause in the public eye.\n  Both before and after these events in their lives, Mrs. Chen Wu \nprovided indispensable encouragement and support as Chen Shui-bian \nprogressed from legislator to Taipei Mayor to President. He has called \nhis wife his ``most important source of strength.''\n  First Lady Chen Wu Sue-jen was instrumental in building Taiwan's \nearly, unequivocal and generous support for the United States and \nAmerican people following the attacks on September 11, 2001. She comes \nto the United States this week with a message of Taiwan's continuing \nstrong support in the war against terrorism.\n  I know that Senators will share my appreciation for her country's \nfriendship and solidarity. I also hope they will join in welcoming \nTaiwan's First Lady on the occasion of her historic visit to the United \nStates.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize Madame Chen \nWe Sue-jen, the first lady of Taiwan, and welcome her to Washington, \nDC.\n  Madame Chen We Sue-jen has displayed exemplary character and strength \nin her endeavors to promote justice, human rights, and democracy in \nTaiwan. Overcoming both personal and professional hardships with grace, \nshe has remained steadfast in her support of these principles.\n  Although Madame Chen We Sue-jen has overcome obstacles throughout her \npublic career, never has she let it overcome her. She is described as \noptimistic, cheerful and friendly-noted for\n\n[[Page S9226]]\n\nher sense of human and laughter. She continues to act as a strong and \neffective advocate for Taiwan's physically challenged citizens. \nThroughout all her trials, she has remained solid in her support for \nher family and the people of Taiwan. This strength of character has \ncontributed much to the First Lady's greatness.\n  First Lady Chen Wu is here today to bring a message from her husband \nand the people of Taiwan. Her message is one of cooperation and support \nfrom the Taiwanese in our joint antiterrorism campaign. Already, with \nsupport of Madame Chen We Sue-jen, Taiwan has demonstrated charity and \nhumanitarian assistance to the victims of the terrorist attacks on \nSeptember 11, 2001. As mentioned in the House Resolution, the \nGovernment and people of Taiwan have consistently provided tremendous \nsupport and generous contributions to the United States after those \nattacks.\n  Madame Chen We Sue-jen is a woman of great character and strength. I \nwish to offer my warmest welcome to her as she visits the Capitol. I \nextend my gratitude to her for all the important work she has done and \nI wish her well in her pursuits of justice and democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/25/senate-section/article/S9226-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred January 17, \n2001 in Helena, MT. A gay college student was beaten unconscious in his \ndorm room. The attacker struck the student in the head with a bottle, \nbeat him while he was unconscious, and wrote ``Die Fag'' on his body \nwith an ink marker. The victim withdrew from school two weeks after the \nattack.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/25/senate-section/article/S9226-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CRANE CONSERVATION ACT OF 2002\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nS. 2847, which I recently joined as a cosponsor.\n  Cranes, the tallest flying birds on Earth and among the most \ngraceful, inhabit wide expanses of wetlands and grasslands and exert a \ncharismatic appeal reflected in many cultures.\n  Our Whooping Crane, the rarest of the world's cranes, is shared with \nCanada and has survived only because of close cooperation between the \nUnited States and Canada. If the species is to survive, however, those \nmagnificent birds need more intensive conservation efforts. This bill \nwould provide such help, all up and down the Mississippi River Flyway, \nwhile also applying our conservation techniques on behalf of nine more \nendangered species of cranes in Africa and Asia.\n  This bill would support organizations with expertise in crane \nconservation by funding projects in areas such as habitat protection \nand restoration, research and monitoring of crane populations, \ncommunity participation and outreach, and reintroduction of cranes to \nthe wild. The projects will be asked to promote long-term conservation \nby eliciting matching funds from government agencies, local \ncommunities, NGOs or others in the private sector.\n  Whether in Louisiana, elsewhere in the United States, or overseas, \nprotecting cranes' ecosystems benefits thousands of other animal and \nplant species at the interface between aquatic and terrestrial \nhabitats.\n  Louisiana is important to cranes because of the spectacular wetlands \nalong our southwest coast. Sandhill cranes, which had disappeared from \nthe state, already have returned as a wintering species. In a natural \narea near New Orleans, the Audubon Nature Institute has established a \nSpecies Survival Center which is rearing the endangered Mississippi \nsubspecies of the sandhill crane, for release in the Mississippi \nSandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge near Biloxi. That Center also \nrecently received eight Whooping Cranes and plans to expand to ten \nbreeding pairs as the core of a plan to restore Whooping Cranes to \nLouisiana's coast.\n  Funding would flow through a new ``Crane Conservation Fund'' in \nInterior's Multinational Species Conservation Fund. In covering cranes, \nthis bill would for the first time provide such protection for a \nspecies of bird.\n  I ask other Senators to join me in supporting the Crane Conservation \nAct of 2002.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/25/senate-section/article/S9226-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               FALUN GONG\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the \ndetermination and perseverance of the Falun Gong, a peaceful movement \nseeking the basic freedoms to think as they wish and believe as they \nchoose that we as Americans hold so dear.\n  Three principles of Truth, Compassion, and Tolerance lie at the core \nof Falun Gong. Those who practice Falun Gong do so to become better, \nhealthier people through living by these principles.\n  Despite Falun Gong's peaceful principles and teachings, violations of \nhuman rights have occurred in China against Falun Gong practitioners. \nHuman rights is an important goal as recognized by the United Nations \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights which sets forth certain basic \nrights such as the right to life, to liberty, and to the freedom of \nexpression. The Senate has ratified a series of international treaties \nsuch as International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, 1976, and \nthe Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \nTreatment or Punishment, 1987. The Senate's approval of these and other \ntreaties highlights the progress made towards human rights.\n  In direct response to the recent human rights violations against \nFalun Gong practitioners, the Senate, on November 19, 1999, unanimously \napproved Senate Resolution 217. This resolution, ``recognizing the \nplight of many Chinese citizens,'' calls on the Government of the \nPeople's Republic of China to: 1. release all prisoners of conscience \nand put an immediate end to the harassment, detention, physical abuse, \nand imprisonment of Chinese citizens exercising their legitimate rights \nto free belief, expression, and association; and 2. demonstrate its \nwillingness to abide by internationally accepted norms of freedom of \nbelief, expression, and association by repealing or amending laws and \ndecrees that restrict those freedoms and proceeding promptly to ratify \nand implement the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n  We must embrace the opportunity to continue to support the principles \nof Falun Gong to realize freedom and I wish them well in their quest \nfor freedom and justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/25/senate-section/article/S9226-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9226-S9227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       NEW JERSEY TASK FORCE ONE\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the \nattention of the Senate the outstanding efforts and contributions of \nthe New Jersey Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue Team.\n  On September 11, 2001 at approximately 9:00 a.m. New Jersey Task \nForce One was activated and deployed to the World Trade Center Attack. \nRequested by New York City's Office of Emergency Management, New Jersey \nTask Force One had an advance team in New York City by 11:15 a.m. The \nteam's entire equipment cache, along with 140 members was set up at the \nJacob Javits Center by 2:00 p.m. that same day. They deployed search \nassets to search for survivors during the afternoon and evening of the \n11th and for the next 10 days, they worked continuously as part of the \nurban search and rescue effort.\n  In a short period of time, New Jersey Task Force One became an \nintegral part of the rescue efforts. The team was integrated into the \nFEMA Urban Search and Rescue System and was included in the FEMA Urban \nSearch and Rescue Action Planning. The well-equipped New Jersey Task \nForce One had the ability to lend critical equipment to some of the \nresponding FEMA\n\n[[Page S9227]]\n\nteams and developed an excellent working relationship with many of \nthese teams. Structural engineers and planners from New Jersey Task \nForce One were used by the FEMA Incident Support Team to brief the \nincoming FEMA teams as they rotated into New York City.\n  FEMA gave an operational performance evaluation to New Jersey Task \nForce One for their participation related to the World Trade Center \nOperations. New Jersey Task Force One was rated as superior in six out \nof nine categories. Those categories included attitude, initiative, \nconsideration for personnel welfare, obtain necessary equipment and \nsupplies, physical ability for the job, and safety.\n  With valor and honor, the members of New Jersey Task Force One have \nproven themselves as one of the finest Urban Search and Rescue teams in \nthe country. It is for these reasons that my colleague, Senator Corzine \nand I introduced S. 2618 to designate New Jersey Task Force One as the \n29th National Urban and Search Rescue Team.\n  New Jersey Task Force One was formed in 1997 and they have used the \nFEMA Urban Search and Rescue guidelines in its development. The team is \norganized under the New Jersey State Police Office of Emergency \nManagement Domestic Preparedness and Hazardous Material Planning and \nEmergency Response Unit. The State provides an annual budget of $1.5 \nmillion to support New Jersey Task Force One.\n  The team consists of 180 members from over one hundred different \nfire, police and EMS agencies throughout the State. Over the past few \nyears, New Jersey Task Force One has purchased the necessary cache of \nequipment, based on the FEMA equipment list, and has trained its \nmembers to FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Standards. New Jersey Task \nForce One is in the process of purchasing weapons of mass destruction \nresponse equipment.\n  The 180 courageous men and women of New Jersey Task Force One have \ndedicated their lives to saving others. They have proven themselves to \nbe highly qualified to join FEMA's Urban Search and Rescue System. I \nstrongly believe that New Jersey Task Force One would enhance FEMA's \nUrban Search and Rescue program. I urge the FEMA Director to include \nNew Jersey Task Force One as the 29th FEMA Urban Search and Rescue \nteam. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/25/senate-section/article/S9227-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MR. BOB HAYES\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the \npassing of a truly exceptional friend and athlete, Mr. Bob Hayes. On \nSeptember 18, 2002, the State of Florida and the world lost a \ntrailblazing athlete who broke records on the track field and set the \nstandard for speed and agility in the National Football League.\n  Bob was a native of Jacksonville, where he attended Gilbert High \nSchool. While at Gilbert High, Bob displayed his athletic talents on \nthe football and baseball fields, and on the basketball court. The \nhonors he won in these athletic pursuits afforded him the opportunity \nto attend Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University on \nscholarship, where he played half-back and returned kicks for legendary \ncoach Jake Gaither. In his illustrious career as a FAMU Rattler, he led \nthe team in kick-off returns, held the team's touchdown record in 1963, \nand averaged over 26 yards per punt return in 1962 and 1963. In his \nsenior season, Bob became the first African-American to play in the \nSenior, North-South, Bowl, a game in which he caught a touchdown pass \nfrom former NFL-great Joe Namath and was also named the South's Most \nValuable Player.\n  Bob was also a premier track star. In his junior year at Florida A, \nBob competed in the Tokyo Olympic Games. He earned the title ``World's \nFastest Human'' for record-breaking performances in which he won the \n100 meters in a world-record time of 10.5 seconds and anchored the 400-\nmeter relay, finishing in 39.0 seconds. Both performances earned him \nOlympic Gold medals. His performance in the 400-meter is widely \nregarded as the greatest relay leg in track history.\n  In 1963, the Dallas Cowboys drafted Bob in the seventh round as a \nreceiver. As a rookie, Bob had 46 catches for 1,003 yards and 12 \ntouchdowns. Several past NFL players, including Roger Staubach and \nCalvin Hill, have commented on how Bob's speed and agility forced the \nNFL to begin to design defenses to counter his phenomenal plays. \nIndeed, Bob established the standard, in terms of speed and quickness, \nwhich present players now emulate. Bob spent 10 years in Dallas, where \nhe was part of two Super Bowl teams. At the end of his career, Bob had \n371 catches for 7,414 yards and 71 touchdowns, still a Cowboys \nreceiving record.\n  At his death, Bob remains the only athlete to have won a Super Bowl \nring and Olympic Gold Medals. His amazing achievements on both the \nfootball and track field truly give meaning to his nickname-\"The \nBullet''. He is enshrined in the USA Track and Field Hall of Fame and \nsimilar Halls of Fame in Florida, Texas and at Florida A In \nSeptember 2001, Bob was inducted as the 11th member of the Cowboys' \nRing of Honor at Texas Stadium.\n  Bob's achievements stand as a testament to hard work, dedication and \nperseverance. In his later years, he sought to pass these ideals on to \naspiring high school track stars through the Bob Hayes Invitational \nTrack and Field Meet. Truly, it can be said that he touched many lives \nand inspired future generations of athletes. While it is with great \nsadness that I mark his passing, I am happy to recognize Bob's legacy \nfor the great State of Florida and the entire world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/25/senate-section/article/S9227-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9227-S9228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. BERNARD S. ARONS\n\n   Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my \ncolleagues Senator Edward Kennedy, Congressman Patrick Kennedy, and \nmany others to recognize the extraordinary achievements of Dr. Bernard \nS. Arons as Director of the Center for Mental Health Services at the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and to \nacknowledge his departure as he moves forward to become Senior Science \nAdvisor to the new Director of the National Institute of Mental Health. \nAs we strive to pass critically important mental health legislation in \nthis Congress, we know how fortunate we have been to have Bernie's \nextraordinary leadership at CMHS during these past nine years. His \nexpertise and remarkable ability to integrate mental health services \nwith evidence-based practices and scientific research made him an \noutstanding national leader who directed our country's mental health \nagenda through many years of challenge and crisis.\n  When Bernie first came to CMHS in 1993, he faced an enormous \nchallenge: heading a new Federal Center whose mission was to lead our \ncountry in the delivery of mental health services. To do this, he faced \nthe reality of inadequate resources at the federal, state, and local \nlevel for those with mental illness. The lack of mental health parity \nin private and public health care systems leaves many states struggling \nwith how to help. Yet he was undaunted. He and his extraordinary staff \nat CMHS led the way on making mental health a major priority for this \ncountry. For these last 9 years, he has clearly taken our country \nforward and helped to restore hope to the millions of Americans with \nmental illness. Bernie's extraordinary talents as an administrator, \nscientist, and communicator, have made him a major force in advancing \nthe public's awareness of the ways in which mental illness affects the \nlives of so many. Although stigma still exists, there are very few who \ndare to challenge the fact that mental disorders are real, that they \nare treatable, that there are effective national and community programs \nthat can help, and that we must do more to ensure that all get the \ntreatment they need.\n  During his tenure at CMHS, Bernie worked closely with former Surgeon \nGeneral David Satcher to publish the first-ever Surgeon General's \nReport on Mental Health, which continues to enhance national awareness \nof mental health issues. He led CMHS in addressing many critical mental \nhealth issues that traditionally impede access to quality services, \nsuch as stigma and lack of community services. His commitment to making \na difference fueled the work on a National Strategy for Suicide \nPrevention, which continues to bring together researchers, providers, \nadvocates and consumers in developing a prevention plan to reduce \nsuicide in the United States. Bernie also guided\n\n[[Page S9228]]\n\nCMHS in providing a national response to recent terrorist threats, \nbased in science and best practices. From studies on parity in mental \nhealth coverage to initiatives on school violence, CMHS has become a \nleading national voice on mental health issues under his leadership.\n  We are particularly pleased that Bernie was at the forefront of the \nefforts to shape the future of mental health services as our country \nfaced the crisis of terrorism. More than ever, his efforts to include \nthe voices of patients and families in the overall planning process at \nCMHS was needed. We too rely on those whose lives are touched by mental \ndisorders to be the true experts in our work to shape public policy.\n  With his thoughtful, wise, and gentle manner, Bernie is truly a man \nwho has the ability to bring together people with diverse \nresponsibilities and missions to address the serious mental health \ncrisis. Through his efforts, and with minimal resources, he shaped CMHS \ninto an institution that has brought us so much further in the struggle \nto provide decent mental health services, reduce stigma, and to \nrecognize as a society that mental disorders are real and treatable.\n  As he departs from the Center for Mental Health Services, we wish him \nwell and thank him for all he has done to improve mental health care in \nour country. We are confident that Bernie has placed CMHS on a course \nthat promises to build on these remarkable achievements, one that will \nmeet the extraordinarily challenging mental health needs ahead.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nestablish labeling requirements regarding allergenic substances in \nfood, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleagues \nSenator Gregg, Senator Clinton, Senator Roberts, Senator Dodd, Senator \nFrist and others in introducing legislation to improve the labeling of \nallergens in food.\n  American families deserve to feel confident that the food they eat is \nsafe. The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act will allow \nthe seven million Americans with food allergies to identify more easily \na product's ingredients, avoid foods that may harm them, and stay \nhealthy. One hundred fifty Americans die each year from ingesting \nallergenic foods, and this legislation will greatly reduce that number.\n  The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act will require \nthat food ingredient statements on food packages identify in common \nlanguage when an ingredient, including a flavoring, coloring, or other \nadditive, is itself, or is derived from, one of the eight main food \nallergens.\n  The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act will require \nthe Food and Drug Administration to provide for ``gluten-free'' \nlabeling on foods, to help people with celiac disease avoid the glutens \nthat cause their disease. It will require FDA to report to Congress \nabout how manufacturers can minimize cross-contact with food allergens \nbetween foods produced in the same facility or on the same production \nline, and about when manufacturers should use ``may contain'' or other \nadvisory language in food labeling.\n  The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act will also \nrequire the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track deaths \nrelated to food allergies, and it will direct the National Institutes \nof Health to develop a plan for research activities concerning food \nallergies.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this legislation that \nwill do so much to improve the lives of those with food allergies and \nceliac disease. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3001\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Food Allergen Labeling and \n     Consumer Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is estimated that--\n       (A) approximately 2 percent of adults and about 5 percent \n     of infants and young children in the United States suffer \n     from food allergies; and\n       (B) each year, roughly 30,000 individuals require emergency \n     room treatment and 150 individuals die because of allergic \n     reactions to food;\n       (2)(A) Eight major foods or food groups--milk, eggs, fish, \n     Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and \n     soybeans--account for 90 percent of food allergies;\n       (B) at present, there is no cure for food allergies; and\n       (C) a food allergic consumer must avoid the food to which \n     the consumer is allergic;\n       (3)(A) in a review of randomly selected manufacturers of \n     baked goods, ice cream, and candy in Minnesota and Wisconsin \n     in 1999, the Food and Drug Administration found that 25 \n     percent of sampled foods failed to list peanuts or eggs as \n     ingredients on the food labels; and\n       (B) nationally, the number of recalls because of unlabeled \n     allergens rose to 121 in 2000 from about 35 a decade earlier;\n       (4) a recent study shows that many parents of children with \n     a food allergy were unable correctly to identify in each of \n     several food labels the ingredients derived from major food \n     allergens;\n       (5)(A) current regulations of the Food and Drug \n     Administration require that ingredients in foods be listed by \n     their ``common or usual name'';\n       (B) in some cases, the common or usual name of an \n     ingredient may be unfamiliar to consumers, and many consumers \n     may not realize the ingredient is derived from, or contains, \n     a major food allergen; and\n       (C) current regulations of the Food and Drug Administration \n     exempt spices, flavorings, and certain colorings and \n     additives from ingredient labeling requirements that would \n     allow consumers to avoid those to which they are allergic; \n     and\n       (6)(A) celiac disease is an immune-mediated disease that \n     causes damage to the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous \n     system, and other organs;\n       (B) the current recommended treatment is avoidance of \n     glutens in foods that are associated with celiac disease; and\n       (C) a multicenter, multiyear study estimated that the \n     prevalence of celiac disease in the United States is 0.5 to 1 \n     percent of the general population.\n\n     SEC. 3. FOOD LABELING; REQUIREMENT OF INFORMATION REGARDING \n                   ALLERGENIC SUBSTANCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(t)(1) If it is not a raw agricultural commodity and it \n     is, or it intentionally bears or contains, a major food \n     allergen, unless either--\n       ``(A) `Contains', which statement is followed by the name \n     of the food source as described in section 201(ll)(1) from \n     which the major food allergen is derived, follows immediately \n     after or is adjacent to (in a type size no smaller than the \n     type size used in the list of ingredients) the list of \n     ingredients required under subsections (g) and (i); or\n       ``(B) the common or usual name of the major food allergen \n     in the list of ingredients required under sections (g) and \n     (i) is followed in parentheses by the name of the food source \n     as described in section 201(ll)(1) from which the major food \n     allergen is derived, except that the name of the food source \n     is not required when--\n       ``(i) the common or usual name of the ingredient is the \n     term used to describe a major food allergen in section \n     201(ll)(1), or\n       ``(ii) the name of the food source as described in section \n     201(ll)(1) has appeared previously in the ingredient list; \n     and\n\n       ``Provided all major food allergens are labeled in a \n     consistent manner either as specified in clause (A) or as \n     specified in clause (B).\n       ``(2) The information required under this subsection may \n     appear in labeling other than the label only if the Secretary \n     finds that such other labeling is sufficient to protect the \n     public health. A finding by the Secretary under this \n     subparagraph is effective upon publication in the Federal \n     Register as a notice (including any change in an earlier \n     finding under this subparagraph).\n       ``(3) Notwithstanding subsection (g), (i), or (k), or any \n     other law, a spice, flavoring,\n\n[[Page S9232]]\n\n     coloring, or incidental additive that is, or that \n     intentionally bears or contains, a major food allergen shall \n     be subject to the labeling requirements of this subsection.\n       ``(4) The Secretary may by regulation modify the \n     requirements of subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), or \n     eliminate either the requirement of subparagraph (A) or the \n     requirement of subparagraph (B), if the Secretary determines \n     that the modification or elimination of the requirement is \n     necessary to protect the public health.\n       ``(u) Notwithstanding subsection (g), (i), or (k), or any \n     other law, a spice, flavoring, coloring, or incidental \n     additive that is, or that intentionally bears or contains, a \n     food allergen (other than a major food allergen), as \n     determined by the Secretary by regulation, shall be disclosed \n     in a manner specified by the Secretary by regulation.''.\n       (b) Effect on Other Authority.--This section does not alter \n     the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 \n     et seq.) to require the labeling of other food allergens.\n       (c) Conforming Amendment.--Section 201 of the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following:\n       ``(ll) The term `major food allergen' means any of the \n     following:\n       ``(1) Milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, \n     wheat, peanuts, and soybeans.\n       ``(2) A proteinaceous substance derived from a food \n     specified in paragraph (1) (unless the Secretary determines \n     that the substance does not cause an allergic response that \n     poses a risk to human health).''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--A food that is labeled on or after \n     January 1, 2006, and that is, or that intentionally bears or \n     contains, a major food allergen (as defined in the amendment \n     made by subsection (c)) shall be labeled in compliance with \n     the requirements of the amendment made by subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORT ON FOOD ALLERGENS.\n\n       Not later than June 30, 2004, the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services shall submit to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of \n     Representatives a report that--\n       (1)(A) analyzes--\n       (i) the ways in which foods, during manufacturing and \n     processing, can be unintentionally contaminated with major \n     food allergens, including contamination caused by the use by \n     manufacturers of the same production line to produce both \n     products for which major food allergens are intentional \n     ingredients and products for which major food allergens are \n     not intentional ingredients; and\n       (ii) the ways in which foods produced on dedicated \n     production lines might nonetheless become unintentionally \n     contaminated with major food allergens; and\n       (B) estimates how common those practices are in the food \n     industry, with breakdowns by food type as appropriate;\n       (2) recommends methods that can be used to reduce or \n     eliminate cross-contact of foods with the major food \n     allergens;\n       (3) describes--\n       (A) the various types of advisory labeling (such as use of \n     the words ``may contain'') used by food producers;\n       (B) the conditions of manufacture of food that are \n     associated with the various types of advisory labeling; and\n       (C) the extent to which advisory labels are being used on \n     food products;\n       (4) determines how consumers with food allergies or the \n     caretakers of consumers would prefer information about the \n     risk of cross-contact be communicated on food labels by using \n     appropriate survey mechanisms; and\n       (5) identifies the circumstances, if any, under which \n     advisory labeling could appropriately be used.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to provide for the preservation and restoration of \nhistoric buildings an structures at historically black colleges and \nuniversities; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Preservation \nAct of 2002,'' legislation to revise and extend certain provisions of \nthe Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996.\n  I want to begin by acknowledging the important role played by the \nNation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities, HBCUs, in \neducating young people of all races and nationalities in America. HBCUs \nare in the vanguard of providing access and some measure of choice in \nhigher education, and of opening the doors to educational opportunity \nfor all students, regardless of family income and traditional measures \nof academic readiness for college study. In Louisiana, we have a strong \nfamily of HBCUs: Grambling State University in Grambling, Southern \nUniversity's three campuses in Baton Rouge, Shreveport and New Orleans, \nas well as Dillard and Xavier universities in New Orleans.\n  While similar bills have been introduced this Congress, my bill takes \na different and, I believe, a necessarily strategic approach in \nidentifying, prioritizing and providing the funds necessary to restore \nall of the historic buildings and sites on black colleges and campuses. \nThis historic preservation bill provides an orderly process for \nidentifying and assessing the degree of deterioration of all \nproperties; for determining the capacity of the HBCU to provide \n``matching'' funds to assist in the cost of restoration; and for \nprioritizing Congressional funding and the Interior Department's \ndetermination of properties eligible for restoration funding.\n  This legislation is not only needed, it is also timely. In 1998, the \nNational Trust for Historic Preservation placed the historic buildings \nof the nation's HBCUs on its list of ``11 Most Endangered Historic \nPlaces''. The Trust cited a General Accounting Office study that found \nthat the estimated cost of restoring and preserving the 712 historic \nproperties, including dormitories, chapels, gymnasiums and classroom \nbuildings, owned by the schools is $755 million, of which a mere $60 \nmillion, or 8 percent, has been set aside in school budgets. If we in \nCongress fail to help, the cost of restoration will only continue to \nrise while these historic buildings continue to deteriorate.\n  I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor this important legislation. \nWithout it, we may not be able to ensure that these buildings will \nsurvive into the new millennium and beyond to welcome future \ngenerations of scholars.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 3003. A bill to authorize a land conveyance between the United \nStates and the City of Craig, Alaska, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \nbill that will facilitate Forest Service land management on Prince of \nWales Island and help community expansion and development. The City of \nCraig is one of the fastest growing cities in the State of Alaska. It \nis the economic center of Prince of Wales Island, the third largest \nisland in the United States and home to a vibrant population of rural \nAlaskans. The only clinic or hospital on the island is located in \nCraig. The town contains the major retail shopping and service outlets \non the island and Prince of Wales residents drive up to a hundred miles \nround trip to come to town for medical services and shopping.\n  One of the Forest Service's main administrative facilities, the Craig \nRanger District Office is located in Craig and the Craig District \nRanger has management authority over much of the island. It is critical \nthat the Forest Service has the tools it needs to provide good \nmanagement for that part of the island. One of these tools is the \npresence of some Federal land near the Craig Ranger Station. Right now, \nthere is no Forest Service land near the Ranger Station. In an unusual \nsituation for Alaska, the Ranger Station is an inholding in private, \nState, and City owned land. This legislation would provide for a three-\nway conveyance process which would result in a parcel of land now owned \nby the City being conveyed into the National Forest and a private \ninholding now owned by a private owner being acquired by the City.\n  This is one of those situations people like to describe as ``win-\nwin.'' Providing a new recreational opportunity in the Tongass National \nForest at Craig benefits the public, and the residents of Craig would \nobtain land vital to future community development.\n  What this legislation does, is authorize the Federal Government to \naccept conveyance of land from the City of Craig which will enable the \nCity to acquire a private inholding near the City. The City would \nconvey to the Federal Government up to 348.68 acres of land it now owns \nto the National Forest. This land is highly prized for local recreation \nand would provide the Craig Ranger District with a missing piece of its \nmanagement scheme by providing a recreation site within short walking \ndistance of the Ranger Station.\n  Right now, visitors to the Forest come to the Craig Ranger Office to \norient themselves to the Forest. One of the things they look for is \nonsite recreation in the Forest from the Ranger Station. But presently \nthere is no such opportunity. Because of the land conveyance status \ndirectly around Craig, there is no Forest land in that area. Visitors \nare disappointed that they must arrange transportation for at least a \n20 mile trip before they can take even a short walk on the Forest.\n  However, the City of Craig owns almost 350 acres of prime \nrecreational land including a dedicated trail from the Ranger Station. \nThe object of this legislation would be for that land to be conveyed by \nthe City to the Forest and for the City to obtain a much smaller 10 \nacres site in the town now owned by a private party. That property is a \ncannery site dating from the early 1900's which has not been used since \nthe early 1980's. It is prime land for the city to develop to improve \nits community management plan and to provide economic development in \nCraig. The parcel include both uplands and tidelands and could be used \nby Craig to develop a good port and harbor and to provide first class \nlocations for retail merchants and other community services.\n\n  I strongly support meeting the needs of Craig in developing its local \neconomy. The entire island is in transition. When I was first elected \nto the Senate in 1980, Craig and Prince of Wales Island were the center \nof a vibrant timber based economy that provided thousands of direct and \nindirect jobs to the Island. Much of that is now gone as a result of \nunfortunate Federal policies which have devastated the timber economy \non Prince of Wales Island and much of Southeastern Alaska.\n  The Congress must help Craig in its transition to another economy. \nThe City leaders are dynamic and visionary people who have provided \nreal leadership on the island. They have worked hard to help maintain \nthe remaining timber plant at Klawock which provides year round \nemployment to city and island residents. They have organized, along \nwith their neighbors, the Prince of Wales Community Council, an \nassociation of municipalities and Native and non Native communities to \nwork as a team on islandwide projects.\n  The most recent product of this effort is the InterIsland Ferry \nAuthority composed of members from Wrangell, Petersburg, Ketchikan, \nCraig, Throne\n\n[[Page S9234]]\n\nBay, and Coffman Cove. The Authority has built and put into service a \nday ferry from Hollis, a neighboring community to Craig, and my home \ntown of Ketchikan. This ferry replaces the State ferry, which has been \nforced to cut back its service. The InterIsland Ferry service will \nincrease to twice a day during the summer and will provide a terrific \nboost to the local economy of Craig and the island.\n  Passage of this legislation is critical to the future of the City of \nCraig. It will increase recreational opportunities for the local and \nvisiting public. I urge my colleagues to join me in moving forward on \nthis legislation. All the conveyances will be subject to appraisals as \nrequired by this Act. The Federal Government will receive equal value \nin land from the City for any funding which it provides under this Act. \nThe passage of this Act is good for the public and for the residents of \nCraig. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 3005. A bill to revise the boundary of the Kaloko-Honokohau \nNational Historical Park in the State of Hawaii, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Kaloko-\nHonokohau National Historical Park Addition Act of 2002. This bill \nprovides for the adjustment of Park boundaries to permit the \ndevelopment of permanent Park operational facilities for administrative \npurposes and to provide the public with a visitor's center and \ninterpretative facilities.\n  Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park is located along the Kona \ncoast on the island of Hawaii. It was designated as a National Historic \nLandmark in 1962 and was established as a National Historical Park in \n1978. The Park was created to preserve, interpret, and perpetuate \ntraditional Native Hawaiian culture. The ocean makes up over half of \nthis 1160-acre Park, and the boundaries include the culturally \nsignificant Kaloko and `Aimakapa fishponds and `Ai`opio fish trap. \nThere are also several heiau, or Hawaiian religious sites, found in the \nPark.\n  The Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park is currently leasing \noffice space outside the Park to carry out its necessary \nadministrative, interpretive, resource management and maintenance \nfunctions. This office space is woefully inadequate. The amount of \nvisitor parking available is limited to four spaces, and its location \npresents a challenge for visitor access.\n  The National Park Service has considered the possibility of \nconstructing new operational facilities within the Park boundaries. \nHowever, such action would be inconsistent with current National Park \nService management policies because of its adverse impacts on Park \nresources and values. Building within the boundary of Kaloko-Honokohau \nPark would intrude on the Park's historic setting and has the potential \nto harm the fishponds, which are considered to be some of the Park's \nmost valuable resources.\n  Acquiring an additional two parcels of land adjacent to the Park \nmakes sense. An existing two-story building will provide an easy and \ninexpensive retrofit for use as Park headquarters. The building has \nnever been occupied, and contains offices, lab and storage areas, as \nwell as a reception lobby that would be ideal to host visitor \norientation and interpretive programs. The building has the capacity \nfor artifact storage that meets curatorial standards for historical and \narchaeological items. More than 90 percent of the two acres remains \nundeveloped, thereby providing enough space for visitor parking and \nfuture Park operations. It is important to note that no additional \nstaffing would be required to support the proposed expansion.\n  Last year, 54,000 people visited Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical \nPark. We need a facility there that offers administrative personnel the \nresources they need to carry out their management functions, and \nvisitors the opportunity to learn about this important part of Hawaiian \nhistory. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Park \nService to make this possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3005\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The President, or the designee of the \n     President, may withdraw the plan any time prior to the \n     conclusion of 90 calendar days of continuous session of \n     Congress following the date on which the plan is submitted to \n     Congress.\n       (b) Additional Contents of Reorganization Plan.--A \n     reorganization plan--\n       (1) may change the name of an agency affected by a \n     reorganization and the title of its head, and shall designate \n     the name of an agency resulting from a reorganization and the \n     title of its head;\n       (2) may provide for the appointment and pay of the head and \n     1 or more officers of any agency (including an agency \n     resulting from a consolidation or other type of \n     reorganization) if the message transmitting the plan \n     declares, that by reason of a reorganization made by the plan \n     the provisions are necessary;\n       (3) shall provide for the transfer or other disposition of \n     the records, property, and personnel affected by a \n     reorganization;\n       (4) shall provide for the transfer of such unexpended \n     balances of appropriations, and of other funds, available for \n     use in connection with a function or agency affected by a \n     reorganization, as necessary by reason of the reorganization \n     for use in connection with the functions affected by the \n     reorganization, or for the use of the agency which shall have \n     the functions after the reorganization plan is effective; and\n       (5) shall provide for terminating the affairs of an agency \n     abolished.\n\n     A reorganization plan containing provisions authorized by \n     paragraph (2) may provide that the head of an agency be an \n     individual or a commission or board with more than 1 member. \n     In the case of an appointment of the head of such an agency, \n     the term of office may not be fixed at more than 4 years, the \n     pay may not be at a rate in excess of that found to be \n     applicable to comparable officers in the executive branch, by \n     and with the advice and consent of the Senate.

However, \n     if the statute, regulation, or other action has vested the \n     functions in the agency from which it is removed under the \n     reorganization plan, the function, insofar as it is to be \n     exercised after the plan becomes effective, shall be deemed \n     as vested in the agency under which the function is placed in \n     the plan.\n       (2) Pending legal proceedings.--A suit, action, or other \n     proceeding lawfully commenced by or against the head of an \n     agency or other officer of the United States, in the \n     officer's official capacity or in relation to the discharge \n     of the officer's official duties, does not abate by reason of \n     the taking effect of a reorganization plan under this \n     section. On motion or supplemental petition filed at any time \n     within 12 months after the reorganization plan takes effect, \n     showing a necessity for a survival of the suit, action, or \n     other proceeding to obtain a settlement of the questions \n     involved, the court may allow the suit, action, or other \n     proceeding to be maintained by or against the successor of \n     the head or officer under the reorganization effected by the \n     plan or, if there is no successor, against such agency or \n     officer as the President designates.\n       (e) Rules of Senate and House of Representatives On \n     Reorganization Plans.--Subsections (f) through (i) are \n     enacted by Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such \n     they are deemed a part of the rules of each House, \n     respectively, but applicable only with respect to the \n     procedure to be followed in that House in the case of \n     resolutions with respect to any reorganization plans \n     transmitted to Congress (in accordance with subsection (a)(3) \n     of this section); and they supersede other rules only to the \n     extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with the full recognition of the constitutional right \n     of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to \n     the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner \n     and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of \n     that House.\n       (f) Terms of Resolution.--For the purposes of subsections \n     (e) through (i), ``resolution'' means only a joint resolution \n     of Congress, the matter after the resolving clause of which \n     is as follows: ``That Congress approves the reorganization \n     plan transmitted to Congress by the President on \n     ____________, 20____.'', and includes such modifications and \n     revisions as are submitted by the President under subsection \n     (a)(4). The blank spaces therein are to be filled \n     appropriately. The term does not include a resolution which \n     specifies more than 1 reorganization plan.\n       (g) Introduction and Reference of Resolution.--\n       (1) Introduction.--No later than the first day of session \n     following the day on which a reorganization plan is \n     transmitted to the House of Representatives and the Senate \n     under subsection (a), a resolution, as defined in subsection \n     (f), shall be--\n       (A) introduced (by request) in the House by the chairman of \n     the Government Reform Committee of the House, or by a Member \n     or Members of the House designated by such chairman; and\n       (B) introduced (by request) in the Senate by the chairman \n     of the Governmental Affairs Committee of the Senate, or by a \n     Member or Members of the Senate designated by such chairman.\n\n[[Page S9255]]\n\n       (2) Referral.--A resolution with respect to a \n     reorganization plan shall be referred to the Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Government Reform of the House (and all resolutions with \n     respect to the same plan shall be referred to the same \n     committee) by the President of the Senate or the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives, as the case may be. The \n     committee shall make its recommendations to the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, respectively, within 75 \n     calendar days of continuous session of Congress following the \n     date of such resolution's introduction.\n       (h) Discharge of Committee Considering Resolution.--If the \n     committee to which is referred a resolution introduced \n     pursuant to subsection (g)(1) has not reported such a \n     resolution or identical resolution at the end of 75 calendar \n     days of continuous session of Congress after its \n     introduction, such committee shall be deemed to be discharged \n     from further consideration of such resolution and such \n     resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of the \n     House involved.\n       (i) Procedure After Report or Discharge of Committees; \n     Debate; Vote on Final Passage.--\n       (1) Procedure.--When the committee has reported, or has \n     been deemed to be discharged (under subsection (h)) from \n     further consideration of, a resolution with respect to a \n     reorganization plan, it is at any time thereafter in order \n     (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been \n     disagreed to) for any Member of the respective House to move \n     to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. The motion \n     is highly privileged and is not debatable. The motion shall \n     not be subject to amendment, or to any motion to postpone, or \n     a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A \n     motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed \n     to or disagreed to shall not be in order.

The President, or the designee of the \n     President, may withdraw the plan any time prior to the \n     conclusion of 90 calendar days of continuous session of \n     Congress following the date on which the plan is submitted to \n     Congress.\n       (b) Additional Contents of Reorganization Plan.--A \n     reorganization plan--\n       (1) may change the name of an agency affected by a \n     reorganization and the title of its head, and shall designate \n     the name of an agency resulting from a reorganization and the \n     title of its head;\n       (2) may provide for the appointment and pay of the head and \n     1 or more officers of any agency (including an agency \n     resulting from a consolidation or other type of \n     reorganization) if the message transmitting the plan \n     declares, that by reason of a reorganization made by the plan \n     the provisions are necessary;\n       (3) shall provide for the transfer or other disposition of \n     the records, property, and personnel affected by a \n     reorganization;\n       (4) shall provide for the transfer of such unexpended \n     balances of appropriations, and of other funds, available for \n     use in connection with a function or agency affected by a \n     reorganization, as necessary by reason of the reorganization \n     for use in connection with the functions affected by the \n     reorganization, or for the use of the agency which shall have \n     the functions after the reorganization plan is effective; and\n       (5) shall provide for terminating the affairs of an agency \n     abolished.\n     A reorganization plan containing provisions authorized by \n     paragraph (2) may provide that the head of an agency be an \n     individual or a commission or board with more than 1 member. \n     In the case of an appointment of the head of such an agency, \n     the term of office may not be fixed at more than 4 years, the \n     pay may not be at a rate in excess of that found to be \n     applicable to comparable officers in the executive branch, by \n     and with the advice and consent of the Senate.

However, \n     if the statute, regulation, or other action has vested the \n     functions in the agency from which it is removed under the \n     reorganization plan, the function, insofar as it is to be \n     exercised after the plan becomes effective, shall be deemed \n     as vested in the agency under which the function is placed in \n     the plan.\n       (2) Pending legal proceedings.--A suit, action, or other \n     proceeding lawfully commenced by or against the head of an \n     agency or other officer of the United States, in the \n     officer's official capacity or in relation to the discharge \n     of the officer's official duties, does not abate by reason of \n     the taking effect of a reorganization plan under this \n     section. On motion or supplemental petition filed at any time \n     within 12 months after the reorganization plan takes effect, \n     showing a necessity for a survival of the suit, action, or \n     other proceeding to obtain a settlement of the questions \n     involved, the court may allow the suit, action, or other \n     proceeding to be maintained by or against the successor of \n     the head or officer under the reorganization effected by the \n     plan or, if there is no successor, against such agency or \n     officer as the President designates.\n       (e) Rules of Senate and House of Representatives On \n     Reorganization Plans.--Subsections (f) through (i) are \n     enacted by Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such \n     they are deemed a part of the rules of each House, \n     respectively, but applicable only with respect to the \n     procedure to be followed in that House in the case of \n     resolutions with respect to any reorganization plans \n     transmitted to Congress (in accordance with subsection (a)(3) \n     of this section); and they supersede other rules only to the \n     extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with the full recognition of the constitutional right \n     of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to \n     the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner \n     and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of \n     that House.\n       (f) Terms of Resolution.--For the purposes of subsections \n     (e) through (i), ``resolution'' means only a joint resolution \n     of Congress, the matter after the resolving clause of which \n     is as follows: ``That Congress approves the reorganization \n     plan transmitted to Congress by the President on \n     ____________, 20____.'', and includes such modifications and \n     revisions as are submitted by the President under subsection \n     (a)(4). The blank spaces therein are to be filled \n     appropriately. The\n\n[[Page S9287]]\n\n     term does not include a resolution which specifies more than \n     1 reorganization plan.\n       (g) Introduction and Reference of Resolution.--\n       (1) Introduction.--No later than the first day of session \n     following the day on which a reorganization plan is \n     transmitted to the House of Representatives and the Senate \n     under subsection (a), a resolution, as defined in subsection \n     (f), shall be--\n       (A) introduced (by request) in the House by the chairman of \n     the Government Reform Committee of the House, or by a Member \n     or Members of the House designated by such chairman; and\n       (B) introduced (by request) in the Senate by the chairman \n     of the Governmental Affairs Committee of the Senate, or by a \n     Member or Members of the Senate designated by such chairman.\n       (2) Referral.--A resolution with respect to a \n     reorganization plan shall be referred to the Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Government Reform of the House (and all resolutions with \n     respect to the same plan shall be referred to the same \n     committee) by the President of the Senate or the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives, as the case may be. The \n     committee shall make its recommendations to the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, respectively, within 75 \n     calendar days of continuous session of Congress following the \n     date of such resolution's introduction.\n       (h) Discharge of Committee Considering Resolution.--If the \n     committee to which is referred a resolution introduced \n     pursuant to subsection (g)(1) has not reported such a \n     resolution or identical resolution at the end of 75 calendar \n     days of continuous session of Congress after its \n     introduction, such committee shall be deemed to be discharged \n     from further consideration of such resolution and such \n     resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of the \n     House involved.\n       (i) Procedure After Report or Discharge of Committees; \n     Debate; Vote On Final Passage.--\n       (1) Procedure.--When the committee has reported, or has \n     been deemed to be discharged (under subsection (h)) from \n     further consideration of, a resolution with respect to a \n     reorganization plan, it is at any time thereafter in order \n     (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been \n     disagreed to) for any Member of the respective House to move \n     to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. The motion \n     is highly privileged and is not debatable. The motion shall \n     not be subject to amendment, or to any motion to postpone, or \n     a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A \n     motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed \n     to or disagreed to shall not be in order.

However, \n     if the statute, regulation, or other action has vested the \n     functions in the agency from which it is removed under the \n     reorganization plan, the function, insofar as it is to be \n     exercised after the plan becomes effective, shall be deemed \n     as vested in the agency under which the function is placed in \n     the plan.\n       (2) Pending legal proceedings.--A suit, action, or other \n     proceeding lawfully commenced by or against the head of an \n     agency or other officer of the United States, in the \n     officer's official capacity or in relation to the discharge \n     of the officer's official duties, does not abate by reason of \n     the taking effect of a reorganization plan under this \n     section. On motion or supplemental petition filed at any time \n     within 12 months after the reorganization plan takes effect, \n     showing a necessity for a survival of the suit, action, or \n     other proceeding to obtain a settlement of the questions \n     involved, the court may allow the suit, action, or other \n     proceeding to be maintained by or against the successor of \n     the head or officer under the reorganization effected by the \n     plan or, if there is no successor, against such agency or \n     officer as the President designates.\n       (e) Rules of Senate and House of Representatives On \n     Reorganization Plans.--Subsections (f) through (i) are \n     enacted by Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such \n     they are deemed a part of the rules of each House, \n     respectively, but applicable only with respect to the \n     procedure to be followed in that House in the case of \n     resolutions with respect to any reorganization plans \n     transmitted to Congress (in accordance with subsection (a)(3) \n     of this section); and they supersede other rules only to the \n     extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with the full recognition of the constitutional right \n     of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to \n     the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner \n     and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of \n     that House.\n       (f) Terms of Resolution.--For the purposes of subsections \n     (e) through (i), ``resolution'' means only a joint resolution \n     of Congress, the matter after the resolving clause of which \n     is as follows: ``That Congress approves the reorganization \n     plan transmitted to Congress by the President on \n     ____________, 20____.'', and includes such modifications and \n     revisions as are submitted by the President under subsection \n     (a)(4). The blank spaces therein are to be filled \n     appropriately. The term does not include a resolution which \n     specifies more than 1 reorganization plan.\n       (g) Introduction and Reference of Resolution.--\n       (1) Introduction.--No later than the first day of session \n     following the day on which a reorganization plan is \n     transmitted to the House of Representatives and the Senate \n     under subsection (a), a resolution, as defined in subsection \n     (f), shall be--\n       (A) introduced (by request) in the House by the chairman of \n     the Government Reform Committee of the House, or by a Member \n     or Members of the House designated by such chairman; and\n       (B) introduced (by request) in the Senate by the chairman \n     of the Governmental Affairs Committee of the Senate, or by a \n     Member or Members of the Senate designated by such chairman.\n       (2) Referral.--A resolution with respect to a \n     reorganization plan shall be referred to the Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Government Reform of the House (and all resolutions with \n     respect to the same plan shall be referred to the same \n     committee) by the President of the Senate or the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives, as the case may be. The \n     committee shall make its recommendations to the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, respectively, within 75 \n     calendar days of continuous session of Congress following the \n     date of such resolution's introduction.\n       (h) Discharge of Committee Considering Resolution.--If the \n     committee to which is referred a resolution introduced \n     pursuant to subsection (g)(1) has not reported such a \n     resolution or identical resolution at the end of 75 calendar \n     days of continuous session of Congress after its \n     introduction, such committee shall be deemed to be discharged \n     from further consideration of such resolution and such \n     resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of the \n     House involved.\n       (i) Procedure After Report or Discharge of Committees; \n     Debate; Vote On Final Passage.--\n       (1) Procedure.--When the committee has reported, or has \n     been deemed to be discharged (under subsection (h)) from \n     further consideration of, a resolution with respect to a \n     reorganization plan, it is at any time thereafter in order \n     (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been \n     disagreed to) for any Member of the respective House to move \n     to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. The motion \n     is highly privileged and is not debatable. The motion shall \n     not be subject to amendment, or to any motion to postpone, or \n     a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A \n     motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed \n     to or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of the resolution is agreed to, \n     the resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the \n     respective House until disposed of.\n       (2) Debate.--Debate on the resolution, and on all debatable \n     motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited \n     to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally \n     between individuals favoring and individuals opposing the \n     resolution.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, S. 2506, a bill to authorize \nappropriations for the intelligence community for fiscal year 2003, \nrepresents the first intelligence budget for the War on Terrorism--a \nwar where intelligence is our most effective weapon. The Congress \nhistorically has considered the annual Intelligence Authorization bill \nto be important legislation, but now it has become a matter of national \nsurvival. Without an enhanced and effective intelligence capability \nintegrated into the significant capabilities of the U.S. military and \ntightly linked to law enforcement and the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity, we will continue be at the mercy of international terrorists \nbent on the destruction of our society and we may suffer even more \ndevastating attacks.\n  Since the tragedy of September 11, the men and women of the U.S. \nintelligence community have worked every day, nonstop to protect us \nagainst those who would seek to do us harm. This bill represents an \nimportant step in our effort to provide them with the necessary \nresources and authorities to get the job done. In its budget request \nfor fiscal years 2003 through 2007, the administration proposes \nsignificant resource increases for our national intelligence effort. \nSuch increases build upon substantial supplemental appropriations \napproved for the intelligence community for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 \nafter September 11.\n  As the community has noted in past years, the challenges confronting \nthe intelligence community have, for too long, received inadequate \nfiscal attention. I am encouraged by the commitment of resources \nproposed by the administration for fiscal year 2003 and beyond. The \nintelligence community is poised to benefit from an infusion of \nadditional people and funding that can provide momentum for a range of \nintelligence efforts against those individuals, groups, and states--to \ninclude al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden--that threaten our security and \nsafety. As the intelligence community is our first line of defense, the \nadministration's fiscal year 2003 request for the National Foreign \nIntelligence Program is a necessary first step in correcting the \ndeficiencies of the past.\n  Earlier this year, the Select Committee on Intelligence conducted a \nthorough review of the administration's budget request for the National \nForeign Intelligence Program for fiscal year 2003. This review included \nan extensive examination of the individual programs and agencies--such \nas the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Reconnaissance \nOffice--which comprise the U.S. intelligence community. Building on the \napproach we took last year, our review once again focused on specific \npriority areas as well as individual agencies and functions.\n  The committee highlighted five areas that must continue to receive \npriority attention in the near term if intelligence is to fulfill its \nrole in our overall national security strategy and the ongoing war on \nterrorism. They are: (1) revitalizing the National Security Agency; (2) \ncorrecting deficiencies in human intelligence; (3) addressing the \nimbalance between intelligence collection and analysis; (4) rebuilding \na robust research and development program; and (5) increasing the \ncapabilities of measurements and signatures intelligence to fulfill key \nintelligence requirements. These priorities address the basic building \nblocks of intelligence--capabilities that will support the War on \nTerrorism as well as the multitude of other intelligence requirements. \nS. 2506 authorizes additional resources for these areas.\n  While the additional funding for intelligence programs goes a long \nway towards alleviating existing near term deficiencies, other long \nterm problems remain to be addressed. We face a looming crisis in our \nability to collect critical information from key platforms as a result \nof unexpected failures; a major acquisition program is experiencing \nsignificant cost overruns and schedule slippage; and, we have \ninadequate funding to ensure that information collected by the next \ngeneration of space-based sensors will be processed, exploited, and \ndisseminated appropriately to intelligence analysts.\n  Higher levels or resources, however, will not address all of the \nimportant challenges which confront the intelligence community. The \nintelligence community must overcome an aversion to risk that has crept \ninto the culture since the end of the cold war. The world will be a \ndangerous and unstable place for foreseeable future. In order to \nprotect our country, we will need to deal with unsavory characters and \nwe will need to operate in unsafe parts of the world. The CIA has \nsuffered casualties in the war in Afghanistan and we must steel \nourselves to the inevitability of more loss of life. Some problems, \nsuch as the intelligence community's current organization or its \nability to exchange information effectively and efficiently with other \ngovernment agencies, may require additional legislative actions in the \nfuture. The bicameral investigation into the events of September 11 is \nongoing and I expect that the investigation will result in \nrecommendations for actions to be taken to strengthened our \nintelligence community.\n  The bill includes legislative provisions that are important additions \nto the work the Intelligence Committee did last year--both in the \nfiscal year 2002 Intelligence Authorization Act and the USA-PATRIOT \nAct. I will summarize a few of these provisions:\n  Section 304 is designed to make improvements in the information \navailable to the Committee each year as it prepares its budget \nauthorizations in the areas of counterterrorism, counterproliferation, \ncounternarcotics and counterintelligence. The provision requires the \nadministration each year to specify in its budget submission the \naggregate amount requested in each of these four critical areas. \nCurrently, these numbers are spread throughout the budget submission in \nthe requests for particular programs in individual agencies. The \ncommittee believes that it is essential to rational decision-making in \nthe budget process--both for the administration and for Congress--to \nhave ``cross-cut'' budget numbers so that it is clear how much money is \nbeing requested across the Government in these important areas.\n  Section 306 is a provision that supplements changes implemented under \nthe USA-PATRIOT Act. Under that act, foreign intelligence information \nthat has been collected by law enforcement agencies in the course of \ncriminal investigations can, and in fact must, be provided to the \nDirector of Central Intelligence to be included in the all-source \nanalytic products prepared by intelligence analysts. In other words, \nthese ``dots'' of foreign intelligence that are collected in criminal \ncases, including grand jury proceedings and criminal wiretaps, now flow \nto the intelligence community. The purpose of Section 306 is to clarify \nthat the intelligence committees of the Congress, in the conduct of \ntheir oversight of the intelligence community, shall also have access \nto that law-enforcement-derived information that has been provided to \nthe intelligence agencies. The intelligence committees cannot conduct \neffective oversight of the intelligence agencies if there are \ncategories of information upon which intelligence operations and \nanalyses are based that is off limits of the committees.\n  Sections 311 and 312 follow up on provisions that were included in \nthe USA-PATRIOT Act and the FY02 Intelligence Authorization bill. \nCongress required the Director of Central Intelligence to review and \nreport to the intelligence committees his recommendations of how best \nto create\n\n[[Page S9352]]\n\ntwo new centers: ``The National Virtual Translation Center'' and the \n``Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center.'' We have finally received \nthose reports and Sections 311 and 312 establish those centers in law \nas part of the intelligence community. We are hopeful that the very \ndifficult problems of translation resources in the intelligence \ncommunity and the efficient and effective tracking of terrorist \nfinances will be significantly enhanced by the creation of these \ncenters.\n  Section 313 is similar to S. 2459, a bill introduced by Senator \nWyden. This excellent provision addresses the problem we have all heard \nso much about in the press: Is there a complete and accurate list of \nknown or suspected international terrorists that is derived from all-\nsource information available to the U.S. Government and that is \nprovided to all agencies whose job is to protect our borders from \npenetration by terrorists? This provision requires the establishment of \na ``Terrorist Identification Classification System'' that will be \navailable to all Federal agencies, State and local governments and, as \nappropriate, to foreign governments. It will solve a problem that we \nhave identified in our committee of the proliferation of ``watch \nlists'' in our Government--all with different suspected terrorists \nnames, used by different agencies for different purposes.\n  Title V of the bill establishes in statute the National \nCounterintelligence Executive, the ``NCIX''. At the urging of our \ncommittee, the President created the NCIX in 2001 to provide the U.S. \nGovernment in the counterintelligence area with (1) strong, policy-\ndriven leadership; (2) new and enhanced counterintelligence \ncapabilities; and (3) coherent program, strategies and cooperative \napproaches. The committee's oversight of this fledging effort revealed \nproblems, however, that Title V is designed to remedy. By establishing \nthe NCIX in statute and placing it in the Executive Office of the \nPresident, with oversight by the intelligence committees, the committee \nbelieves that the NCIX leadership problems, resource constraints and, \noverall, lack of sufficient status and visibility within the \nGovernment, will be remedied.\n  Finally, Title VI of the bill establishes a National Commission for \nReview of Research and Development Programs of the United States \nIntelligence Community. The committee supports a strong intelligence \ncommunity R & D program. Research and Development supports virtually \nall other intelligence community efforts by laying the groundwork for \nthe necessary modernization and innovation of intelligence \ncapabilities. The purpose of the Commission, to be composed of \ngovernment officials and private sector experts, is to review the \ncurrent state of research and development in the intelligence community \nand, in particular, to determine if the level of resources devoted to \nvarious efforts across the community is in line with those scientific \nand technological fields judged to be of the greatest importance to the \nintelligence needs of the future.\n  I mentioned earlier the tireless efforts of the men and women of the \nintelligence community. I am privileged as chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee to travel to the different agencies around Washington and to \nvisit various installations around the world. I am consistently \nimpressed with competence, professionalism and dedication of these \nindividuals. For years they have been unsung heroes, serving under \ndifficult conditions and often putting their lives on the line. They do \nthis not for money or glory--indeed the nature of their work means that \nsuccess goes unacknowledged--but because they love their country and \nthey have a profound sense of duty. We owe these people a debt of \ngratitude of their sacrifices, now more than ever before.\n  I must mention another group of people who are critical to the \nprocess of bringing this legislation to the floor. The staff of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee has once again done a superb job \npreparing this bill. The staff is led by Al Cumming the staff director \nand Bill Duhnke the minority staff director. They have guided the staff \nthrough a very difficult year including the anthrax evacuation and the \nlaunching of the joint investigation with the House Intelligence \nCommittee into events related to September 11. Through all the turmoil \nthey kept the committee focused on our work and our oversight \nresponsibilities. They are assisted by Kathleen McGhee, Chief Clerk, \nBob Filippone, Deputy Staff Director, Jim Hensler, Deputy Minority \nStaff Director, Vicki Divoll, General Counsel, Chris Ford, Minority \nCounsel, Melvin Dubee, Budget Director, and the rest of a very talented \nstaff. A special thanks goes to Jim Wolfe, the committee's Security \nDirector for his efforts to ensure the security of our people and our \nclassified materials last fall and winter when the committee was forced \nto work from temporary offices during the anthrax episode.\n  Finally and most importantly, I must acknowledge the excellent \ncooperation and support of Vice Chairman Shelby. Senator Shelby has \nserved on the committee for almost 8 years and his experience and \ncommitment have been critical to the success of the committee. We have \nnot agreed on everything but we have agreed on the goal of giving the \nAmerican people the best intelligence organization possible and have \nworked together toward that goal. I have appreciated his support and \nadvice.\n  At this time in our Nation's history, our support for the U.S. \nintelligence community is vitally important. I urge support for this \nbill.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we have before us the Intelligence \nAuthorization bill for fiscal year 2003. This is a bill which we have \ndebated extensively in the Select Committee on Intelligence, and which \nwe reported out in May.\n  Especially during the global war against terrorism in which our \nnation is currently engaged, it is important that we give the U.S. \nintelligence community the support and encouragement it needs to do its \nvital job--and that we hold it properly accountable for its activities \nthrough the oversight process. This bill provides healthy measures of \nsupport, encouragement, and accountability, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  While we cannot discuss actual budget figures in an unclassified \nsetting, I can assure my colleagues that this bill provides a \nsignificant increase in funding to the U.S. intelligence community, \nmoney that it needs and will continue to need as we demand more and \nbetter work from it than ever before. Even the world's sole remaining \nsuperpower with unchallenged military supremacy cannot be everywhere, \nand the war on terrorism taxes our capabilities in new and often \nunprecedented ways. More than anything else, this current conflict is \nan intelligence-dependent war. We need to do everything we can to \nensure that our polilcymakers and our military commanders get the best \npossible intelligence support. This bill will help ensure that they do.\n  In addition, our bill also increases the Intelligence Community's \naccountability to the elected representatives of the American people \nwhose job it is to ensure proper oversight of our intelligence \nbureaucracy. I would like to mention just a few examples of this.\n  First, our bill clarifies, rationalizes, and codifies the series of \nreporting requirements that form such an important part of the process \nby which Congress obtains information and analyses of intelligence \ncommunity activities.\n  The bill also ensures that the intelligence community will be able to \ncontinue to fulfill its reporting requirements to the intelligence \noversight committees of Congress in the wake of the changes to \ninformation-sharing laws contained in the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001.\n  Our bill also requires that the National Foreign Intelligence Program \nbudget provide specific breakdowns for annual budget aggregates \nrelating to counterterrorism, counterproliferation, counternarcotics, \nand counterintelligence. This greater specificity, we hope, will enable \nCongress better to assess intelligence community resourcing decisions \nand ensure that the right priorities receive our support in years \nahead.\n  The two sides of our committee have not agreed on every detail of the \nclassified appendix that accompanies our report on this bill, but on \nbalance we feel that this is a piece of legislation that will provide \nmuch-needed support for--and improve the accountability of--the United \nStates intelligence community.\n  I urge the Senate to pass this bill promptly.\n  The committee amendments were withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 4752), in the nature of a substitute, was agreed \nto.\n\n[[Page S9353]]\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  The bill (H.R. 4628), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  The Presiding Officer (Mr. Dayton) appointed Mr. Graham, Mr. Levin, \nMr. Rockefeller, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \nEdwards, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \nRoberts, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Thompson, and Mr. Lugar conferees on the part \nof the Senate.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.
