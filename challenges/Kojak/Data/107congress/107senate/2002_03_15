You are our supreme commander, \nwe are Your servants. Throughout the Bible, the truly great men and \nwomen regarded the name ``Servant of God'' as a description of their \nhighest calling. Patriarchs, priests, prophets, and disciples bore the \ndistinguished title of servants. The psalmist urgently calls us to \n``Serve the Lord with gladness.''--Psalm 100:2. That's our purpose \ntoday. As Senators, officers of the Senate, and staff, we all renew our \ncommitment to serve You in our work in government. We are not here to \nbe served but to serve. May no challenge be too momentous nor any \nassignment too menial for us as Your servants. Our security and esteem \nare not in titles, positions, power, or turf but in being Your \nservants, working for Your glory and the good of America. May it be so \ntoday, Sovereign Master of our Lives.

BURY, OF ARIZONA, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT \n                   JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now go into executive session and proceed to the \nconsideration of Executive Calendar No. 704. The clerk will state the \nnomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of David C. Bury, of \nArizona, to be United States District Judge.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate is voting on the 41st \njudicial nominee to be confirmed since last July when the Senate \nJudiciary Committee reorganized after the Democrats became the majority \nparty in the Senate. With the confirmation of David C.\n\n[[Page S1960]]\n\nBury to the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, the Senate \nwill have resolved 6 judicial emergencies since we returned to session \njust a few short weeks ago and 11 since I became chairman this past \nsummer. As of this week, the Senate has confirmed more judges in the \nlast 9 months than were confirmed in 4 out of 6 years under Republican \nleadership. The number of judicial confirmations over these past 9 \nmonths--41--exceeds the number of judicial nominees confirmed during \nall 12 months of 2000, 1999, 1997, and 1996.\n  During the preceding 6\\1/2\\ years in which a Republican majority most \nrecently controlled the pace of judicial confirmations in the Senate, \n248 judges were confirmed. The larger number, the total judges \nconfirmed during President Clinton's two terms, includes 2 years in \nwhich a Democratic majority proceeded to confirm 129 additional judges \nin 1993 and 1994. During the 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control of the \nSenate, judicial confirmations averaged 38 per year--a pace of \nconsideration and confirmation that has already been exceeded under \nDemocratic leadership over these past 9 months. The Republican majority \ndid not proceed on any of the judicial nominations resent to the Senate \nin January by President Clinton or those initially sent to the Senate \nin May by President Bush.\n  In the past 9 months, we have had more hearings, for more nominees, \nand had more confirmations than the Republican leadership did for \nPresident Clinton's nominees during the first 9 months of 1995. In each \narea--hearings, number of nominees given hearings, and number of \nnominees confirmed--the Judiciary Committee has exceeded the comparable \nperiod when Republicans were in power. And 1995 was one of their most \nproductive years. Beginning in 1996, the Republican majority really \nbegan stalling the judicial confirmation process. In the 1996 session, \nonly 17 judges were confirmed all year. Judge Bury will be the 13th \njudge confirmed since January 24 this year, and it is only March.\n  Under Democratic leadership, we have reformed the process and \npractices used in the past to deny Committee consideration of judicial \nnominees. Almost 60 judicial nominees never received a hearing by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee or received a hearing but were never voted \non by the Committee. We are holding more hearings for more nominees \nthan in the recent past. We have moved away from the anonymous holds \nthat so dominated the process from 1996 through 2000. We have made home \nState Senators' blue slips public for the first time.\n  I do not mean by my comments to appear critical of Senator Hatch. \nMany times during the 6\\1/2\\ years he chaired the Judiciary Committee, \nI observed that were the matter left up to us, we would have made more \nprogress on more judicial nominees. I thanked him during those years \nfor his efforts. I know that he would have liked to have been able to \ndo more and not have to leave so many vacancies and so many nominees \nwithout action.\n\n  The speedy confirmation of David Bury to the District Court for \nArizona illustrates the effect of the reforms to the process that the \nDemocratic leadership has spearheaded, despite the poor treatment of \ntoo many Democratic nominees through the practice of anonymous holds \nand other obstructionist tactics employed by some in the preceding 6 \nyears.\n  David Bury will be filling a judicial emergency vacancy seat that has \nbeen vacant since 2000, when the new position was created by public law \nto handle the greater number of criminal and immigration cases in the \ncourts along our Southwest Border. I have worked with the Senators from \nArizona, Texas and other Senators from the Southwestern Border States \nto fill these new judgeships. It is a shame, however, that the Congress \ndid not see fit to create the judgeships needed so desperately in the \nSouthern District of California. Perhaps Senator Feinstein will succeed \nin doing that this year. I know that I am supporting her efforts and \nwill be trying to help her finally achieve that goal.\n  David Bury is the second Federal judge confirmed from Arizona in a \nlittle more than a month and the third since the change in majority. On \nFebruary 26th, the Senate confirmed by a vote of 98 to zero Judge Cindy \nJorgenson and last December we confirmed Judge Frederick Martone.\n  There are some who insist that circuit court nominees are being \ntreated unfairly. Nothing could be farther from the truth. By having \nfair hearings and voting on nominees, up or down, the Judiciary \nCommittee is proceeding as it should. Unlike the many judicial nominees \nwho did not get hearings or were accorded a hearing but were never \nallowed to be considered by the Committee, we are trying to accord \nnominees both a hearing and a fair up or down vote.\n  Until Judge Edith Clement received a hearing on her nomination to the \n5th Circuit last year, there had been no hearings on 5th Circuit \nnominees since 1994 and no confirmations since 1995. Last year we were \nable to confirm the first new judge to the 5th Circuit in 6 years and \nhelp end the Circuit emergency that had been declared in 1999 by the \nChief Judge.\n  Jorge Rangel was nominated to the 5th Circuit in 1997 and never \nreceived a hearing on his nomination or a vote by the Committee. His \nnomination to a Texas seat on the Fifth Circuit languished without \naction for 15 months.\n  Enrique Moreno was first nominated to the 5th Circuit in 1999 and \nnever received a hearing on his nomination or a vote by the Committee. \nHis nomination to a Texas seat on the Fifth Circuit also languished \nwithout action for 17 months.\n  H. Alston Johnson was also first nominated to the 5th Circuit in 1999 \nand never received a hearing on his nomination or a vote by the \nCommittee in 1999, 2000, or the beginning of 2001. His nomination to a \nLouisiana seat on the Fifth Circuit also languished without action for \n23 months.\n  In contrast, under the Democrat-led Senate, President Bush's nominees \nto the 5th Circuit, Judge Edith Brown Clement and Judge Charles \nPickering, were treated fairly. Both received hearings less than 6 \nmonths after their nominations. In fact, Judge Clement was the first \nFifth Circuit nominee to receive a hearing since 1994, when Senator \nBiden chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee. She is the first person \nto be confirmed to that Circuit since 1995.\n  In contrast to recent, past practices, we are moving expeditiously to \nconsider and confirm David Bury, who was nominated in September, \nreceived his ABA peer review in November, participated in a hearing in \nFebruary, was reported by the Committee in March and is today being \nconfirmed.\n  This nominee has the support of both Senators from his home State and \nappears to be the type of qualified, consensus nominee that the Senate \nhas been confirming to help fill the vacancies on our federal courts. I \ncongratulate Mr. Bury and his family on his confirmation today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to support the confirmation of David \nC. Bury to be U.S. District Judge for the District of Arizona.\n  I have had the pleasure of reviewing Mr. Bury's distinguished legal \ncareer, and I have come to the opinion that he is a fine lawyer who \nwill add a great deal to the Federal bench in Arizona.\n  David Bury was born and raised in Tulsa, OK. After graduating from \nOklahoma State University in 1964, he attended the University of \nArizona College of Law, earning his Juris Doctorate in 1967.\n  Mr. Bury has been a trial lawyer in private practice for over 34 \nyears, and he has experience in almost every area of civil trial \npractice--primarily in the area of insurance defense. His clients have \nincluded private citizens, large corporation, lawyers, doctors, \ninsurance companies, Pima County, and the State of Arizona. Mr. Bury \nhas defended medical and legal malpractice cases, products liability \nand construction site cases, governmental entities in false arrest \ncases, assault and battery cases, United States Code section 1983 \nactions, and road design and construction cases. He has defended school \nteachers and school districts. Additionally, he has represented \nindividuals in personal injury and employment cases.\n  Mr. Bury is a Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers and an \nAdvocate in the American Board of Trial Advocates. He is also listed in \nthe ``Best Lawyers in America.'' He has served as a lawyer \nrepresentative to the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference,\n\n[[Page S1961]]\n\non the Commission on Trial Court Appointments for Pima County, and on \nthe disciplinary committee for the State Bar of Arizona. In addition, \nMr. Bury often serves as an arbitrator and has been a guest lecturer \nfor legal and medical organizations throughout his career.\n  I have every confidence that David Bury will serve with distinction \non the Federal District Court for the District of Arizona.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is, Will the Senate \nadvise and consent to the nomination of David C. Bury, of Arizona, to \nbe United States District Judge for the District of Arizona? On this \nquestion, the yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln) \nand the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback), \nthe Senator from Montana (Mr. Burns), the Senator from Idaho (Mr. \nCraig), the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Frist), the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), the \nSenator from Kentucky (Mr. McConnell), and the Senator from Texas (Mrs. \nHutchison) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nMontana (Mr. Burns) would vote ``yea''.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, due to my absence, I was unable \nto vote today on the confirmation of David C. Bury as a judge for the \nUnited States District Court for the District of Arizona, Tucson \nDivision.\n  Had I been present today, I would have voted ``yea'' on Mr. Bury's \nnomination with whole-hearted enthusiasm for a man of outstanding \ncharacter and tremendous legal talent.\n  Without question, Mr. Bury is well-qualified for this position. His \nreputation precedes him. In the State of Arizona, he has always been a \nwell-respected and highly competent trial attorney. His unblemished 34 \nyears in the practice of law have proven his commitment to the legal \nprofession. Not only does he bring to the Federal bench extensive \nexperience in civil litigation, he will bring to the bench the \nrequisite qualities of patience, fairness and the highest ethical \nstandards. In short, Mr. Bury will be an outstanding Federal judge for \nour great state of Arizona.\n  I congratulate him, his wife Debby and his three children on his \nnomination to the Federal court. They are undoubtedly proud of him not \nonly for this high honor, but also for the rest of his professional \naccomplishments and his personal commitment to them.\n  I am very confident that Mr. Bury will be a top-notch public servant \nwho will bring to the Federal judiciary the highest level of \nprofessionalism, leadership and dedication. He will make the people in \nArizona proud. And for his public service, I thank him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/15/senate-section/article/S1961-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, during this lull in the debate of the \nenergy bill I would like to take a moment to thank the Senator from New \nMexico and his staff for all of their hard work and cooperation on the \nAlaska gas pipeline title of this bill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator for those kind words. This is an \nimportant energy policy initiative for the nation. I thought we had a \ngood beginning with the amendments that were offered and debated last \nweek.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I agree, it was a good start. However, we still have a \nfair piece to go before we reach the end of this trail. If the Senator \nwould recall during last week's debate I mentioned that there were a \nnumber of additional items that would need to be addressed before we \ncompleted our legislative effort on this important issue.\n  These additional items include crafting language that sets procedures \nin place for allocating initial gas capacity of the pipeline and for \nany subsequent expansions that might be warranted based on new \ndiscoveries or additional needs in Lower 48 markets.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes, I do recall the Senator's remarks and I am aware \nthat there are several additional items that are being worked on at the \nstaff level. I particularly hope we will be able to make some \nimprovements that will assist in lowering the overall risk associated \nwith this $20 billion project.\n  These include enhancing the ability of the Pipeline Coordinator \ncreated in the gas pipeline title to keep the numerous Federal and \nState agencies that will be involved in this project working in a \ncooperative and coordinated fashion and providing for clear and \nexpedited procedures for resolving legal challenges that might arise \nduring permitting and construction of the pipeline. Streamlining the \npermitting process will help reduce the risks of delay and added costs \nto the project.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I do indeed understand what my friend from New Mexico \nis saying. This point is especially true when you recall that the oil \nand gas producers who hold the leases on the Prudhoe Bay gas have \nstated publicly that the project as it now stands is uneconomical. Any \nlegislative language that adds risk or cost to the project will simply \nmake it impossible to build the Alaska gas transportation system--and \nthis will deny the American consumers with access to a dependable,\n\n[[Page S1962]]\n\nlong-term, and economic supply of domestic natural gas.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I agree with the Senator from Alaska. We must be \nextremely careful in crafting language for inclusion in the gas title; \npoorly thought out concepts can add significant risk to this project.\n  I suggest that we continue our cooperative efforts as we have in the \npast. I believe that by working together we can get this project built, \nand that will benefit both the people of Alaska and the entire gas \nconsuming public across the United States.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I agree completely and I look forward to continuing \nour efforts. I particularly appreciate the Senator's understanding the \nneed to allow Alaskans access to the North Slope gas reserves. As in \nthe Nation, my State needs abundant and dependable gas supplies to fuel \nthe growth of our economy over the next three decades.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we have just confirmed a district \njudge, and I am delighted with that action. It is an action I wish we \nwould take more often around here.\n  Last night, the Judiciary Committee refused to send to the Senate \nJudge Pickering, who was nominated for the circuit court. I wish to \nmake a few comments with respect thereto, and do it in the shadow of \nthe confirmation vote we have just had.\n  When this session of Congress began, the Senator from Vermont, who \nnow chairs the Judiciary Committee, made it clear he had an extra-\nconstitutional test he would apply to every judge. That is, he insisted \nwe have the statement of the American Bar Association before us before \nwe even consider a judge. I use the term ``extra-constitutional'' \nrather than ``unconstitutional,'' as some commentators have, because \nthe Senator has every right to turn to any group or any area he wants \nin order to make his decision, but a requirement that a judge be \nrecommended by the American Bar Association is not in the \nConstitution. Therefore, it is an extra-constitutional test.\n\n  When Judge Pickering came before the Judiciary Committee, he passed \nthat extra-constitutional test. He was chosen and designated as being \nwell qualified by the American Bar Association. Yet he was voted down \nby the members of the Judiciary Committee. Some of them said he had \nracist views. Yet the African Americans in his home State came forward \nin great numbers to insist that this judge did not have racist views. \nIndeed, these African Americans who knew him better than African \nAmericans outside of his State insisted he was an excellent judge and \nan excellent choice for the circuit court. Nonetheless, he was still \nnot sent to the Senate for a vote.\n  What this means is that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has \nan additional extra-constitutional test he is applying to nominees. As \nhe said before, it is his right to put whatever test he wants. But I \nhope, in courtesy to the Senate, that he and the other members of \nJudiciary Committee who voted against Judge Pickering will disclose \ntheir extra-constitutional test. They did at the beginning of the \nsession. They said, in response to the President, they would not \nconsider him until we have a rating from the American Bar Association. \nThat is an extra-constitutional test we will openly and directly apply.\n  It is clear from what has happened to Judge Pickering that there is \nnow another extra-constitutional test being applied in secret, that is \nbeing applied in camera, and that is being applied in the dark. Those \nof us who are unaware of what it is are, therefore, unable to discuss \nit and unable to talk about it or direct our concerns toward it.\n  Therefore, I formally ask the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Mr. Leahy from Vermont, to tell us what the extra-\nconstitutional test that he applied to Judge Pickering is.\n  The newspapers say he has to pass muster from groups such as People \nfor the American Way. I would rather not get the information from the \nnewspapers. I would rather not have a journalist tell me what is on the \nSenator's mind. I would rather have the Senator tell us as openly and \ndirectly as he can at the beginning of this session what it is he \nrequires before he will vote for someone to come out of the Judiciary \nCommittee for a Senate vote.\n  It is only fair that we and the constituents in Vermont understand \nwhat the test is that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee is \napplying. At the moment, we are left in the dark.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 2 months ago, I traveled with some of our \nother Senate colleagues to Afghanistan and other Central Asian nations.\n  We wanted to see what progress is being made in the war against \nterrorism. We also wanted to talk with our allies in the region to try \nto assess how we might help make their nations hospitable to freedom--\nand inhospitable to terrorists.\n  We learned a great deal.\n  I have already had a chance to share many of my thoughts and \nobservations with Secretary Powell.\n  Today, I would like to say a few words publicly about the part of our \ntrip that I found the most moving and impressive: the other Americans \nwe met--men and women who are serving our Nation's interests every day \nin places far from home--often under incredibly challenging conditions.\n\n[[Page S1963]]\n\n  We met extraordinary people from almost every State. They all deserve \nour profound appreciation.\n  I was especially moved by five people I met from my own State. \nListening to them, and watching them perform their jobs, made me very \nproud to be a South Dakotan. It also reinforced my conviction that we \nwill triumph in the war against terrorism.\n  This week, as we mark the 6-month anniversary of the attacks on our \nNation, seems like a fitting time to tell my colleagues about them.\n  David Nelson, the Senior Economic Counselor in the U.S. Embassy in \nBerlin, is from Brookings, SD. Day in and day out, he is working to \nprotect America's economic interests in Germany. Since September 11, he \nhas also played a critical role in our efforts to cut off the \nterrorists' money supplies.\n  Dr. Jan Riemers is from Bristol, SD. She is the only western doctor \nin Uzbekistan's capital city of Tashkent. She is a sort of modern-day \nAlbert Schweitzer, who moved her entire family to Uzbekistan so she \ncould serve people who might otherwise never see a doctor.\n  I also met three remarkable young men who are even more directly \ninvolved in the war against terrorism. They are serving our country in \nuniform. For security reasons, I won't use their names.\n  One is an Army private from Midland, SD who I met in Uzbekistan. When \nwe met, it had been almost 2 years since his last leave.\n  On September 11, he was just completing a tour of duty in Bosnia. He \nand his colleagues had been living in tents and eating MREs--packaged \nmeals--three times a day for several months at that point. He could \nhave come home instead, he volunteered to go to Central Asia to be a \npart of the war against terrorism. And he said he was honored to do so.\n\n  In Afghanistan, I met an Air Force master sergeant from Rapid City. \nHe is involved in delivering two things Afghanistan needs desperately: \nU.S. military support, and humanitarian assistance.\n  His efforts helped make possible the military victories we have seen \nin Afghanistan. They are also part of the reason we have not seen the \nhumanitarian disaster some predicted at the outset of the war.\n  In Kyrgyzstan, I met an Air Force staff sergeant from Yankton--one of \nthe first U.S. service members deployed to that country. We met at \nManas International Airport, where he and other Americans are working \nto build an air base that will host personnel from several countries \nand serve as a hub for air operations in Afghanistan. He came out to \nmeet us in the middle of a snowstorm, and he could not have been more \nexcited about his mission.\n  We ask our service men and women--like these three honorable South \nDakotans--to attempt extraordinary things and make extraordinary \nsacrifices. Time after time, they not only meet our expectations, they \nexceed them.\n  In this week, when we mark the 6-month anniversary of the attacks on \nour Nation, it seems appropriate that we also honor the men and women \nwho are working--and risking their lives--to try to prevent us from \never experiencing that heartache again.\n  They are true patriots. They come from my State and yours, and from \nevery State and territory in our Nation. They make us proud. And they \nare making America, and the world, stronger and better.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the report we have \ncompiled regarding the trip to Afghanistan from January 10 to 19 of \nthis year be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Daschle CODEL to Central Asia, January 10 to 19, 2002\n\n       Senator Daschle led a bipartisan and bicameral \n     Congressional Delegation CODEL to Germany, Uzbekistan, \n     Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan from \n     January 10 to January 19. The following views expressed in \n     this report, however, reflect only the views and findings of \n     Senators Daschle and Durbin.\n\n\n              summary of findings and key recommendations\n\n     The initial phase of the war on terrorism has been a clear \n         success.\n       It was evident from our trip to Central Asia that the \n     conduct of the war on terrorism has, to date, produced \n     impressive results. Our troops, President Bush, Secretary \n     Rumsfeld, and Secretary Powell deserve credit and recognition \n     for that success.\n     U.S. troops are a credit to themselves and the country.\n       The performance of U.S. troops in Central Asia and \n     Afghanistan has been remarkable and a tribute to the hard \n     work and commitment of the thousands of men and women who are \n     carrying out Operation Enduring Freedom. U.S. personnel are \n     braving harsh weather and very rudimentary accommodations. \n     One Air Force Sergeant said he ``had been living in the mud'' \n     in Uzbekistan for 3 months, further saying he was honored to \n     be doing so. An Army Colonel in Afghanistan, while eating \n     chicken Chow Mein for the fourth night in a row, observed, \n     ``I can't complain, because it's hot [food].'' Another Army \n     PFC declared he was proud to have spent the past 3 months \n     serving Afghanistan, notwithstanding the fact that he was \n     deployed to the region 1 week after moving into a new house \n     with his new wife. The morale of U.S. troops is very high, as \n     evidenced by another Army PFC from South Dakota who has not \n     had leave since February 2000 and volunteered to serve in \n     Uzbekistan as he was finishing a tour of duty in Bosnia \n     because he was eager to participate in the war against \n     terrorism.\n       The U.S. personnel from other U.S. agencies in the region \n     are also a credit to America. Foreign Service officers in \n     Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are working around the \n     clock--literally--to advance U.S. interests and ensure the \n     safety of American personnel. The Embassy in Tashkent is \n     overcrowded, the Embassy in Kabul is in terrible straits \n     after being overrun by decades of war, and families of \n     personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad were forced to \n     return to the U.S. as a result of security threats.\n       On a more personal note, we were proud to meet a number of \n     South Dakotan and Illinois servicemen and women who are \n     serving their country in the region. To a person, they \n     support the mission and take pride in the role they are \n     playing to improve living conditions in the region and defeat \n     international terrorism.\n       Senator Daschle was also proud of the generosity of South \n     Dakotans was greatly appreciated by Afghans. The delegation \n     delivered three boxes of winter clothing to the Afghan \n     Minister of Orphans, Widows and Martyrs. The clothing was \n     collected by South Dakotan business leaders and students at \n     two separate elementary schools.\n     The troops' success allow us to focus on consolidating gains.\n       The successful effort that started as a war in Afghanistan \n     to bring to justice those responsible for the September 11th \n     attacks is shifting to focus on consolidating gains and \n     helping to bring some semblance of economic, political, and \n     physical security to the region. Challenges are many, but the \n     United States undertook a remarkable effort to confront and \n     defeat the first such challenge--widespread hunger.\n       A remarkable U.S.-led effort to deliver food and shelter \n     has averted humanitarian disaster, which last fall, after \n     years of mismanagement by the Taliban, looked inevitable. But \n     the USG--led by the Department of Defense and USAID with \n     significant assistance from CARE, Catholic Relief Services, \n     Church World Services, International Rescue Committee, and \n     others--provided nearly $200 million worth of food, water, \n     health care and shelter to millions of Afghans in FY 2002.\n       Challenges remain. It is particularly troubling that Bin \n     Laden, the bulk of the senior Al Qaeda leadership, Mullah \n     Omar and the majority of the Taliban leadership remain at \n     large.\n       The fact that so many key terrorist leaders are unaccounted \n     for is one factor that contributes to insecurity in \n     Afghanistan, which is increasingly threatening the gains the \n     United States has made in the region. At the time of the trip \n     to Afghanistan, Chairman Karzai and U.S. personnel in the \n     region were clearly concerned about security. Events since \n     the delegation's visit to Afghanistan--such as the fights \n     between warlords in Gardez, the murder of the interim tourism \n     minister, and increasingly alarming reports out of the \n     Administration about a general rise of lawlessness and \n     warlordism, including a specific report that some warlords \n     may be preparing to sabotage the loya jirga set for June--\n     only serve to harden that assessment.\n       The current configuration of the International Security \n     Force (ISAF) is insufficient to confront this insecurity. At \n     the very least, the ISAF should be expanded beyond Kabul and \n     into other Afghan cities until efforts to train a police \n     force and an Afghan military loyal to the interim \n     government can catch up with this insecurity. While \n     success of the ISAF is not dependent on the U.S. providing \n     ground troops as part of an expanded effort, it is clear \n     that an American component for transportation, \n     intelligence and search-and-rescue is likely to be a \n     precondition for significant international participation \n     in an expanded ISAF.\n       An increased U.S. military role in support of an expanded \n     ISAF is entirely consistent with the Administration's \n     apparent policy goal of maintaining a U.S. presence in the \n     region, evidenced by the substantial upgrades beginning at \n     Manas Airport in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan and a more permanent \n     presence being prepared in Uzbekistan and Georgia. This \n     increased American military\n\n[[Page S1964]]\n\n     presence can play an important role in support of the ISAF.\n     Central Asian Republics have taken significant steps in \n         support of the U.S.--and are urging a long term American \n         presence in return.\n       Good long term relations with the Central Asian Republics \n     is very much in the national interest of the United States.\n       Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and even Turkmenistan have \n     demonstrated, with their efforts in Afghanistan, a solid \n     commitment to the war against terrorism.\n       Uzbekistan agreed to our request for basing and overflight \n     rights, including the right for the United States to maintain \n     a significant troop presence at the airfield at Khanabad. As \n     a result, our two countries signed a Status of Forces \n     Agreement on October 7 and a Memorandum of Understanding on \n     Economic Cooperation on November 7. Last fall, the U.S. also \n     allocated an additional $100 million in assistance for \n     Uzbekistan, and the Administration is reported to be \n     considering an additional tranche of assistance in a \n     supplemental for ``front line states'' expected to be \n     submitted to Congress in mid-to-late March.\n       The Government of Uzbekistan has also provided important \n     cooperation with U.S. programs to curb the proliferation of \n     material for use in weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The \n     October 22 agreement between the U.S. and Uzbekistan to begin \n     cleaning up the former Soviet biological weapons test range \n     on Vozrozhdeniya in the Aral Sea is an important step forward \n     in U.S. efforts to halt the proliferation of WMD material. \n     The Government of Uzbekistan also ought to be commended for \n     efforts, supported by the U.S., at strengthening border \n     controls of weapons material.\n       Kyrgyzstan provided overflight and landing rights and \n     agreed to permit the basing of a large number of coalition \n     personnel and aircraft at the international airport in Manas, \n     a site which will function as a ``transportation hub'' for \n     coalition efforts in Afghanistan and the region.\n       Turkmenistan has allowed for some overflight rights and \n     became an important--indeed the principal--conduit of \n     American and international humanitarian assistance into \n     northern Afghanistan.\n     These steps represent a move toward the West, but sustaining \n         positive long term relationships still demand major \n         improvements on political and economic reform.\n       Each country claimed that they had made a deliberate and \n     conscious choice to reach out to the West. What is not clear \n     is whether the governments are also committed to embracing \n     universal human and voting rights that have been sorely \n     lacking in each country.\n       While the U.S. is right to continue cooperating with these \n     governments, significant and sustained economic and political \n     reforms are a pre-requisite to consolidating long term \n     relationships with these countries.\n       Each country's continuing refusal to enact political reform \n     while at the same time continuing to violate basic human \n     rights will contribute to extremism and threaten the \n     stability that each government argues it is seeking.\n       The human rights situation in Uzbekistan is abysmal. There \n     is no freedom of association and independent institutions--\n     including the press--are banned. In one telling moment, a \n     human rights leader in Uzbekistan said that the media in \n     Russia--currently being cracked down on by government \n     regulators--is much more free than the Uzbek media. Even the \n     Parliament is largely a rubber stamp for the Karimov \n     government, with little, if any, influence.\n       Civil society in Uzbekistan has also been drastically \n     restricted. NGOs are not allowed to register or function. The \n     few independent groups that do exist are subjected to \n     harassment based on Soviet practices, including firing \n     ``agitators'' from state run jobs, confiscating human rights \n     workers passports, confiscating equipment of independent \n     NGOs. Human rights leaders and the U.S. State Department also \n     catalogued instances where the government used torture and \n     prolonged detention to deter other civil society activity.\n       In Kyrgyzstan, where the United States encouraged the \n     government's bold steps in the early and mid-1990s toward \n     democratization, there has been a dramatic backsliding in its \n     political reform process. Of particular concern are reports \n     of constant pressure on opposition political parties, \n     harassment of journalists who criticized members of the \n     government, and numerous flaws--many apparently \n     deliberate--in the October 29, 2000 presidential \n     elections. In fact, the Office for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Office of Democratic \n     Institutions and Human Rights concluded that the October \n     elections ``failed to comply with OSCE commitments for \n     democratic elections.''\n       In Turkmenistan, there are no legally registered opposition \n     parties and absolutely no free press. The State Department \n     reports that the most recent elections, in December 1999, \n     ``did not even approach minimum international standards.'' \n     The only officially recognized religions are the Russian \n     Orthodox church and Sunni Islamism; all other faiths face \n     harsh persecution and harassment. In what seems to be a \n     fitting moniker, several analysts refer to insular \n     Turkmenistan as the North Korea of Central Asia. Furthermore, \n     while the leaders of Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan at least \n     admitted to having significant human rights problems, the \n     National Security Adviser of Turkmenistan simply dismissed \n     concerns about human rights saying, ``I understand that these \n     things [freedom of religion, the media and association] are \n     important for America, but it is simply not time for such \n     reforms in Turkmenistan. Before we do these things, we need \n     time to strengthen our economy.''\n     HIV/AIDS is a growing threat in Central Asia.\n       The leadership of Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan noted their \n     concern regarding the trafficking of Afghan opium to and \n     through their countries, which has contributed to large \n     increases in illicit drug use throughout Central Asia in \n     recent years. According to UNAIDS, this surge in drug use has \n     brought the Central Asian republics to the ``verge of a major \n     public health and socio-economic development disaster, in \n     terms of large scale epidemics of HIV/AIDS.'' As such, the \n     United States should be looking for opportunities to increase \n     funding for bilateral AIDS prevention, care and treatment \n     programs targeted to Central Asia and to increase the annual \n     U.S. commitment to the Global Trust Fund to Fight AIDS, TB \n     and malaria.\n     Pakistan and President Musharraf are also making a strategic \n         choice to join the West. Concrete steps to confirm and \n         reward that choice will be welcomed.\n       Pakistan has been a vital ally in the war against \n     terrorism. With its location in a critical region of the \n     world, a nuclear arsenal, and a population set to double in \n     the next 20 years, American national security is undoubtedly \n     improved by President Musharraf's strategic choice.\n       The January 12 speech by President Musharraf--in which he \n     proclaimed a jihad against extremism--demonstrates that he is \n     ready to take Pakistan back from the extremists. He outlined \n     a far reaching proposal for reforming the Pakistani education \n     system and a systematic crackdown on extremists. Although \n     ultimate success in this effort can only be judged by \n     results, initial efforts suggest that he is committed to this \n     effort.\n       He has specifically requested U.S. support for reforms to \n     the Pakistani education system, which has been ignored by \n     previous Pakistani governments more interested in investing \n     in weapons systems than social services. The United States \n     should support that effort with significant new resources, \n     closely conditioned on President Musharraf maintaining his \n     commitment to reform. There can be no better investment of \n     U.S. assistance in Pakistan.\n       President Musharraf's comments about and concrete steps to \n     reform the ISI given widespread reports of its links to \n     extremists are also a reason for optimism. He should be \n     commended for his cooperation on the investigation of the \n     kidnapping and brutal murder of Danny Pearl case. However, as \n     with his speech on fighting extremism, the USG must demand \n     concrete results in this investigation. President Musharraf's \n     seriousness about confronting Islamic extremists--including \n     those responsible for the murder of Pearl--can be further \n     confirmed by Pakistan handing over to the United States \n     Sheikh Omar, the confessed mastermind of the abduction.\n     Germany taking concrete--and costly--steps in the war on \n         terrorism, but it is concerned about next steps.\n       German Foreign Minister Fischer referred to the way on \n     terrorism as a fight with a ``new totalitarianism.'' In a war \n     with such extremists, there can be no compromise, just as \n     there could be no compromise with the Nazis.\n       Germans also reserved blunt language for the conduct of the \n     Saudis in this effort against extremism--``democracy is the \n     necessary pre-condition of defeating terrorism''--and for the \n     lack of concerted effort by Palestinian Authority Chairman \n     Arafat--the decision to start the Intifada in September 2000 \n     was judged an ``historic mistake'', and ``we all may have \n     overestimated how much Arafat wants peace.''\n       Germany has taken seriously its role in this war against \n     totalitarianism, taking concrete and historic steps in the \n     war in Afghanistan and in the law enforcement and \n     investigation efforts in the United States. Germany has \n     deployed troops to Afghanistan as part of Operating Enduring \n     Freedom and in Kabul with the ISAF and German naval vessels \n     are operating in the Indian Ocean off the Horn of Africa as \n     part of international efforts to stop the flow of arms to \n     Somalia.\n       Just as remarkably, Germany has provided intensive law \n     enforcement cooperation in the investigation of the September \n     11 attacks. German cooperation has been pivotal to initial \n     success in the United States, including the indictment of \n     Zacarias Moussaoui.\n       While it does not see another state that has sponsored \n     terrorism to the extent that Afghanistan did, the German \n     government recognizes clearly that this is going to be a \n     ``long term war'' and appears to be ready to make further \n     contributions to that effort. In particular, the German \n     leadership pointed out Iran--and its clear desire for WMD--as \n     a problem that the west will have to confront.\n       Given the extent of German cooperation in the first phase \n     of the war against terrorism--and the political price paid by \n     the German government--it was interesting to hear the serious \n     concerns expressed by the German officials about the next \n     phases in the war.\n       German Government officials noted especially the threat \n     posed by Saddam Hussein--both to his own people and, with his \n     interest in developing weapons of mass destruction, to the \n     region, Europe and the United States.\n\n[[Page S1965]]\n\n       These officials also noted, however, that forcing military \n     action in Iraq without prior consultation with, if not \n     outright support from, the international community risks a \n     potentially even more threatening set of circumstances in the \n     Gulf with negative impacts on energy security as well as the \n     security of Israel.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/15/senate-section/article/S1965-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      THE RETIREMENT OF ALEX LEWIS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

After 35 years of dedicated service, \nAlex Lewis of the Recording Studio is stepping down.\n  Alex began work for the Architect of the Capitol in 1967 at the ripe \nold age of 20. He started work here as an electrician's helper. By the \n1970s he was running and maintaining the Senate and House audio \nsystems, moving to the Senate full time in 1991.\n  In 1994, he helped bring the Senate into the computer age, working \ntirelessly over many late nights and weekends and under a tight \ndeadline to replace the old Senate sound system with the state-of-the-\nart digital system we use today.\n  That can-do attitude, his friendliness and cooperativeness was \nrespected by everyone who worked with him. And, in the last 3 years as \nstudio supervisor, Alex was respected for his caring, consideration, \nand fairness by everyone here in this body.\n  Alex said that having the opportunity to be witness to more than \nthree decades of historical events at the Capitol is something he will \nalways treasure.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my deepest-felt \ndisappointment in the decision of the Judiciary Committee yesterday \nagainst the nomination of Judge Charles Pickering, a jurist of the \nhighest character and proven dedication to public service.\n  Mr. President, I will not repeat my defense of Judge Pickering's \nrecord, which I addressed here yesterday.\n  There are particular reasons why I am disappointed and saddened. \nFirst, certainly, is the unfairness with which the Judiciary Committee \ntreated Judge Pickering's record.\n  I feel awful for Judge Pickering and his family for the way that the \nspecial interest groups and the liberal activists have distorted his \nrecord.\n  It has come to the point that men and women who put themselves up for \npublic service and the Senate confirmation process are heroes, willing \nto sacrifice their good name and peace of mind.\n  I also feel terribly for the people of Mississippi, and about what \nthis decision says to them after the long distance they have traveled \nto correct past wrongs. I feel terribly for the African Americans from \nMississippi who stood by Judge Pickering, at risk to their own \nreputations.\n  Opponents have made much of the meager 26 reversals that Judge \nPickering has had, an attempt to open old and painful wounds by using \nthe all-too familiar race card and suggesting that Judge Pickering has \na poor record in civil rights cases.\n  They claim that Judge has a poor record on voting rights. In fact, he \nhas had only four voting rights cases--only four--and he has been \nappealed on the merits in none of them. My staff has counted almost 200 \ndecisions, and there may be more, in which Judge Pickering has applied \nthe various civil rights laws of the United States with neither an \nappeal nor a reversal.\n  Opponents sought desperately to find aggrieved litigants with an ax \nto grind. They have found almost none. That is amazing for somebody who \nis in the Federal and State courts for much of a legal career. The \nAfrican American parties who were involved in one of the four voting \nrights cases have even written to support the confirmation of Judge \nPickering--the same judge who ruled against them.\n  Many of my colleagues are lawyers. They know full well, as did these \nAfrican American parties who support Judge Pickering that just ruling \none way or another in a case does not mean you are against the \nunderlying law. With this, does it mean that every judge who has \noverturned a drug sentence is pro-drugs? Obviously not. We all know \nbetter than that.\n  The judge's record is clear and distinguished. But I venture to say \nthat the opponents of Judge Pickering are not interested in \naccentuating the positive record, to say the least. It is not \npolitically expedient to do so.\n  Take the case of little Jeffrey Hill. His parents believed that their \nson was entitled to receive a free appropriate education under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  Jeffrey's parents sued and stood alone against the State of \nMississippi. Judge Pickering, as he has done in cases involving \nhomosexuals, African-Americans and others, appropriately found that the \nlaw in that case required Mississippi to educate handicapped children. \nJudge Pickering gave little Jeffrey Hill his day in court. He ruled on \nthe law.\n  Yesterday Senators on the Judiciary Committee received a letter from \nthree dozen members of the House of Representatives, including the \nformer chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Hyde.\n  House Members asked that the Judiciary Committee repudiate extreme \nliberal, left-of-mainstream special interest groups that have raised \nJudge Pickering's religious views as an issue, going so far as to \nattack Judge Pickering for a speech he gave on the Bible when he was \npresident of the Mississippi Southern Baptist Convention.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the House letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Republican Study Committee,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2002.\n\n  House Members Urge Senators To Repudiate Religious Tests for Judges\n\nOutside Groups Attempting to Create a Religious Test in Order to Defeat \n                   the Nomination of Judge Pickering\n\n       Washington, D.C.--Over three dozen Members of the House of \n     Representatives today sent a letter to Members of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee asking them to repudiate attempts by \n     groups such as the People for the American Way to establish a \n     defacto religious test preventing persons of faith from \n     serving as federal judges.\n       Rep. Walter Jones (R-NC), stated, ``In their campaign \n     against the nomination of Judge Charles Pickering to the \n     Court of Appeals, a number of outside interest groups have \n     asserted that Judge Pickering is unfit because he `promotes \n     religion from the bench.' A close examination of these \n     allegations and Judge Pickering's record clearly indicate \n     that what opponents of his nomination are really objecting to \n     is the fact Judge Pickering is personally a man of religious \n     faith.''\n       Rep. Joe Pitts (R-PA) added, ``The failure of the Senate \n     Democrats to repudiate the charge that Judge Pickering is \n     unfit for the Judiciary because of his religious faith sends \n     a very clear message: `So long as Democrats control the \n     Senate, religious people will be prohibited from serving as \n     judges.' ''\n       The text of the letter sent to Senate Judiciary Committee \n     Members is reset on the next page:\n\n\n[[Page S1966]]\n\n\n                                                   March 13, 2002.\n     Members of the Senate Judiciary\n     Committee.\n       Dear Senators: We write to express our grave concern \n     regarding the attempts by some organizations to have the \n     Senate impose what amounts to a religious test on judicial \n     nominees. As you are aware, Article VI of the Constitution \n     specifically forbids the imposition of a religious test.\n       Groups such as People for the American Way have been \n     leading a campaign in opposition to the nomination of Judge \n     Charles Pickering to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th \n     Circuit. Opponents of Judge Pickering have argued that he is \n     unfit because he ``promotes religion from the bench.'' In \n     support of this charge opponents cite a speech Judge \n     Pickering delivered in 1984 when he was President of the \n     Mississippi Baptist Convention and comments made by Judge \n     Pickering from the bench referencing biblical principles and \n     other religious literature.\n       Judge Pickering has made clear that he will follow the law \n     and not his particular religious beliefs in the exercise of \n     his judicial duties. Indeed, his record over the past decade \n     as a District Judge clearly indicates that he practiced in \n     the best traditions of the U.S. judicial system, even when \n     making reference to religious literature. Indeed, Chief \n     Justice Earl Warren, Justice Thurgood Marshall, and Justice \n     William Brennan have all made explicit references to the \n     Bible or biblical principles when delivering the opinion of \n     the Supreme Court in cases covering such disparate issues as \n     the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and the \n     forfeiture and seizure of vessels used for unlawful purposes.\n       Many of those opposing Judge Pickering's nomination are in \n     effect arguing that a religious person is unqualified to \n     serve in the federal judiciary because he cannot be trusted \n     to separate his personal religious beliefs from his official \n     duties. This is nothing more than a religious test barring \n     any person of faith from holding a judicial office.\n       We request that you join us in publicly repudiating those \n     who argue that people of faith are unsuited for the federal \n     judiciary. Such arguments run counter to our Constitution and \n     the best practices of the American judiciary.\n           Sincerely,\n         Walter Jones, Henry Hyde, Frank Wolf, J.C. Watts, Ernie \n           Fletcher, Ed Whitfield, John Hostettler, John Cooksey, \n           Henry Brown, Charles Taylor, Joe Pitts, Virgil Goode, \n           Dave Weldon, Chris Cox, Steve Chabot, John Shadegg, \n           Pete Hoekstra, Jeff Flake, Sue Myrick, Mike Pence.\n         John Sullivan, Todd Tiahrt, John Doolittle, Melissa Hart, \n           Jim DeMint, Bob Schaffer, Robert Aderholt, Todd Akin, \n           Kevin Brady, David Vitter, Jo Ann Davis, Bob Barr, Joe \n           Barton, Chris Cannon, Roscoe Bartlett, John Linder, Lee \n           Terry, John Shimkus, Tom Tancredo.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I think that is wrong. Being a member of the Church of \nJesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints myself, the only church in the \nhistory of this Nation that had an extermination order out against it \nby the Governor of Missouri at the time, I fully understand terrible \nreligious prejudice. So I decry anybody on the right, or anybody \nsupporting Judge Pickering, calling Senator Leahy or any other Democrat \nor any other Member of this body, to criticize their religious \nperspective or view.\n  But it certainly was wrong to criticize Judge Pickering's religion \nand his religious perspective. He is a religious, righteous man, the \ntype of person you would want to have on the bench. And thank goodness \nhe still will be on the bench in the district court, but he won't be \nable to lend his expertise and talents to the circuit court of appeals.\n  I join with the concern expressed by my colleagues here and in the \nHouse, including Democrats. The fact that an impression has been \ncreated that the Senate Judiciary Committee would impose any test, \nwhether a religious test or an abortion litmus test, concerns me \ngreatly.\n  Republicans refused to establish an abortion litmus test in either \ndirection when we controlled this committee. We confirmed 377 of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees without imposing such a test.\n  Maybe this has something to do with the make up of the Judiciary \nCommittee: all the members on one side of the aisle share a single \nview, but on the Republican side, both views are welcomed.\n  I might also add, I believe that underlying these attacks on \nconservative judicial nominees is the issue of abortion. If we had \nchosen to use that as a litmus test issue, President Clinton would have \nhad very few judges confirmed. If that is going to be the rule, then \nthat is a very bad thing and bad precedent to start. I was told by some \nof the outside groups that they do not believe anybody should serve on \nany court in this land who is not pro-abortion.\n  That is an extreme view. Hopefully that view will never have that \nmuch influence on this body, but, unfortunately, I think it does have \nan influence. I will not ever agree that the Judiciary Committee or the \nSenate should exercise its advice and consent responsibility in a way \nthat makes an absolutely lock-step demand that nominees think in a \nparticular way on any single issue. Of course, as long as the Democrats \nare in the majority, I cannot stop them from doing so.\n\n  But I can promise this: a decision to impose a litmus test will \noffend everyone in this country who understands and appreciates the \nrule of law, the independent judiciary, and the great tradition of \ndebate and acceptance of diversity that have made our country the \nstrong democracy it is today.\n  Although some Senators on this committee prize diversity as a \nstandard for the confirmation process. It concerns me that some \npeople's definition of diversity includes only those with diverse skin \ncolor or ethnicity, and then only if they agree with their liberal \nviews.\n  Take Miguel Angel Estrada, who the President nominated 310 days ago, \nalmost a year, Mr. President.\n  Mr. Estrada, an immigrant from Honduras with a distinguished career, \nwould be the first Hispanic on the prestigious Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit, and yet I read on the front page of the \nWall Street Journal today that Democrats are gearing up to do to him \nwhat they did to Judge Pickering.\n  He may be a minority, but he is the wrong kind of a minority, \napparently, in the eyes of some of these people. I think that is awful.\n  Clarence Thomas was a minority, but he was the wrong kind of a \nminority in the eyes of some of these people. That is awful.\n  Diversity appears not to include intellectual diversity--diversity of \npersonal viewpoints or religious conviction, that have nothing to do \nwith ability to follow the law.\n  Some of my Democrat colleagues have openly sought to introduce \nideology into the judicial confirmation process, something which I \nrepudiate. I am now concerned that the abortion litmus test would have \nthe same effect as a religious test.\n\n  Indeed, most people who are pro-choice hold their position as a \nmatter of ideology. Some even allow their chosen ideology to trump the \ntenets of their religion. They do so in good conscience no doubt, and I \nrespect that.\n  But the great majority of people who are pro-life come to their \npositions as a result of their religious convictions. We view unborn \nlife as sacred. We believe in the words of the Declaration of \nIndependence that we are ``endowed by our Creator with certain \ninalienable rights'' and that among these is ``life.'' Many Americans \nhold this view as a religious tenet, but this view does not affect \ntheir ability to interpret the law and precedent, just as skin color \ndoes not.\n  In effect, what is ideology to my Democrat friends is a matter of \nreligious conviction to a large portion of the American people.\n  When one Senator asked Judge Pickering about Roe versus Wade, Judge \nPickering's response was unequivocally that he viewed it as the law of \nthe land and would follow it as a judge, without regard to his private \nviews. Surely, this should be enough. Otherwise, this will mean that no \njudges with private pro-life views, who derive these views from \nreligious conviction, will ever again be confirmed in a Democrat-led \nSenate.\n  To impose an abortion litmus test on private views--call it \nideological if you want to--is to exclude from our judiciary a large \nnumber of people of religious conviction, who are perfectly prepared to \nfollow the law.\n  I fear this is the door this Democrat-led Senate could be opening. I \ncan understand why people would believe that a religious test is being \nimposed.\n  Certainly, as a former president of the Mississippi Southern Baptist \nConvention, Judge Pickering's nomination makes concern over a religious \ntest understandable. The recorded attacks of the extreme left, special \ninterest groups based on Judge Pickering's religious views are \nrepugnant, and I do hope that my Democrat colleagues will indeed \nrepudiate such tactics.\n\n[[Page S1967]]\n\n  Judge Pickering's record on the bench shows that he, in good faith, \ndoes understand the difference between the law and private views, and \nthat he has followed the law regardless of personal beliefs.\n  Judge Pickering has never had an abortion case during his 11 years on \nthe bench, but he has ruled on cases in which the issue of sexual \nprivacy was involved.\n  Conveniently, opponents ignore Judge Pickering's record on gay \nissues. It is not surprising that Log Cabin Republicans, the largest, \nnational gay Republican organization, recently issued a press release \ncalling on this Committee to approve the nomination of Judge Pickering \nand to send it to the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Let me quote from the release. According to Rich Tafel, the executive \ndirector of Log Cabin Republicans:\n\n       Judge Pickering reiterated to me his strong belief that all \n     Americans should be treated equally under the law, including \n     gay and lesbian Americans, and his record as a federal judge \n     clearly demonstrates it.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Among several cases he has heard, two key cases from 1991 \n     and 1994 demonstrated Pickering has followed the principle of \n     equality under the law for gay Americans going back over a \n     decade.\n       In 1991, Pickering sharply rebuked an attorney who tried to \n     use a plaintiff's homosexuality in a fraud trial. \n     ``Homosexuals are as much entitled to be protected from fraud \n     as any other human beings,'' Pickering instructed the jury. \n     ``The fact that the alleged victims in this case are \n     homosexuals shall not affect your verdict in any way \n     whatsoever.''\n       In 1994, an anti-gay citizens group in the town of Ovett, \n     Mississippi launched a crusade of intimidation and threats to \n     drive out Camp Sister Spirit, a lesbian community being built \n     by a lesbian couple. When the group took Camp Sister Spirit \n     to court, Judge Pickering threw their case out.\n\n  They go on:\n\n       His civil rights record is long and distinguished. In 1967, \n     Judge Pickering testified for the prosecution in a criminal \n     hate-murder case against Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard Sam \n     Bowers in the death of an African American civil rights \n     worker. When Jones County, Mississippi schools were racially \n     integrated in the 1970's, Judge Pickering and his wife kept \n     their children in the public school system when other white \n     families removed their children. He was a featured speaker at \n     Mississippi NAACP meetings as far back as 1976, when he was \n     chairman of the Mississippi GOP.\n       In 1981, he defended an African American man who was \n     falsely accused of robbing a white girl at knife point, \n     forcing the case to a second trial after a hung jury and an \n     eventual acquittal. In 1988, he convened and chaired a \n     bipartisan, biracial committee to promote better race \n     relations in Jones County, Mississippi.\n\n  And then remarkably Tafel says:\n\n       The judge who threw out the anti-Camp Sister Spirit case \n     and rebuked homophobia from the bench in the Deep South over \n     ten years ago deserves a promotion, not a rebuke.\n\n  That is what Tafel said.\n  I fear that the Judiciary Committee was not as fair to Judge \nPickering's record. I am greatly disappointed and profoundly concerned \nfor our country.\n  What is now occurring is far beyond the mere tug-of-war politics that \nunfortunately surrounds Senate judicial confirmation since Robert Bork. \nMy Democrat colleagues are out to effect a fundamental change in our \nconstitutional system. Rather than seeking to determine the \njudiciousness of a nominee and whether a nominee will be able to rule \non the law or the Constitution without personal bias, my Democrat \ncolleagues are out to guarantee that our judges are in fact biased. And \ncertainly no person who holds certain religious convictions need apply.\n  In the America that the Senate Democrats would reshape, citizens will \nhave to worry about the personal politics of the judge to whom they \ncome for justice under the law.\n  The legitimacy of our courts, and especially the Supreme Court, comes \nfrom much more than black robes and a high bench. It comes from the \npeople's belief that judges and justices will apply a judicial \nphilosophy without regard to personal politics or bias.\n  What my Democrat colleagues are pursuing is an end to the \nindependence of our judiciary with unforeseeable, unintended \nconsequences to the strength of the Republic.\n  Today is the Ides of March. I would call on my Senate colleagues to \n``Beware.'' The fight they started with Judge Pickering is one that \nothers may end. I hope, however, to quote Shakespeare further, that \nthey have not crossed the Rubicon, that the die is not cast.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/15/senate-section/article/S1967-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1967-S1969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          COMMENDING SENATOR LEAHY AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have sat in the Chamber for several hours, \nall last night and this morning, and when I have not been right here \nphysically in the Chamber, I have listened to some of the statements \nthat have been made regarding what the Judiciary Committee did \nyesterday; that is, do their job.\n  The main reason I am here--and it is coincidental my friend is in the \nbuilding someplace; I saw him just a few minutes ago, Senator Leahy, \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee--during all this process, when \nthe minority has been criticizing the committee, there has not been a \nword said about Senator Leahy positive in nature.\n  I personally believe, speaking on behalf of 50 other Democrats--and \nif the truth were known, many of the Republicans--that there is not a \nSenator in this body who is held in higher regard than Senator Leahy. \nBut even if every Senator in the Senate had no regard for Senator \nLeahy, the people of Vermont and the people of America hold him in high \nregard.\n  Here is a man who started talking about landmines and how bad they \nwere before it became popular to do so. He was the first to speak out \nagainst landmines.\n  It is hard for me to get out of my mind a trip I took to Africa, \nAngola. Every place you go there, people are missing arms and legs. The \nNo. 1 business is fixing people with prostheses, mainly women and \nchildren, because they are the ones who go out in the fields.\n  Senator Leahy has spoken about landmines and our need to do something \nabout them. And we have done things about them.\n  As to nutrition programs for children--principally children but also \npeople less fortunate than everyone in this Chamber today--Senator \nLeahy led the charge with Senators Dole and Lugar to do something about \nnutrition programs so that this land of plenty should not have hungry \nchildren and people.\n  In talking about constitutional rights, there is no one--no one--who \nhas been more protective of our Constitution than Senator Leahy. The \nfirst amendment is something he is known for protecting.\n  Who was the one who slowed down the antiterrorism bill? It was done \nby Senator Leahy. And after the bill was written, people gave him \naccolades for doing that. It was a good bill, and it was as good a bill \nas it was because Senator Leahy had the guts--for lack of a better \nword--after September 11, to say: Whoa. This is the United States. We \nhave a Constitution.\n  Probably the leading exponent of the Internet, other than Senator \nLeahy, is the Presiding Officer, but Senator Leahy was using his \ncomputer before I even knew what one was. He really was one of the \nfirst to use, in a modern way, the computer.\n  Now, the two of you--I am referring to Senator Leahy and the \nPresiding Officer, Senator Wyden--have done wonderful things as the co-\nleaders of a task force, assigned by Senator Daschle, to bring the \nSenate Democrats up to snuff on the new technology around the country. \nAnd a good job has been done there.\n  One of the really thankless jobs in the Senate is to be a chairman of \nthe Foreign Operations Subcommittee of Appropriations. Senator Leahy is \na person who has a lot of seniority and would have his pick of many \ndifferent subcommittees. There are 13 of them on Appropriations in the \nSenate. But he has taken the Foreign Operations Subcommittee because he \nbelieves it renders a service to this body, to the country, and the \nworld. It is difficult, but he has been judicious in his leadership of \nthat subcommittee.\n\n[[Page S1968]]\n\n  I could go on and describe what Senator Leahy has done that has made \na difference in this country. But for people to criticize his \nchairmanship of the Judiciary Committee is something I will not allow \nto happen without speaking out.\n  I am not only proud of Senator Leahy, but I am proud of the Judiciary \nCommittee--not for what they did yesterday or did not do yesterday--\nbecause I am proud of the fact that they have tremendous \nresponsibility.\n  When I served in the State legislature, I served on the Judiciary \nCommittee. It seemed then, and it seems now in this body, that every \ndifficult issue comes to the Judiciary Committee. Whether it is \nantiterrorism legislation, abortion matters, or judicial nominations, \nall the tough stuff comes to the Judiciary Committee. Those 19 people \nwho serve on the Judiciary Committee have a very tough task, led by the \nsenior Senator from Vermont.\n\n  (Mr. LEAHY assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. REID. I rise to defend the Senate Judiciary Committee, not for \nwhat they did or didn't do yesterday but because I believe they have a \ntremendously difficult job. I also wish to defend individually the \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee--the Democratic members \nspecifically--on unfounded attacks against these men and women who \nvoted their conscience on the nomination of a judge. This judge was \nbeing asked to be elevated to the second highest court we have. The \nonly one above it is the Supreme Court. Reasonable people can disagree \nabout whether this man deserved a promotion, given his record as a \njudge. I am terribly concerned, however, that some people, even some \ncolleagues, are making this committee vote over one person into an \nunfortunately acrimonious fight.\n  It is not the vote of people of goodwill on the confirmation of a \njudge but the voices of anger and disappointment that will hurt our \ninstitution.\n  I hope we are not entering the era in which any disagreement is \nvilified and harsh, inappropriate rhetoric is employed to make points \nwith the fringes. We have to have disagreements here. That is what this \ninstitution is all about. We have an aisle here that separates \nDemocrats from Republicans. We have different philosophies about a lot \nof issues. The fact that there was a person who was not approved by a \ncommittee doesn't mean the institution is falling apart. It shows the \nstrength of the institution. The American people should be glad we \ndon't agree on everything.\n  I have heard a lot of talk, as I have listened since yesterday \nevening, about religion. I have had three Democratic Senators come to \nme and say they had no idea what Judge Pickering's religion was. I \nhave since learned he is a Baptist. I don't think it had anything to do \nwith what happened. I know it had nothing to do with what his religion \nis. I never heard it mentioned in the hearings I watched. It was not \nanything I read about in the newspaper. This is just a red herring \npeople have thrown out to try to make this into a much more difficult \nsituation than it should be.\n\n  Whether a nominee goes to a church, a temple, a mosque, or not, has \nnot been used by Congress in the consideration of any judicial \nnomination, and it should not be. Article VI of the Constitution \nrequires that no religious test shall ever be required as a \nqualification for any office or public trust under the United States. \nBut the responsibility to advise and consent on the President's \nnominees is one that the Senators take very seriously.\n  I have attended meetings where individual Senators have been very \nconcerned about what they do on any particular issue, whether it deals \nwith antiterrorism, a specific part of that legislation, whether it \ndeals with a specific matter dealing with abortion, or a judicial \nnomination. Some of our Democratic Senators have been receiving calls \nand criticism based on their religious affiliations.\n  The Judiciary Committee is made up of Catholics, Jews, Protestants. \nPeople who are Democratic members of that committee have been receiving \nphone calls since last night saying: You did this because you are a \nJew; you don't like Baptists; you are Catholic; you don't like \nBaptists. This is really a big stretch.\n  There are strong views on both sides regarding this matter of \nyesterday. But so what? There is nothing wrong with that.\n  One of the subjects I want to touch on briefly today is to express \nsome concern about statements from the administration, including from \nthe President, that the Senate's treatment of judicial nominees ``hurts \nour democracy.'' His statement is unsettling, unfounded, and it is a \nmisunderstanding of the fundamental separation of powers in the \nConstitution, the checks and balances in the Founders' design.\n  In our democracy, the President is not given unchecked powers to pack \nthe courts and give lifetime appointments to anyone who shares his \nview. Instead, the Constitution provides a democratic check on the \npower of appointment by requiring the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  This little document was given to me by Senator Robert Byrd. He \nsigned this little worn document. It means a lot to me personally. I \ncarry it with me almost every day. Sometimes I forget it, but not \noften. It gets in the way of a lot of things we try to do around here. \nThe Constitution gets in our way because the Constitution prevents us \nfrom doing certain things.\n  We have three separate but equal branches of government. That is the \nway it is. This little document established three separate but equal \nbranches of government. The legislative branch of government has all \nthe power that the executive branch of government has and all the power \nthe judicial branch of government has. We have responsibilities also \ngiven to us by the Constitution. For someone to say that the Senate's \ntreatment of judicial nominees hurts our democracy is a terrible \ndisappointment.\n  George W. Bush is President of the United States, not King of the \nUnited States. He is President Bush. He is President George, not King \nGeorge.\n  I also want to take a minute and respond to the criticism that \ncircuit court nominees are being treated unfairly. I believe nothing \ncould be further from the truth. By having fair hearings and voting on \nnominees, up or down, the Judiciary Committee is proceeding as it \nshould. Unlike the many judicial nominees who did not get hearings or \nwere accorded a hearing but were never allowed to be considered for a \nvote by the committee, we are trying to accord nominees whose paperwork \nis complete and whose blue slips are returned both a hearing and a fair \nup-or-down vote.\n\n  Senator Daschle on this floor and in press conferences has said that \nwe are not going to be in a payback mode. We are not going to treat \nthem like they treated us. If we did, Judge Pickering would not have \nhad two hearings. I said last night in closing, after I listened to all \nthe speeches, as we were going out: Isn't it interesting the item of \nbusiness today, Friday, that what we are going to do is a judicial \napproval. We voted on a judge. We approved an Arizona judge. Arizona \nhas two Republican Senators. This is not payback time.\n  Until Judge Edith Clement received a hearing on her nomination to the \nFifth Circuit court last year, there had been no hearings on Fifth \nCircuit nominees since 1994 and no confirmations since 1995. If Senator \nLeahy wanted to get even, he had a lot of even to get because he was \nnot very well treated as a ranking member of that committee. In 1999 \nthe Fifth Circuit declared an emergency because it had three vacancies \nthat had not been filled. Last year, in 2001, we were able to confirm \nthe first new judge in the Fifth Circuit in 6 years.\n  Jorge Rangel was nominated to the Fifth Circuit in 1997 by Bill \nClinton and never received a hearing on his nomination or a vote by the \ncommittee--never. His nomination to a Texas seat on the Fifth Circuit \nlanguished without action for 15 months.\n  Enrique Moreno was first nominated to the Fifth Circuit in 1999 and \nnever received a hearing on his nomination or a vote by the committee. \nHis nomination to a Texas seat on the Fifth Circuit languished without \naction for 17 months.\n  H. Alston Johnson was first nominated to the Fifth Circuit in 1999 \nand never received a hearing on his nomination or a vote by the \ncommittee in 1999, 2000, or the beginning of 2001. His nomination to a \nLouisiana seat on the Fifth Circuit languished without action for about \n2 years.\n\n[[Page S1969]]\n\n  In contrast, under the Leahy-led Judiciary Committee, President \nBush's nominees to the Fifth Circuit: Edith Brown Clement and Judge \nPickering, were treated fairly. Both received hearings less than 6 \nmonths after their nominations. In fact, Judge Clement was the first \nFifth Circuit nominee to receive a hearing since Judge James Dennis had \na hearing when Senator Biden chaired the Judiciary Committee in 1994. \nShe is the first person confirmed to that circuit since Judge Dennis's \nconfirmation almost 7 years ago.\n  Those who assert that the Democrats have caused a vacancy crisis in \nthe Federal courts are, regrettably, ignoring recent history. At the \nend of the 106th Congress, December 15, 2000, there were 76 vacancies \non the Federal courts. There were 80 when President Bush took office. \nThere were an unusual number of retirements taken by Federal judges \nduring the first 6 months of this Republican President. By the time the \nSenate was permitted to reorganize after change in minority, the number \nreached 111. Since then, 41 judicial nominees have been confirmed, and \nanother one was confirmed this morning. there will be another one on \nMonday. There are currently nine vacancies due to retirements and \ndeaths, but our rate of confirmation is greater than the rate of \nattrition. We have made more progress than was made in 4 of 6 years of \nRepublican leadership.\n  On January 3 of last year, there were 26 vacancies on the Federal \nappellate courts, some of these seats had been vacant for years, since \n1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000. Because of these long \nstanding vacancies, President Clinton renominated nine court of appeals \nnominees who had either not been given a hearing or a vote by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee under Republican leadership. None of those \nnominees received hearings or votes last spring before the change in \nmajority, and in fact no nominees were confirmed by the time the \nDemocrats became the majority.\n  By the time the Senate was permitted to reorganize last summer there \nwere 32 vacancies on the circuit courts. Since that time, an additional \nsix vacancies have arisen on the circuit courts. In spite of the \nextraordinary rate of attrition since the presidential election, \ncombined with the number of long-standing vacancies that were not acted \nupon during years of Republican control, we have kept up with the rate \nof attrition and exceeded it. We are doing what the Republican majority \ndid not do: keep up with the rate of attrition and move in the right \ndirection. While there are now 31 seats open on the appellate courts--\nmost of which were left vacant by Republican tactics in the previous \nsix years--seven nominees to the court of appeals have already been \nconfirmed, and next week we will have a hearing on another circuit \nnominee who I hope will turn out to be uncontroversial and well \nregarded by people from both sides of the aisle. Our task is made \neasier when the President works with members of both parties to \nnominate consensus nominees who are not outside of the mainstream and \nwhose record demonstrates that they will follow precedent--not try to \nfind a way around it.\n  The one thing I have not mentioned, Mr. President, is not only have \nwe had a change in leadership, but keep in mind what happened since the \nchange in leadership: September 11. We didn't have places to hold \nhearings. I attended a hearing down here in the Capitol. People were \njammed into this room. I don't think most people would have had the \nhearing. Senator Leahy decided to have the hearing. If that wasn't \nenough, we had an anthrax scare that closed down our building, and 50 \nSenators in the Hart Building were told they couldn't come in and their \nstaffs couldn't come in. That anthrax threat was directed toward \nSenator Daschle. Then we had one directed toward Senator Leahy.\n  As I said as I began my remarks today, there should be accolades \ngiven to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for what he has done \nto allow the process to proceed as fast as it has. Our friends on the \nother side of the aisle didn't even have excuses for holding up action. \nThis Judiciary Committee has had lots of reasons for holding it up, but \nthey pushed it ahead anyway. September 11, anthrax--they go ahead \nanyway.\n  Through the efforts of the Democratic Senators on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee 14 hearings have been held on judicial nominees. In \nonly nine months of Democratic leadership, seven circuit court nominees \nhave been confirmed. Only seven circuit court nominees were confirmed \non average in each year of Republican leadership. During the Republican \nmajority in the past six years, there was even one year in which no, \nzero, court of appeals nominees were voted out of Committee.\n  At the beginning of the year, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman \nLeahy outlined his plan to reform the process and practices used in the \npast, under Republican leadership, to deny Committee consideration of \njudicial nominees. Almost 60 judicial nominees never received a hearing \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee or received a hearing but were never \nvoted on by the Committee. We are holding more hearings for more \nnominees than in the recent past. We have moved away from the anonymous \nholds that so dominated the process from 1996 through 2000. We have \nmade home State Senators' blue slips public for the first time.\n  Mr. President, I repeat, as a Senator, there is no more difficult \ncommittee on which to serve than the Judiciary Committee. The issues \nare complex, difficult, hard. But this Judiciary Committee is one that \nhas done extremely well. And if there were a Super Bowl, this committee \nwould be placed in it. If there were a coach of the year, it would be \nthe chairman of the Committee, Senator Pat Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Smith are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/15/senate-section/article/S1969-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1969-S1970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       STATES WITH MORE GUNS HAVE MORE GUN DEATHS AMONG CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a few weeks ago the Harvard School of \nPublic Health released a study that shows children are dying from gun \nviolence at higher rates in States with higher levels of gun ownership. \nThe study, ``Firearm Availability and Unintentional Firearm Deaths, \nSuicide, and Homicide among 5 to 14 Year Olds,'' appears in the \nFebruary 2002 issue of The Journal of Trauma.\n  According to Center for Disease Control and Prevention statistics \ncited in the study, only motor vehicles and cancer claim more lives \nthan do firearms among children 5 to 14 years old. The Harvard study \npresents evidence of a correlation between the level of gun ownership \nin a State and the number of gun related deaths on the State level. The \nstudy asserts that children living in the five States with the highest \nlevels of gun ownership were more than 16 times more likely to die from \nunintentional firearm injury, almost seven times more likely to die \nfrom firearm suicide and more than three times more likely to die from \nfirearm homicide than children in the five States with the lowest \nlevels of gun ownership.\n  Most fatal firearm accidents and suicides occur when children and \nteens discover firearms at home that have been left loaded or \nunsecured. The Child Access Prevention Act is a common sense approach \nthat attempts to address one part of this problem. This legislation \nwould hold adults who fail to lock up a loaded firearm or an unloaded \nfirearm with ammunition accountable. Adults who fail to lock up their \nfirearm and ammunition would be held liable if the weapon was taken by \na child and used to kill or injure another person or him or herself. \nThe bill would also increase the penalties for selling a gun to a \njuvenile and create a gun safety education program that includes \nparent-teacher organizations\n\n[[Page S1970]]\n\nand local law enforcement. The legislation is similar to a State law \nwhich President Bush signed into law during his tenure as the Governor \nof Texas. The Harvard study only reinforces my support for this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/15/senate-section/article/S1970-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SETTLING THE SOFTWOOD LUMBER DISPUTE: POSSIBILITIES AND PROBLEMS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Bush administration is currently involved \nin negotiations to settle a dispute regarding the importation of \nCanadian softwood lumber.\n  Softwood lumber is essential for building quality, affordable homes \nin the United States.\n  Its price and availability have a major impact on the U.S. economy, \nworkers and consumers. The U.S. homebuilding industry employs 6.5 \nmillion people. The Census Bureau estimates a price increase of $1,500 \nfor the average new home--expected if an export tax or duty is imposed \non Canadian softwood lumber coming into the U.S.--which would prevent \napproximately 450,000 families from qualifying for a home mortgage. \nThese families are likely to be less advantaged groups in the \npopulation.\n  Quite simply, Canadian softwood lumber is needed here. It has \ndifferent qualities than the lumber produced in the U.S. and is used \nfor different purposes. The southern yellow pine produced in the U.S. \ncannot replace Canadian spruce-pine-fir, which is used by American home \nbuilders for interior walls. These homebuilders use U.S. southern \nyellow pine for decks and flooring because of its strength and ability \nto accept hard treatment. But if southern yellow pine were used in \ninterior walls, unlike Canadian spruce-pine-fir, it could twist, warp \nand shrink causing nails to ``pop.'' Obviously, this would result in \nproblems for home builders and consumers.\n  There are a number of proposed settlements that raise legal and \npractical concerns. These proposed settlements range from the \nimposition by the Canadian government of an ``export tax'' on the sale \nof Canadian lumber to U.S. companies, to mandated minimum prices \nestablished by both governments. Such settlements will cause volatility \nin lumber markets without adequately considering the disadvantages for \nU.S. consumers.\n  I urge the administration to base its decision on existing U.S. and \ninternational trade law, and I implore the administration to exclude \nfrom any settlement provisions that would impose a de facto, foreign \ncountry-imposed sales tax on U.S. homebuyers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/15/senate-section/article/S1970-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1970-S1971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  90TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GIRL SCOUTS\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the Girl \nScouts of America who are celebrating their 90th anniversary. As the \nlargest organization for girls in the world, the Girl Scouts promote \nself confidence, values, integrity, and leadership. Through this \nworthwhile organization, girls are able to build character, skills for \nsuccess, and have fun while doing it.\n  For a moment, I would like to brag about the Girl Scouts of Kansas. \nWith over 40,000 girls and over 10,000 adult members in Kansas, the \nGirl Scouts are an active and necessary presence in my home State.\n  Throughout Kansas, the Girl Scouts are involved in various volunteer \nand community activities. Some programs include: Promoting anti-\nviolence education; helping children of parents who are going through \ndivorce; reaching out to immigrant children; organizing activities \nbetween girls and their incarcerated mothers; partnering with the Boys \nand Girls Club of America on various projects.\n  I am proud of all our Girl Scouts, most especially the ones in \nKansas. Through the promotion of science, technology, health, fitness, \nand friendship, these girls will grow up to be outstanding young women. \nI commend all the Girl Scouts on their success and their commitment to \nthis organization.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 90th \nanniversary of the founding of the Girl Scouts, and congratulate the \norganization for its outstanding and unflagging efforts to make a \npositive impact on America's girls and young women for the past 90 \nyears.\n  While the Girl Scouts Organization has successfully adapted to the \nchanging times since its founding in 1912, thankfully its core values \nhave remained the same, to teach young girls about their physical \nhealth and well-being, provide a place for them to acquire self-\nconfidence and expertise, help them achieve their full potential, \nencourage them to act with integrity and character, and instill in them \nthe importance of contributing to society and their community.\n  The Girl Scouts of Maine exemplify these values. In addition to \nfostering the programs that are at the core of girl scouting, the Girl \nScouts of Maine have been visionary in creating an initiative to \nprovide young girls, ages 9-12, education on bone health awareness. \nConsidering that the National Osteoporosis Foundation recently found \nthat 30 million women over the age of 50 have some form of \nosteoporosis, it is critical that girls learn to foster these healthy \nhabits during their formative years.\n  In another example of the innovative work of the Girl Scouts of \nMaine, the Kennebec Council has launched the Women Investing In Girl \nScouts, or WINGS, program. This effort strives to link Maine's \nvulnerable young girls with successful working women to provide these \nyoung girls with guidance and mentoring through their most pivotal and \ndifficult years, in the hopes of decreasing the numbers of Maine girls \nwho fall victim to eating disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, and \nillegal activity and providing a positive influence at a crucial time.\n  I was heartened to recently learn that one in every seven girls in \nthe State of Maine participates in the Girl Scouts. That's over 12,000 \ngirls, a remarkable level of participation in a State of just one-and-\na-quarter million people. Worldwide, the Girl Scouts boast a thriving \nmembership of 3.8 million strong, and this membership continues to grow \nand prosper.\n  I again want to congratulate the Girl Scouts for 90 years of success, \nand wish the organization all the best as it embarks on its next 90 \nyears.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to enthusiastically commend the \ngood work of the Girl Scouts of the USA, on this week of their 90th \nAnniversary. For nine decades, this organization has been instrumental \nin the nurturing and development of millions of American youth in all \ncommunities, reaching beyond racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic \nbarriers. Today, Girl Scouting has a membership of 3.8 million, making \nit the largest organization for girls in the world. In my home State of \nWisconsin, there are 77,000 girls, one in five, who currently \nparticipate in Scouts.\n  One cannot quantify the positive impact the Girl Scouts have had on \nthis country and our youth. Countless girls have emerged from this \nwonderful organization with the qualities and values we hope our \nchildren will embody. Countless girls have left Scouts strong and \nconfident; thoughtful and creative; dedicated and involved; responsible \nand trustworthy. Countless girls have used their experiences in Scouts \nto develop a deep sense of justice, honor and integrity. Countless \ngirls have matured into role models, leaders and public servants in \ntheir communities. I have had the pleasure of talking with numerous \nGirl Scouts and Girl Scouts alumni who have described the positive role \nScouts has played in their lives. There are so many more stories that \nhave, and can, be told about the extraordinary impact this organization \nhas had.\n  I believe the best example of what the Girl Scouts represent is the \nGirl Scout Gold Award Young Women of Distinction. Each year, 10 young \nwomen receive this achievement, the organization's highest, for their \nexemplary sense of community service. I am proud to recognize one of \nthose women: Elsa, a 17-year-old, who hails from Shorewood, WI. Elsa \nestablished the Avenue Store, a clothing ministry for low-income \nindividuals in the Milwaukee area. As chairman of the board of the \nstore, Elsa worked with a board of adults, established guidelines for \nthe store, and designed and implemented a voucher system for obtaining \nclothes. She also worked with more than 60 schools and agencies in her \ncommunity and trained over 50 volunteers. In the project's first year, \nthe Avenue Store\n\n[[Page S1971]]\n\nserved over 500 people from several homeless shelters. Elsa is a fine \ncitizen, who embodies the profound impact Girl Scouts have on their \ncommunity and society.\n  Today, Girl Scouts of the USA continues to flourish, helping millions \nof girls grow strong. Girl Scouts continues to empower girls to develop \ntheir full potential; to relate positively to their peers; and to \ndevelop values that provide the foundation for good decision-making. It \nis my great honor to congratulate the Girl Scouts for 90 years of \nstrengthening America's youth, and I wish them all the best as they \nextend this tradition for 90 years and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/15/senate-section/article/S1971-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in August \n1991 in Longview, WA. A gay man was beaten by two attackers. The \nassailants, Mark H. Granger, 27, and Michael J. Watts, 39, were charged \nwith first degree assault in connection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/15/senate-section/article/S1971-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1971-S1972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nTHE 99th BIRTHDAY OF REAR ADMIRAL ELLIOTT BOWMAN STRAUSS, USN (Retired)\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the \noccasion of the 99th birthday of a true American patriot Rear Admiral \nElliott Bowman Strauss, USN (Ret.). His lifetime of extraordinary \nservice to this great Nation has been an inspiration to us all.\n  Elliott Bowman Strauss was born in Washington, DC on March 15, 1903, \nson of the late Admiral Joseph Strauss, USN, and Mrs. Mary Sweitzer \nStrauss, and grandson of the late Brigadier General N. B. Sweitzer, \nUSA. He attended Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, CT, and entered the \nU.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, on appointment at large in \nJune 1919. He was graduated and commissioned Ensign on June 7, 1923, \nand subsequently progressed in rank to that of Captain, to date from \nMay 1, 1943.

Embarked as an \nobserver in a British destroyer which rendered close fire support \nduring the Allied raid on Dieppe on August 19, 1942, Captain (then \nCommander) Strauss obtained information of great value to the United \nStates and Great Britain in the planning and execution of subsequent \noperations. Ordered to the Normandy beaches on D plus 2-Day, he applied \nhis comprehensive knowledge of the build-up procedure in solving far \nshore shipping problems which threatened to delay the operation. \nServing with distinction, skill and courage despite enemy air and \nground attack throughout these missions to halt German aggression, \nCaptain Strauss upheld the highest traditions of the United States \nNaval Service.''\n  On October 12, 1944, he assumed command of the USS Charles Carroll, \nan attack transport which finished her share of the follow-up \noperations in connection with the Southern France campaign, and sailed \non October 25 for Norfolk, Virginia.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a group \nof young Indiana students who have shown great educative achievement. I \nwould like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the winners of \nthe 2001-2002 Eighth Grade Youth Essay Contest which I sponsored in \nassociation with the Indiana Farm Bureau and Bank One of Indiana. These \nstudents have displayed strong writing abilities and have proven \nthemselves to be outstanding young Hoosier scholars. I submit their \nnames for the Congressional Record because they demonstrate the \ncapabilities of today's students and are fine representatives of our \nNation.\n  This year, Hoosier students wrote on the theme, ``World-Wide Meals \nfrom Hoosier Farms.'' I submit for the Record the winning essays of \nCrista Dismore of Scott County and Joseph Jochim of Gibson County. As \nState winners of the Youth Essay Contest, these two outstanding \nstudents are being recognized on Friday, March 15, 2002 during a visit \nto our Nation's Capitol.\n  The essays follow:\n\n                 World-Wide Meals From Hoosier Farmers\n\n                   (By Christa Dismore, Scott County)\n\n       Indiana farms can contribute significantly to the \n     production of food for people around the world. Agriculture \n     in Indiana is a large industry with 65,000 farms containing \n     15.5 million acres of farmland. Hoosier farmers will use new \n     technologies to increase their crop yield, produce healthier \n     food, and sell their crops to more specialized markets.\n       Farming is becoming more like science. In Indiana, corn \n     production is king. Through improvements in technology such \n     as new equipment, safer pest control, and hybrid seed the \n     yield per acre has increased from 40 to 150 bushels per acre. \n     Also, the farmers will be able to raise livestock that is \n     less fattening for our bodies because of a new science, \n     genomics, which allows researchers to make changes in plants \n     and animals. This technology will be important in keeping \n     Indiana a leader in food production since Indiana farmers \n     supply our dinner tables with bacon, eggs, steaks, and milk. \n     Indiana farms will become more specialized in that they will \n     only raise one type of animal instead of a variety of \n     animals. An example is Rose Acre Farms in southern Indiana \n     which raises chickens to produce eggs.\n       Indian agriculture affects my daily life because my \n     grandfather grows a large garden and my father sells farming \n     equipment. I eat tomatoes, corn, green beans, potatoes, beets \n     and broccoli from the garden. My dad tells me abut tillers, \n     loaders, backhoes, and trailers that farmers use. In Austin, \n     Indiana, Morgan Foods is one of the nation's largest \n     condensed soup manufacturers and many of my friends' families \n     work there.\n       Hoosier farmers will do their part in providing the world \n     with food. Indiana has three of the most well-known research \n     universities, a prominent agricultural school, and \n     many science-based companies that will help Indiana to \n     become a leader in meeting the world-wide demands on the \n     food supply.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  World-Wide Meals From Hoosier Farms\n\n                   (By Joseph Jochim, Gibson County)\n\n       As I sit next to my Dad in his combine, I watch as it \n     husks, shells, and cleans the bright yellow kernels of corn. \n     I'm amazed at the large amount of corn, soybeans, and wheat \n     he can grow and harvest to help feed our world. He pays close \n     attention to the markets world-wide as well as international \n     trade agreements between countries that affect our prices.\n       Indiana, as well as the rest of the U.S. grain belt states, \n     supply two-fifths of the world's supply of corn. Corn is \n     Indiana's leading crop. Much of this corn is fed to Indiana's \n     livestock like hogs, cattle, and poultry. This meat is \n     exported to countries like Japan, Canada, China, and Mexico. \n     Since October 1, 2001, we had corn sales to South Korea, \n     Russia, Israel, Uganda/Angola, and Montenegro. Locally, \n     Azteca Milling processes white corn purchased from area \n     farmers into white flour. This is sold world-wide for \n     products like tortillas and tamale shells.\n       Soybeans are another of Indiana's valuable farm products. \n     So far this year, sales of our soybeans have increased to \n     Indonesia, Canada, China and Mexico. We also export soybeans \n     to Japan, Algeria, South Korea, Peru, and China.\n       With increasing technology, mechanization, productivity, \n     and soil conservation, Indiana's farmers are increasing their \n     yields. Improvements and discoveries in genetics and plant \n     breeding are helping us to produce more nutritious foods that \n     require less pesticides and herbicides. For example, in \n     Indiana we commonly use soybeans resistant to the herbicide \n     Roundup. Therefore, less herbicide, field cultivating, and \n     fuel is used.\n       In addition, Indiana helps supply whole meal food \n     assistance to the needy in areas like Southeast Asia.\n       I'm proud that Indiana and my dad help produce whole meals \n     like grains, vegetables, fruit, dairy products, and meats to \n     feed the world's growing population.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    2001-2002 District Essay Winners\n\n       District 1: Eric Jensen (Starke County) and Anne LaFree \n     (St. Joseph County).\n       District 2: Zach Heimach (DeKalb County) and Melinda Hohler \n     (DeKalb County).\n       District 3: Kevin Lange (Benton County) and Brittany \n     Scherer (Benton County).\n       District 4: Aaron Poole (Jay County) and Heather Meitzler \n     (Huntington County).\n       District 5: Jason Allen (Vermillion County) and Marina \n     Nicholson (Morgan County).\n       District 6: Aaron Nees (Marion County) and Hillary Foltz \n     (Delaware County).\n       District 7: Matt Steves (Greene County) and Christina \n     Riggle (Daviess County).\n       District 8: Greg Rennekamp (Rush County) and Lauren Haas \n     (Franklin County).\n       District 9: Joseph Jochim (Gibson County) and Lynn Fletcher \n     (Warrick County).\n       District 10: Jonathan Raichel (Scott County) and Christa \n     Dismore (Scott County).\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     2001-2002 County Essay Winners\n\n       Bartholomew: Sarah Michael and Sam McAleese, St. \n     Bartholomew Catholic School.\n       Benton: Kevin Lange and Brittany Scherer, Benton Central \n     Jr. HS.\n       Cass: Heath Karnafel and Kayla Somers, Columbia Middle \n     School.\n       Clay: MacKenzie Watson, Clay City Jr. HS.\n       Daviess: Christina Riggle, Washington Jr. HS.\n       Delaware: Zachary Rabenstein and Hillary Foltz, Heritage \n     Hall Christian School.\n       DeKalb: William Zachary Heimach and Melinda Hohler, DeKalb \n     Middle School.\n       Franklin: Andrew Sparks, Laurel School, and Lauren Haas, \n     St. Michael School.\n       Gibson: Joseph Jochim, Owensville Community School.\n\n[[Page S1973]]\n\n       Greene: Matt Steves, Linton-Stockton Jr. HS, and Laura \n     Bartlow, Calvary Christian School.\n       Hamilton: Brett Finkelmeier and Claire Harwood, Carmel Jr. \n     HS.\n       Hancock: Curtis Merlau, Greenfield Middle School.\n       Hendricks: Chris Beard and Jana Emmelman, Kingsway \n     Christian School.\n       Henry: Brian Butler and Amy Wenning, Tri Jr. HS.\n       Howard: Eric Talbert and Rachele Carter, Western Jr. HS.\n       Huntington: Heather Meitzler, Huntington Catholic School.\n       Jackson: Ryan Hirtzel and Laura Kilpatrick, Seymour Middle \n     School.\n       Jasper: Jason Simmons and Amy Streitmatter, Rensselaer \n     Middle School.\n       Jay: Aaron Poole and Shannon Rines, East Jay Middle School.\n       Knox: Martha Vance, North Knox Jr. HS.\n       Lake: Matt Trocha, DeMotte Christian School, and Stephanie \n     Strnatka, St. Michael School.\n       Madison: Aron Brown and Alison Denny, Southside Middle \n     School.\n       Marion: Aaron Nees and Tracy Horan, St. Jude School.\n       Monroe: Brandon Petesch, Batchelor Middle School.\n       Morgan: Matt Gegg and Marina Nicholson, Mooresville \n     Christian Academy.\n       Posey: Kelley Clem, North Posey Jr. HS.\n       Rush: Greg Rennekamp, Benjamin Rush Middle School.\n       St. Joseph: Michael Chartier, St. Matthew Cathedral School, \n     and Anne LaFree, Jackson Middle School.\n       Scott: Jonathan Raichel and Christa Dismore, Austin Middle \n     School.\n       Spencer: Matt Kaufman and Breanna Faulkenberg, Heritage \n     Hills Middle School.\n       Starke: Eric Jensen and Andrea Bastin, Oregon-Davis Jr. HS.\n       Vanderburgh: Chris Mutschler, St. James School.\n       Vermillion: Jason Allen and Elisha Marie Chancey, North \n     Vermillion Jr. HS.\n       Wabash: Cody White and Erica Grossman, Northfield Jr. HS.\n       Warrick: Nathan Rice and Lynn Fletcher, Boonville Jr. HS.\n       Washington: Casey Nesmith and Casey Parker, West Washington \n     Jr. HS.\n       Wayne: Timothy Mosley and Kaitlin Vaughn, Centerville Jr. \n     HS.\n       Wells: Nathan Meyer and Janelle Meyer, Bethlehem Lutheran \n     School.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/15/senate-section/article/S1973-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PASSING OF JOHN M. EISENBERG\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, John Eisenberg, director of the \nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ, succumbed to a brain \ntumor this past Sunday. Although John had battled his illness for \nmonths, his death was a disturbing shock to many. He had done so much \nto improve healthcare in this Nation, and I know there was much more he \nwanted to do. Still, John leaves a legacy--both professional and \npersonal--so large that it cannot and will not be forgotten.\n  John Eisenberg was an outstanding public servant. He did not play \npartisan politics. Nor could he be corrupted by power. Simply put, he \nwas passionate about people. It was his mission to improve the quality \nof health care in America. He dedicated his life to that mission as the \ndirector of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, as a \nfounder of the Congressional Physician Payment Review Commission, and \nas a member and leader of countless other societies, associations, and \ninstitutes. For John, public service was more than his job; it was his \nlife's calling, which he answered with distinction and excellence.\n  I consider myself privileged to have worked with John Eisenberg for \nmany years and on many issues. He taught me so much not just about \nimproving the quality of healthcare, but about being a leader by \ntransforming the way people think about issues and institutions. I know \nhe had an impact on leaders in all branches of government, and men and \nwomen at all levels of government respected him. And as for the medical \ncommunity: John was one of them. I have heard this often and, even with \nthe event of his passing, I still hear it today.\n  As a physician, John Eisenberg saved the lives of many. As a leader, \nhe enhanced the lives of millions. As a friend, he touched the lives of \nus all. The largeness of his life and legacy will endure in our \nmemories and warm our hearts for many years to come. John Eisenberg \nwill be known as more than one of the good ones, but one of the best \nthere ever was and ever will be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/15/senate-section/article/S1973-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:23 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2146.

A bill to establish the Department of National Border \nSecurity; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise today to introduce a piece of \nlegislation which tries to address one of the oppressive problems we \nhave in confronting the issues of terrorism in our country as we move \nforward; that is, checking our borders and making sure we have control \nover the people who are coming into our country and how they can come \ninto our country.\n  As a nation, we have traditionally had very open borders, which is \nsomething in which we take great pride. Unfortunately, people who wish \nto cause us harm, people who wish to kill Americans, people who wish to \nkill Americans by the thousands, and who have stated that their sole \npurpose in life is to kill Americans, have taken advantage of that \nopenness. Certainly we saw on September 11 the situation that occurred.\n  We have 100,000 miles of coastline, 2,000 miles of land border with \nMexico, and 4,000 miles of land border with Canada. Last year, we had \n127 million automobiles come across those borders, 11 million trucks, 2 \nmillion railcars, and 1 million commercial airplanes. More than 500 \nmillion people were admitted to the United States last year. You can \nsee that our borders are aggressively used.\n  There is great international commerce, which there should be, and we \nwant to continue that. But one of the problems we have is that the \nagencies responsible for managing our borders have been disoriented, \ndysfunctional, spread about, and uncoordinated. We have seen some \nreally horrendous instances of mismanagement. We have also seen \ninstances that have occurred as a result of failure of communication. \nWe have seen failures that have\n\n[[Page S1975]]\n\noccurred as a result of turf fights between different agencies. We have \nseen agencies which have found their purpose to be unfocused in their \nexecution of the protection of the borders.\n  The most recent and startling and almost unbelievable example, of \ncourse, was the delivery of visas to a Florida flight school just this \nweek for two people who committed the atrocities in New York. America \nis outraged. Clearly, the President was shocked. All of us were shocked \nthat that would happen. That was a total example of an incredible \nbreakdown in the systems which are managing our borders; that is, the \nINS.\n  What I propose today is to try to get some coherence into this \neffort, to bring together the agencies which are responsible to protect \nour borders, to put them all under one management structure, and to \ncreate a new Cabinet-level Department, which would be called the \n``Department of National Border Security.''\n  Under this Department, we would take the various agencies which have \nresponsibility for managing our borders and protecting our Nation and \nput them into this Department so that they would be communicating with \neach other and have a streamlined management and command process--\nsomething which they do not have today.\n  Included in this Department would be, for example, the U.S. Customs \nService, the U.S. Coast Guard, large elements of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, including, of course, Border Patrol, and \nelements of the DEA which have responsibility for border security in \nthe area of drugs, and the Agriculture Quarantine Inspection Program, \nwhich obviously controls food that comes into the country.\n  The result of putting all these groups together in one management \nstructure will be that there will be, hopefully, a coordinated approach \nto managing our borders. It doesn't guarantee it. But it is very clear \nthat the system we have today, because of the lack of coordination, \nbecause of the overlapping authority, because of the turf issues, and \nbecause of the lack of centralized directional command is not working.\n\n  I happen to be ranking on a committee which has specific jurisdiction \nover funding for the Justice Department and the State Department and \nwhich has a large percentage of responsibility for our border \nactivities, especially the INS. I can tell you from my own experience \nas the ranking member, and formerly as chairman, of that Subcommittee \non Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary of the Appropriations \nCommittee, that unless we get these parties together functioning under \none umbrella of leadership, we are simply not going to get our borders \nunder control.\n  Is this the full answer to the problem--the reorganizing of these \nDepartments? Absolutely not. There also has to be the intention on the \npart of the parties who are serving these Departments to accomplish the \ngoal. There has to be leadership on the part of the administration to \naccomplish the goal of border security and making it more efficient.\n  But as a practical matter, without this first step I personally do \nnot think we are ever going to get the type of coordination that is \nrequired in order for leadership in this area to be effective.\n  What we have today in this arena is that these various Departments \nare spread across the Government. On top of it, we have each reporting \nto a separate Department Secretary. On top of that, we have the \nHomeland Security Director, of course. Overseeing all of it, we have \nthe President. As a result, even though everybody wants to go in the \nsame direction, it is like six or seven horses pulling in opposite \ndirections. By bringing them all under the same tent, we will have a \ncentralized activity.\n  We should not, for example, be housing the Customs Service in one \nbuilding, the Border Patrol in another building, the DEA in another \nbuilding, and have them not generally communicating with each other at \na border crossing point; or have the resources of one agency be in \nsurplus at one border crossing point while the resources of another \nagency are strapped at the same crossing point and not having them be \nable to work together to try to more effectively manage those resources \nso that we get the most efficient use out of the people, the parties, \nand the items involved.\n  All of that problem which exists today with tremendous \ndysfunctionalism between these various agencies as they try to relate \nto each other, all of that problem is a function of the fact that they \nall report up separate stovepipes, and the only generally coordinating \nevent that occurs comes from the President and the new Homeland \nSecurity Director. But that person, Governor Ridge, has no legislative \nauthority and no budget authority. Therefore, as a practical matter, \nother than having the good will of the President behind him, he does \nnot have a whole lot of authority.\n\n  So when you have one Department over here--let's say, Treasury, with \nCustoms--and one Department over here--let's say, INS, with the Border \nPatrol, and Justice heading that Department up--you tend to have people \nwho are functioning independent of each other, who, although they may \nhave the good intentions to communicate with each other, really do not \nand do not work effectively as a result of that. We do not get the best \nresponsiveness.\n  So it is just logic, it is just good governance, and, for that \nmatter, good management--which I recognize maybe is anathema to \ngovernment--that all the people who are responsible for one function of \nthe Government, which is protecting our borders, be functioning under \nthe same leadership structure and, therefore, reading off of the same \npage. That is what this new Department will create.\n  This new Cabinet level Department will set up a structure where \neverybody who is responsible for the border will report to a single \nCabinet leader and, as a result, will be functioning off the same page \nrelative to the way the border is managed. Hopefully, then we will be \ngetting the most efficient and effective use of those people who are \nmaking a genuinely good effort today but a lot of which is involving \njust the spinning of wheels because of the lack of coordination. Then \nwe will get coordination into that good effort and, as a result, get \nbetter border protection.\n  This is a thought which is not necessarily original to me. However, \nit is obvious to me. As the ranking member and former chairman of the \ncommittee which has jurisdiction over a chunk of this area of \nresponsibility, it is something I believe we need to do. I believe \nthere are other groups who have looked at the border who have agreed \nwith this approach.\n  The Third Annual Report to the President and the Congress of the \nAdvisory Panel to Assess Domestic Response Capabilities for Terrorism \nInvolving Weapons of Mass Destruction, which essentially was Governor \nGilmore's commission, came to the same conclusion: that there had to be \na better centralization. They did not do it in the terms of forming a \nnew Department, but they came to the same substantive conclusion that \nthere had to be a better coordination, collection, and organization of \nthe information coming into the country and of the tracking of people \ncoming into the country.\n  The Hart-Rudman Commission, Roadmap to National Security, Imperative \nfor Change, which reported on February 15, came to the exact conclusion \nthat I am proposing in the bill:\n\n       Steps must be taken to strengthen the three individual \n     organizations themselves.\n\n  They were talking here about Customs, Border Patrol, and the Coast \nGuard.\n\n       We recommend the creation of an independent Homeland \n     Security Agency with responsibility for planning, \n     coordinating, and integrating various U.S. Government \n     activities involving homeland security.\n\n  This does not go completely to that point, but it goes a long way in \nthe area of border activity in that it creates a Centralized Border \nCenter. They also suggested that that group, which they called the \nHomeland Security Agency, should include the Coast Guard, the Customs, \nthe Border Patrol, and it should have Cabinet level operational effect.\n  Even the White House has acknowledged there is a lack of coordination \nin this area. It was interesting, in relation to that, Governor Ridge \nmade the statement: If you asked me today who is responsible for the \nborder, I would say to you, in response, what part of the border? The \nborders remain disturbingly vulnerable to terrorism.\n\n[[Page S1976]]\n\n There is no direct line of accountability for agencies charged with \nprotecting them.\n  So I think Governor Ridge clearly sees the problem as I see it, which \nis that we do not have a coordinated central management point for all \nborder crossing activity. It makes no sense to have Customs in \nTreasury, INS in Justice and DEA in Justice, and the Coast Guard over \nin Transportation with no coordinated central management point for all \nborder crossing activity. When these agencies serve to protect the \nborder as their primary responsibility, and with the threat of \nterrorism that we confront today, they should clearly be together \nmanaging the issue of protecting our border as a coordinated unit under \na Cabinet level Secretary.\n  That is what the legislation which I am introducing today does.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI:\n  S. 2021. A bill to amend the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to \nprohibit the use of certain anti-competitive forward contracts; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to speak this \nmorning. I will speak on a favorite topic of our area of the country, \nthe packer concentration. It is a huge problem for our ranchers in \nkeeping them from getting what they should be getting for raising the \nlivestock for this country. So I rise to introduce a bill that amends \nthe Packers and Stockyards Act to reform livestock formula price \ncontracts. This bill aims to rid the livestock industry of pricing \nschemes which take advantage of hard-working ranchers. It requires \ncontracts to contain a fixed base price and to be traded in open public \nmarkets.\n  Currently, there are four packers that slaughter 80 percent of the \ncattle in the United States. They hold the supply of livestock captive \nin a number of ways.\n  Captive supply is when packers either own livestock or contract to \npurchase livestock more than 2 weeks before slaughter. Packers use \ncaptive supply to ensure their slaughter lines have consistent \ninventory. I will not argue with that original goal, for that goal. \nCaptive supply makes good business sense. All businesses want to \nmaintain a steady supply of inputs to ensure their production and \ncontrol costs.\n  But packers go beyond good organization and business performance to \nmarket manipulation. I have been working on this problem for 5 years \nand, so far, all we have been able to do is prove that there is a \npacker concentration.\n  With captive supply, packers can purposefully drive down the market \nprice by refusing to buy in the open market. This deflates all \nlivestock prices and limits the market access of producers who have not \naligned with specific packers.\n  Most of us have not signed a formula price contract to sell a load of \nlivestock, but many of us have sold a house. To illustrate the \nseriousness of this problem, and make it a little easier to understand, \nlet's explore how you would sell a house with a formula price contract \nin a market structured like the current livestock market.\n  It is March, and you know you will be selling your home in July. As a \nwise seller, you want to have a buyer for your home before that time. \nNow, what if it turns out that the other people do not really buy homes \nfrom each other anymore, and what if, in fact, you found out there were \nonly four main companies that handled over 80 percent of all of the \nreal estate transactions? You would have no choice but to deal with one \nof those companies.\n  Now, one of them would offer you a contract stating that you will \nreceive $10,000 over the average price of what other similar homes are \nselling for in your area in July. Sounds like a good deal, doesn't it?\n  To manage your risk and ensure a buyer, you have been practically \nforced to sign a contract that does not specify how much you will \nreceive. It says you will receive $10,000 over the average price at \nthat time. There should be a tingle of fear in the pit of your stomach \nand it will mature to full-fledged panic when you close the deal in \nJuly. This is why. The four real estate companies have been planning. \nThey decide to pull away from the market so all the home selling in \nJuly that is not contracted to these four companies floods the market \nand the price for homes in your area drops $12,000.\n  What have you done? By trying to manage your risk in a limited \nmarket, you sold your home for $2,000 less than what the average price \nshould have been, if there would have been a normal open market such as \nwe have in the housing market.\n  Livestock producers face that same problem. Yesterday there were \n91,906 head of cattle arriving at packing plants for slaughter. Forty-\nfour percent of those were bought by a formula price marketing \narrangement. Now you know what that means.\n  Just like the housing example, the money that producers lose in \nformula price contracts adds up over a year. When totaled, captive \nsupply costs producers an estimated average of $1 billion per year, \naccording to a study done by an Oregon State University professor.\n  I am sure you didn't notice when you went to the grocery store to buy \nyour beef that the price was lower because it is not. The packer \nconcentration controls the price at that end, too.\n  Another Senator from Wyoming faced the same concentration of market \npower in the packing industry 80 years ago. A predecessor to the Senate \nthat held the seat I hold now, Senator John B. Kendrick, said:\n\n       [The packing industry] has been brought to such a high \n     degree of concentration that it is dominated by a few men. \n     The packers, so-called, stand between hundreds of thousands \n     of producers on one hand and millions of consumers on the \n     other. They have their fingers on the pulse of both the \n     producing and consuming markets and are in such a position of \n     strategic advantage they have unrestrained power to \n     manipulate both markets to their own advantage and to the \n     disadvantage of over 99 percent of the people of this \n     country. Such power is too great, Mr. President, to repose in \n     the hands of any men.\n\n  This great power Senator Kendrick talked about resides in the hands \nof the packers once again.\n  My bill does two things to change the situation. It requires that \nlivestock producers have a fixed base price in their contracts. It also \nputs these contracts up for bid in the open market where they belong. \nUnder this bill, livestock contracts must contain a fixed base price on \nthe day the contract is signed. This prevents packers from manipulating \nthe base price at the point of sale and time of sale.\n  You may hear allegations that this bill ends quality driven \nproduction, but this bill does not prevent adjustments to the base \nprice for quality grade or other factors that are outside of the packer \ncontrol. It prevents packers from changing the base price based on \nfactors that they do control. You also may hear that this bill ends \ntraditional forward contracting. However, contracts that are based on \nthe futures market are also exempted from the bill's requirements \nbecause the futures market is not controlled by the packers.\n  My bill also limits the size of contracts to the equivalent of a load \nof livestock, meaning 40 cattle or 30 swine. It doesn't limit the \nnumber of contracts that can be offered by an individual. This key \nportion prevents small and medium-sized livestock producers from being \nshut out of deals that contain thousands of livestock per contract.\n  In the past I have tried to get some transparency of reporting. The \npacker concentration has influenced the rules so they didn't have to \nreport on the prices they are paying. You go into a market blind. We \nthought we had the problem solved, and they helped to influence a \nlittle 3/60 rule so if less than three packers or contracts were sold \nin a day, or if more than 60 percent of the market was by one of them, \nthey didn't have to report. It virtually wiped out reporting in the \nsheep industry. We have some changes in that, but some changes for \ntransparency need to be made.\n  There are a number of benefits accompanying this bill. It effectively \nincreases buyer competition without resorting to increasing buyer \nnumbers through a messy packer breakup. It gives fair access to all \nproducers to compete for contracts on a level playing field with big \nproducers. This bill encourages public and electronic trading of great \nnumbers of livestock, providing greater price transparency. That is \nwhere we are trying to go on all of this.\n  Simply put, this bill makes packers and livestock producers bid \nagainst\n\n[[Page S1977]]\n\neach other to win a contract--no more secret deals. We know the packers \nare engaging in secret deals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record this \nadvertisement I have collected.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, SD, Feb. 3, 2002]\n\nSenator Johnson's Farm Bill Amendment Imperils the Job Security of His \n     Own Constituents and Would Destroy the Pork and Beef Industry\n\n       To The Argus Leader Editor and the People of Sioux Falls \n     and South Dakota: We want to call your attention to and \n     correct certain misleading and untrue statements that have \n     been made by or attributed to Senator Tim Johnson and \n     published in the Argus Leader on January 27, 2002 about \n     Smithfield Foods, John Morrell, and our plant in Sioux Falls.\n\n\n             senator tim johnson false statement number one\n\n       ``The bipartisan Johnson-Grassley Amendment does not \n     negatively affect the John Morrell pork slaughter and \n     processing plant in Sioux Falls.''\n\n       Fact: The Johnson Amendment (S. Amdt. 2534) to the Senate \n     Farm Bill (S. 1731) prohibiting meat packers from owning \n     livestock farms or controlling livestock for more than 14 \n     days would have a huge negative impact on the future of the \n     Morrell plant in Sioux Falls and its 3,200 employees. Our \n     company is both a meatpacker and a producer and we have made \n     major investments in our system to provide a healthy product \n     to consumers at the lowest possible price and to assure them \n     of food safety, uniformity, and consistency in those \n     products. The Johnson Amendment, if it becomes law, would \n     have a major negative impact on our company and the red meat \n     industry as it exists today. A clear choice for packers that \n     own livestock or contract for livestock would be to sell or \n     close facilities. The Sioux Falls plant, which is nearly 100 \n     years old, and the oldest hog processing plant in our system \n     by far, would head the list of candidates. Critical to this \n     plant's future and continued operation is an assured and \n     stable supply of high-quality hogs grown to our demanding \n     specifications as to care, quality and food safety. Hogs \n     represent the ``fuel'' that drives the plant. Without an \n     assured and stable quality livestock supply, we cannot meet \n     the demands and requirements of our customers.\n       Restrictive laws such as the Johnson-Grassley-Wellstone \n     Amendment already have had a major negative impact on the \n     agri-business economy of South Dakota. As a result of the \n     state's restrictive farming practices (Amendment E), the hog \n     supply to our plant now comes 20% from South Dakota, 40% from \n     Minnesota, 20% from Canada, and the remaining 20% from other \n     midwestern states. As a result of unnecessary government \n     regulations such as Amendment E, hog production in South \n     Dakota declined 50% during the period 1995 to 2001.\n       Senator Johnson and his staff have offered no study or \n     analysis of the impact that his Amendment would have on the \n     agri-business economy not only of South Dakota but also on \n     the entire country. On the other hand, eight leading agri-\n     business economists from the country's leading land-grant \n     universities, led by Wayne Purcell (Alumni Distinguished \n     Professor of Agricultural and Applied Economics, Virginia \n     Tech University) and including Dillon Feuz (Professor of \n     Agricultural Economics, University of Nebraska), Glenn Grimes \n     (Emeritus Professor of Agricultural Economics, University of \n     Missouri), Marvin L. Hayenga (Professor of Economics, Iowa \n     State University), Stephen R. Koontz (Professor of \n     Agriculture and Resource Economics, Colorado State \n     University), John D. Lawrence (Professor of Economics and \n     Director ISU Beef Center, Iowa State University), Ted C. \n     Schroeder (Professor of Agricultural Economics, Kansas State \n     University), and Clement E. Ward (Professor of Agricultural \n     Economics, Oklahoma State University), have recently \n     published an independent study that concludes that the \n     Johnson Amendment would have disastrous effects on major \n     sectors of the agri-business economy.\n       Their study says that the amendment would actually lower \n     hog prices because of the great glut of supply that would \n     result from divestiture; that it would give back the \n     advantage and gain that the U.S. industry has made over the \n     last 15 years to foreign countries such as Argentina, Brazil, \n     Canada and Australia; that it would cause companies like ours \n     to essentially forfeit billions of dollars of investments \n     that we have made to move the U.S. to the forefront of the \n     industry; that it would have a major negative impact on \n     credit availability of farmers who would no longer be able to \n     rely on firm contracts with packers to use as security with \n     their bank lenders; and that it would give the efficient, \n     vertically-integrated poultry industry an even greater \n     competitive advantage over the pork and beef industries than \n     it now currently enjoys.\n       Had Senator Johnson bothered to conduct any study or \n     analysis, or reviewed any public USDA figures, he would have \n     found that in the last ten years, producers have been \n     profitable in 8 of those years, and the division of the pork \n     dollar shows retailers with the greatest share, producers \n     with the second greatest share, and the packers in a distant \n     third position.\n\n\n            Senator Tim Johnson False Statement Number Two:\n\n       ``Johnson said he has been assured by Morrell and its \n     parent company, Virginia-based Smithfield Foods Inc., that \n     the Sioux Falls plant operates within the restrictions of the \n     amendment.''\n\n       Fact: This is a false statement and we are astonished that \n     Senator Johnson would place his name behind it. Senator \n     Johnson has never extended the courtesy or taken the time to \n     meet with senior officers of Smithfield Foods. In recent \n     years, I personally traveled to Washington, once with Richard \n     Poulson, another senior officer of Smithfield Foods, and on \n     another occasion with Patrick Boyle, president and chief \n     executive officer of the American Meat Institute, to meet \n     with Senator Johnson by prior scheduled appointment to \n     discuss issues in South Dakota. On both occasions, Senator \n     Johnson was ``too busy'' to meet with us and delegated a \n     junior staffer to attend the meeting in his stead.\n       Despite the fact that Senator Johnson has had no interest \n     in meeting with Smithfield officials, his staff was fully \n     advised of the precarious nature of the Sioux Falls plant \n     prior to his introducing his Amendment to the Farm Bill. Our \n     Sioux Falls plant manager traveled to Washington on December \n     28, 2001 to meet with Senator Johnson and his aides and told \n     them that the greatest negative impact of his Amendment would \n     be on his own constituents and that the Amendment in the end \n     will benefit no one but the poultry industry. Smithfield \n     Foods wants to make it quite clear to Senator Johnson that he \n     can take full credit for putting 3,200 jobs at peril by \n     causing South Dakota's third-largest employer to reconsider \n     it's prior decision to pursue a major renovation, update, and \n     expansion of the Sioux Falls plant, or to build a new, more \n     modern plant in South Dakota to take advantage of the strong \n     local work force and rural ethic that is so important to our \n     business.\n       Smithfield Foods will dedicate its resources and make its \n     future investments in states and countries where we are \n     welcomed by the elected and appointed state, federal or other \n     governmental officials. We consider Senator Johnson's actions \n     in pursuing his Amendment to be hostile to the survival of \n     the pork industry, Smithfield Foods, the Morrell plant, and \n     to our employees in Sioux Falls because he was made fully \n     aware of the consequences of his amendment before he \n     introduced it.\n       It is unfortunate that Senator Johnson would sponsor such \n     an ill-conceived piece of legislation even after the Senate \n     Agriculture Committee had voted it down in December by a vote \n     of 12-9. He doesn't seem to understand that his state's anti-\n     corporate farming laws have already delivered a near fatal \n     blow to South Dakota's hog growing industry and that his \n     current action is simply another nail in the coffin. One of \n     the more puzzling things about Senator Johnson's Amendment is \n     that he apparently seeks to destroy the red meat industry \n     while leaving the poultry industry untouched. For years the \n     poultry industry has taken major market share away from the \n     red meat industry because of its ability to own and control \n     by contract the quality of its livestock supply.\n       Background: Smithfield Foods' involvement with John Morrell \n     and the Sioux Falls Plant.\n       After all the other major industry players had for years \n     rejected the opportunity to buy John Morrell and to keep the \n     plants open, Smithfield Foods agreed to purchase the company \n     in 1995. The Sioux Falls plant was losing money at the time \n     Smithfield purchased it and would have closed had we not \n     purchased it. Today, the plant is profitable. It contributes \n     in excess of $1 billion a year to the South Dakota economy. \n     How did this transformation happen? The answer is quite \n     simple: Smithfield has invested over $65 million in the Sioux \n     Falls plant since 1995. Studies have shown that every new job \n     at John Morrell creates several additional new jobs in South \n     Dakota.\n       While the plant today is stable and profitable, we are \n     faced with the reality that we need to make improvements to \n     the nearly 100-year-old facility or to build a new plant in \n     Sioux Falls or elsewhere. Prior to Senator Johnson's ill-\n     conceived Amendment, our planning was focused on maintaining \n     the plant location in South Dakota. But we will not invest \n     our resources in states where we cannot have a responsible \n     relationship with elected and appointed officials.\n       Conclusion: We are not certain whose interests Senator \n     Johnson thinks he represents with his Amendment to the Farm \n     Bill. He certainly does not represent the interests of the \n     3,200 workers at our John Morrell plant. He has taken no \n     steps to acquaint himself with the true facts, nor has he \n     commissioned any studies to determine the true impact and \n     cost of his Amendment, and he has totally ignored the \n     considered decision and vote (12 to 9) of the Senate \n     Agriculture Committee not to approve his Amendment.\n       We want Senator Johnson to understand the true impact of \n     his ill-conceived Amendment and it is as follows:\n       If the Johnson Amendment becomes law, Smithfield Foods will \n     neither rebuild the Sioux Falls plant, or build a new plant \n     in South Dakota, nor will we make any further investment in \n     South Dakota, or for that\n\n[[Page S1978]]\n\n     matter in any other state whose public officials are hostile \n     to our ongoing operations and our industry.\n           Very Truly Yours,\n\n                                          Joseph W. Luter III,\n\n                             Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,\n                                            Smithfield Foods, Inc.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. This ad was run on February 3, 2002, in the Sioux Falls, \nSD, newspaper, the Argus Leader, in response to an amendment banning \npacker ownership of livestock that we did on the farm bill recently. It \nwas paid for by Smithfield Foods, Inc., a large hog producing and pork \nprocessing company. The advertisement claims that the company wants \nSenator Johnson to understand the true impact of his ill-conceived \namendment. I also supported his amendment and was a cosponsor, and I \nvoted for it along with 50 of my colleagues. The advertisement, as you \ncan see, from the Argus Leader, states:\n\n       If the Johnson amendment becomes law, Smithfield Foods will \n     neither rebuild the Sioux Falls plant, or build a new plant \n     in South Dakota, nor will we make any further investment in \n     South Dakota, or for that matter in any other state whose \n     public officials are hostile to our ongoing operations and \n     our industry.\n\n  If the packers are dealing fairly, why would they resort to scare \ntactics such as this? Does this mean my State will be blacklisted, too? \nLet me tell you what has happened in Wyoming. When we were doing this \namendment, people who had contracts were being called, saying, you are \ngoing to lose 3 cents per pound on your beef if this goes through. They \nare buying all the beef. They are paying the prices, and they are \nsetting them.\n  Packer ownership of livestock is only a small portion of the packer \ncaptive supply problem. My bill would put an end to the rest of the \npackers' manipulative power. What they are referring to there takes \ncare of 5 percent of the problem. It is the best we have been able to \ndo against the packers. What I am proposing will only take care of \nanother 35 percent of the problem. There is a long way to go. \nEventually the consumer should get the best prices and the people \ntaking the most risk ought to get a fair price.\n  It is important to remember why we are doing this. All producers \nshould have a fair chance to compete against each other in an honest \nopportunity to get the highest price for their product. Cattle grown on \nfamily ranches in Wyoming help to feed the entire United States. I \nvalue the small and medium-sized producers' ability to provide quality \nproducts for consumers. Big business may be more efficient, but it \nlacks the loyalty to a locale that our small producers have. We can see \nthis in the advertisement I have just added to the Record.\n  The packers are threatening to leave an area that has been \neconomically dependent upon them for over 90 years. That isn't loyalty \nto a community. That is the behavior of a bully. In Wyoming, we must \nencourage our small producers to remain in business and compete. The \nloyalty to small communities that our small and medium-sized businesses \nhave ensures they will continue to enrich our main streets.\n  Some of my colleagues may be wondering why this bill is needed after \nwe passed the amendment banning packer ownership of livestock. The ban \non packer ownership of livestock would address one small portion of the \ncaptive supply problem--about 5 years--but it would not address the \nlarge number of contracts based on the formula prices that I explained \nusing the housing market example. Formula contracts provide the packers \nwith monopolistic power over the livestock market.\n  I ask my colleagues to rid the livestock industry of pricing schemes \nwhich take advantage of hard-working ranchers and farmers. I mentioned \nthat this amendment only affects 5 percent of the market. It is a very \nimportant 5 percent of the market. It is a very important start. I am \nhoping the people on the conference committee will make sure this \nprovision remains in the bill and makes a start toward fairness in the \nlivestock industry--fairness for the small producer versus the packing \nconcentration.\n  We need to end the secret deals and the unfair contracts. I ask my \ncolleagues to give your constituents the opportunity to compete on a \nlevel playing field.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 2022. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe unrelated business income limitation on investment in certain debt-\nfinanced properties; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business \nInvestment Company Capital Access Act of 2002, whose purpose is to \nincrease the amount of venture capital available to small businesses. I \nam pleased that my good friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, the ranking \nmember on the Senate Finance Committee, has agreed to be the principal \ncosponsor of this important bill.\n  During the past 18 months, there has been a significant contraction \nof the private-equity market. During this same period, the Small \nBusiness Administration's Small Business Investment Company program has \ntaken on a significant role in providing venture capital to small \nbusinesses seeking investments in the range of $500,000 to $3 million.\n  Small Business Investment Companies, SBICs are government-licensed, \ngovernment-regulated, privately managed venture capital firms created \nto invest only in original issue debt or equity securities of U.S. \nsmall businesses that meet size standards set by law. In the current \neconomic environment, the SBIC program represents an increasingly \nimportant source of capital for small enterprises.\n  While Debenture SBICs qualify for SBA-guaranteed borrowed capital, \nthe government guarantee forces a number of potential investors, namely \npension funds and university endowment funds, to avoid investing in \nSBICs because they would be subject to tax liability for unrelated \nbusiness taxable income, UBTI. More often than not, tax-exempt \ninvestors generally opt to invest in venture capital funds that do not \ncreate UBTI. As a result, 60 percent of the private-capital potentially \navailable to these SBICs is effectively ``off limits.''\n  The Small Business Investment Company Capital Access Act of 2002 \nwould correct this problem by excluding government-guaranteed capital \nborrowed by Debenture SBICs from debt for purposes of the UBTI rules. \nThis change would permit tax-exempt organizations to invest in SBICs \nwithout the burdens of UBTI record keeping or tax liability.\n  In 1958, Congress created the SBIC program to assist small business \nowners in obtaining investment capital. Forty years later, small \nbusinesses continue to experience difficulty in obtaining investment \ncapital from banks and traditional investment sources. Although \ninvestment capital is readily available to large businesses from \ntraditional Wall Street investment firms, small businesses seeking \ninvestments in the range of $500,000-$3 million have to look elsewhere. \nSBICs are frequently the only sources of investment capital for growing \nsmall businesses.\n  Often we are reminded that the SBIC program has helped some of our \nNations best known companies. It has provided a financial boost at \ncritical points in the early growth period for many companies that are \nfamiliar to all of us. For example, when Federal Express needed help \nfrom reluctant credit markets, it received a needed infusion of capital \nfrom two SBA-licensed SBICs at a critical juncture in its development \nstage. The SBIC program also helped other well-known companies, when \nthey were not so well-known, such as Intel, Outback Steakhouse, America \nOnline, and Callaway Golf.\n  What is not well known is the extraordinary help the SBIC program \nprovides to Main Street America small businesses. These are companies \nwe know from home towns all over the United States. Main Street \ncompanies provide both stability and growth in our local business \ncommunities. A good example of a Main Street company is Steelweld \nEquipment Company, founded in 1932, which designs and manufacturers \nutility truck bodies in St. Clair, Missouri. The truck bodies are \nmounted on chassis made by Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. \nSteelweld provides truck bodies for Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., \nTexas Utilities, Paragon Cable, GTE, and GE Capital Fleet.\n  Steelweld is a privately held, woman-owned corporation. The owner, \nElaine Hunter, went to work for Steelweld in 1966 as a billing clerk \nright out of high school. She rose through the ranks of\n\n[[Page S1979]]\n\nthe company and was selected to serve on the board of directors. In \nDecember 1995, following the death of Steelweld's founder and owner, \nMs. Hunter received financing from a Missouri-based SBIC, Capital for \nBusiness, CFB, Venture Fund II, to help her complete the acquisition of \nSteelweld. CFB provided $500,000 in subordinated debt. Senior bank debt \nand seller debt were also used in the acquisition.\n  Since Ms. Hunter acquired Steelweld, its manufacturing process was \nredesigned to make the company run more efficiently. By 1997, \nSteelweld's profitability had doubled, with annual sales of $10 million \nand 115 employees. SBIC program success stories like Ms. Hunter's \nexperience at Steelweld occur regularly throughout the United States.\n  In 1991, the SBIC program was experiencing major losses, and the \nfuture of the program was in doubt. Consequently, in 1992 and 1996, the \nCommittee on Small Business worked closely with the Small Business \nAdministration to correct deficiencies in the law in order to ensure \nthe future of the program.\n  Today, the SBIC Program is expanding rapidly in an effort to meet the \ngrowing demands of small business owners for debt and equity investment \ncapital. And it is important to focus on the significant role that is \nplayed by the SBIC program in support of growing small businesses. When \nFortune Small Business compiled its list of 100 fastest growing small \ncompanies in 2000, 6 of the top 12 businesses on the list received SBIC \nfinancing during their critical growth year.\n  The Small Business Investment Company Capital Access Act of 2002 is \nimportant for one simple reason: once enacted it paves the way for more \ninvestment capital to be available for more small businesses that are \nseeking to grow and hire new employees. According to the National \nAssociation of Small Business Investment Companies, NASBIC, a \nconservative estimate of the effect of this amendment would be to \nincrease investments in Debenture SBICs by $200 million from tax-exempt \ninvestors in the first year and $400 million in the second year. \nGovernment-guaranteed SBIC leverage commitments equal to $400 million \nin year one and $800 million in year two would be added to the private \ncapital. Thus, total year one capital available for investment would \nequal $600 million and total year two capital would equal $1.2 billion.\n  Data developed by Venture Economics for the period 1970-1999 \nindicates that one job is created for every $22,600 investment in a \nsmall company. At that rate, this bill could be responsible for the \ncreation or support of as many as 62,000 jobs within the next two \nyears, whether within companies receiving investments directly or \nwithin those firms benefiting indirectly through increased sales of \ngoods and services to the former companies.\n  And the cost? Industry experts estimate that if the change were \neffective now, there would be less than a $1 million in lost tax \nrevenues. About $1.5 billion in private capital is invested in \nDebenture SBICs. A NASBIC poll of Debenture SBICs indicates $30.3 \nmillion of that amount is from tax-exempt investors. For the previous \n10 years, Debenture SBIC returns have averaged 7.78 percent. Applied to \nthe $30.3 million, that would result in lost taxable income of $2.36 \nmillion per year. If all of that were taxed at the top 39 percent rate, \nthe tax revenue loss would be $922,000 per year.\n  The cost is low and the potential for economic gain is great. Passage \nof the bill will make the Government's existing SBIC program more \neffective in providing growth capital for America's small business \nentrepreneurs.\n  And most importantly, it will provide sorely needed capital for the \nsector of our economy that provides about 75 percent of the net new \njobs, small businesses. That is a real stimulus that would cause new \ninvestments to be made and the creation of critically needed new jobs. \nOur economy is primed for this kind of support, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2022\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor an increase in expensing under Section 179; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nbenefit our Nation's small businesses--the backbone of our economy. I \nam very pleased to be joined by several of my colleagues, including \nSenator Bond, Senator Tim Hutchinson, and Senator Gordon Smith. All of \nthese Senators have been steadfast proponents and supporters of small \nbusinesses throughout their Senate career. Today, we are introducing \nlegislation to allow small businesses to expense more of their \ninvestments in equipment and property. In short, we are introducing \nlegislation to help small businesses grow.\n  The importance of small businesses to our economy cannot be \noverstated. According to the Small Business Administration, small firms \naccount for three-quarters of our Nation's employment growth and almost \nall of the net new jobs. That is certainly true in my home State of \nMaine. These are good jobs, jobs that make our communities strong.\n  Mr. President, last Friday the Senate overwhelmingly passed a \ncritical piece of legislation designed to boost our economy. The \nlegislation extends benefits for an additional 13 weeks to an estimated \n3 million unemployed workers who have exhausted, or will soon exhaust, \ntheir regular unemployment benefits before being able to find new work. \nThis program will help put food on the table for an estimated 23,000 \nunemployed workers in Maine by providing money for extended benefits.\n  The economic recovery legislation also includes ``bonus \ndepreciation'' provisions that will encourage mostly larger firms to \ninvest in new property and equipment. Again, that is another provision \nI support. It includes a number of other important proposals, including \none that is near and dear to me providing tax relief to teachers who \nreach deep into their own pockets to buy supplies and materials for \ntheir students. Yet my biggest regret about the economic recovery \npackage we passed last week is that it does very little for smaller \nbusinesses. I think that is disappointing and I think that is wrong \nbecause it is small businesses that tend to lead our economy out of \nrecession.\n  Often, I think we take smaller businesses for granted. When times are \ngood, we expect small businesses to create vast numbers of good, new \njobs for American workers, and when times are tough, we count on small \nbusinesses to resuscitate our sluggish economy. Time and time again, \nentrepreneurs lead the Nation down avenues of new economic opportunity, \nand our expectations rise with each remarkable success story. But if we \nexpect so much from small businesses, if we count on them to this \ndegree, we owe it to them to create a climate that nurtures and rewards \nentrepreneurship.\n  That is why we have come together to introduce this straightforward \nlegislation. Under section 179 of the Tax Code, a taxpayer with a \nrelatively small amount of annual investment may elect to deduct up to \n$24,000 of the cost of qualifying property and equipment placed in \nservice in any given\n\n[[Page S1980]]\n\nyear. The deduction is phased out for taxpayers who invest over \n$200,000 per year.\n  Our bill would permit small businesses to expense their new equipment \npurchases up to $40,000 per year. In other words, we would be \nincreasing the section 179 expensing limit from $24,000 to $40,000. \nThat is a fairly significant increase, but it should be; the last time \nCongress increased the small business expensing limit was back in 1996. \nAn adjustment is well overdue.\n\n  Section 179 is critically important to small businesses. Direct \nexpensing allows a small employer to avoid the complexities of the \ndepreciation rules as well as unrealistic recovery periods for many \nassets. For example, under current law, a computer must be depreciated \nover 5 years. Now, all of us know that the useful life of most \ncomputers is only 2 or 3 years, at best.\n  Expensing also addresses a top concern of small businesses that has \nbeen exacerbated by the recent recession. The concern is access to \ncapital.\n  I served for a time as the New England Administrator of the Small \nBusiness Administration, and I know there are so many small companies \nwhere the owner of the company has a wonderful concept, a workable \nbusiness plan, yet lacks access to capital to get the business underway \nor to grow it to the next level. The concern is access to capital, \nwhich the Small Business Administration has called the ``greatest \neconomic policy challenge'' for rapidly growing businesses.\n  One indication of the need for additional financing is the amount of \nventure capital invested into the United States. In the year 2000, a \nrecord $103 billion was invested. But in 2001, that total fell by 65 \npercent, to $36.5 billion. When we see this decrease in access to \nventure capital, inevitably, it seems, women-owned companies and \nminority-owned firms are disproportionately affected and are shut out \nof the capital market.\n  By raising the section 179 limit, our bill, in effect, will reduce \nthe cost of capital for small businesses nationwide and it will free up \nadditional capital for small businesses to purchase more plant and \nequipment.\n  I have spoken to small business owners in my home State of Maine, and \nthey have told me time and again that an increase in the small business \nexpensing limit would make a real difference to them. It would allow \nthem to expand their businesses, thus create more good, new jobs.\n  Terry Skillins of Skillins Greenhouses is a fourth-generation Maine \nfamily business founded in 1885. It is a good example of what I am \ntalking about. Skillins Greenhouses employs between 70 and 120 \nemployees, depending on the season, in its landscaping, greenhouse, and \nfloral businesses. Terry told me the company is looking to expand but \nthat to do so takes money. From tractors, to conveyor belts, to \nspecialized machinery, the equipment needed to expand is expensive. \nTerry said raising the small business expensing limit to $40,000 would \nhelp tip the scales in favor of his proceeding with an expansion, \nparticularly if the increase were made permanent. Terry said his \nbusiness plan extends over a number of years and, hence, knowing the \nexpensing limit would be increased permanently, he could and would use \na significant multiyear savings to expand his business.\n  We offered a small business expensing amendment to the economic \nrecovery bill back in January. The amendment was offered by my \ncolleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, and myself. It included exactly \nthe same increases as I am proposing in the bill we are introducing \ntoday. I point out that our amendment passed the Senate by an \noverwhelming vote of 90 to 2. So, clearly, there is an understanding \namong our colleagues that this tax change is long overdue and that it \nwould make a real difference to the small businesses in our country.\n  Today, I am inviting all of our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring \nthis bill, which is strongly supported and has been endorsed by the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, our Nation's largest small \nbusiness organization. In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that a \nletter from Dan Danner, senior vice president of the NFIB, be printed \nin Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2002.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the 600,000 members of \n     the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I \n     commend you for introducing The Section 179 Small Business \n     Expensing Bill. The Collins-Bond-Hutchinson-Smith bill will \n     increase the amount of equipment purchases, allow small \n     businesses to expense each year from the current $24,000 to \n     $40,000 and most importantly, make this language permanent.\n       Many small businesses are currently struggling to cope with \n     the recession and the events of September 11th. Increasing \n     the expensing limit would provide small and growing firms \n     with the funds to make critical investments and keep their \n     firms running and growing, creating new jobs.\n       This legislation will also help small business by \n     eliminating burdensome record keeping involved in \n     depreciating equipment. And it adjusts the investment limit \n     on expensing from 200,000 to $325,000.\n       Small business is the major job generator for the economy. \n     Let's give them the tools to grow, hire more employees, and \n     lead this country out of recession.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Dan Danner,\n                             Senior Vice President, Public Policy.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this is a change that makes sense. I hope \nwe will adopt it this year. It is long overdue to change our tax policy \nto reflect the modern-day realities of running a small business.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the bill offered by Senator Collins today is \nintended to simplify the tax rules for small businesses as they \npurchase new equipment to sustain and expand their businesses. I am \npleased to be the lead co-sponsor on this important small business \nlegislation.\n  The bill parallels the amendment that Senator Collins and I offered \nto the economic-stimulus legislation considered on the floor in January \nand makes the increase in the expensing limits permanent. The Bond-\nCollins amendment was approved by the Senate by a vote of 90-2.\n  While some may think that small business is not that important, let's \nbe clear about the role they play in our economy. Small business: \nrepresents 99 percent of all employers; employs 51 percent of the \nprivate-sector workforce; provides about 75 percent of the net new \njobs; contributes 51 percent of the private-sector output; and \nrepresents 96 percent of all exporters of goods.\n  In short, size is the only ``small'' aspect of small business.\n  Our bill would permit small businesses to expense their new equipment \npurchases up to $40,000. The current annual limit is $24,000.\n  The bill also increases the limitation on the total amount of \nproperty that a small business can place in service during a year \nbefore triggering a phase-out of the annual expensing amount. Under the \namendment, a business would be able to claim the full $40,000 in \nexpensing if it purchased no more than $325,000 of property during the \nyear. Under current law, the phase-out limitation is only $200,000. To \nthe extent that a business exceeds the phase-out limit, the annual \nexpensing amount declines.\n  Direct expensing allows small businesses to avoid the complexities of \nthe depreciation rules as well as the unrealistic recovery periods for \nmost assets. For example, under current law a computer must be \ndepreciated over 5 years even though the useful life is most likely 2-3 \nyears at best.\n  These provisions have several important advantages, especially in \nlight of the current economic conditions.\n  By allowing more equipment purchases to be deducted currently, we can \nprovide much needed capital for small businesses.\n  With that freed-up capital, a business can invest in equipment, which \nwill benefit the small enterprise and, in turn, stimulate other \nindustries.\n  In addition, that's more money available to keep employees working \nand hopefully hire new employees.\n  Moreover, new equipment will contribute to continued productivity \ngrowth in the business community, which Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan has repeatedly stressed is essential to the long-term \nvitality of our economy.\n  Finally, these modifications will simplify the tax law for countless \nsmall businesses. Greater expensing means less equipment subject to the \nonerous depreciation rules.\n\n[[Page S1981]]\n\n  In short, the equipment-expensing change I propose are a win-win for \nsmall businesses consumers, equipment manufacturers, and our national \neconomy as a whole.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to respond to the \nurgent needs of small businesses in my home State of Oregon. Oregon \nsmall businesses are in need of help as the state's economy deals with \npoor growth and high unemployment.\n  In an effort to boost both small business and the Oregon economy I am \nproud to introduce legislation with Senator Collins that will provide \ntax relief for small firms, the section 179 small business expensing \nbill.\n  Economic recovery must include job creation. In Oregon most new jobs \nare created by the State's 270,000 small businesses. Small businesses \nhave a broad impact on Oregon's economy and are essential to its well-\nbeing.\n  Oregon ranks third in the Nation in small businesses per capita. \nOregonians are independent and creative and much of this creativity \ngoes into the wide diversity of small businesses that exist in my \nState. Therefore it is imperative that we bolster and strengthen the \nsmall business community in Oregon.\n  One critical way in which we can help small firms is by raising the \nthreshold for expensing equipment purchases.\n  Currently, companies may expense equipment purchases up to $24,000 of \nthe cost of equipment and depreciate the remainder.\n  This legislation will increase the amount small businesses can \nexpense per purchase to $40,000 and increase the total investment from \nthe current $200,000 to $325,000 annually.\n  This limit of $325,000 on total purchases of equipment in a single \nyear applies to the smallest of companies.\n  Only the smallest of firms that are struggling to stay afloat and \nseek to grow by buying equipment would be able to take advantage of \nthis expensing.\n  This would provide a greatly needed boost to small businesses in \nOregon, allowing them to move forward on job hiring and capital \ninvestment plans that they have had to put aside during the downturn of \nrecent days.\n  This legislation is strongly supported by the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses and I would like to enter into the Record a \nletter from Dan Danner expressing the importance of this increase to \nsmall businesses.\n  I believe these changes will ease the record-keeping burden of \ndepreciating such equipment and fill free up capital that can be used \nto create and sustain new jobs, expand current small businesses, and \nencourage the creation of new businesses as well.\n  All of these economic actions will boost the Oregon economy at a time \nit is still sorely needed. Businesses will use the extra money to \npurchase new equipment, which will help an economic expansion.\n  Creating new jobs for Oregonians who were laid off last year lessens \nthe burden on the State economy and puts unemployed Oregonians back to \nwork.\n  In conclusion, I would like you to know that this critical \nlegislation that would boost small businesses in Oregon was initially \npart of the economic stimulus legislation that the Senate passed \noverwhelmingly in January. I call on all of my colleagues to support \nthis legislation and swiftly give small businesses across the Nation \nand in my State this important boost.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I referred \npreviously be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 2002.\n     Hon.

Roosevelt of the Emergency \n     Conservation Work Act, a precursor to the Civilian \n     Conservation Corps Act that established the CCC;\n       Whereas, between 1933 and 1942, the CCC provided employment \n     and vocational training for more than 3,000,000 men, \n     including unemployed youths, more than 250,000 veterans of \n     the Spanish American War and World War I, and more than \n     80,000 Native Americans in conservation and natural resources \n     development work, defense work on military reservations, and \n     forest protection;\n       Whereas the CCC coordinated a mobilization of men, \n     material, and transportation on a scale never previously \n     known in time of peace;\n       Whereas the CCC managed more than 4,500 camps in every \n     State and the then-territories of Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto \n     Rico, and the Virgin Islands;\n       Whereas the CCC left a legacy of natural resources and \n     infrastructure improvements that included planting more than \n     3,000,000,000 trees, building 46,854 bridges, restoring 3,980 \n     historical structures, developing more than 800 state parks, \n     improving 3,462 beaches, creating 405,037 signs, markers, and \n     monuments, and building 63,256 structures and 8,045 wells and \n     pump houses;\n       Whereas the benefits of many CCC projects are still enjoyed \n     by Americans today in national and state parks, forests, and \n     other lands, including the National Arboretum in Washington, \n     DC, Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico, Great Smoky \n     Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee, \n     Yosemite National Park in California, Acadia National Park in \n     Maine, Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, and \n     Vicksburg National Military Park in Mississippi;\n       Whereas the CCC provided a foundation of self-confidence, \n     responsibility, discipline, cooperation, communication, and \n     leadership for its participants through education, training, \n     and hard work, and participants made many lasting friendships \n     in the CCC;\n       Whereas the CCC demonstrated the commitment of the United \n     States to the conservation of land, water, and natural \n     resources on a national level and to leadership in the world \n     on public conservation efforts; and\n       Whereas the conservation of the Nation's land, water, and \n     natural resources is still an important goal of the American \n     people: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 31, 2002, as ``National Civilian \n     Conservation Corps Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe the day \n     with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``Designating March 31, \n     2002, as `National Civilian Conservation Corps Day'.''\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the substitute \namendment be agreed to, the resolution be agreed to, as amended, the \namendment to the preamble be agreed to, the preamble, as amended, be \nagreed to, the amendment to the title be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 207), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The amendment to the preamble was agreed to.\n  The preamble, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The amendment to the title was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/15/senate-section/article/S1982-4", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1982-S1983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMEMORATING AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE DEDICATION AND SACRIFICE MADE BY \n                        LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to Calendar No. 327, S. Res. 221.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 221) to commemorate and acknowledge \n     the dedication and sacrifice made by the men and women who \n     have lost their lives while serving as law enforcement \n     officers.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthis resolution to honor our Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nofficers who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our public safety. I \ncommend Senator Campbell for his leadership in submitting Senate \nResolution 221, which recognizes May 15, 2002, as Peace Officers \nMemorial Day, in honor of Federal, State, and local officers killed or \ndisabled in the line of duty.\n  I want to recognize the other cosponsors of this resolution: Senators \nHatch, Biden, DeWine, Cantwell, Allard, Allen, Bingaman, Bunning, \nCochran, Gregg, Hutchinson, Rockefeller, and Thomas.\n  Since my time as a State prosecutor, I have always taken a keen \ninterest in law enforcement in Vermont and around the country. Vermont \nhas the reputation of being one of the safest States in which to live, \nwork and visit,\n\n[[Page S1983]]\n\nand rightly so. In no small part, this is due to the hard work of those \nwho have sworn to serve and protect us, and we should do what we can to \nhonor them and their families.\n  Our Nation's law enforcement officers numbering more than 700,000 men \nand women--put their lives at risk in the line of duty everyday. No one \nknows when danger will appear and what form it will take. \nUnfortunately, in today's violent world, even pulling over a driver for \nspeeding may not necessarily be ``routine.'' The events of the past \nyear and the ensuing relentless vigilance on the part of our peace \nofficers in guarding against further such attacks have proven this.\n  Guardians of the peace face more risks than ever in these times. All \nlaw enforcement officers across the Nation deserve our heartfelt \nrespect and appreciation on Peace Officers Memorial Day.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to, en bloc; that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the resolution \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 221\n\n       Whereas the well-being of all citizens of the United States \n     is preserved and enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance \n     and dedication of law enforcement personnel;\n       Whereas more than 700,000 men and women, at great risk to \n     their personal safety, presently serve their fellow citizens \n     as guardians of peace;\n       Whereas peace officers are on the front line in preserving \n     the right of the children of the United States to receive an \n     education in a crime-free environment, a right that is all \n     too often threatened by the insidious fear caused by violence \n     in schools;\n       Whereas 70 peace officers died at the World Trade Center in \n     New York City on September 11, 2001, the most peace officers \n     ever killed in a single incident in the history of the \n     Nation;\n       Whereas more than 220 peace officers across the Nation were \n     killed in the line of duty during 2001, 57 percent more \n     police fatalities than the previous year, and the deadliest \n     year for the law enforcement community since 1974;\n       Whereas every year, 1 out of every 9 peace officers is \n     assaulted, 1 out of every 25 peace officers is injured, and 1 \n     out of every 4,400 peace officers is killed in the line of \n     duty; and\n       Whereas on May 15, 2002, more than 15,000 peace officers \n     are expected to gather in Washington, D.C. to join with the \n     families of their recently fallen comrades to honor those \n     comrades and all others who went before them: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes May 15, 2002, as Peace Officers Memorial \n     Day, in honor of Federal, State, and local officers killed or \n     disabled in the line of duty; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     this day with appropriate ceremonies and respect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/15/senate-section/article/S1983-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDER FOR RECORD TO REMAIN OPEN\n\n  Mr. REID.
