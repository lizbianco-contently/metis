Mr. President, during this time of trouble, since September \n11, there has been a lot of attention focused on Islam. I can say that \nI have had some exposure to this religion. It is a religion that builds \ngreat character. It is a religion that has a very fine health code. It \nis basically a very good religion. My wife, who has had some illness in \nher time, has two physicians who are Muslims. They are wonderful men. \nThey are close friends. One is an internist and one is a surgeon. Her \nfamily physician--the person who takes care of her more often than \nnot--is Dr. Anwar. Her surgeon is Dr. Khan. I have been in their homes \non several occasions, going back almost 20 years --well, more than \nthat, 25 years. We are social friends. I have had the pleasure of going \nto their beautiful new mosque in Las Vegas, where these two men and \ntheir families worship.\n  We in America, this past 4 weeks, have come to better understand this \nreligion. But we have a lot more that we need to understand. I received \na letter--and I am sure other Senators received the same letter--which \nI would like to read into the Record. It is a letter addressed to me, \ndated September 14, 2001. It says:\n\n       Honorable Senator: We are writing this letter in light of \n     the horrific tragedy that\n\n[[Page S10672]]\n\n     struck America on September 11, 2001. We would like to extend \n     our heartfelt sympathies and condolences to families of all \n     civilians and rescue workers who lost their loved ones in the \n     tragedy. May Allah bless them and give them courage during \n     this time of grief and extreme sadness. We also pray for the \n     steady and early recovery of individuals who suffered \n     injuries as a result of the incident.\n       We would like you to know that although perpetrators of \n     such heinous crimes more often than not justify these acts in \n     the name of religion, we do not support their ideas. Islam \n     for instance, condemns senseless acts of violence against \n     fellow human beings. As the Qur'an so aptly states in Chapter \n     5, vs. 32, ``For that cause we decreed for the children of \n     Israel that whosoever killeth a human being for other than \n     manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he \n     had killed all mankind, and whoso saveth the life of one, it \n     shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind.'' All in \n     all, Islam values human life and applauds its preservation \n     rather than its destruction. It is a religion that preaches \n     peace, love, justice and tolerance for people from all walks \n     of life.\n       Moreover, we would like to clarify a misconception that \n     many people harbor in their minds about Islam. Islam is not a \n     religion that was founded by Prophet Muhammad rather, it is a \n     continuation of the earlier Revelations that were made to \n     Prophets Abraham (Ibrahim), David (Dawood), Moses (Musa) and \n     Jesus (Issa) in the Torah and the Bible, Prophet Mohammed was \n     the last Prophet though whom the Final Revelation was made--\n     that Final Revelation is the Qur'an. On that note, please \n     accept the enclosed copy of the Holy Qur'an as a token of our \n     support.\n  I do have that and I have read part of that since having received it.\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       Finally, we would like to applaud the tireless rescue \n     efforts that have been underway for the past few days and \n     also pray for all those who are involved in this mission and \n     wish them every success.\n\n  Signed by Aunali Khalfan, who is with the Tahrike Tarsile Qur'an, \nInc., based in Elmhurst, NY.\n  I believed it was appropriate to spread across the Record of this \nSenate this very thoughtful letter that I received hoping it will lead \nto a better understanding of this very fine religion which 6 million \nAmericans follow, the teachings of Islam.\n  I ask unanimous consent--I see my friend from Alaska here--that I be \nallowed 10 more minutes to complete a statement on another subject.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, the Senator from Nevada is recognized for 10 \nadditional minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/15/senate-section/article/S10672-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10672-S10673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last week the Senate continued demonstrating \nits resolve to move forward in a bipartisan manner, following on the \nfootsteps of the resolution allowing force, the $40 billion for New \nYork-related matters, moneys that were made available, and the airline \nbailout, costing billions of additional dollars, plus legislation which \nallowed relief for those people who were injured physically and killed \nin that incident. Last week we moved even further; we passed a very \nstrong aviation security bill and extremely tough antiterrorism \nlegislation. I believe this sends a strong message to those who are \nwatching our Nation's response to the attacks of September 11.\n  Everywhere I go--and I am sure it is the same with the President pro \ntempore and my friend from Alaska who is in the Chamber--people are \namazed and appreciative of the bipartisanship that has been shown these \npast 5 weeks. People all over America--Nevada is no exception--hope we \ncan maintain this bipartisanship and pass legislation that is good for \nthis country.\n  If there is legislation that passes that is good, everyone can take \ncredit for that, but if we do not pass legislation that is necessary \nfor the well-being of this country, everyone rightfully has to take \nblame for that.\n  We as Democrats are working closely with the President to provide our \nmilitary with the support it needs to fight this war against terrorism. \nWe are working with our Republican colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. We are proceeding with the proper amount of caution and purpose, \nbut we are meeting our obligation to complete our work in an orderly \nmanner. I hope that can continue this week.\n  The reason I say that is we are voting at 5:30 p.m. today on \nsomething I think is totally unnecessary. We are trying to move forward \nand complete our appropriations bills. We have an extremely important \npiece of legislation. It is the foreign operations appropriations bill \nthat funds our involvement in the world. It is one of the 13 \nappropriations bills. We were unable to move to that last week. We had \nto file a cloture motion on a motion to proceed to the legislation.\n  That is just wrong, and to the people who are causing us to go \nthrough these procedural hoops to get to this legislation, I have to \nsay respectfully, it is not good for this country. Why are they not \nallowing us to go forward on this most important legislation? Because \nthey say we are not approving enough judges.\n  Senator Leahy, who is an outstanding Member of this Senate--there is \nnot a better patriot anyplace in America than Pat Leahy--working with \nthe ranking member, Orrin Hatch, has been working very hard. \nAntiterrorism legislation has taken up every spare minute they have \nhad, but in spite of that, they also have been able to report out some \njudges.\n  Maybe it is not enough. I am willing to accept maybe it is not \nenough, but work with us and let's get some more done.\n  What we could have said was we were not going to have any more judges \nuntil you allowed us to go forward on these appropriations bills. We \nhave not done that. Whenever judges are ready to move through the \nSenate, we approve them. We approved two last week. More are going to \nbe ready this week. We are going to approve those judges in spite of \nwhat I believe is a wrongheaded legislative tactic on behalf of some \npeople in the minority.\n  We have to complete action on these annual appropriations bills. \nThere is no more reassuring message we can send to the American people \nthan to pass these bills.\n  Now, more than ever, people are turning to government, especially the \nFederal Government, for assurances that we are ready to respond to \nanything. Certainly we should be able to do the basic things this \nGovernment has to do every year; that is, pass these appropriations \nbills. Keeping our Government open and running can only be accomplished \nwith the passage of these appropriations bills. To not act on these \nbills now is irresponsible. We are trying to be responsible.\n  The Presiding Officer is the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee. It is a distinct honor to be chairman of that Appropriations \nCommittee, no question, but there is no one in the United States who \nhas more knowledge of the legislative process than the President pro \ntempore. I cannot imagine how he must feel in that we are not able to \nmove forward on these appropriations bills--held up over somebody \nthinking we are not approving enough judges.\n  The American people have a lot of problems on their minds right now, \nbut I bet there are very few who are concerned about us not having more \njudges. I have yet to have anybody from Nevada say: Could you get us \nsome more judges? And Nevada is the most rapidly growing State in the \nNation. We have two judges who are in the pipeline. They are going to \nbe approved, Mr. President. I am not worried about it.\n  My two friends are going to be judges: Mr. Hicks and Judge Mayhan. \nThey are going to be approved. These people are not doing those two men \nany favors by holding up these appropriations bills.\n  Secretary Powell, Secretary Rumsfeld, Secretary Thompson, and \nAttorney General Ashcroft are not worrying about whether there are \nenough judges. Some believe this is our way to get us some more judges.\n\n  Senator Daschle, the majority leader, and I have said on many \noccasions, this is not payback time as to the fact we did not get many \njudges. We are approving the judges as quickly as we can. I am sure \nthere was more that could have been done in the Judiciary Committee. \nMaybe Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch should have set aside some of the \nantiterrorism work they were doing and moved on some of these judges. \nAs one of my children would say: Give us a break; we are doing our \nbest. This is not good government. I hope we can move forward on at \nleast a motion to proceed today so we can get this legislation out of \nthe way.\n  I see my friend--as I have said a couple times today--from Alaska. I \nam\n\n[[Page S10673]]\n\nsure, if I know him, he is going to be talking about energy policy. \nThere is not a chance we can do any energy legislation until we finish \nour appropriations bills. Senator Daschle has said he will at the \nearliest possible time move to energy, but we cannot do that until we \nfinish our appropriations work. We have conferences we have to \ncomplete. We have bills we have to pass.\n  We have some complicated bills. We have the Defense appropriations \nbill, Labor-HHS. When they come to the floor, we cannot finish those in \nan hour. These are very difficult bills involving billions and billions \nof dollars. All we are saying to those who are holding this legislation \nup because of judges: Let us do our work.\n  We have matched circuit judges who were approved during the first \nClinton administration. We can prove anything with statistics. They can \nprove anything with statistics; we can prove anything with statistics.\n  All I am saying is, as a matter of common sense, let us move forward \non appropriations bills. There is a time and a place for everything. I \ndo not think this is the time to hold up legislation because we are not \nmoving enough judges. We are moving judges. As I said before, we are \nmoving all the judges we can clear. We could have held those back, but \nwe are not doing that. We are moving forward. This is not the time to \nhorse trade on judges. This is the time to keep our Government open and \nrunning, not on a week-to-week basis, but get it done for the next \nyear.\n  The public deserves to see stability and responsiveness from its \nelected leaders. Passing appropriations bills in an orderly manner \nsends just that message.\n  I hope we can move forward with other appropriations bills. We could \nfinish foreign operations maybe tonight or tomorrow. Certainly we \nshould move forward. We have to do an agricultural appropriations bill. \nWe have many people coming from the heartland of this country who are \nextremely desperate to get a new agricultural bill. We cannot do that \nuntil we finish the appropriations bills.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my friend from North Dakota for \na question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada talks about the \nimportance of moving the appropriations bills. I observe the deadline \nfor the appropriations bills was October 1. The deadline was October 1, \nand the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the ranking member \nhave done everything humanly possible to try to move these bills, and \nyet we discover we cannot even get past the motion to proceed on an \nappropriations bill, which is just unthinkable to me.\n  Is it not the case we had to break a filibuster on the motion to \nproceed not just on appropriations bills but even on the aviation \nsecurity bill and the bill before that?\n  This is not a time to be having filibusters on motions to proceed. \nWill the Senator from Nevada agree with that?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator from Nevada has \nexpired.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent to have time to answer my friend's \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. How much time?\n  Mr. REID. Two minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the Senator is \nrecognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I also express my appreciation to my friend from Alaska for \nallowing me to proceed.\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota, the distinguished Senator, this \nis not the time to play legislative games. Yes, it is true that to move \nforward on airport security we had to break a filibuster. Hard to \nbelieve, but that is true.\n  I stated, before the Senator arrived, that I believe the majority has \nset an example of bipartisanship. Senator Daschle has gone out of his \nway to work with the President of the United States. They have \ndeveloped a very fine relationship. They talk several times a day on \nthis country's business. I think the very least we could do is move \nforward on the appropriations bills.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one additional \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, let me say \nthere is no more bipartisan committee in the Congress than the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. These are Republicans and Democrats working \ntogether in a very significant way. It is completely bipartisan in its \nculture, and I am proud to be a part of that.\n  I am proud to be on the Appropriations Committee. It is just \ndisappointing that the appropriations bills Senator Byrd and Senator \nStevens have helped us fashion can now not be brought to the floor \nbecause of people blocking the motion to proceed. That does not serve \nthe Senate's interests, and it does not serve the country's interests. \nMy hope is those who are blocking this will decide that they should \nstep aside and allow us to do the Appropriations Committee's work. It \nis very important we do that. It is important for us, and it is \ncertainly important for the country.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Nevada yielding.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/15/senate-section/article/S10673-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10673-S10674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FIELD TESTS CONFIRM PRESENCE OF ANTHRAX\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use some of my leader time. I \nthink this is an appropriate time to inform my colleagues about the \nevents of the day, and I want to take just a couple of minutes to do so \nat this time.\n  At about 10:15 this morning, a member of my staff opened an envelope. \nIt became clear from the very beginning that the envelope contained a \nsuspicious substance. My office notified the Capitol Police and the \nCapitol physician, who responded almost instantaneously. The tests were \ntaken immediately. They call them field tests. Two field tests were \ntaken on the scene. Both tests confirmed the substance was anthrax. I \nsay ``confirmed'' advisedly because a far more sophisticated test is \nunderway. We will not have that information available for approximately \n24 hours.\n  Based upon the preliminary tests, members of my staff most directly \ninvolved were tested and given an antibiotic. The office was \nquarantined, and all mail from our office was returned. I immediately \ncontacted the other leaders to inform them of the incident.\n  The President happened to be calling at that point, and I informed \nhim as well. I say the antibiotic is so effective it is 100-percent \nsuccessful in killing the bacteria once that bacteria has been \nreleased. So we are supremely confident of our ability to deal with \ncircumstances such as this.\n  I must compliment the Sergeant at Arms, the Capitol Police, and our \nCapitol physician for their extraordinary response, organizationally \nand medically. I am very grateful to all of those who have been \ninvolved so far.\n  The office has been quarantined and will not be open for several days \nas the office cleanup takes place. We have asked that all offices \nreturn all mail, and that is being done this afternoon. We will have \nmeetings in our caucuses tomorrow wherein we will hear from the \nSergeant at Arms, the Capitol Police, the Capitol physician, and others \nwho will brief us about the specific ramifications of incidents such as \nthis.\n  I will say, however--it is very important to me, and I have talked to \nSenator Lott and to many of my colleagues--this Senate and this \ninstitution will not stop. We will not cease our business. We will \ncontinue to work.\n  I am confident we can put in place practices that will minimize the \nexposure to any danger our staff may have to endure. I am especially \nconfident about our ability to respond as we have today.\n  So our work will continue. We will be in session tomorrow. I hope all \noffices will conduct their business as we would expect them to conduct \nit, with the exception of my office, until the inspection and the \ninvestigation and the cleanup can take place.\n  I also want to express my heartfelt sympathy to my staff for what \nthey have had to endure. I have been in contact with many of the \nfamilies of my staff throughout the day, and while this has been an \nextraordinary experience for each of them, I am proud of the way they \nhave handled themselves.\n\n[[Page S10674]]\n\n I am proud of the attitude they bring even now to their work and to \ntheir mission, and I am especially proud of the fact that under these \ncircumstances they have been so responsive, courageous, and upbeat.\n  I simply want to encourage all colleagues to continue to conduct \ntheir work with the knowledge that we are taking every step and we will \ntake additional steps as we become more aware of what can be done in a \npreventive way to deal with these circumstances in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  In regard to the comments by the majority leader, when I left my \noffice we had found a very strange envelope, which appeared with no \npostage, that was apparently left in the office with no identification. \nWe contacted the Capitol Police and were advised there would be someone \non the scene very soon.\n  When I left the office, the police were in the office. They were \nwaiting for the specialist to come over to identify the particular \nenvelope. We were advised at that time we were No. 12 on the list of \nofficial notices that had been given to the Capitol Police relative to \nstrange, unidentified postal packages or letters that have come in.\n  I wish to emphasize we have no indication of what was in this \nparticular article. It was not mailed. It did not have stamps. \nNevertheless, I think it represents the precautions that are necessary \nto be taken.\n  Again, I do not want to alarm anyone, but I commend the Capitol \nPolice for the manner in which they came on the scene with \ninstructions.

Mr. President, I will be speaking each day this week \non the issue of homeland energy security. I have come before the Senate \non many occasions to discuss our needs for national energy in this \ncountry, some form of a national energy policy. I think my colleagues' \nfocus for the most part is on the issue of opening and exploring that \nsmall sliver of the 19 million acres known as ANWR, an area the size of \nthe State of South Carolina. This is a sliver because it represents \nroughly 1.5 million acres open for exploration that only Congress can \nallow, and the realization in the House-passed bill that there was only \nan authorization of 2000 acres, not much bigger than a small farm. This \nis the issue of opening up ANWR in my State of Alaska.\n  Last spring, for example, Senator Breaux and I proposed a \ncomprehensive bipartisan energy policy with some 300 pages. All that \nmost people focused on was the two pages remitted to opening ANWR. I am \na man of few words. It is fair to say some of the radical environmental \ngroups have used ANWR as a cash cow in that they have milked it for all \nit is worth from the standpoint of membership and dollars. It is a \ngreat issue because it is far away--the American people cannot see for \nthemselves and understand and appreciate the dimension, size, and \nmagnitude nor the response we had in producing Prudhoe Bay, which could \nbe transferred to the ANWR area.\n  ANWR will be opened. The radical environmental groups will move on to \nanother issue in the course of future action. Nevertheless, this \ndiscussion is not just about ANWR. I am not in favor of opening ANWR \nsimply because it is the right thing to do for my State or it is the \nright thing to do for the Nation. My concern with our increasing \ndependence on unstable sources of energy is not a smokescreen for \nnarrow political gain. I am in fear of opening ANWR simply as an \nintegral part of our overall energy strategy, a policy balance between \nproduction and conservation.\n  I was pleased to note the President's remarks a few days ago when he \ncommented: There are two other aspects of a good, strong, economic \nstimulus package, one of which is trade promotion authority, and the \nother is an energy bill. Now there was a good energy bill passed out of \nthe House of Representatives, and the reason it passed is because \nMembers of both parties understood an energy bill was not only good for \njobs or stimulus, it is important for our national security to have a \ngood energy policy.\n  I urge the Senate to listen to the will of the Senators and move a \nbill that will help Americans find work and also make it easier for all \nof us around this table to protect the security of the country. The \nless dependent we are on foreign sources of crude oil, the more secure \nwe are at home. We have spent a lot of time talking about homeland \nsecurity. An integral piece of homeland security is energy \nindependence, and I will ask the Senate to respond to the call to get \nan energy bill moving.\n  The facts speak for themselves. In 1973, we were 37 percent dependent \non foreign oil and the Arab oil embargo brought us to our knees. How \nquickly we forget about gas lines around the block. In 1991, we fought \na war with Iraq largely over oil. We spent billions and billions of \ndollars to keep Saddam Hussein in check largely in order to keep a \nstable source of supply coming from the Persian Gulf.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial \nfrom October 11 in the Washington Post by Robert Samuelson.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 11, 2001]\n\n                     Now Do We Get Serious on Oil?\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       If politics is the art of the possible, then things ought \n     to be possible now that weren't before Sept. 11. Or perhaps \n     not. For three decades, Americans have only haphazardly tried \n     to fortify themselves against a catastrophic cutoff of oil \n     from the Middle East, which accounts for about a third of \n     world production and two-thirds of known reserves. Little \n     seems to have changed in the past month, although the \n     terrorism highlighted our vulnerability. Oil is barely part \n     of the discussion.\n       Over the past 30 years, we have suffered Middle East supply \n     disruptions caused by the Yom Kippur War of 1973, the fall of \n     the shah of Iran in 1979 and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in \n     1990. We have fought one war for access to oil--the Persian \n     Gulf War. How many times do we have to be hit before we pay \n     attention? No one can foresee what might lead to a huge \n     supply shutdown or whether the present attack on Afghanistan \n     might trigger disastrous changes. A collapse of the Saudi \n     regime? A change in its policy? Massive sabotage of \n     pipelines? Another Arab-Israeli war? Take your pick.\n       Even if we avoid trouble now, the threat will remain. In \n     2000 the United States imported 53 percent of its oil; almost \n     a quarter of that came from the Persian Gulf. Weaning \n     ourselves from Middle Eastern oil would still leave us \n     vulnerable, because much of the rest of the industrial \n     world--Europe, Japan, Asia--needs it. Without it, the world \n     economy would collapse. Of course, countries that have oil \n     can't benefit from it unless they sell it. The trouble is \n     they can sell it on their terms, which might include a large \n     measure of political or economic blackmail.\n       They, too, run a risk. Oil extortion might provoke a \n     massive military response. It is precisely because the \n     hazards are so acute and unpredictable for both sides that \n     Persian Gulf suppliers have recently tried to separate \n     politics from oil decisions. (Indeed, prices have dropped \n     since the terrorist attacks.) But in the Middle East, logic \n     is no defense against instability. We need to make it harder \n     for them to use the oil weapon and take steps to protect \n     ourselves if it is used.\n       The outlines of a program are clear:\n       Raise CAFE (``corporate average fuel economy'') standards. \n     America's cars and light\n\n[[Page S10675]]\n\n     trucks--pickups, minivans and sport-utility vehicles--consume \n     a tenth of annual global oil production, about 8 million \n     barrels a day out of 77 million. Tempering oil demand \n     requires lowering the thirst of U.S. cars. The current CAFE \n     standards are 27.5 miles per gallon for cars and 20.7 mpg for \n     light trucks. With existing technologies, fuel economy could \n     be raised by 17 percent to 36 percent for cars and by 27 \n     percent to 47 percent for light trucks without harming safety \n     and performance, according to the National Research Council. \n     Changes would have to occur over a decade to give \n     manufacturers time to convert.\n       Impose a gasoline or energy tax. People won't buy fuel-\n     efficient vehicles unless it pays to do so. Cheap gasoline \n     prices also cause people to drive more. An effective tax \n     would be at least 35 cents to 50 cents a gallon. It ought to \n     be introduced over two or three years beginning in 2003. (To \n     impose the tax would worsen the recession.) A 50-cent-a-\n     gallon tax might raise about $60 billion a year. Some of this \n     might be returned in other tax cuts; some might be needed to \n     cover higher defense and ``homeland security'' costs.\n       Relax restrictions against domestic drilling. The other way \n     to dampen import dependence is to raise domestic production. \n     It peaked in 1970 and since then has dropped about 28 \n     percent. The easiest way to cushion the decline is to open up \n     areas where drilling is now prohibited, including the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and areas off both the \n     Atlantic and Pacific coasts. This would aid both oil and \n     natural gas production.\n       Expand the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Tapping the SPR is \n     the only way to offset a huge oil loss until a military or \n     diplomatic solution is reached. Created in 1975, the SPR was \n     envisioned to reach 1 billion barrels. At the end of 2000, it \n     had 541 million barrels, roughly where it was in 1992. The \n     failure to increase the SPR in the Clinton years was \n     astonishingly shortsighted. When oil prices are low--as now--\n     the SPR should be slowly expanded to at least 2 billion \n     barrels. Other industrial countries should also raise their \n     oil stocks.\n       What prevents a program such as this is a failure of \n     political imagination. There ought to be a natural coalition \n     between environmentalists and defense groups. \n     Environmentalists want to reduce air pollution and greenhouse \n     gas emissions. Defense groups want to limit our vulnerability \n     to oil cutoffs or blackmail. A common denominator is the need \n     to control cars' gasoline use. But these groups aren't \n     allies, because their dogmas discourage compromise. \n     Environmentalists don't like more drilling in places such as \n     ANWR, despite modest environmental hazards; and defense types \n     (read: the Bush administration) want to expand production and \n     dislike CAFE, because it compromises the freedom they seek to \n     defend. Both shun unpopular energy taxes.\n       The American way of life doesn't depend on $1 or $1.50 \n     gasoline. It does depend on reliable sources of energy. \n     Unless vast reserves are discovered outside the Middle East--\n     or new technologies eliminate the need for oil--the world's \n     dependence on fuel from the Persian Gulf seems destined to \n     grow. The dangers have been obvious for years, and our \n     failure to react ought to be a source of deep national \n     embarrassment. This is a long-term problem; anything we do \n     now won't have significant effects for years. But if we fail \n     to heed the latest warning, the neglect would be almost \n     criminal.\n\n  Mr. Murkowski. In this article he rightly points out:\n\n       Even if we avoid trouble now, the threat will remain. In \n     2000 the United States imported 53 percent of its oil.\n\n  I pointed out that factually, it was 56 percent and will be closer to \n62 percent in the next few years, according to the Department of \nEnergy, with the biggest increase coming from the Persian Gulf. Mr. \nSamuelson points out the terrible threat to our economic stability \ncreated by this state of affairs.\n  I don't necessarily draw the same conclusions, but I agree we need a \ncomprehensive program to address the situation. There are those who \ntried to shut down the discussion on energy that are so bound to narrow \nparochial interests of one group that they refuse to address the clear \nand evident need for energy now. What we need is a balanced policy \nbased on conservation and increasing our own domestic production. These \nare solutions that are available and as a consequence we must look to \ndevelop these solutions--not a moratorium on discussion of what that \nbalance will mean. I fear we will not address this situation until it \nis too late. That seems to be the case.\n  I fear the United States is in denial about the reality of the \nsituation. What is it going to take to wake up? Is it going to take \nanother crisis, the overthrow of our friends in the gulf? We know that \nSaudi Arabia, one of our staunchest allies in the gulf, has told the \nUnited States that it is unable to cooperate in freezing the assets of \nbin Laden and his associates. What kind of signal does that send us? \nThe money supply is his lifeline. Evidently, bin Laden is still intact. \nThe Saudi regime is providing little help to Federal investigators with \nbackground checks on suspected terrorists. The Saudi Government, as we \nhave learned, has also asked Britain's Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to \nstay away for the time being and not visit the Kingdom as part of its \nefforts to build support for the international coalition against \nterrorism. What kind of a signal is that? I understand why the Saudi \nregime is uncomfortable with being helpful in our efforts to track down \nbin Laden, and I can understand why the Saudis are uncomfortable, \nseemingly overfriendly to the United States at this time. There is a \nsizable constituency in Saudi Arabia that supports bin Laden, and we \nknow that.\n  By overtly choosing sides against him, the regime would endanger its \nown rule. But by siding with the United States, the Saudis risk an \nuprising which could make the ones going on in Pakistan, Israel, and \nIndonesia right now look very tame.\n  The Saudis are rightly worried about their political future, and I \ncan understand that. But I also suggest if the Saudis are worried about \nthe stability of their regime, then we should be worried, too. If the \nSaudis, from whom we get 16 percent of our oil, view our close \nrelationship as destabilizing, we should, too.\n  It is interesting to look at where we get our oil. Let me show you \nthis chart. This is pretty much where the inputs into the United States \ncome from. There are about 6 million barrels a day coming into the \nUnited States. Saudi Arabia is the largest contributor at about 1.7 \nmillion barrels, then Libya, Nigeria, Venezuela, Indonesia, Bahrain, \nIraq, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and so forth.\n  The interesting thing is the significance of the oil that we seem to \nbe getting from Iraq. It is a little over 1 million barrels a day. It \nwas 862,00O. Lest we forget, we are enforcing a no-fly zone over Iraq. \nFrom our friend Saddam Hussein, who since the Persian Gulf war has been \na thorn in our side, we are importing nearly 1 million barrels a day. \nWe are taking his oil, putting it in our aircraft and enforcing a no-\nfly zone in the air, which is very similar to a blockade, in theory.\n  What is he doing with our money? We know he takes the money for the \noil and obviously pays his Republican Guard that contribute to his \nlivelihood, or he develops a missile capability with biological warfare \ncapability and for all practical purposes may aim it at Israel. So here \nwe are taking the oil, fueling his aircraft, we bomb some of his sites. \nAspects of that are associated, realistically, with where we have \nvulnerability. The vulnerability of our country speaks for itself.\n  Before I go to a couple more charts, I wish to identify our reliance \non the Persian Gulf in the sense we rely on the Persian Gulf to get our \nchildren to school in the morning, inasmuch as our fuel comes from \nthere; we get the food from the farms, inasmuch as the oil fuels our \ntractors; and to heat our homes in the winter.\n  There are some in this body who believe the urgency behind the \ndevelopment of energy policy faded on that disastrous day of September \n11. There are those who would put aside the energy issue and move to \nmore pressing affairs. I cannot disagree more. Mark my words, energy is \nfront and center on the war on terrorism. If you go back and find out \nwhere terrorism is being funded, it is being funded indirectly through \nMideast oil.\n  Bin Laden refers to oil as Islamic wealth. He believes the United \nStates owes Muslims $36 trillion because we paid artificially low \nprices for energy.\n  I think we are becoming more and more aware of bin Laden's writings. \nI ask unanimous consent to print an article bylined Donna Abu-Nasr, \nunder the headline, ``Bin Laden's Past Words Revisited.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Associated Press, Sept. 28, 2001]\n\n                    Bin Laden's Past Words Revisited\n\n                          (By Donna Abu-Nasr)\n\n       All American men are the enemy, Osama bin Laden says. And \n     the United States owes Muslims $36 trillion, payback for \n     ``the biggest theft'' in history--the purchase of cheap oil \n     from the Persian Gulf.\n       A book with that and more of bin Laden in his own words has \n     been snapped up by Arabic\n\n[[Page S10676]]\n\n     readers in the weeks since he was named the No. 1 suspect in \n     the Sept. 11 suicide bombings in New York and Washington. The \n     book, ``Bin Laden, Al-Jazeera--and I'' by Jamal Abdul Latif \n     Ismail, includes a 54-page transcript of the complete 1998 \n     interview that was broadcast in abbreviated form on Al-\n     Jazeera, a popular television program. Al-Jazeera has \n     rebroadcast its version of the interview, conducted by \n     Ismail, since the attacks. Those hungry for more often found \n     copies sold out in book stores across the Mideast. Readers \n     have been borrowing and photocopying the book from friends.\n       Bin Laden spoke to Ismail in a tent in mountainous southern \n     Afghanistan four months after the August 1998 bombings of two \n     U.S. embassies in Africa--attacks in which he's also a \n     suspect.\n       Bin Laden began the interview with personal notes, saying \n     he was born 45 years ago, in the Muslim year of 1377, in the \n     Saudi capital of Riyadh. The family later moved between the \n     two holy cities of Mecca and Medina and the port city of \n     Jiddah.\n       Bin Laden's father, Muhammad, who was born in the Yemeni \n     region of Hadramawt, was a prominent construction magnate who \n     built the major mosques in mecca and Medina and undertook \n     repairs on Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock. He died when bin \n     Laden was 10.\n       After getting a degree in economics at a university in \n     Jiddah, bin Laden joined his father's company before \n     beginning his road to jihad.\n       Even before President Bush mentioned the word ``crusade'' \n     in describing the anti-terror campaign, bin Laden was using \n     that term to describe alleged U.S. intentions against \n     Muslims.\n       ``There's a campaign that's part of the ongoing Crusader-\n     Jewish wars against Islam,'' bin Laden told Ismail.\n       Asked about his 1998 fatwa, or edict, urging Muslims to \n     target not only the U.S. military, but also American \n     civilians, bin Laden said only American men were the target. \n     ``Every American man is an enemy whether he is among the \n     fighters who fight us directly or among those who pay \n     taxes,'' bin Laden said.\n       Bin Laden claimed Western attacks on Arabs, such as the \n     British-U.S. bombings of Iraq, were directed by Israelis and \n     Jews who have infiltrated the White House, the Defense \n     Department, the State Department and the CIA.\n       His views on other issues:\n       --On reports he was trying to acquire chemical, biological \n     and nuclear weapons, bin Laden said:\n       ``At a time when Israel stores hundreds of nuclear warheads \n     and bombs and the Western crusaders control a large \n     percentage of these weapons, this should not be considered an \n     accusation but a right. . . . It's like asking a man, `Why \n     are you such a courageous fighter?' Only an unbalanced person \n     would ask such a question.\n       ``It's the duty of Muslims to own (the weapons), and \n     America knows that, today, Muslims have acquired such a \n     weapon.''\n       --On whether he's ready to stand trial in an Islamic court: \n     ``We are ready at any time for a legitimate court . . . If \n     the plaintiff is the United States of America, we at the same \n     time will sue it for many things . . . it committed in the \n     land of Muslims.''\n       --Bin Laden denied he was behind the 1998 embassy bombings, \n     but acknowledged he ``has incited (Muslims) to wage jihad.''\n       --Asked about the freezing of his assets, bin Laden said \n     even though the United States has pressured several countries \n     to ``rob us of our rights,'' he and his followers have \n     survived. ``We feel that the whole universe is with us and \n     money is like a passing shadow. We urge Muslims to spend \n     their money on jihad and especially on the movements that \n     have devoted themselves to the killing of Jews and the \n     crusaders.''\n       --On the U.S.-backed fight against the Soviet presence in \n     Afghanistan: ``Those who waged jihad in Afghanistan . . . \n     knew they could, with a few RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades), \n     a few anti-tank mines and a few Kalashnikovs, destroy the \n     biggest military myth humanity has even known. The biggest \n     military machines was smashed and with it vanished from our \n     minds what's called the superpower.''\n       --Asked about the money the United States put on his head, \n     bin Laden said: ``Because America worships money, it believes \n     that people think that way too. By Allah, I haven't changed a \n     single man (guard) after these reports.''\n       --Bin Laden claimed the United States has carried out the \n     ``biggest theft in history'' by buying oil from Persian Gulf \n     countries at low prices. According to bin Laden, a barrel of \n     oil today should cost $144. Based on that calculation, he \n     said, the Americans have stolen $36 trillion from Muslims and \n     they owe each member of the faith $30,000.\n       ``Do you want (Muslims) to remain silent in the face of \n     such a huge theft?'' bin Laden said.\n       --His message to the world: ``Regimes and the media want to \n     strip us of our manhood. We believe we are men, Muslim men. \n     We should be the ones defending the greatest house in the \n     world, the blessed Kaaba . . . and not the female, both \n     Jewish and Christian, American soldiers.'' Bin Laden was \n     referring to the U.S. troops that have deployed in Saudi \n     Arabia since 1990 following Iraq's invasion on Kuwait.\n       ``The rulers in the region said the Americans would stay a \n     few months, but they lied from the start. . . . Months \n     passed, and the first and second years passed and now we're \n     in the ninth year and the Americans lie to everyone. . . . \n     The enemy robs the owner, you tell him you're stealing and he \n     tells you, `It's in my interest.'\n       ``Our goal is to liberate the land of Islam from the \n     infidels and establish the law of Allah.''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will just refer to two very short paragraphs.\n\n       All American men are the enemy, Osama bin Laden says. And \n     the United States owes Muslims $36 trillion, payback for \n     ``the biggest theft'' in history--the purchase of cheap oil \n     from the Persian Gulf.\n\n  It further goes on to say:\n\n       Bin Laden claimed the United States has carried out the \n     ``biggest theft in history'' by buying oil from Persian Gulf \n     countries at low prices. According to bin Laden, a barrel of \n     oil today should cost $144. Based on that calculation, he \n     said, the Americans have stolen $36 trillion from Muslims and \n     they owe each member of the faith $30,000.\n\n  If there is any motivation in the connection of oil, I remind you of \nthat.\n  Control of Arab oil is the core of bin Laden's philosophy and at the \nheart of Saddam Hussein's politics. There is no question about it; oil \nis the key, not only to bin Laden but Saddam Hussein. Our Achilles' \nheel in this war is our dependence on foreign oil. Bin Laden knows it. \nSaddam Hussein knows it. That the Senate does not yet seem to know it \nis to our immense discredit. I hope I have helped enlighten us a little \nbit today. That we do not recognize it and did not recognize it on \nSeptember 11 is to our immense discredit. If we do not recognize it \nsoon, God help us all.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/15/senate-section/article/S10676-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10676-S10679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PROHIBITING UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATIONS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to say the national \nantiterrorism legislation passed by this body is in grave danger of \nbeing rendered useless. The bill passed by this body corrected an \nimmediate and severe impediment to the undercover investigations that \nmust be employed to shut down terrorism in our Nation. The \nantiterrorism bill passed by this body included legislation introduced \nby Senator Leahy, Senator Hatch, and myself that would untie the hands \nof Federal prosecutors in my home State of Oregon and remove the \nroadblocks that currently all but prohibit undercover investigations \nthere.\n  Unfortunately, the antiterrorism legislation passed by the House \nstrips that provision and rips back open the enormous loophole that \npotentially makes Oregon a safe haven for dangerous criminals and \nterrorists everywhere.\n  For more than a year now, State and Federal prosecuting attorneys in \nOregon have been legally prohibited from advising or participating in \nlaw enforcement undercover investigations. Without advice of counsel, \nlaw enforcement operatives cannot conduct wiretaps, sting operations, \nor infiltrate dangerous criminal operations. Covert investigations in \nmy State have been shut down for more than a year. If the Senate does \nnot insist on antiterrorism language to restart these investigations in \nOregon, the national antiterrorism legislation will not be national at \nall; it will cover 49 States and it will give dangerous criminals, \nincluding terrorists, not just a license but practically an engraved \ninvitation to set up shop in Oregon with little fear of detection or \napprehension through undercover or covert methods. It would endanger, \nnot just the people of my State but all Americans.\n\n  I wish to explain briefly how this situation came about. It started \nhere in Washington in 1998. An amendment to the omnibus appropriations \nbill started the ball rolling in Washington, DC. A McDade-Murtha \namendment required Federal prosecutors to abide by the State ethics \nlaws and rules in the State in which they work. In Oregon, the State \nbar association enacted a disciplinary rule making it unethical for \nattorneys to take part in any practice involving ``deceit or \nmisrepresentation of any kind.''\n  When an Oregon attorney misrepresented his identity to investigate a \nclaim, the State supreme court found him guilty of an ethics violation. \nThe McDade-Murtha amendment backed that up. It became very clear no \nmatter how vital the investigation, no matter how great the need, no \nmatter how dangerous the criminals, attorneys--including Federal, \nState, and\n\n[[Page S10677]]\n\nlocal prosecutors--are simply absolutely not allowed to take a single \nstep, not even to give advice, to help in an undercover investigation. \nIf an undercover investigator cannot get advice from a Federal, State, \nor local prosecutor, that undercover investigator cannot go forward. It \nis that simple: no wiretaps, no sting operations, no infiltrating or \ngathering information on any criminal group no matter how dangerous \ntheir bent or how dastardly their plans.\n  I have been working on a bipartisan basis for more than a year now \nwith Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch. They have been very helpful, but \nthe stakes are getting higher and the solution is more important than \never.\n  Federal officials have informed me that criminals have admitted that \nthey set up shop in Oregon because the McDade situation makes it easier \nfor them to remain undetected and unpunished--even more particularly \nsophisticated criminals. But garden-variety criminals have recognized \nthe opportunities the loophole allows, and certainly more sophisticated \ncriminal elements and terrorists can as well.\n\n  Criminals operating in my State involved in serious crimes such as \nchild pornography, drug sales, and eco-terrorism have been breathing \neasier, safe in the knowledge that law enforcement will have a much \ntougher time catching them without the best weapon in the war against \nthese criminals. Several important investigations have in fact been \nterminated or impeded.\n  For example, the Portland Innocent Images Undercover Program, which \ntargeted child pornography and exploitation, was shut down when the \nU.S. attorney's office informed the FBI field office it would not \nconcur or participate in the use of long-used and highly productive \ntechniques such as undercover operations and conventional monitoring of \nphone calls that could be deemed excessive.\n  If unsophisticated criminals were aware of enough to be attracted to \nOregon because of this situation, I am extremely concerned that more \nsophisticated criminals and terrorists are equally aware that they can \nexploit this loophole.\n  The House-passed version of the antiterrorism bill undoes the \nimportant work that Senator Leahy, Senator Hatch, and I did on the \nbipartisan basis, because the House bill specifically excludes the \nlanguage that would fix the McDade problem.\n  I say today that that must not be acceptable to the Senate. This body \nmust act, and act now, to find the solution. Senators Hatch and Leahy \nand I worked on a bipartisan basis with the FBI and the Department of \nJustice to introduce the language that would allow prosecutors in \nOregon to once again advise, consult, and participate in legal \nundercover investigations with law enforcement agencies. But if it \ndoesn't get done in this conference on antiterrorist legislation, my \nconcern is it will not get done at all.\n  When the differences between the Senate and House antiterrorism bills \nare taken up in conference, Senate conferees must insist that the \nMcDade fix is in the bill that goes to the President's desk. Anything \nless would make this antiterrorism legislation a toothless tiger, \nseemingly strong but incapable of defending or protecting any \nAmericans, including the language that could possibly allow Oregon to \nbe an easy basing State for future terrorist attacks that would be \ndevastating to our Nation.\n  The terrorists made their homes in Florida and New Jersey before \nstriking Americans in New York and Virginia. I don't want to find 6 \nmonths from now that the terrorists made their homes in Oregon because \nthis body failed in its resolve to shut them down in every State in our \ncountry. Leaving one State vulnerable makes each State in this country \nvulnerable.\n  I implore the conferees, and indeed the Congress, to act swiftly and \njudicially to guarantee that our Federal prosecutors and investigators \nhave these essential tools that they have asked us to support on a \nbipartisan basis so they can conduct covert operations that are \nnecessary to prevent and prosecute criminals in terrorist acts.\n  I conclude by asking unanimous consent that several news articles \nthat highlight the concerns Senators Leahy and Hatch and I have on a \nbipartisan basis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, Aug. 4, 2001]\n\n        Oregon Ethics Ruling Chided for Handcuffing Police Work\n\n                          (By V. Dion Haynes)\n\n       For the last year, police and law-enforcement officials say \n     they have been handcuffed by a state Supreme Court ruling \n     that all but prohibits undercover work, a staple of crime \n     investigations.\n       Nationwide, sting operations--those involving paid \n     informants, surveillance and undercover officers--have become \n     the preferred weapon in the investigative arsenals of law-\n     enforcement agencies battling crime. Typically, prosecutors \n     direct the operations to ensure that law-enforcement agencies \n     do not entrap suspects and do not break rules in gathering \n     evidence.\n       But prosecutors reluctantly severed their ties to some \n     undercover investigations and disbanded others after the \n     Oregon's highest court ruled a year ago that prosecutors are \n     not exempt from state bar ethics codes prohibiting lawyers \n     from engaging in ``dishonesty, fraud, deceit or \n     misrepresentation.''\n       While the ethics codes of most state bars forbid \n     dishonesty, Oregon is the only state to apply that rule to \n     prosecutors involved in undercover investigations in which \n     informants or detectives must misrepresent themselves.\n       Undercover operations in Oregon have continued since the \n     ruling, but without legal advice from prosecutors.\n\n\n                          ABA to address issue\n\n       The American Bar Association, now meeting in Chicago, plans \n     to address a related controversy over a federal law requiring \n     Justice Department prosecutors to submit to state ethics \n     guidelines.\n       Some criminal defense lawyers praise the Oregon Supreme \n     Court ruling, saying all lawyers should be subject to the \n     same standards. The ruling is helping rein in prosecutors and \n     investigators who often rely too heavily on undercover work, \n     they say.\n       ``As a matter of public policy in a democratic system, \n     government lawyers should not be allowed to engage in deceit \n     while other lawyers are precluded from doing so by bar \n     disciplinary rules,'' said Steven Wax, a federal public \n     defender in Portland.\n       But the FBI, U.S. attorney's office, Drug Enforcement \n     Administration, state attorney general, Oregon State Police, \n     county district attorneys and local police departments say \n     the ruling has curtailed their investigative work, hindering \n     their ability to fight narcotics, child-sex abuse, \n     prostitution, organized crime, housing discrimination and \n     consumer fraud.\n       ``I think it's generally true that the worst criminals are \n     smart enough to hide their crimes and can only be found \n     through undercover operations,'' said Oregon U.S. Atty. Mike \n     Mosman.\n       Oregon's court decision, in part, illustrates a long-\n     standing, bitter dispute over whether Justice Department \n     prosecutors should be subject to local bar association ethics \n     codes in the states where they serve.\n       The debate started during the first Bush administration and \n     continued in the Clinton administration, when the attorneys \n     general issued policies exempting federal lawyers from state \n     ethics codes.\n\n\n                           Mc Dade Amendment\n\n       Last year, Congress reversed a Justice Department policy \n     with the so-called McDade Amendment, which requires lawyers \n     and federal prosecutors in all states to comply with local \n     ethics and court rules.\n       The law stemmed from concerns about ``how far should \n     government go in preventing crime,'' said John Henry Hingson, \n     a defense attorney in Oregon City, Ore., and a former \n     president of the National Association of Criminal Defense \n     Lawyers.\n       ``Many Americans believe that undercover operations go into \n     entrapment,'' he added.\n       The question of whether an ethical double standard exists \n     for government lawyers and defense lawyers arose in Oregon \n     with the case that prompted the August 2000 state Supreme \n     Court ruling banning misleading practices by prosecutors.\n       Using the tactics of government undercover operations, \n     personal injury lawyer Daniel Gatti allegedly posed as a \n     doctor in phone calls to an insurance company he was planning \n     to sue, according to the Oregon State Bar.\n       Citing the ethics code prohibiting lawyers from using fraud \n     and deceit, the state high court publicly reprimanded Gatti.\n       The U.S. Justice Department asked that state Supreme Court \n     to exempt prosecutors from the code, but the court ruled that \n     the ethics code does not allow exceptions. The opinion \n     further forbade lawyers from encouraging anyone else to \n     participate in the misconduct.\n       ``I have not authorized certain investigations or I have \n     shut down other investigations because I did not have a \n     prosecutor or U.S. attorney involved,'' said Capt. Jim \n     Ferraris of the Portland Police Bureau's drug and vice \n     division.\n\n\n                         Drafting an exemption\n\n       A state bar committee is drafting a rule change that would \n     exempt all prosecutors from the ethics code prohibition on \n     deception, thereby allowing them to again supervise \n     undercover operations. If it passes the bar's House of \n     Delegates next month, the proposed rule would go to the \n     Supreme Court for final approval. The high court early this \n     year rejected a similar proposal.\n\n[[Page S10678]]\n\n       The Justice Department is pressing Congress to repeal the \n     law requiring federal prosecutors to follow state ethics \n     rules and it is suing the Oregon State Bar over its \n     disciplinary code.\n       Meanwhile, the American Bar Association is proposing a \n     change in state ethics codes that would preserve the federal \n     law's requirement that government prosecutors submit to state \n     disciplinary rules but would give the Justice Department \n     latitude in its investigations--with a court order.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Oct. 12, 2001]\n\n House Fails To Include Oregon Investigation Measure in Anti-Terrorism \n                                Package\n\n                         (By Katherine Pfleger)\n\n       Washington.--The House anti-terrorism package passed Friday \n     failed to include a measure designed to remove barriers faced \n     by federal attorneys conducting covert investigations in \n     Oregon, Including those into suspected terrorists.\n       The measure, which the Senate approved Thursday, would have \n     lifted restrictions in Oregon that hinder federal prosecutors \n     from approving undercover operations to catch suspected \n     criminals.\n       But Reps.

Ron Wyden, who proposed the Oregon provision after the \n     Sept. 11 attacks, and more recently inserted it in the anti-\n     terrorism bill requested by President Bush, will fight to put \n     it back into the bill, according to his staff.\n       Without the provision, ``in essence, the bill will be an \n     anti-terrorism bill for 49 states,'' said Josh Kardon, \n     Wyden's chief of staff.'' A bill that addresses only 49 \n     states leaves the entire nation in jeopardy.''\n       The provision would amend a controversial 1998 law that \n     requires federal prosecutors to comply with the laws and \n     state bar rules of every state in which they conduct \n     enforcement activities.\n       That law, passed at the behest of Rep. Joseph M. McDade, R-\n     Pa., and Rep. John P. Murtha, D-Pa., was designed to curtail \n     prosecutorial excessiveness. McDade was once indicted on \n     federal corruption charges but later was acquitted.\n       Murtha and Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who are big supporters \n     of the 1998 law, demanded that the Oregon provision be \n     stripped out of the anti-terrorism bill, Kardon said.\n       Molly Rowley, a spokeswoman for Senate Majority Leader Tom \n     Daschle, D-S.D., said the Senate would conduct a legislative \n     conference on the bill with the House early next week.\n       Last year, federal law enforcement officials suspended many \n     undercover operations in response to an Oregon Supreme Court \n     ruling that prosecutors were excepted from state bar rules \n     against lawyers' lying.\n       In 2000, the Oregon Supreme Court upheld a disciplinary \n     action against Daniel J. Gatti, a Salem attorney who \n     misrepresented himself as a chiropractor while investigating \n     whether to file a lawsuit.\n       The Oregon State Bar responded in January by passing a rule \n     that allowed all lawyers to supervise undercover operations, \n     but the Supreme Court rejected the change.\n       Last month, the bar passed a more limited rule that allowed \n     only government lawyers and legal aid groups to supervise \n     undercover operations. The Supreme Court has yet to decide on \n     that change.\n       In the meantime, earlier this year the U.S. Department of \n     Justice sued the state bar over the rule, seeking to block it \n     from being enforced against federal prosecutors.\n       A hearing in that case is scheduled for next month.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Statesman Journal, Oct. 13, 2001]\n\n                      House Measure Ignores Oregon\n\n\n  covert criminal investigations are hampered here by restrictive laws\n\n       Washington.--The House anti-terrorism package passed Friday \n     failed to include a measure designed to remove barriers faced \n     by federal attorneys conducting covert investigations in \n     Oregon, including those into suspected terrorists.\n       The measure, which the Senate approved Thursday, would have \n     lifted restrictions in Oregon that hinder federal prosecutors \n     from approving undercover operations to catch suspected \n     criminals.\n       But Reps.

Mr. President, I could not help thinking, particularly as I \nlistened to the distinguished majority leader discuss the activity in \nhis office today and the concern about his staff and their current \nterrorist threat that reaches the U.S. Capitol staff now, about how \nmany ways this threat of terrorism affects all of us. I certainly hope \nall of the majority leader's staff is well and suffers no ill effects \nfrom what may well have been another reach of terrorist attack here in \nthe United States.\n  It reminds us how this kind of unlawful extralegal activity can \naffect a society which has always been so free and so open, precisely \nbecause we are a nation of laws and precisely because we believe in the \nrule of law.\n  Of course, in our society that rule of law ultimately rests upon the \njudge and our courts for its administration. Of course, it is the \njudges who are the ultimate arbiters of the law. We could not function \nlong as a free society without our judges. Yet today we are speaking \nabout the fact that an unacceptable number of vacancies exist in our \ncourts, vacancies that must be filled if we are to be able to properly \nadminister that law we revere so much.\n  Currently, there are 108 empty seats in the Federal judiciary. We are \nspeaking of the Federal courts alone. That represents a 12.6-percent \nvacancy in the total number of judgeships.\n  I note, as others I believe have perhaps also noted, that of those, \nthere are 41 judicial emergencies. In other words, more than a third of \nthese vacancies, according to the Administrative Office of the Courts, \nrepresents judicial emergencies--meaning that they are in districts and \nin courts in which there is an overwhelming burden of cases in which, \nwithout having a judge to fill the court position, essential justice \nwill not be done. It certainly raises the question about why we as a \nSenate are not able to act on the judges or the candidates for judge \nwhom the President has nominated.\n\n  It is in this regard that I feel my responsibility most strongly \nbecause not only am I a Member of this body but I am also a member of \nthe Judiciary Committee. Until the Judiciary Committee acts, we as a \nbody are not able to give our final advice and consent. In fact, I am \nespecially keen on the issue because three of these vacancies represent \nnominations for a district court for my own State of Arizona. All three \nof them are also designated by the administrative office as judicial \nemergencies.\n  This is not a hypothetical or a theoretical matter; it is a very real \nmatter for us today, which should touch all of us, but it certainly \ntouches some of us very strongly. It is, therefore, with some sadness \nthat I hear my colleagues talk about the potential of holding up action \non appropriations bills in order to take up the matter of judicial \nnominations.\n  Historically, the Senate has been able to do many things at the same \ntime. We have considered legislative matters on the floor when we have \nhad other calendars from which we took up matters. Indeed, many of the \nnominations, including judicial nominations, are considered as a \nrelatively routine matter, sometimes at the end of the legislative day \nwhen the majority leader will simply ask for unanimous consent to \nconsider a number of nominees. It is mostly the case that judicial \nnominees as well as others are considered in that fashion without even \nhaving a rollcall vote.\n  It has been the custom of the current chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee this year to call for, I believe in most all cases, rollcall \nvotes, which is fine. I would actually prefer to do it that way. But it \nhas not been deemed necessary in the past because most of these \nnominations are not controversial--my point being that we can consider \nand act upon frequently large numbers of nominations without having to \ntake a lot of the Senate's time for debate. It has always been that \nway. The Senate can do many things at once. We hold committee hearings \nwhen we have actions pending on the floor. It is simply not true that \nwe can only do one thing at a time.\n  Part of the reason we don't have the number of judges confirmed we \nshould is that some have made the arguments that we are too busy doing \nother things and we have to be on the floor doing the antiterrorist \nlegislation, or some other business before the Senate, and therefore we \ncan't take up the nominations. That, I submit, is not an accurate \nstatement of the way the Senate operates.\n  But for those who say we can't do more than one thing at a time, I \nhave said: Fine; then given the fact that we have time and time again \nasked for action on judicial nominations that has not been forthcoming \nby and large, perhaps it is time to give those nominations the proper \npriority they deserve and to get them on the calendar so we can \nconsider them. As a result of that, I, on a couple of other occasions, \nsuggested that rather than taking up a particular appropriations bill, \nwe should get on with nominations. No. Some colleagues argued: We need \nto get on with these appropriations bills. We will take up those \nnominations in due course.\n\n  As a matter of fact, there have been two explicit agreements reached \nbetween the majority leader, minority leader, and others about how to \nfollow this process, with the specific commitment made to take action \non those nominees, at least those who were nominated prior to the \nAugust recess. Still, we do not see action occurring at a pace fast \nenough to be able to conclude that by the end of our session this year \nwe will have, indeed, taken action on the nominations pending prior to \nthe August recess.\n  That is why I have decided that if, in fact, it is the case that we \ncannot do more than one thing at a time, then we will simply call a \ntimeout on the appropriations process, go to these nominations, see how \nmany of them we can get done as appropriate, and then return to the \nappropriations process.\n  No one suggests we will not complete that process this year. We have \nto do it. We will do it. I will be supportive of it, as well. That is \nessentially the reason why I have suggested we call a timeout on that \nprocess, so we can get those nominations done.\n  I will continue my statement, but I know the distinguished majority \nwhip wishes to speak.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize for the interruption, but I want to make clear \nI thought there was going to be a request for morning business. We have \nno one on our side wishing more morning business.\n  I want to make sure that everyone understands the next hour is that \ntime set aside for Senator Leahy and Senator McConnell. So any time \nthat is going to be used would have to be, under the previous \nagreement, given to them by the managers of the legislation or whoever \ndecides to dole out the time for each side.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Would it be appropriate to ask unanimous consent that we \nhave morning business until 5 p.m.?\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to Senator Leahy. He would agree to give up \n15 minutes of his time.\n\n[[Page S10680]]\n\n  Would Senator McConnell be willing to give up 15 minutes of his time?\n  Mr. KYL. I say to the Senator from Nevada, Senator McConnell has \nasked me to represent him during this period of time. I would be happy \nto do that if that would be the preference of the Senator from Nevada \nand the Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/15/senate-section/article/S10680-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Let me summarize where I was, Mr. President.\n  The point is, we are a country that relies upon our courts to \nadminister the rule of law. At the Federal level that means we need to \nhave a fully staffed Federal judiciary. We always know there are a \ncertain number of vacancies at any given time. But we need to complete \naction on as many of the nominations pending before us as possible, \ncertainly before we leave perhaps some time next month.\n  In the past, it has been the case that Members of both parties have \nexpressed concern about the fact that we have vacancies and that we \nneed to fill those vacancies. I will make note of that in just a moment \nbecause some of my colleagues on the other side have been eloquent \nabout their commitment to try to get the process done.\n  My point is, with over 40 vacancies designated as emergencies by the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts that characterizes vacancies as \n``emergency'' or ``nonemergency,'' with over 100 vacancies now, over 40 \nof which are emergencies, it is not business as usual. We cannot \ncontinue to have maybe one hearing a week, with maybe one or two judges \nbeing considered. We have only confirmed eight judges this entire year; \nmost of them quite recently--only eight.\n  At that pace, we are clearly not going to be able to act even on the \nPresident's nominees that existed at the time we began the August \nrecess. These are nominations made in May, in June, I believe, mostly--\nmaybe a couple in July. Clearly, we ought to at least act on those \nnominations before we terminate our business this session.\n  But if we do not get about that task very soon, there will not be \nenough in the pipeline coming from the Judiciary Committee to get that \nwork done. That is why I have said we are going to have to have a \ntimeout. If the argument is we just don't have time, we are too busy \ndoing other things, then I am willing to say: Then let's call a \ntimeout. Let's get to the nominations. And when there is a sufficient \nnumber of nominations completed, then we will go back to our other \npriorities.\n  We will continue to pass continuing resolutions to fund all of the \nvarious operations that are the subject of the appropriations bills. \nThere will be nothing lost from that process.\n  We will pass the appropriations bills. No one suggests otherwise. But \nin terms of priorities, if we do not act soon on these judges, two \nthings will happen: No. 1, we are not going to have enough time to \ncomplete the work on those before we quit; second, we will not fill \nthese vacancies that have been declared emergency vacancies by the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts.\n  So that is my reason for calling this timeout. It is my reason for \nurging people to vote against the motion to proceed to the foreign \noperations bill, which I very strongly support, incidentally.\n  I will represent to my colleagues that Senator McConnell, who is the \nranking member of that subcommittee, did, indeed, ask me to represent \nhim until he arrives this afternoon. He may be in the Chamber by 5 \no'clock. He may not. But it is his view that this is an appropriate \nobjection at this time to moving forward with action on that bill.\n  Since I see a couple of my colleagues are in the Chamber to speak, \nlet me simply say, when I resume my comments, I will speak \nstatistically to where we are in this current situation vis-a-vis past \nadministrations and make the point that it pretty much does not matter \nhow you cut it. By any statistical measure, we are far behind.\n\n  In the Reagan administration of 8 years, in the Clinton \nadministration of 8 years, in the previous Bush administration of 4 \nyears--in every case, with one exception, every single Presidential \nnominee for the courts that was made prior to the August recess was \nacted upon before Congress adjourned for the year.\n  There are 30-some vacancies for the courts now. I do not see, at the \ncurrent pace at which we are operating, how we can come close to \ncompleting action on those nominations. Actually, if you were to \ncompare the numbers through October 31, it would be a better measure, \nand that would make it virtually impossible for us to get all these \nnominations done when we are so far behind at this point.\n  I think an even more conservative proposal of just acting on those \nnominees the President sent to the Senate prior to August would be \nperfectly appropriate. I see no reason for us not to do it. That is why \nI am willing to say until we do that, we need to defer action on our \nother business so we can indeed get about this job.\n  With that, Mr. President, I reserve the time until we take up the \nmotion to proceed to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to follow up a bit on what my \nfriend from Arizona has talked about. Certainly, each of us recognizes \nthat things have changed substantially since September 11.\n  I spent the weekend in Cheyenne, WY, and much of it with the National \nGuard. These great men and women are continuing to carry out their \nduties in protecting the country, as well as now doing the special \nthings, such as airport security, and other requirements they have. \nSome have just returned from Bosnia, as a matter of fact.\n  I guess my point is, things changed for all of us; and special things \ncome up at times such as we are in now. But it is also necessary for \nus, after we have done the things we have to do for those special \ntimes, to go ahead and do the things that we ordinarily have to do. \nLife goes on, and we have to continue to pursue that.\n  I think very much that is the case now with issues we have before us, \nspecial things such as airport security, special things such as the \ndeclaration, really, of war on terrorism, which we have done. Those \nthings needed to be done.\n  Now, of course, we need to do appropriations. But we also have to do \nthe mundane things such as the confirmation of judges, the seating of \nU.S. attorneys, many of whom have a very real role in this matter of \ndomestic terrorism.\n  I, too, believe we have to work these two things out together. I \nunderstand the frustration of the leadership in the majority when they \nare seeking to move things, but I have to remind us, for example, that \non July 21, 2000, while objecting to Majority Leader Lott's attempt to \nproceed with the intelligence authorization bill, the minority leader--\nnow majority leader--said this:\n\n       I hope we can accommodate this unanimous consent request \n     for intelligence authorization. As does Senator Lott, I \n     recognize that it's important. I hope we can address it. We \n     must address additional appropriations bills. There is no \n     reason that we can't. We will find a compromise if there is a \n     will, and I am sure there is. But we also want to see the \n     list of what we expect will probably be the final list of \n     judicial nominees to be considered in hearings before the \n     Judiciary Committee.\n  This is what he said as he held up that appropriations bill.\n  Our friend from Nevada, on July 24, while objecting to Senator Lott's \nrepeated attempt to move forward, said:\n\n       We believe there should be certain rights protected. Under \n     this Constitution, we have a situation that was developed by \n     our Founding Fathers in which Senators would give the \n     executive branch, the President, recommendations for people \n     to serve in the Judiciary. Once these recommendations are \n     made, the President would send the names to the Senate and we \n     would confirm them and\n\n[[Page S10681]]\n\n     approve of those names. One of the problems we are having is \n     it is very difficult to get people approved and confirmed. \n     This has nothing to do with the energy and water bill. It \n     does, however, have something to do with other bills.\n\n  That was as he objected to continuation.\n  We find ourselves in the same position. We need to move forward to do \nthe things that must be done. We need to do the things that are \nordinarily done. I suggest we can do those things at the same time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if I could take just a couple minutes to say \na few words.\n  I have listened to my friend from Arizona, but he has to understand--\nthe whole world has to understand--we, the Democrats, just took control \nof the Senate in June. For the first 6 months this year, the \nRepublicans controlled the Senate Judiciary Committee. The chairman was \nOrrin Hatch. During that period of time, there was not a single \nconfirmation hearing or a single judicial confirmation.\n  They have to get real. They are not.\n  My friend from Arizona says we are going to have to take time out and \ndo nothing here. That is what we will be doing because we have to \nfinish the appropriations bills.\n  I also say what we have to do is very important. We have \nappropriation bills we must complete. No one is saying we will not \nconfirm judges. Even though we didn't get many confirmations for \nPresident Clinton, this is not payback time. We are going to do the \nvery best we can, and the Judiciary Committee has done the very best it \ncan. There are hearings scheduled for this Thursday to report out a \nsignificant number of judges. They have known that. These hearings are \nnot something we just planned. They have been planned for a long period \nof time.\n  There was talk from my friend from Wyoming that we have to do U.S. \nattorneys. I don't know how many U.S. attorneys we did the past week, \nbut it was 10 or 15 U.S. attorneys.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Fourteen, I say to the Senator from Nevada. Not only 14, \nbut we have been doing U.S. attorneys as fast as they have come in--26 \nso far for the year. At times when we have gone to a markup for U.S. \nattorneys, the White House wouldn't even send up their material. We had \nmy staff working until 3 in the morning to help them complete--for \nPresident Bush's nominees, to help them complete their paperwork to get \nit through. We are still waiting for them to send up the U.S. marshals. \nIn 26 years, I have never known any President, Republican or Democrat, \nto take this long.\n  And as the Senator from Nevada said, during the half a year the \nRepublicans controlled the Senate, of course, they didn't have a single \njudicial confirmation hearing. They didn't confirm a single judge. We \nare now, of course, confirming them much faster than they were \nconfirmed during the first year of the Clinton term or the first year \nof former President Bush's term. Actually, as I recall, when the \nRepublicans controlled the Senate during the Clinton years, we had 34 \nmonths that they didn't even have hearings on judges.\n  We have been doing hearings every single month, whether we are in \nrecess or not. So I suppose I could take a partisan attitude and say we \nwill go as slowly on judges as they did with President Clinton. I \nthought that was unfair then; of course it is unfair now. I have no \nintention of taking the irresponsible position my Republicans \ncolleagues did during that time.\n  What we are doing is debating a motion to proceed to the foreign \noperations appropriations bill. Senators have asked me earlier: Is all \nour Middle East money in the foreign operations bill? Yes, it is.\n  Is money in there for such things as President Bush has talked about; \nfor example, for aid to the Afghan people? Yes, some of that is in that \nbill.\n  Some have asked me if the money we provide to countries we have been \ncalling on to stand up for the United States during this time--some of \nthat money is in this bill that the other side wants to hold up. An \namazing fact, Mr. President. Everywhere President Bush has said we want \nto help and work together, and we want your help; and we want to help \nyou, I say to the leaders, that money the President is talking about, \nwhich he wants us to support him on, guess what. It is in this bill.\n  I suspect that all Democrats are going to vote to go forward. We want \nto give the President the money he needs to help in this effort against \nterrorism. I am amazed that some Senators want to stop the President \nfrom getting that money. If they vote against going forward, then he \nwill not get it. That is why I am amazed to find--I read in one of the \npapers, Republican Senators would hold up this bill--the bill that \nfunds our foreign policy--at a time when the President of the United \nStates is going around the world asking for support. It makes no sense.\n  Every Senator has a right to vote the way he or she wants. But I can \nimagine what would be said if Democrats had ever done that to any \nPresident--Republican or Democrat. They would probably be calling for \nour impeachment.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I ask the chairman: Would the \nSenator agree that during this time of trouble and strife we have been \ngoing through, two of our greatest allies have been Israel and Egypt?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Absolutely true.\n  Mr. REID. Now, as a result of the inaction of the Senate, as has been \nthreatened by the Senator from Arizona, these two countries that have \nbeen such a stalwart friend of the United States, they won't be getting \nthe aid we have set forth in this bill, will they?\n  Mr. LEAHY. No. In fact, we have a procedure when we pass the bill; a \ncertain amount is provided upfront. That is not going to be there \nbecause we can't do it under a continuing resolution. It would be \nmisleading to suggest otherwise. We have billions of dollars for our \nfriends in the Middle East, held up, as the Senator said. We have \nmilitary assistance for our European allies. We asked them to stand \nbehind us. We have antiterrorism assistance in this bill.\n  Imagine that. This bill has $38 million in antiterrorism assistance. \nI wonder how many Senators who would vote against sending this bill \nforward are willing to go back home and explain, well, even though the \nDemocrats went a lot faster in judicial nominations than we did, we \nheld up antiterrorism assistance. I would hate to have to make that \nargument back home, but they are going to have to.\n  We have assistance for refugees in Africa--the poorest of the poor. \nAre we going to hold up that money? We have victims of drought and \nearthquakes in Central America. Are we going to hold up that money? We \nhave funding to combat HIV/AIDS, the worst public health crisis in half \na millennium. Are we going to hold up that money? How about assistance \nfor combating poverty around the world, which breeds the hopelessness \nand resentment that provides the fertile breeding grounds for \nterrorists?\n  President Bush spoke about that. The Secretary of State has made the \nsame point. Do we want to hold up that money?\n  It is self-defeating and shortsighted, and it is irresponsible to \nhold up funding for foreign policy when anyone can see we have \nshortchanged foreign policy for years.\n\n  It is time to recognize that global leadership requires acting like a \nleader, not like petulant children in a school ground. It is about more \nthan dropping bombs; it is about diplomacy and foreign assistance.\n  Let's stop holding up this bill and get on with the Senate's \nbusiness. It is utterly lacking in judgment. It unfairly punishes the \nentire Nation to hold up this bill.\n  Think of the things that are being held back. Then look at the \nreason. They claim it is because judges are being held up.\n  I have a chart. I mention this because my friend from Nevada \nmentioned it earlier. He mentioned how Republicans--Republicans didn't \nhold a\n\n[[Page S10682]]\n\nsingle hearing on a judicial nomination, not one, didn't confirm a \nsingle judicial nominee. When I became chairman of the reconstituted \ncommittee, 10 minutes after that we started having hearings. In fact, \nthe Presiding Officer knows that a Republican appointee from his State, \na nominee to the circuit court of appeals, the Presiding Officer and \nhis colleague came to me and talked to me about it. That judge moved \nforward. Look at this chart. We have here the green line.\n  This is what happened in the first term of George Herbert Walker \nBush. By October 15, they had four judges. Take a look at President \nClinton. He didn't get his first judge until September. By this time, \nwe had four. Look what happened under our chairmanship. Within a couple \nof weeks of becoming Chair, I was having hearings on nominations. So \nthis baloney about numbers--I thought I would share the facts.\n  An easy fact to remember is that during this part of the year the \nRepublicans didn't hold a single confirmation hearing or confirm a \nsingle judge. I have gone now faster than the first year of the last \ntwo Presidents--both President Bush and President Clinton--twice as \nfast, actually, moving judges through than it was done in their terms. \nThat is only since becoming chairman of the committee in July. I held \nhearings two different days during the August recess. I was roundly \ncriticized by two Republican members on the Judiciary Committee for \neven holding the hearings. You are almost damned if you do, damned if \nyou don't.\n  That is fine. They have an absolute right. I believe in the first \namendment.\n  The more important question here is not the judges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/15/senate-section/article/S10682-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, for the edification of the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Senator McConnell asked that during the period of time prior \nto the vote I represent him. I will be happy to do that. I assume that \nsince the proponent of the legislation is the Senator from Vermont, he \nwill want to begin, and I respect that.\n  I presume from the shrug, the Senator from Vermont does not wish to \nmove forward, in which case I will be happy to continue with the \ndiscussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will respond to a couple things the Senator \nfrom Vermont had to say. I very much appreciate the burden he carries \nas chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and the fact he was not in the \nmajority until June. However, I think it important to point out there \nis a reason the chairman of the Judiciary Committee before him did not \nhold hearings on nominees.\n  We will all recall that it took President Bush a little while to \nsecure his office this time, and he was probably a good 6 weeks or so \nbehind. I am not sure how that translates into making nominations to \nthe bench, but by early May he, indeed, was making nominations. There \nare a whole number of nominations that were made on May 9, as a matter \nof fact, and then following that, on May 25 and then in June, and so \non.\n  Very shortly after he was sworn in, he began the work of nominating \npeople to fill the vacancies on the court. It is important to point out \nthat, probably more than any of the last four Presidents, himself \nincluded, he has acted with alacrity to fill vacancies. As a matter of \nfact, by the beginning of the August recess, in the short time that \nPresident Bush held office, the President had submitted to the Senate \n44 judicial nominees. Let me put this in perspective.\n\n  President Reagan had submitted 8 nominees before the end of the \nAugust recess, President Bush submitted 8 nominees before the August \nrecess, and President Clinton submitted 14 nominees before the August \nrecess. President Bush submitted, as I said, 44 nominees before the \nAugust recess.\n  It is true that those were not submitted in February and March and \nApril. Obviously, he was just taking office at that time. To point out \nno hearings were held before the distinguished Senator from Vermont \nbecame chairman of the committee I think does not represent the \nsituation in any accurate way for us to take action now.\n  The fact is, we had 44 nominees pending prior to the August recess, \n108 vacancies currently, and therefore it is time to act. Whatever the \nsituation was before June, we now know we have all of these nominees. \nMy question is, Why are we not acting on them?\n  In terms of hearings, it is true the Senator from Vermont has held \nhearings, but the problem is he does not put very many judicial \nnominations on the hearing calendar. In contrast to his predecessor, \nSenator Hatch, who averaged 4.2 judicial nominees per confirmation \nhearing, Senator Leahy has been moving at about a third of that place--\n1.4 judicial nominees per confirmation hearing. It is a little hard to \nfill these 108 vacancies when you are only having 1.4 nominees per \nhearing and you only hold the hearings on the schedule they have been \nheld so far.\n  As a result, we have only confirmed eight judges. That is the reality \nof where we are today.\n  The fact that we have 41 designated emergency judges as indicated by \nthe Administrative Office of the Courts does not concern anyone? It \ncertainly concerns me as a Senator representing a border State, where I \nhave three nominations pending, with no action being taken on those.\n  There are 21 nominees pending in the Judiciary Committee who are \nslated to fill positions which have been declared judicial emergencies \nby the Administrative Office of the Courts. Why are we not holding \nhearings on these nominations? As far as I know, there is nothing to \nprevent us from holding hearings, and if I am wrong, I ask the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee to tell me how I am wrong.\n  He says anyone who takes the position I have taken is utterly lacking \nin judgment. I ask him to perhaps reconsider that comment. Perhaps I \ncan ask the Senator from Vermont who he thinks is acting like petulant \nchildren in the schoolyard--the other comment he made.\n  The fact is, we have had time to hold hearings, and there are all of \nthese nominations pending. They were pending before the August recess. \nThere is nothing preventing us from holding the hearings. There is \nnothing preventing us from voting on those nominations in the hearing, \nnothing except politics, I submit, and that, at the end of the day, is \napparently where we are.\n  I do not like to hold up other business any more than anyone else. It \nis important to get the foreign operations bill done. Clearly, we will \ndo that. But for those who say we are just so busy doing other things, \nthen I am forced to say, fine. Then let's stop until we can get some of \nthese nominations to the floor for a vote and acted on.\n  Mr. President, I wish to make one other comment. These are not my \nwords but the words of the distinguished Senator from Vermont. When \nBill Clinton was President and there were fewer than 85 vacancies--now \nthere are 108--Senator Leahy took the position that ``[a]ny week in \nwhich the Senate does not confirm three judges is a week in which the \nSenate is failing to address the vacancy crisis.''\n  When there were fewer than 70 judicial vacancies, the Senator told \nthe Judiciary Committee:\n\n       [W]e must redouble our efforts to work with the President \n     to end the longstanding vacancies that plague the Federal \n     courts and disadvantage all Americans. That is our \n     constitutional responsibility.\n\n\n[[Page S10683]]\n\n\n  I certainly agree with the Senator.\n  Finally, in May of 2000 Senator Leahy argued that we should move more \njudges than had been moved before at a time when they were being moved \nfaster than they are now. He said:\n\n       I have challenged the Senate to regain the pace met in 1998 \n     when the committee held 13 hearings and the Senate confirmed \n     65 judges.\n\n  I suggest if it was an appropriate pace then, it is an appropriate \npace now. There is no reason not to do it. Therefore, we should get on \nwith that task.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am going to speak on this issue of \njudicial nominations for a few moments. I urge us to get as many of \nthese judges reported as possible, but I do also think we need to stick \nto some of the facts. I will put in the Record a few facts.\n  President Bush has submitted 60 nominees for confirmation to us this \nyear; we have confirmed 8. That is 13 percent. President Clinton \nthrough all of 1993--the Senate confirmed 27; he submitted 47; so that \nwas a total of 57 percent.\n  The first President Bush, in 1989, in his first year, submitted 24. \nWe confirmed 15. So he had 62 percent of the judges he submitted to \nCongress in his first year be confirmed.\n  President Reagan, in 1981, submitted 45. Forty-one were confirmed for \na confirmation rate of 91 percent. For President Reagan, we confirmed \n91 percent of the judges he submitted in his first year in office; \nPresident Bush, 62 percent; President Clinton, 57 percent. This year \nwith President George W. Bush, we have confirmed 8 out of 60--only 13 \npercent. So we are way behind compared to the three previous \nPresidents. We have a lot of catching up to do.\n  Those are the facts. We are way behind on circuit court nominees. We \nhave had more circuit court nominees submitted this time than in the \npast. We have only confirmed 4, but we have had 25 submitted. So we \nhave only confirmed 16 percent of the circuit court nominees. I just \nmention that.\n  For the district court, 35 have been submitted, and we have only \nconfirmed 4. We have a few more in the pipeline, and hopefully we will \nget those through, but we still have a lot.\n  My point is, out of 60 judges submitted by President Bush this year, \nwe have confirmed 8. That is only 13 percent. That is far behind the 57 \npercent for President Clinton's judges. Sixty-two percent of President \nBush's judges and 91 percent of President Reagan's judges were \nconfirmed in the first year. So we are moving very slowly. We need to \naccelerate. That is the reason why some of us are saying wait a minute \nbefore we agree to move forward on all the appropriations bills. Let us \ntry to see if we cannot come up with an agreement where we can have \nexpeditious consideration of these judges. They should not be \npenalized.\n  This Congress should confirm the judges. I know Senator Daschle and \nSenator Reid have told me they concur with that. So I hope in the very \nnear future we come up with an agreement on how to proceed that all \nwould say is a fair way of dealing with these judges.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Am I in control of the time on this side? If so, how \nmuch time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three and a half minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have been a longtime friend of the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. In fact, he and I have worked \ntogether for some 9 years on the foreign operations bill, the bill that \nwill at some point in the future be before the Senate. Sometimes he has \nbeen chairman and sometimes I have been chairman. Right now he is \nchairman.\n  As an appropriator, I am mindful of the need to complete \nappropriations bills in a timely fashion. This year, the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee has put together what I believe to be a good \nbill, and I certainly support that bill and want to see it become law \nat the earliest possible time. Nevertheless, I do intend to vote \nagainst cloture on the motion to proceed because regretfully this seems \nto be the only tool with which we are left to try to advance the \nPresident's judicial nominations.\n  While I am aware of the importance of the timely completion of \nappropriations bills, I am also cognizant of the need to make sure that \nour Federal judiciary is adequately staffed. It is because I am \nconcerned that some of my colleagues do not fully appreciate the crisis \nfacing the Federal judiciary that I feel it is necessary to object \nproceeding to this bill. I hope that by doing so, we can get a concrete \nagreement on timely confirming the President's nominees and remedying \nthe situation facing the judiciary.\n  I have great respect for the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who \nis also chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, but the cold, \nhard fact is there are 108 judicial vacancies, almost 13 percent of the \nFederal bench, which means that the Federal judiciary is woefully \nunderstaffed. And we are running out of time in this fall session.\n  It will do us precious little good to pass important counter-\nterrorism legislation, for example, if there are not enough judges to \nreview search warrants and to try cases in a timely fashion. We are \nengaged in a massive war on terrorism with, as we have seen today, new \nfronts emerging each and every day. With such a massive law enforcement \noperation, we need U.S. Attorneys, and we need Federal judges.\n  I am particularly puzzled that my colleagues across the aisle, who \nhave cried for adequate judicial safeguards in our counter-terrorism \npackage, would not support our request for the expeditious \nconsideration of the President's judicial nominees.\n  If we look at the first year of the last three administrations, all \nbut one of the judges nominated before the August recess were \nconfirmed. Clearly, for whatever reason, we are not getting the job \ndone in the Judiciary Committee.\n  We need to have an adequate complement of Federal judges on the \nbench. Given the sorry state of the vacancy situation, timely \nconsideration is certainly needed. It is the middle of October, and the \nPresident has only eight judicial nominees confirmed. By contrast, at \nthe end of his first year in office, President Clinton had 27 or 28 \njudges confirmed.\n  This is not President Bush's fault. He submitted 44 nominees before \nthe August recess. Indeed, President Bush submitted his first batch of \nnominees back in May. This, again, is another record, at least for the \nlast couple of decades.\n  Rather, the reason for this delay is that while we have had some \nhearings, we have not come close to getting the most out of these \nhearings. I expect this afternoon there has been a lot of talk about \nhearings, but the fact is we have gotten the least out of the most.\n\n  Specifically, while from 1998 to 2000 the Judiciary Committee \naveraged 4.2 judicial nominees per hearing, this year we have averaged \nonly 1.4 judicial nominees per hearing. That is a pace that is three \ntimes as slow as was the case from 1998 to 2000.\n  We can do better than that. We must do better than that. The chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee and my friend, Senator Leahy, was constantly \ncomplaining prior to this year about the slow pace of the previous \nSenate. The fact is, it was moving a lot more rapidly than we are at \nthe moment.\n  Now, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will say, \n``McConnell, you got it all wrong. You need to look at `this.' And you \nneed to look at `that.' And you need to look at the other.' '' Well, I \nand my colleagues are not going to be distracted by ``this, that, and \nthe other,'' and we are going to make sure the American public is not \neither. We are going to keep our eyes fixed on the bottom line, and the \nbottom line is that President Bush's 8 judicial nominees is woefully \ninadequate when compared to his predecessors, and particularly \nPresident Clinton who got 28 judges confirmed in his first year.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the President, the Federal \njudiciary, and the law enforcement community, which is on the front \nlines of our nation's war against terrorism. Vote no on this motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 15 minutes.\n\n[[Page S10684]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Then do we vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 5:30, by agreement, there will be a cloture \nvote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Chair. The former Governor of \nNebraska has spent an enormous amount of time in that chair. I know he \nis now giving up the chair, but he has done the Senate a great service \nwith the amount of time he has spent there. I have a feeling the \nSenator from Nebraska, when he came from the executive branch, never \nthought he would be presiding as much, but he has done the Senate a \ngreat service.\n  I love to hear quotes, especially those taken out of context. Back \nwhen the Republicans controlled the Senate I urged that they move \nquicker on judicial nominations. I think it is because they left an \nextraordinary number of President Clinton's nominees at the end of his \nterm on which they never even allowed a vote. He had women, Hispanics, \nothers who would wait 3, 4, 5 years and never even get a hearing. That \ncreated a real problem. Now, having created all of those vacancies, \nthey come in and say, oh, my gosh, we have judicial vacancies.\n  President Clinton tried to fill those judicial vacancies, as my \ncolleagues may recall, and the Republican-controlled Senate refused to \nallow him. Time and time again, they would hold them up. They would \nkeep sending more questions to them. They would not allow them to come \nforward. They would not have a hearing. They would not have a vote, and \nfinally the nominations died. So, of course, there were vacancies. All \nthe vacancies would have been filled if they had even allowed votes on \nthese because, when on the rare occasions they would allow a vote, the \nperson would get 90 votes, 95 votes, sometimes 100 votes. They would go \nthrough easily, but they would not allow them to have a vote. So the \nvacancies occurred.\n  It is a little bit like the young person who is before the court. He \nis there for murdering his parents and he says, Your Honor, you have to \nhave mercy on me. I am an orphan. Well, this is the same thing. \nRepublicans spent 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 years creating enormous judicial \nvacancies and then they come in and say we have to fill these judicial \nvacancies.\n  We are going to have hearings for five judges on Thursday. We will \nhave a hearing for them. So there are five judges on Thursday alone who \nare coming up. As we wait for them to finish their questionnaires, I \nthink it is good if we can find out if they have criminal records or \nthings such as that before we go forward. If they fit at least a basic \nlevel of competence before they go forward, we will continue to have \nthose hearings. I am not going to do what the Republicans did and have \n34 months without having any hearings at all. We have been having \nhearings every month.\n  It is an interesting complaint they make, when they had 6 months that \nthey controlled the Senate and did not have any confirmation hearings \nof judges or votes. We started having them within a week after taking \nover the Senate.\n\n  Be that as it may, maybe someone sits in a room somewhere and thinks \nwe don't have enough work to do. After all, we spent 3 weeks putting \ntogether an antiterrorism bill--which did take up a little bit of time. \nI remember the number of times I was here late at night, and then to \nhear complaints we have not had Judiciary hearings--actually, we had a \ncouple while we were working on the antiterrorism bill.\n  Some things have happened in the last month in this country that have \nneeded our attention. We have been trying to move U.S. attorneys as \nfast as they come up, but it is like pulling teeth to get them out of \nthe White House so we can move them. I don't know if we have had any \nmarshal nominations come up, but a week ago we had not had a single \none. I have never known a President in my term to take that long.\n  Holding up the foreign aid bill is an interesting tactic. I cannot \nfigure out why. If Senators want to criticize me on judges, I am happy \nto make a commitment to move as fast as they moved the nominees of \nPresident Clinton, but I have a feeling no one would be happy if I, as \nchairman, were to treat President Bush's judicial nominees the way they \ntreated President Clinton's. If I did that, we would hear screams. I \nthink we would hear screams from Democrats, too, because it would be so \npatently unfair if we did to them what the Republicans did to President \nClinton. I am not going to do that. I don't believe in doing that. When \nwe get done, whatever time I am chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we \nwill find President Bush's nominees were handled far more fairly than \nthose of President Clinton.\n  Having said that, I wonder what in Heaven's name is the masochistic \nattitude that is holding up this bill so they can make political points \non the weekend talk shows. I cannot understand that. Secretary Powell \nis overseas now trying to solidify our antiterrorism coalition. \nDemocrats have united behind the President and the Secretary of State \nin helping to bring together the support of leaders of other countries. \nThe distinguished majority leader has pushed hard to get through money \nand authorization for President Bush to fight terrorism. We went the \nextra mile to get the antiterrorism bill completed.\n  Having done that, we are now saying to the President: Look, Mr. \nPresident, you can call on all these people overseas, ask them to \nsupport us in our antiterrorism activities, but we are not going to \ngive you your foreign aid bill. We will not give you the money you are \nnow promising the foreign leaders for their help. We are not going to \ngive you the money that goes to NATO allies. We will not give you the \nmoney that goes to the Middle East Camp David signers. We will not give \nyou the money to fight AIDS in Africa. We are not going to give you the \nmoney to give child immunizations. We are not going to give you the \nmoney, apparently, to help feed the Afghanistan people after this war \nends.\n  It is a sad day when, for partisan reasons, an important \nappropriations bill is sabotaged. Even the ranking member of the \nforeign appropriations subcommittee will vote against proceeding to the \nappropriations bill. It is unfortunate, unjustified, especially after I \nhave bent over backwards to work with him on this bill. Our economy is \nintricately intertwined with the global economy. Our health depends on \nour ability and the ability of countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin \nAmerica to control the spread of deadly infectious diseases. Our \nsecurity is linked to the spread of nuclear, biological, and chemical \nweapons and our ability to stop terrorism and narcotrafficking and \norganized crime. These threats are prevalent from as far away as China \nto our own cities.\n\n  No less a threat but potentially the trigger that ignites many others \nis poverty. We are surrounded by a sea of desperate people. Two billion \npeople, a third of the world's inhabitants, live on the edge of \nstarvation. They barely survive on whatever scraps they can scavenge. \nMany children die before the age of 5. This grinding, hopeless, \ndesperate existence is overladen with despair. That despair fuels \nhatred, fear, violence, and even the terrorism that hit this country a \nmonth ago. We see it on many continents, including today in Pakistan, \nwhere thousands of people are threatening to overthrow their own \ngovernment if it gives American troops access to Pakistani territory. \nWe see it across Africa and in Colombia and Indonesia. We see it in the \nform of refugees and people displaced from their homes who number in \nthe tens of millions.\n  The world is on fire in too many places to count, and in most of \nthose flashpoints poverty and the injustice that perpetuates it are at \nthe root of instability.\n  Our foreign assistance programs provide economic support to poor \ncountries, health care to the world's neediest women and children, food \nand shelter to refugees and victims of natural and manmade disasters, \nand technical expertise to promote democracy, free markets, human \nrights, and the rule of law. This is as it should be. But as important \nas this is, what we give is a pittance when considered in terms of our \nwealth and the seriousness of the threats we face. Even this pittance, \nthe other side doesn't want us to even vote on. Stand up and say we are \nall against terrorism. Of course we are. Wave the flag and say you want \nto protect America. Of course we do. But to say we might do something \nto actually stop some of the root causes of terrorism--\n\n[[Page S10685]]\n\nwell, not if it interferes with the partisan political agenda; we can't \ndo that.\n  The approximately $10 billion we provide in this type of assistance--\nwhether through the State Department and the Agency for International \nDevelopment or as contributions to the World Bank, the U.N. Development \nProgram, the World Food Program, and other organizations--amounts to \nless than $40 per person in this country.\n  We are all willing to give far more money than that--we were in my \nfamily--for the victims of terrorism. But at least give something that \nmaybe will stop the terrorism from happening in the first place. We are \nalso trying to help people in our country because our economy is \nsuffering. But we cannot bury our heads in the sand and protect our \nnational interests, in today's complex and dangerous world, on a \nforeign assistance budget that is less in real terms than it was 15 \nyears ago.\n  Our world is not simply our towns and our States and our country, it \nis the whole world. We live in a global economy. The Ebola virus is \nlike a terrorist--the terrorists could get on a plane in one part of \nthe world and could be in our backyard hours later. We can try our best \nto control our borders, but we cannot hide behind an impenetrable wall.\n  We have to go to the source of the problem, to the countries that are \nfailing from ignorance, poverty, and injustice.\n  Almost 60 percent of the world's people live in Asia. That number is \ngrowing. Seventy percent of the world's people are nonwhite, 70 percent \nare non-Christian, 5 percent own more than half the world's wealth, \nhalf the world's people suffer from malnutrition, and 70 percent are \nilliterate.\n  These people may not knock down skyscrapers that kill 6,000 Americans \nin a single day. But they pose immense long-term threats to our way of \nlife: Extreme poverty on a massive scale in countries that cannot feed \ntheir people today, and the poisoning of our environment. All of these \nthings should be attacked by us just as much as we attack the networks \nof Osama bin Laden.\n  We give no credit to the Senate--the greatest parliamentary body--we \ngive no credit to this great body if we block the foreign aid bill from \ngoing forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to a period for morning business, with Senators allowed to \nspeak therein for a period not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, 5 years ago I stood here and called upon \nthe Senate to join the fight against terrorism. Back then terrorism \nseemed like something that happened far away, in distant lands over \ndistant conflicts. Well, that has all changed.\n  Terrorism has come to America.\n  We have to be a little proactive now. Back then, I proposed a series \nof precise antiterrorism tools to help law enforcement catch terrorists \nbefore they commit their deadly acts, not ever imagining the events of \nSeptember 11.\n  In particular, I said that it simply did not make sense that many of \nour law enforcement tools were not available for terrorism cases.\n  For example, the FBI could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia, \nbut they could not get one to investigate terrorists. To put it \nbluntly, that was crazy! What's good for the Mob should be good for \nterrorists!\n  Anyway, some of my proposals were enacted into law, a number were \nnot.\n\n[[Page S10686]]\n\n  There were those who decided that the threat to Americans was \napparently not serious enough to give the President all the changes in \nthe law he requested.\n  Today, five years later, I again call on my colleagues to provide law \nenforcement with a number of the tools which they declined to do back \nthen. The anti-terrorism bill we passed judgment on Thursday, S. 1510, \nis measured and prudent. It takes a number of important steps in waging \nan effective war on terrorism.\n  It allows law enforcement to keep up with the modern technology these \nterrorists are using. The bill contains several provisions which are \nidentical or near-identical to those I previously proposed.\n  For example: it allows the FBI to get wiretaps to investigate \nterrorists, just like they do for the Mafia or drug kingpins; it allows \nthe FBI to get a ``roving wiretap'' to investigate terrorists--so they \ncan follow a particular suspect, regardless of how many different forms \nof communication that person uses; it allows terrorists to be charged \nwith federal ``racketeering offenses''--serious criminal charges \navailable against organizations which engage in criminal conduct as a \ngroup--for their crimes; it includes a provision similar to legislation \nI introduced last Congress, S. 3202, to prohibit terrorists, and \nothers, from possessing biological materials when that person does not \nhave any lawful reason for having them. Right now, it's only illegal if \nyou intend to use such materials as a weapon, the FBI tells me that \nthat is simply too difficult a burden for them to prove in many cases, \nand that the new offense we create in this bill will be helpful in \nprosecuting terrorists who possess dangerous biological agents; it \nincorporates the language of S. 899, legislation Senator Hatch and I \nintroduced earlier this year to raise the payment to families of public \nsafety officers killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty from \n$100,000 to $250,000.\n  Let's be clear. This bill is a step in the right direction. Some will \nsay that it doesn't go far enough.\n  I have to say, I was disappointed that the Administration dropped \nsome proposals from an early draft of its bill, measures which I called \nfor five years ago. Those antiterrorism measures are NOT in the bill, \nbut I continue to believe that they're common-sense tools which law \nenforcement should have.\n  We should be extending 48 hour ``emergency'' wiretaps and ``pen \nregisters,'' ``caller-ID''-type devices to track incoming and outgoing \nphone calls from suspects, to terrorism crimes. This would allow \npolice, in an emergency situation, to obtain immediately surveillance \nmeans against a terrorist, provided the police go to a judge within 48 \nhours and prove that they had the right to get the wiretap and that the \nemergency circumstances prevented them from going to the judge in the \nfirst place. Right now, these emergency means are available only for \norganized crime cases.\n  We should be extending the Supreme Court's ``good faith'' exception \nto wiretaps. This well-accepted doctrine prevents criminals in other \ntypes of offenses from going free when the police make an honest \nmistake in seizing evidence or statements from a suspect. We should \napply this ``good faith'' exception to terrorist crimes as well, to \nprevent terrorists from getting away when the police make an honest \nmistake in obtaining a wiretap.\n  I'm also pleased that Chairman Leahy and the administration were able \nto reach consensus on the two areas which gave me some pause in the \nadministration's original proposal: those provisions dealing with \nmandatory detention of illegal aliens and with greater information \nsharing between the intelligence and law enforcement communities.\n  Overall, the agreement Chairman Leahy reached has satisfied me that \nthese new law enforcement powers will not upset the balance between \neffective law enforcement and the civil liberties we all value.\n  This bill is not perfect. No one here claims it has all the answers. \nThis fight may be lengthy. But I am confident that by treating \nterrorism as seriously as we do the Mob, that we are taking a step in \nthe right direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/15/senate-section/article/S10686-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  Last Friday marked the three-year anniversary of a heinous crime that \noccurred in Laramie, WY. On October 12, 1998, Matthew Shepard, 21, an \nopenly gay student at the University of Wyoming, was savagely beaten to \ndeath, burned, and tied to a wooden fence. Russell A. Henderson, 21, \nand Aaron McKinney were convicted of first-degree felony murder, \nkidnapping, and aggravated battery. The duo had met Shepard at a bar, \npretended to be gay, and lured him to their truck where they intended \nto rob him. After being pistol whipped and burned, Shepard was found 18 \nhours later tied to a fence and in a coma. He died later that night in \nPoudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, CO. The pair's girlfriends, \nChasity V. Pasley, 20, and Kristen L. Price, 18, were convicted for \nbeing accessories after the fact.\n  On a personal note, I want to state that my involvement with hate \ncrimes legislation stems from this murder. I was in Portland, OR \nwatching the televised vigil on the steps of the Capitol following \nMatt's death. It caused me great sorrow to note that no sitting \nRepublican Senator was involved in this vigil. I resolved then to help \nchange our current hate crimes law in part so that what happened to \nMatt, would never happen again.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/15/senate-section/article/S10686-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10686-S10687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this autumn from September 15th to October \n15th, we commemorate the Nation's 33rd Hispanic Heritage Month. In \n1968, Congress designated a week to celebrate Hispanic culture \nnationally. Twenty years later in 1988, the week-long festivity was \ntransformed into a month-long variety of activities aimed at raising \nnational awareness of the tradition and achievement of Hispanics in \nAmerica.\n  In that spirit I would like to recognize the initiating force behind \nthis celebration, Gil Coronado. Colonel Coronado envisioned a week-long \ncelebration of culture and pride and as founder and chairman of \n``Heroes and Heritage: Saluting a Legacy of Hispanic Patriotism and \nPride'' a non-profit organization, set forth to make his dream a \nreality. A hero himself, Colonel Coronado enlisted with the Air Force \nat age 16 and would serve for 30 years in Vietnam, Panama, Germany and \nSpain before he retired with over 35 awards including the Legion of \nMerit and the Bronze Star. Hispanic Americans like Colonel Coronado, \nhave risen to the call of duty, defending the liberty and freedom the \nUnited States stands for, just as they continue to do so today in our \narmed services.\n  Hispanic contributions to our culture and society go back almost 500 \nyears, to when Juan Ponce de Leon first arrived in Florida in 1513. His \nfellow explorers like Alvarez de Pinela and Cabeza de Vaca would \ntraverse what is now the American ``Sunbelt.'' In fact, the arrival of \nDe Soto in Mississippi in 1541 is commemorated in one of the great \nhistorical canvases in the Rotunda of the Capitol building in which we \nwork.\n  Today, Hispanics continue to be pioneers in our society. Fernando \nBujones was 19 when he became the first American to win a gold medal at \nthe 1972 International Ballet Competition in Varma Bulgaria. Mari Luci \nJamarillo would be appointed by President Jimmy Carter as the \nAmbassador to Honduras in 1977, distinguishing her as the first woman \nambassador of Hispanic descent.\n  I would also like to make special note of two people affiliated with \nmy home state of Michigan. In 1990, Antonia Novello became the first \nfemale Hispanic U.S. Surgeon General. Dr. Novello started her medical \ncareer at\n\n[[Page S10687]]\n\nUniversity of Michigan where she was named ``Intern of the Year,'' the \nfirst woman to ever receive such an award. Detroit would also be the \nstarting point for Jose Feliciano's musical career. A native of Puerto \nRico, Feliciano was born blind, but he mastered multiple instruments \nlike the 6 and 12 string guitars, the bass, banjo, mandolin, organ, \nbongo drums, piano, harpsichord, harmonica and trumpet. He would \nachieve stardom with his Latin-soul version of ``Light My Fire.'' \nHowever, he would gain even more popularity with his unorthodox blues-\nrock rendition of ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' during the 1968 World \nSeries game in Detroit.\n  These are just a few outstanding examples of Hispanic contributions \nto American society. It is a pleasure for me to stand today with my \nSenate colleagues as we continue to recognize the contributions of our \nHispanic community during National Hispanic Heritage month.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of this year's \nHispanic Heritage Month, commemorated annually between September 15 and \nOctober 15. This celebration is an opportunity to honor a community \ndevoted to family, faith, country and hard work. It is also a \ndemonstration of patriotism as we appreciate the diversity from which \nour country derives its strength.\n  This month, and all year, we honor the courage, talent, \ndetermination, leadership and vision of Hispanic men, women and \nchildren who have done so much for our Nation in the face of incredible \nobstacles. We also honor the rich culture and heritage of the Chicano/\nLatino community and the tremendous gifts the community has given to \nour country.\n  Our greatness lies in the diversity of our beliefs as well as in the \nstrength of our common ideals. The history of our country, its values \nand beliefs, are thus intertwined with the Chicano/Latino community.\n  In acknowledging the rich heritage of the Chicano/Latino community, I \nwould like particularly to acknowledge the outstanding contributions of \nfour Chicano/Latino institutions in my State of Minnesota. Their \nefforts have helped shape the social, economic and political landscape \nof their vibrant community as well as the community at large.\n  The Chicanos Latinos Unidos en Servicio, CLUES, has provided critical \nservices to advance the Chicano/Latino community. Founded in 1981 in \nSt. Paul to provide culturally appropriate and bilingual mental health \nservices, CLUES has just opened a new office in Minneapolis that \nprovides mental health, chemical health, education, employment and \nelder wellness programs.\n  The Chicano Latino Affairs Council, CLAC, advises the Government and \nState legislature on issues of importance to the Minnesota Chicano/\nLatino community. CLAC consists of 15 members appointed by the Governor \nof Minnesota from all different levels of government. The CLAC educates \nthe legislature, the general public, the media, and agency heads on the \ncontributions of Chicano/Latinos and the issues facing the community.\n  In addition, Minnesota has funded a bi-lingual charter school, El \nColegio, designed to improve the achievement of high school students. \nIts mission is to engage students in experiences that help them find \nmeaning and purpose in their lives. This experimental education uses \nHispanic, Chicano and Mexican perspectives to study art, environment \nand technology. The school helps students take pride in who they are \nand in what they can do for American society. One student, David Juanez \nis currently helping me with legislation which would allow States to \ncreate permanent resident status for undocumented students in good \nstanding, enabling them to receive state funding when applying to \ncollege. This is only an example of what these students can do when \ngiven the opportunity.\n  A further great contribution to the Chicano/Latino community has been \nthe opening of Mercado Central in August, 1999 and its ongoing \noperation since then. The market features 45 Latino merchants offering \nauthentic foods, housewares, gifts, and groceries. The entrepreneurs \nthat have opened this market have changed the face of Minneapolis' Lake \nStreet forever. Its addition is a celebration of the Hispanic, Chicano, \nand Mexican community here in Minnesota.\n  At a time when we are faced with national challenge, we must strive \neven more to continue building a society in which people of diverse \nbackgrounds are valued for the richness of their contributions. I hope \nthat we can use this special occasion of Hispanic Heritage Month to \nbring the American people closer together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/15/senate-section/article/S10687-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FLIGHT FOR FREEDOM\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, ever since the days of the \npioneers, when folks would gather from miles around to participate in \ncommunity barn raisings, the spirit of neighbor helping neighbor has \nbeen an Oregon tradition.\n  I rise today with great pride in my State to tell you that the \ntradition of neighbor helping neighbor reached new heights these past \nfew days in a remarkable project entitled ``Flight for Freedom''.\n  Spurred by New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's call that New York \nCity was open for business, Portland Mayor Vera Katz and Portland \nbusinessman Sho Dozono came up with the idea of sending a delegation of \nOregonians to New York City to lend whatever support they could to the \nresidents of the Big Apple.\n  It wasn't too long before 100 Oregonians signed up, and then 200, and \nthen 500, and then 750, and when all was said and done, over 1,000 \nOregonians from every corner of my state boarded planes and traveled to \nNew York City last weekend.\n  This delegation brought a great deal of business to New York hotels, \nrestaurants and stores. But more important than that, they brought a \ngreat message. A message that we are one Nation. A message that the \n3,000 miles between New York City and Oregon was made non-existent on \nSeptember 11. A message that as New Yorkers move forward in the days \nand weeks ahead, Oregonians and Americans will stand with them.\n  It was a message expressed in the tee-shirts that members of the \nFlight to Freedom wore and distributed as they marched in the Columbus \nDay Parade. The shirt said simply ``Oregon loves New York.''\n  Many participants in the Flight for Freedom have described the trip \nas the most moving and most memorable of their life. They will always \nremember the gratitude New Yorkers extended to them. They will always \nremember the words of a New York policeman who said, ``The gap in the \nNew York skyline is incredible. It can't ever be replaced. But we'll \nbounce back with the help of people like you in Oregon.''\n  I know my colleague Senator Wyden joins with me in saying to Senator \nSchumer and Senator Clinton that we share the sentiments expressed by \nour fellow Oregonians last weekend. We, too, love New York, and we, \ntoo, will stand with you every step of the way.\n  The State motto of Oregon is ``She flies with her own wings.'' And it \nseems to me that Oregon, New York City, and all of America are flying \njust a little bit higher today because of the spirit and leadership of \nMayor Vera Katz, Sho Dozono, and all those who made the Flight to \nFreedom such a remarkable success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/15/senate-section/article/S10687-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10687-S10688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN MEMORY OF KARLETON DOUGLAS BEYE FYFE\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, at 8:48 a.m. on September 11, 2001, \nAmerica lost one of its finest citizens, one of the many who gave their \nlives in the senseless acts of terror visited upon our country that \nday. His name is Karleton Douglas Beye Fyfe, and he deserves to be \nremembered. He died aboard American Airlines Flight 11, scheduled to \nfly from Boston to Los Angeles. He died at the age of 31 in the service \nof his family, of his profession and of his country. He died among the \nvery first victims of this tragedy which has so unsettled our Nation. \nHe would have had strong views about the aftermath of this tragedy, and \nhe would not have been shy about expressing them.\n  Mr. Fyfe's loss leaves his many survivors devastated. He was a \ndevoted father and loving son, a constant husband and loyal friend, an \noutstanding student and solid professional.\n  Mr. Fyfe grew up in North Carolina and attended the University of \nNorth\n\n[[Page S10688]]\n\nCarolina at Chapel Hill, where he majored in economics and philosophy. \nAt Chapel Hill, Mr. Fyfe's lightning intellect flourished; he was \nequally at home both inside and outside his chosen disciplines. His \ninstructors describe Karleton as a prodigy, the kind of student who \nmakes teaching exciting, rewarding, and easy.\n  Mr. Fyfe served his family and his country as a successful member of \nAmerica's financial community in Boston, working as an analyst with \nFidelity Investments for eight years before joining John Hancock as a \ntelecom analyst in January. As a financial analyst, he would tell his \nfriends of the seriousness with which he took his important work: \n``These are people's lives'' is how he would describe the retirement \naccounts in his care.\n  Mr. Fyfe's family and friends all remember his unique, disarming \nsense of humor, a quality he used to overcome awkward moments and often \nto make a point. He died, and his voice has been silenced, but those \nwho had the honor of knowing Karleton are certain that he would have \nviews about his country's reaction to the horror that took his life.\n  A close friend imagined that Karleton might say: ``If you must go to \nwar, be sure somebody is in charge of protecting the innocent. Make \nsure that our country emerges from this enterprise having improved the \ncondition of all the women and children it will inevitably affect.''\n  Let us take a moment to hear those words. If he thought they could be \nheard in this forum, Mr. Fyfe would have been glad to give his life in \nthe service of his family, his profession, his country, and the \ninnocent.\n  I ask consent that two important insertions into the Record be in \norder. The first will be the text of Mr. Fyfe's death notice as \npublished in the Raleigh News and Observer on Thursday, September 13, \n2001; it reiterates the profound loss suffered by his family and \nfriends, and it emphasizes the message, which must emerge from his \ndeath, of protecting the innocents. The second is an account of Mr. \nFyfe's character, friendship, and sense of humor, written by his dear \nfriend, Ric Schellhorn, as published in the Raleigh News and Observer \non Tuesday, September 18, 2001; it characterizes Karleton's humanity \nand humor as only a best friend can.\n  I now ask consent, that the two documents be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Karleton Douglas Beye Fyfe\n\n       Durham.--Karleton Douglas Beye Fyfe's life was taken \n     yesterday on AA flight 11 by the hatred that so poisons part \n     of our humanity--he would not want us to take revenge on \n     innocent people for this cruel, senseless act.\n       Karleton was born in San Antonio, Texas on a warm, sunny \n     February 10th in 1970. He spent his growing up years in \n     Durham County and graduated from Southern High. He majored in \n     philosophy and economics at UNC and then worked for Fidelity \n     Investments of Boston for eight years. During that time he \n     married Haven Conley from the Chapel Hill-Durham area, earned \n     a Masters degree in business from Boston University and a CFA \n     certificate, and became father to Jackson before joining the \n     John Hancock Company as a financial analyst in January of \n     this year.\n       He is survived by his wonderful wife Haven, his adoring son \n     Jackson of 19 months, his parents, Barbara and Jim of Durham, \n     his older sister Tiffany Tanguilig and husband Larry of \n     Alpharetta, GA, his younger sister Erin Yang and husband Carl \n     of Cambridge, MA, his niece and nephew Sydney and Tyler \n     Tanguilig, and his many loving relatives, friends and \n     associates.\n       Karleton's quick wit, gracious friendliness, keen \n     intelligence and loving family loyalty will be missed by us \n     all.\n       A memorial service will be held at the Community Church of \n     Chapel Hill at a time to be arranged later. In lieu of \n     flowers the family would be happy to see any donations made \n     to the Orange Durham Coalition for Battered Women in \n     Karleton's name.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 Point of View: One Among the Thousands\n\n                          (By Eric Schellhorn)\n\n       San Diego.--Three of us were on the phone the other night \n     reminiscing about our friend when all at once, for a few \n     long, uncomfortable seconds, everyone stopped talking.\n       Karleton--Karleton D.B. Fyfe, formerly of Durham and Chapel \n     Hill--would have savored the moment: ``Pretty cool awkward \n     silence we got going here,'' he'd have piped up, as he always \n     did when a sober moment rudely encroached on an otherwise \n     loose and limber good time. It was a stock Karleton line, one \n     of his trademarks. Try it sometime. See if anyone in the room \n     can keep a straight face, even if you happen to be talking \n     about the absurd, violent death of a dear friend.\n       ``Writing about me for The N, huh?'' I hear him saying \n     now, deadpan as you please. ``Don't forget to tell them all \n     what a handsome devil I was. And remember to spell `genius' \n     right. Big newspapers hate typos.''\n       I won't reduce a dignified and accomplished young life to a \n     series of one-liners, but making an indelible impression on \n     people's senses of humor strikes me as an even more lofty \n     accomplishment than the ones you'll read in his formal bio: \n     31-year-old telecom-industry analyst for John Hancock, MBA \n     from Boston University, earned at night some years back while \n     working full-time for a major mutual fund broker. Those are \n     just the facts, man, and they don't tell you the part of the \n     story that's most worth remembering.\n       He was a junior from Durham majoring in economics and \n     philosophy when I met him as a first-year grad student at \n     UNC-Chapel Hill. In anyone else, you might have dismissed \n     that incongruous pairing of academic pursuits as an \n     affectation, or a resume-builder. For Karleton, reading Kant \n     or Hegel was the perfect antidote to a steady diet of Keynes \n     and Adam Smith. He'd say: ``The best part about reading \n     brilliant economists and brilliant philosophers is that now I \n     have no clue what people in two completely different \n     disciplines are talking about.''\n       Most lives worth remembering embody just these kinds of \n     contradictions: economics and philosophy, class-clown with a \n     work ethic that kept him away from his wife and young son far \n     more than he would have liked, new-era Southern gentleman who \n     inexplicably found himself working shoulder-to-shoulder with \n     Harvard grads in the financial heart of Boston Brahmin \n     country, connoisseur of both Tar Heel baseball caps and fine \n     European-tailored suits.\n       Back at school, you might have watched him schlep his 6-\n     foot-4 frame around in khaki shorts and T-shirts for three \n     straight months, but you wouldn't have considered trucking \n     out to a morning job interview without rousing him from a \n     sound sleep and asking if the jacket or slacks you'd picked \n     out for yourself made you look like an apprentice \n     televangelist. On one such occasion, I wandered into \n     Karleton's room in the house we shared at school for just \n     this kind of fashion consultation. Chucking diplomacy to the \n     breeze, he wordlessly sized me up, went to his own closet and \n     picked out a necktie of his own that, as he later put it, was \n     a little less ``Carnaby Street.''\n       There are people you're proud to call friends, and then \n     there are people whose friends you're proud to be. I always \n     felt I got the better end of our bargain. When Karleton asked \n     me to be the best man at his wedding in 1994, it was like \n     being nominated to an elite inner circle. I repaid the \n     distinction by getting the flu on the morning of his nuptials \n     and passing out cold, mid-ceremony in the early October North \n     Carolina heat. An hour later, the vows exchanged in my \n     absence, he came inside to the couch where I was recovering, \n     threw his arms around me, and said, without a trace of \n     annoyance, ``Thanks for giving us the only wedding video in \n     history that'll be worth watching in slo-mo.''\n       Armchair psychologists will tell you people who respond \n     reflexively to tragic or unpleasant events with a joke or \n     offhand remark are invoking a classic little pain-saving \n     defense mechanism called ``reaction formation.''\n       Karleton was a world-class reaction-former. I can't say for \n     sure, but my guess is that if he'd been watching Tuesday's \n     events on TV at home, rather than sitting on a plane bound \n     for Los Angeles, he would have summed everything up with a \n     vintage understatement: ``Man, whoever did all this . . . \n     they're gonna have to give back a lot of those humanitarian \n     awards.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/15/senate-section/article/S10688-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10688-S10689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF CLYDE L. CHOATE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today with great sadness to mark \nthe passing of an American hero and an Illinois legend. Clyde Choate \nspent his 81 years in service to his country and to his State, and we \nare fortunate indeed to have known him.\n  Clyde Choate was an Illinoisan through and through, born in downstate \nFranklin County and a lifelong resident of nearby Union County. \nSouthern Illinois is the heart of coal country, and Clyde came from a \nfamily for whom mining was both a way of living and a way of life. \nPerhaps we can trace his later ability to stand up for himself as a \nState legislator to the fact that he had 11 brothers and sisters. \nAnyone growing up in a 14-member household would feel right at home in \na large deliberative body.\n  Shortly after the outbreak of World War II, Clyde enlisted as a \nprivate in the U.S. Army and found himself deployed to the European \ntheater, where he spent some 31 months. It was there, on the \nbattlefields of France, that Staff Sergeant Clyde Choate demonstrated a \ndetermination and pride that would mark his public service for the rest \nof his life.\n  In late October of 1944, the tank destroyer battalion Choate \ncommanded\n\n[[Page S10689]]\n\nwas engaged by a German tank and company of infantrymen. With his anti-\ntank weaponry destroyed, Staff Sergeant Choate left a position of \nsafety to search for trapped comrades and to chase the enemy tank, \nwhich was by then moving to attack American troops nearby. Grabbing a \nrocket launcher, Choate singlehandedly attacked the tank, disabling it, \nand then killed its crew with his pistol. He completed destruction of \nthe German vehicle while under heavy enemy fire by dropping a grenade \ninto the turret. With their firepower rendered useless, the German \ntroops retreated, having been turned back solely through the heroic \nactions of Staff Sergeant Clyde Choate.\n  In presenting him with the Congressional Medal of Honor, this \ncountry's highest award, in the East Room of the White House on August \n23, 1945, President Harry Truman noted that ``Staff Sergeant Choate's \ngreat daring in assaulting an enemy tank single-handed, his \ndetermination to follow the vehicle after it had passed his position, \nand his skill and crushing thoroughness in the attack prevented the \nenemy from capturing a battalion command post and turned a probable \ndefeat into a tactical success.''\n  A New York Times story written that day notes that President Truman \nthanked the medal recipients and commented that their ``deeds \ndemonstrated that when leadership was required, no matter what the \nemergency, it came to the top through the young men of America.'' How \ntrue these words ring today when we think about the young men and women \nwho are defending our country in the battle against a new and \nfrightening enemy.\n  Leadership rose to the top through Clyde Choate on a daily basis. His \npolitical career was born that late summer day in our Nation's capital \nwhen the young veteran seized his opportunity to lobby at the highest \nlevel and expressed to President Truman his concerns about the coal \nindustry in southern Illinois. Perhaps, President Truman suggested, the \nyoung Clyde Choate should run for public office. The very next year, \nClyde was a candidate for the Illinois House of Representatives and \nwon. He took up residence in Union County's seat and kept it warm for \nthe next 30 years. In that three-decade span, he served as both \nminority and majority leader of the Illinois House many times.\n  I remember State Representative Clyde Choate. He was passionately \ncommitted to southern Illinois but could always find common ground with \nhis colleagues from the ethnic neighborhoods of our State's biggest \ncities. His common sense and great sense of humor made him a trusted \nleader and favorite friend of Democrats and Republicans alike. After \nleaving the Illinois General Assembly, Clyde Choate became a strong \nvoice for Southern Illinois University.\n  Last year when I visited southern Illinois, my friend Clyde Choate \ncame to my town meeting. Though illness had dimmed his vision, nothing \ncould dim his insight. He pulled me to the side and in his \ncharacteristic style whispered into my ear about politics, the \nPresident and our national agenda. His title was gone but his passion \nfor the important issues of our time was undiminished.\n  Clyde Choate was a soldier for our great nation and a fighter for the \ngreat State of Illinois. We have benefitted tremendously from his \ndedication, his drive and above all, his leadership. He will be sorely \nmissed by the people of Illinois and, most especially, by his neighbors \nand friends in Union County, all of whom he so tirelessly served.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/15/senate-section/article/S10689-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SEAFORD, DELAWARE FIRE DEPARTMENT\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on November 10th, 1901, several \nleading citizens of Seaford, DE met in the Town Council room to discuss \nthe organization of a fire company. They understood what we are so very \nmindful of today, that local firefighters are a key part of our first \nand best defense against disaster.\n  By the end of November 1901, there were more than 50 members of the \nnew Seaford Volunteer Fire Department, and W.H. Miller had been elected \nto serve as its first president. The first chief, T.H. Scott, was \nelected in early December, and soon after led the company on its first \nfire response on December 18th, 1901, at a building that was both a \nstore and a home on Seaford's High Street.\n  The Seaford firefighters used hand-drawn hose reels and ladder \ntrailers until 1921, when the first fire engine was purchased. It is \nworth taking note that Government money helped buy that first engine, a \nreminder that a public investment in the fire service is necessary and \nappropriate. This partnership is all the more important 80 years later, \nwhen we ask our firefighters to respond to such a range of threats and \ndangers.\n  Today, the Seaford Volunteer Fire Company fleet includes four Pierce \nfire engines, an aerial truck, two ambulances, a rescue truck, a brush \ntruck, a utility truck and a van, as well as ``Old Number 4,'' a 1948 \nSeagraves used for fire prevention programs. Four paid ambulance \nattendants now serve the community, with more than 50 volunteer \nfirefighters still ready to answer the call when their neighbors need \nthem, and 50 more volunteers working in support of the Department.\n  As we honor the heroes of September 11th, including so many members \nof New York's Bravest, we stand in prayerful wonder and immeasurable \ngratitude for what firefighters sacrifice and risk on our behalf. They \nare, truly, the best of neighbors and the best of citizens.\n  The Seaford Volunteer Fire Department has been a part of that great \ntradition for 100 years, and on behalf of the people of my state, and \non behalf of the United States Senate, I am proud to extend \ncongratulations to Chief Steve Mayer, President Rich Toulson and all \nthe men and women who have kept the Department and the community strong \ninto a second century of service. Again, we are very proud, and we are \ndeeply grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/15/senate-section/article/S10689-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10689-S10690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATING BARBARA ELY RITTER ON 30 YEARS' FEDERAL SERVICE WITH THE \n                     U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncongratulate an exceptional Federal employee and friend, Barbara Ely \nRitter, who on October 18 of this year will complete 30 years of \nFederal service with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  Mrs. Ritter is currently Chief of Budget Execution for the USFWS here \nin Washington, D.C. But her career extends back to 1971 when, as she \ntells it, as a newly arrived ``Cheechako'' in Anchorage, Alaska, \nconfronting an extremely tight job market, she was faced with a choice \nbetween two career paths: night clerk in a liquor store or temporary \nclerk/typist with the USFWS. Fortunately for the Service and for the \ntaxpayers, Mrs. Ritter chose the latter path.\n  Thus began a career that has taken her from Alaska to New Mexico to \nNorth Carolina to Washington, D.C. to Oregon, and back again to Alaska \nand the District of Columbia. In each transfer Mrs. Ritter has moved \ninto positions of greater and greater responsibility, establishing \nalong the way a reputation for getting things done and done right. \nIndeed, she is known in the Service as one of the ``go-to'' people on \nbudget matters. In addition, she has chosen to share her experience and \nknowledge with up-and-coming USFWS managers and budget specialists by \nmentoring and instructing prospective managers through the Service's \n``Stepping Up to Leadership'' program.\n  She is a regular lecturer at the National Conservation Training \nCenter in Shepardstown, WV, as well as co-developer of the NCTC's \ncourse of budget instruction. In addition, in her various management \npositions Mrs. Ritter has effectively implemented the Federal \nGovernment's oft-stated hiring goals of diversity and quality in its \nworkforce. As an example, she personally led efforts to hire the first \nvisually impaired employee in the USFWS Portland, OR, office--an \nemployee who is, herself, coming up on 10 years' service with the \nUSFWS.\n  Our nation's future depends to a large degree on the quality and \nprofessionalism of the Federal employee. Oft-maligned unjustly, the \nFederal employee is the person who, ultimately, has to get the job done \nfor America.\n\n[[Page S10690]]\n\nBarbara Ely Ritter's 30-year career with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService and her inspiring rise from temporary employee to division \nchief, stands as a vivid example of what our dedicated, hard-working, \nprofessional Federal employees are capable of.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/15/senate-section/article/S10690-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IN MEMORY OF REVEREND DOCTOR FREDERICK GEORGE SAMPSON\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to \nthe achievements of a beloved religious leader, heroic civil rights \nadvocate, inspiring preacher and dedicated father from my home State of \nMichigan, Reverend Doctor Frederick George Sampson.\n  For the past 30 years, my home town of Detroit has been able to claim \nReverend Sampson as one of its own. However, his deep faith, keen \nintellect, and concern for others enabled him to touch the lives of \ncountless people the world over.\n  Born in Port Arthur, TX, Reverend Sampson's insatiable thirst for \nknowledge compelled him to earn three bachelor's degrees, two master's \ndegrees, a doctor of divinity degree from Virginia Theological Seminary \nas well as certificates in economics and medicine. In addition, three \ncolleges awarded him honorary degrees.\n  While he was indeed a man of learning, Reverend Sampson was also a \nman of action who sought to integrate his education and faith into all \nhe did. His learning and faith could be heard in his powerful sermons. \nSuch was the influence of these sermons, that Ebony Magazine twice \nnamed Reverend Sampson as one of the Nation's ``Greatest Black \nPreachers in America.''\n  Central to all the Reverend's work was his untiring advocacy on \nbehalf of the civil rights movement. A close aide to the Reverend \nMartin Luther King, Jr., Dr. Sampson helped organize the 1965 voting \nrights march in Montgomery, AL, and he helped write and edit many \nimportant speeches given during the early days of the civil rights \nmovement. In addition, he was a life member of the National Association \nfor the Advancement of Colored People as well as a former President of \nthe Detroit branch of the NAACP. Much of the success of the civil \nrights movement has been due to the untiring efforts by people of \nfaith, such as Reverend Sampson, who reminded us about the dignity and \nworth of all people regardless of their race, creed or gender.\n  After serving two decades in various churches throughout the nation, \nReverend Sampson came to Detroit to serve as Senior Pastor at the \nTabernacle Missionary Baptist Church. During his tenure as pastor, this \nparish of 5,000 served as a beacon of hope to the entire community. \nTabernacle Church cares for the body and mind as well as the soul, and \nReverend Sampson deserves much of the credit for this. The church \noffers computer training, GED tutoring, runs a soup kitchen, \nadministers a food pantry and among other things has a scholarship \nprogram in addition to its services and Bible studies.\n  As one who early in his life deferred a career in medicine to serve \nGod as a preacher, Reverend Sampson was able to use his role as a \nminister to increase awareness about health matters. Besides speaking \nextensively about health and spirituality, Reverend Sampson was able to \ndisplay considerable courage in his personal life when he was diagnosed \nwith prostate cancer. After this diagnosis, Reverend Sampson and his \ndaughter Freda sought to highlight the threat that prostate cancer \nposes, particularly to African American males, by teaming with the \nAmerican Cancer Society and the Southern Christian Leadership \nConference to raise awareness of this disease.\n  Reverend Sampson has been a community and spiritual leader for nearly \nfive decades. I have been able to witness, firsthand, his passionate \noratory, his love of his Lord and his commitment to helping others. \nReverend Sampson touched the lives of all who met him. I know my Senate \ncolleagues join me in commemorating the life of Reverend Doctor \nFrederick George Sampson, and in offering their condolences to his son \nPastor Frederick Sampson III, his daughter Freda and his extended \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/15/senate-section/article/S10690-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL BUSINESS WOMEN'S WEEK\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this week, for the 73rd year, our \nnation will commemorate National Business Women's Week. Since it was \nfirst observed in 1928, the event has been sponsored by Business and \nProfessional Women, (BPW)/USA as a national tribute to all working \nwomen. It has helped increase awareness of the continuing challenges \nthat working women face, and has highlighted their many successes that \nhave strengthened our nation.\n  With well over 60 million women in the American labor force, \nincluding more than 70 percent of women with children, and an \nincreasing percentage of women who help care for an elderly relative, \nthe issues that challenge working women must be priorities for all of \nus, from balancing responsibilities within our own families to our \ndebates on national and, indeed, multinational policy. And, as has been \nthe case for all of the 73 years that we've had National Business \nWomen's Week, we start from a position where there is good news and bad \nnews; we've come a long way, and we have a long way to go.\n  In 1999, there were nine million women-owned firms, representing 38 \npercent of all American businesses, a 103 percent increase in just over \n10 years; and the rate of growth for women-owned businesses in America \nis nearly three times faster than the overall rate. Women-owned \nbusinesses are also as financially secure and credit-worthy as other \nfirms, and, in fact, are more likely to stay in business.\n  Yet, even with that powerful place in our economy, women \nentrepreneurs still have lower levels of available credit than their \nmale counterparts. And as for employees, women still face a wage gap; \nfor every dollar earned by men in 1998, women earned an average of 73 \ncents. The gap is even wider for women of color, and it gets worse as \nthe workers get older, presumably progressing in their careers.\n  In the highest echelons of the business world, the Fortune 500, the \ngood news is that the number of women corporate officers has increased \nby 37 percent over the past five years; the bad news is that the total \nnumber of women officers is still alarmingly low. The number of women \nin the highest officer positions, like CEO, president and high-ranking \nvice presidencies, has increased by 113 percent since 1995, but that \nstill translates into just 114 women in those jobs, or about five \npercent of top office holders.\n  We've seen similar progress, with corresponding long ways to go, in \nwomen working in government and higher education. In my State last \nyear, we elected our first woman Governor--a Governor, I might add, who \nis also a small business owner. While we rightly celebrate her victory, \nshe was just the 11th of 12 American women ever to have been elected to \nthat office outright. Here in the Senate, we have seen progress--with a \nrecord 13 women currently serving as U.S. Senators--but we still cannot \ncall it success. And in academia, too, although some numbers are \ngetting better, some problems persist, including what the American \nAssociation of University Professors described as substantial \ndisparities in salary, rank and tenure.\n  And so, as we approach National Business Women's Week, we have some \nwork to do. Achieving equity on the job is a process, and it proceeds \nnot on an isolated track but with almost constant overlap with policies \nthat affect home and family life, from providing adequate health care \nto combating domestic violence, from meeting the needs of our young \nchildren to responding to the needs of our aging parents. As a national \ninterest, work and family exist in partnership.\n  We celebrate the progress and contributions of working women in \nAmerica, recognizing that our prosperity--as well as the full \nexpression of our values and national character--depend upon women \nhaving the opportunity to participate fully in our economic life. We \nare not there, but we are inspired by the women who continue to lead \nthe way, and during National Business Women's Week, we are reminded to \nhonor their uniquely valuable contributions to the strength of our \neconomy and our society, and to the promise of our future.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/15/senate-section/article/S10691-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10691]]\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                   enrolled joint resolutions signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on October 12, 2001, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled joint resolutions:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Transportation to give \ncertain workers who have lost their jobs as a result of the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, 2001, priority in hiring for aviation-related \nsecurity positions; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President it's a privilege to introduce this bill to \nensure that laid-off aviation industry workers receive first priority \nwhen the Federal Government and private security firms under Federal \ncontracts hire new employees. Identical legislation was introduced last \nweek in the House of Representatives by Representative Jane Harman of \nCalifornia, and I commend her for her leadership.\n  Under our legislation, the Secretary of Transportation will develop \nregulations giving priority in such hiring for aviation-related \nsecurity positions to qualified airline workers who were laid-off as a \nresult of the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n  Those attacks have had a devastating impact on large numbers of the \nmen and women who work in aviation and related industries. Immense job \nlosses have taken place. Since September 11, layoffs of more than \n140,000 aviation workers have been announced, and nearly 80,000 of \nthose workers are already out of work. Clearly, Congress should do all \nit can to help the men and women in the industry who have lost their \njobs. These workers should get preference for training and new \nemployment opportunities.\n  Last week, the Senate passed the aviation security bill that \nfederalizes airport security, including 18,000 baggage screeners and \n10,000 other security-related positions. The bill that Representative \nHarman and I am sponsoring gives first priority in hiring for these \nairport security jobs to the thousands of men and women who were \nworking in the aviation industry and at airports before September 11, \nand who have been laid off as a result of the terrorist attacks.\n  The time to help these workers is now. We must help these workers get \nback to work. One of the most effective ways to do that is by giving \npreference to those who lost their jobs for these airport security \npositions. I urge my colleagues to help these dedicated men and women \nby supporting this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 1544\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PRIORITY IN HIRING.\n\n       Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations \n     directing that the Department of Transportation, agencies \n     within the Department, and private companies contracted to \n     provide aviation-related security shall give first priority \n     in hiring, for employment related to security at airports and \n     on aircraft operated by air carriers in air transportation \n     and intrastate air transportation, to individuals who--\n       (1) were employed before September 11, 2001--\n       (A) in a security-related position at an airport;\n       (B) by an air carrier;\n       (C) at a facility at, or immediately adjacent to, an \n     airport;\n       (D) in providing transportation to or from an airport; or\n       (E) in other employment directly related to commercial \n     aviation;\n       (2) have been laid off, terminated, released, or otherwise \n     lost their jobs as a result of the terrorist attacks of \n     September 11, 2001; and\n       (3) are qualified for those positions or for training \n     programs needed to qualify for those positions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 1545. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide regulatory relief and contracting flexibility under the \nMedicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, Today I rise to introduce the Medicare \nRegulatory and Contracting Reform Act of 2001.\n  I do so at this time because, within the past month, I have received \ntwo letters from Medicare Contractors who are withdrawing their \nservices from some Oklahoma counties and other markets across the \ncountry. One letter reads, ``. . .over-regulation will force health \nplans to make the difficult decision to withdraw from some markets. . \n.''. Nearly half a million seniors will lose their Medicare+Choice \nhealth coverage this year. This is unacceptable. Over-regulation and \nreimbursement issues plague many Medicare contractors and providers. If \nwe do not act to alleviate the ills of this system, more and more \nAmericans will suffer the consequence.\n  This legislation will substantially alter the current system to \nreduce the regulatory burden on Medicare providers, carriers, fiscal \nintermediaries and beneficiaries, and it will improve the efficiency \nand quality of the contracting system by which Medicare operates on a \ndaily basis.\n  In order to help providers, carriers, and beneficiaries understand \nand implement Medicare regulations, this legislation consolidates the \nrule-making\n\n[[Page S10695]]\n\nprocess for the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, HHS. It also provides for the education and training of all \nparties involved. Should this bill become law, the Secretary of HHS \nwill be required to utilize the mechanisms of competition and \nincentives in the Medicare contracting process. Both competition and \nincentives increase performance and quality of service. Streamlining \nthe claims-appeals process to expedite reviews and amending the process \nof payment recovery will further benefit providers. This legislation \nenhances the technical support for small rural providers that currently \ndo not have the resources to comply with electronic billing \nrequirements. Finally, to directly assist Medicare recipients, this \nbill establishes a resource person to answer questions and work through \nobstacles that arise in the health care process.\n  Passage of this legislation is necessary to stabilize and strengthen \na Medicare system that is disintegrating. I am confident that we can \nbring about beneficial change for millions of Americans who depend on \nMedicare. I hope that my colleagues will join me in this effort.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1545\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide additional funding to combat bioterrorism; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bio-\nSecurity in Agriculture Act of 2001. I refer to the security of \nagriculture, our crops, our livestock production.\n  In the wake of September 11, we increased security of the Capitol, \nour government buildings, airports, sports venues, and businesses.\n  We should do the same for our agriculture and our nation's food \nsupply.\n  I served 2 years as chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on \nEmerging Threats, and now as ranking member of the subcommittee. I'm \nalso on the Intelligence Committee and a member of the Agriculture \nCommittee.\n  In numerous hearings on terrorism, we repeatedly asked top scientists \nand biowarfare experts to assess the greatest threats to our nation. \nOne of their greatest concerns has been the susceptibility of U.S. \nagriculture and the impact an attack on it could have on the \nagriculture economy and the Nation's food supply.\n  It would not be difficult to take a disease such as foot-and-mouth so \nprevalent in Europe and introduce it into the U.S. livestock herd. With \nthe large number of cattle and livestock operations in close proximity \nto each other in our feedlots and hog facilities it could quickly \nbecome an epidemic.\n  I consider this threat to be real. I know of no specific threat, but \nI can tell you 2 years ago, when we asked the FBI where is the \nprobability and where is the risk, the probability was rather low. \nSince the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic overseas and since the events \nof September 11, I can assure my colleagues the probability is rated \nmuch higher. I am not going to get into classified information, but the \nrisk would cause utter chaos in our country.\n  Such an attack would be devastating. One estimate for California is a \nloss of $14 billion should foot and mouth disease break out in that \nstate.\n  We know that the former Soviet Union developed ``tons'' of biowarfare \nagents aimed at North American agriculture. These include FMD, \nglanders, rust diseases for wheat and rice, and Karnal Bunt in wheat. \nThere are other diseases that could be introduced as well.\n  The threat is real. Yet, our federal facilities to test and do \nresearch on\n\n[[Page S10702]]\n\nboth containment and prevention of these diseases are outdated and in \nneed of repair. We have approximately $700 million in the pipeline to \nupgrade these facilities over the next 6 to 10 years. But we cannot \nwait for 6 to 10 years. We need to make the investment in these \nfacilities and the research dollars now.\n  Why is protecting agriculture from terrorist attack important? There \nare several reasons: Agriculture is one of the few sectors of the \neconomy with a trade surplus; using numbers from 1999; agriculture and \nagribusiness related industries accounted for approximately 22 million \njobs and 16.4 percent of GDP; The overall contribution to the Nation's \nGDP in 1999 was $1.5 trillion; and the cheap U.S. food supply kept the \ntotal portion of individual income spent on food to 10.4 percent, or 10 \nand one half cents of every dollar, on food in 1999. The lowest percent \nof income spent on food of any country in the world.\n  The loss of export markets resulting from the intentional \nintroduction of these pathogens would be dramatic. The introduction of \nFMD or Karmal Bunt on a widespread basis could mean the total collapse \nof U.S. export markets.\n  This would be devastating for a commodity such as wheat where 32 \npercent of total production was exported in 1999 and to agriculture in \ngeneral which is one of the few sectors of the economy that operates in \na trade surplus. Also, when an outbreak of FMD occurs, many of the \nanimals are often killed to control the spread of the disease.\n  If a massive herd reduction occurred, it could take several years to \nreplace the lost numbers. Again the ripple effects are enormous. \nIndividual producers will be impacted, feedlots and hog operations \ncould be devastated, meat packers and their employees could be put out \nof business due to reduced slaughter numbers, and the grain markets \nwould take enormous hits as there would be no where for the excess feed \nusage to go.\n  The impact on our Nation of a widespread attack on agriculture could \ndwarf the airline and travel industry's loss from September 11.\n  To keep this nightmare scenario from occurring, legislation is \nnecessary to complete the facility upgrades needed to deal with this \nthreat and to provide funding for the additional research to develop \nrisk control methods, first responder response mechanisms, and \ndevelopment of vaccines and plant resistant varieties that are immune \nto these threats. The need is real, the timing is crucial, and it needs \nto be done now.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide approximately \n$3.5 billion to improve and invest on a ``crash course'' to do the \nbuilding upgrades and research we should have been doing for years.\n  In fiscal year 2002, the bill calls for $1.1 billion, including: $101 \nmillion to allow USDA to meet the security levels required under \nPresidential Decision Directive, PDD-67, for the animal and plant \ndisease facilities at: Plum Island, NY; the National Animal Disease \nCenter, Ames, IA; the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, Athens, \nGA; the Arthropod-Borne Animal Disease Research Laboratory, Laramie, \nWY; and the Foreign Disease Weed Science Laboratory, Fort Detrick, MD.\n\n  We also provide $722.8 million in fiscal year 2002 to accelerate the \nplanning, upgrading, and construction of four of the above named \nfacilities, including: $234 million for the Plum Island facility; $129 \nmillion to renovate the existing Biolevel 3 facilities and $105 million \nfor planning and construction of a Biosafety level 4 facility; $381 \nmillion for modernization of the facilities in Ames, IA; $78 million \nfor the planning and design of the biocontainment laboratory for \npoultry research in Athens, GA; and $29.8 million for the Arthropod-\nBorn Animal Disease Laboratory, Laramie, WY.\n  The bill provides $10 million in fiscal year 2002 for USDA to \npurchase, and distribute to each of the states, rapid diagnostic field \ntests that can give a definitive answer on suspected cases of FMD, \nKarnal bunt, anthrax, etc., in only 45 minutes.\n  These test would represent a strengthened line of security replacing \nthe current process where the sample is trucked to an airport, flown to \none of the disease labs, tested, and then results are released anywhere \nfrom a day to 4 or 5 days later.\n  We also make a significant investment in research with $2.71 billion \nprovided over the next 10 years to continue work ARS is already doing \nwith state universities and private industry, provide competitive \ngrants for USDA to award to qualified universities and private \norganizations, and general funding for USDA to use in those areas where \nit determines we have the most pressing need.\n  We have worked to keep from tying USDA's hands on this in order to \nallow them to respond to future needs or threats that may arise, but \ngenerally the research could include: Expanding on-the-spot diagnostic \ncapabilities; conducting mapping of microorganisms and pests to \npinpoint their geographical origins; genetically engineer diseases that \nwill be effective against agents of bioterrorism concerns; improve \nplant resistance to potential introduced pathogens; create mass vaccine \ndelivery systems for animals, poultry, and fish; conduct research with \nforeign countries to help reduce disease threats at the source and \nremove the natural sources of infectious agents and pests that \nterrorists or nations might easily access to threaten the United \nStates; develop counter toxins; and develop economic models to assist \nin risk assessment and prioritization of efforts. Currently, it is \ndifficult to determine the exact economic effect of an attack on the \nUnited States because the proper economic models do not exist.\n  Finally, the bill provides $12 million each year for USDA to work in \ncollaboration with the Oklahoma City counter-terrorism Institute.\n  This is a significant amount of money. But it is an investment that \nrequires our immediate attention. I do not want us to ignore this issue \nuntil it is too late.\n  Nearly 2\\1/2\\ years ago, as chairman of the Emerging Threats \nSubcommittee, I warned at our first hearing that the World Trade Center \nwas at risk of terrorist attack because of its symbolism of U.S. \neconomic strength and indulgence. At the time, no one wanted to listen \nto the warning.\n  I take no please in my prediction and the events of September 11. But \nI do not want us to ignore similar warnings and threats on \nagroterrorism until it is too late. If we do our 10.5 percent of \ndisposable income spent on food in this country could well be a thing \nof the past.\n  I urge my colleagues to support me in enacting the Biosecurity for \nAgriculture Act of 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S. 1547. A bill amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend and \nmodify the credit for producing fuel from a nonconventional source, to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nNonconventional Natural Gas Reliability Act. This body has moved \nforcefully and responsibly since the tragic events of September 11 to \naddress the most pressing and immediate needs of the country. However, \naction on priorities such as comprehensive energy legislation, has been \ndelayed but remains vitally important. As Congress moves forward to \naddress this pressing issue, it is my belief that any comprehensive \nenergy legislation must include provisions designed to increase access \nto North American natural gas supplies.\n  Following the energy crisis of the 1970's, Section 29 of the Internal \nRevenue Code was enacted to provide a tax credit to encourage \nproduction of oil and gas from unconventional sources such as Coalbed \nMethane, Devonian Shale, Tight Rock Formations, and Tight Gas Sands. \nThis credit has helped the industry invest in new technologies that \nallow us to recover large oil and gas deposits locked in various \nformations that are very expensive to develop.\n  In 1998, the United States consumed 22 trillion cubic feet of natural \ngas. Over the next fifteen years that number is expected to exceed 31 \ntrillion cubic feet. Significant growth in consumption will be \nparticularly evident in the area of electric generation, where \nenvironmental issues make natural gas the fuel of choice. The National \nPetroleum Council predicts that natural gas production by conventional \nmeans will remain relatively constant\n\n[[Page S10703]]\n\nover the next several years, ultimately falling 7 to 9 trillion cubic \nfeet short of what is needed.\n  The Gas Technology Institute and the National Petroleum Council \nestimate that economic incentives may allow nonconventional natural gas \nto bridge to gap by providing an annual addition of 7 to 9 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas to our domestic supply. Section 29 of the \nInternal Revenue code was designed to provide this economic incentive. \nFor current production, ``section 29'' benefits expire at the end of \nnext year and there are no incentives for new production.\n  Today I am introducing ``section 29'' legislation which is designed \nto keep current ``section 29'' wells in production and provide the \nincentive for new wells to be brought on line. Providing a ``clean'' \nalternative to conventional natural gas, and keeping all of our \nexisting sources of energy online will continue to be a priority for \nthis great nation in the years to come. My legislation would provide \nsection 29 credits for qualifying new wells and facilities through \n2009, and for the continuation of benefits to wells and facilities \ncurrently in production through 2006.\n  Whether it is artificial fracturing of gas bearing formations, \nextensive dewatering, gas clean-up issues, these nonconventional \nresources can be significant more expensive to drill, to maintain, and \nto produce. Thus, it is important to support continued production at \nexisting wells and facilities.\n  There are few instances where the facts are more compelling and the \nconclusion so clear. Giving section 29 a new lease on life is a wise \ninvestment of taxpayer dollars that will result in lower natural gas \nprices and greater domestic energy supply.

A bill to provide for increasing the technically trained \nworkforce in the United States; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Mikulski, \nBond, Frist, and Domenici in introducing an innovative response to one \nof the greatest challenges to the growth of the Innovation Economy, \nAmerica's widening talent gap.\n  Our technological prowess is unequaled in the world today, which is \nwhy, despite our recent slowdown and the aftershocks of the September \n11 attacks, we still have the strongest, most vibrant economy on the \nplanet, and we obviously have no deficit of ingenuity and \ninventiveness.\n  But our long-term competitive standing and economic security could \nwell be at risk if we do not address a troubling trendline in our \nworkforce, the mismatch between the demand and supply of workers with \nscience and engineering training.\n  The fact is, the number of jobs requiring significant technical \nskills is projected to grow by more than 50 percent in the United \nStates over the next ten years. But outside of the life sciences, the \nnumber of degrees awarded in science and engineering has been flat or \ndeclining.\n  This has helped fuel a well-chronicled shortage of qualified New \nEconomy workers. We have tried to temporarily plug this human capital \nhole with a stopgap of foreign workers. But there is a broad consensus \namong high-tech leaders and policymakers that it would be a serious \nmistake to prolong this dependence and essentially put our GDP at the \nmercy of H1B's.\n  That may sound like a bit of an overstatement to some. But the \nreality is that technological innovation is now widely understood to be \nthe major driver of economic growth, not to mention a critical factor \nin our military superiority. And it is widely understood that we cannot \nexpand our economy in the future if we don't take steps now to expand \nour domestic pool of brainpower, the next generation of people who will \nincubate and implement the next generation of ideas.\n  Now, most answers to serious economic challenges flow from the \nprivate sector, which is where growth ultimately occurs. But there are \nthings that the federal government can do to help, particularly when it \ncomes to educating and training our workforce. We can provide \nleadership, focus, and not least of all resources, and that is the \npurpose of the bill we are introducing today.\n  Our plan aims to fix a critical link in this ``tech talent'' gap, \nundergraduate education in science, math, engineering, and technology. \nIt would create a new competitive grant program within the National \nScience Foundation that would encourage institutions of higher \nlearning, from universities to community colleges, to increase the \nnumber of graduates in these disciplines.\n  This is not another scholarship program, but a targeted, results-\ndriven initiative that goes straight to the gatekeepers. We're not \nasking them to change their admissions policies, but, in effect, to \ndesign new ``e-missions'' policies. Come up with effective ideas, and \nwe will provide the dollars to make them work.\n  For example, institutions could propose to add or strengthen the \ninterdisciplinary components of undergraduate science education. Or \nthey could establish targeted support programs for women and \nminorities, who are 54 percent of our total workforce, but only 22 \npercent of scientists and engineers, to increase enrollment in these \nfields. Or they could partner with local technology companies to \nprovide summer industry internships for ongoing research experience.\n  The pilot program is authorized at $25 million for Fiscal Year 2002, \nbut our bipartisan coalition hopes the level will rise over the next \nseveral years to approximately $200 million annually, based upon pilot \nprogram results. With that kind of seed money, we're optimistic \nthousands of promising new scientists and engineers will soon bloom.\n  We realize that solving the undergraduate problem is not going to \nsinglehandedly close our talent gap. We must also dramatically reform \nour K-12 public education system, through innovative initiatives such \nas Congressman Boehlert's math and science partnerships bill, and \nstrengthen our national investment in R But it is a vitally \nimportant piece of the productivity puzzle.\n  For evidence of that, just look at the collection of letters of \nsupport we have received from industry, academia, and professional \norganizations, including letters from TechNet, a national network of \nCEOs and senior executives from the leading technology and \nbiotechnology companies; the National Alliance of Business; and STANCO \n25 Professor of Economics at Stanford University, Paul Romer, a leading\n\n[[Page S10704]]\n\ngrowth economist, whose pioneering research underscores the long-term \ntalent crisis facing our Nation, and who helped us think through this \nbill.\n  These industry, academic, and educational leaders recognize as do we, \nthat in our knowledge-based economy, we must have people who know what \nthey're doing, and that is why they have made this problem and our \nlegislation a top priority. We are grateful for their knowledge and \ntheir support, and we look forward to working with them to better \nharvest the enormous potential of America's workforce.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support for the Tech Talent \nbill, from the following organizations and individuals, be printed in \nthe Record: TechNet, Professor Paul Romer, National Alliance of \nBusiness, Semiconductor Industry Association, American Astronomical \nSociety, K-12 Science, Mathematics, Engineering & Technology Coalition, \nGeneral Electric, American Association of State Colleges and \nUniversities, and the American Society for Engineering Education.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                      TechNet,\n\n                                   Palo Alto, CA, October 8, 2001.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     Hon. Christopher S. ``Kit'' Bond,\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     Hon. Sherwood Boehlert,\n     Hon. John B. Larson.\n       Dear Senators Lieberman, Frist, Mikulski, Bond, and \n     Domenici, and Representatives Boehlert, and Larson: On behalf \n     of TechNet's 250 technology industry executives, we are \n     writing to lend our strong endorsement and support for your \n     legislation to increase the technically trained workforce in \n     the United States: the Tech Talent Bill. TechNet considers \n     the lack of a highly skilled American workforce a serious \n     threat to our nation's future economic and technology growth.\n       Recent economic studies have shown that technological \n     progress accounts for more then half of the U.S. economic \n     growth in the post-war period. Correspondingly, a workforce \n     highly trained in science, mathematics, engineering and \n     technology (SMET) is fundamental to our nation's ability to \n     remain competitive. Yet despite predictions that the number \n     of jobs requiring technical skills will grow by 51% over the \n     next decade, from the late 80's to the late 90's the number \n     of earned bachelor's degrees has decreased by 18% in \n     engineering and by 36% in math and computer science.\n       We commend you for taking the lead with a bold and \n     innovative approach to reverse this perilous trend. The Tech \n     Talent bill would authorize funding for the National Science \n     Foundation (NSF) to distribute grants to colleges and \n     universities that agree to specific increases in the number \n     of students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents \n     obtaining degrees in science, math, engineering and \n     technology. The NSF would solicit and competitively award \n     grants, based on a peer-review evaluation, to proposals from \n     colleges and universities with promising and innovative \n     programs to increase the number of graduates in the specified \n     disciplines.\n       A well-prepared workforce coupled with a strong emphasis on \n     R is the only way to ensure a healthier, economically \n     solid, and technologically advanced future for America. We \n     appreciate your steadfast support of policies toward this \n     end, and we urge you to press forward with this legislation \n     in both chambers. Please let us know how we can best support \n     a swift passage of the Tech Talent bill.

Since the end of the 19th century, \n     people trained in these areas have turned scientific \n     opportunity into technological progress. With their help, we \n     harnessed the twin engines of the market and technology. \n     Together, these engines powered the United States into our \n     current position of unchallenged worldwide political and \n     economic leadership.\n       Unfortunately, success breeds complacency. In recent \n     decades, our achievements in undergraduate science education \n     have fallen behind those in many other countries.\n       In the domain of the market, our government fostered growth \n     by doing less. It stood aside and gave people the freedom to \n     start new ventures, introduce new products, and improve on \n     old ways of doing things. By contrast, in the domain of \n     technology, our government fostered growth by doing more, but \n     in a way that supported market competition. The Morrill Acts \n     of 1862 and 1890 created a new type of university, one \n     committed not to an elite study of art or science for its own \n     sake. Instead, these new institutions emphasized the \n     practical application of knowledge. They offered instruction \n     in the ``agricultural and mechanic arts'' and the various \n     branches of science, with ``special reference to their \n     application in the industries of life.'' The land grant \n     universities created and supported by these acts helped many \n     more farmers and miners, tinkerers and inventors, \n     entrepreneurs and managers, engineers and researchers compete \n     in the market by developing new technologies or applying \n     technologies developed by others.\n       Since World War II, the federal government has wisely \n     increased its support for basic research by current \n     university professors and graduate training of future \n     professors. Unfortunately, this support seems to have come at \n     the expense of our early commitment to undergraduate \n     education in science and engineering. At the beginning of the \n     20th century, this commitment put us far ahead of the rest of \n     the world. At the beginning of the 21st century, we lag \n     behind many other countries according to such basic measures \n     as the fraction of all 24-year-olds who receive an \n     undergraduate degree in engineering or the natural sciences.\n       Your bill can begin our return to worldwide leadership in \n     undergraduate science and engineering education. It will \n     reward colleges and universities that devote more effort to \n     teaching, that develop innovative instructional materials, \n     that pull students into science instead of ``weeding them \n     out.''\n       If we can increase the number of undergraduates who receive \n     science and engineering degrees our companies will have more \n     highly skilled workers. Our schools will have more math and \n     science teachers. Our Ph.D.\n\n[[Page S10705]]\n\n     programs will have more qualified applicants. Our economy \n     will grow faster and our nation will be stronger.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Paul M. Romer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  October 5, 2001.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: We commend you for your leadership \n     in sponsoring the Technology Talent bill. This bill focuses \n     attention on an important workforce issue for business and \n     for America's growing knowledge-based economy--the need to \n     increase the number of U.S. students graduating with degrees \n     in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology from the \n     nation's universities and community colleges.\n       American businesses face a constant challenge to find \n     sufficient numbers of professionals with proficiency in these \n     key disciplines. The number of students graduating with \n     degrees in these fields has both failed to keep pace with an \n     ever-increasing demand, and actually declined. Since 1990, \n     for example the number of bachelor degrees in electrical \n     engineering awarded at U.S. universities has declined 37 \n     percent. We must address this need if the United States is to \n     maintain its economic and technological leadership.\n       The demonstration grant program established by the Tech \n     Talent bill will provide new incentives for universities, \n     colleges, and community colleges to increase the number of \n     graduates with bachelor and associate degrees in science, \n     mathematics, engineering and technology. The bill also will \n     encourage mentoring, bridge programs from secondary to \n     postsecondary education, and creative approaches for \n     traditionally underrepresented groups to earn degrees in \n     these disciplines.\n       We look forward to working with you and your colleagues to \n     secure enactment of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n         3M Company; AeA.; AT Business-Higher Education Forum; \n           Compaq Computer Corporation; IBM Corporation; \n           Information Technology Association of America; Intel \n           Corporation; Minority Business RoundTable; Motorola; \n           National Alliance of Business; National Venture Capital \n           Association; Northern Virginia Technology Council; \n           SchoolTone Alliance; Semiconductor Industry \n           Association; Software and Information Industry \n           Association; TechNet; Texas Instruments; Verizon; and \n           Williams.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                          SIA,\n\n                                    San Jose, CA, October 3, 2001.\n     Re Tech Talent Act.\n\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: The Semiconductor Industry \n     Association applauds your introduction of the Technology \n     Talent Act as an important action to expand the technically \n     trained workforce in the United States.\n       Over the next five to fifteen years, the semiconductor \n     manufacturing process that the industry has used for the past \n     thirty years will have reached its physical limits. It will \n     take significant investments to develop the human resources \n     necessary to develop replacement processes and electronic \n     device structures. Absent these investments, the continued \n     productivity gains that our economy has enjoyed from \n     information technology advances will be lost.\n       The demonstration program established by the Tech Talent \n     bill will provide incentive for universities, colleges and \n     community colleges to increase the number of graduates with \n     bachelors and associates' degrees in science, mathematics, \n     engineering and technology. We are pleased that the bill \n     encourages mentoring programs, bridge programs and other \n     innovative approaches to helping increase the number of U.S. \n     students graduating with degrees in these disciplines. That \n     should not only help to increase the supply by retaining more \n     of the students who are already enrolled, but also help \n     attract more students from traditionally under-represented \n     groups to pursue careers in our industry and other high tech \n     sectors.\n       We look forward to working with you and your colleagues to \n     help ensure the legislation's swift and favorable \n     consideration. Thank you again for your leadership on this \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   George Scalise,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                          AAS,\n\n                                 Pasadena, CA, September 10, 2001.\n     Re Tech Talent Bill.\n\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: I am writing to thank you and your \n     colleagues for introducing the ``Tech Talent Bill''. I will \n     work to support this legislation as it moves through \n     Congress.\n       As you know, the decline in our technical workforce is \n     negatively affecting our national economy and worldwide \n     competitiveness. The American Institute of Physics (AIP) has \n     tracked the number of students earning doctorates from U.S. \n     institutions in the physical sciences since 1962. Today, \n     roughly 1,350 doctorates are awarded each year. In 1970, this \n     number was nearly 1,600. Although this statistic does \n     fluctuate from year to year, it has steadily declined over \n     the last several years, dropping 11% between 1994 and 1998. \n     Additionally, the fraction of foreign students earning \n     doctorates has increased dramatically. According to AIP \n     statistics, 46% of physics doctorates are foreign nationals.\n       The Administrator of NASA, Dan Goldin, highlighted this \n     problem in a recent article in the Atlantic magazine \n     (September 2001). In this article, he points out that due to \n     the small number of qualified engineers and physical \n     scientists, design, construction and operation of space \n     probes is becoming difficult. Although not for certain, he \n     suggests that this shortage may have played a role in the \n     recent failures of the Mars Polar Lander and Mars Climate \n     Orbiter. According to Mr. Goldin, nearly as many students \n     earn undergraduate degrees in parks, recreation and leisure \n     as earn degrees in electrical engineering. This is a shocking \n     fact for a Nation built on technology and science.\n       By motivating universities to increase the number of \n     students earning physical science degrees, this legislation \n     will have a direct impact on this problem. I strongly support \n     the ``Tech Talent Bill'' and hope to work with you to ensure \n     its passage in this Congressional term.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Anneila Sargent,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         K-12 Science, Mathematics, Engineering & Technology \n           Education Coalition,\n                                                 October 15, 2001.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: The K-12 Science, Mathematics, \n     Engineering, and Technology Education Coalition commends you \n     and Senators Frist, Mikulski, and Bond for introducing the \n     ``Tech Talent'' bill, designed to increase the United States' \n     technically trained workforce. It is imperative to develop a \n     highly skilled workforce to maintain our national security \n     and foster future economic growth. We believe that the \n     journey begins before college.\n       We are pleased that your legislation encourages \n     universities to partner with community colleges, industry \n     organizations, professional societies and local schools to \n     pave the way for students of all ages and backgrounds to \n     further their interests in science, mathematics, engineering \n     and technology (SMET) coursework and career paths.\n       In October of this year, the deans of engineering and the \n     deans of education from 50 universities met in concert to \n     develop strategic collaborations to enhance K-12 teacher \n     preparation in SMET and to invigorate engineering education. \n     Collaborations of this type can and should be replicated by \n     more universities and across all science, mathematics, \n     engineering, and technological disciplines.\n       This bill will assist in the development and implementation \n     of innovative approaches to increasing enrollments and \n     graduates in key SMET degrees, which is critical to our \n     economy, our national security, and the future job prospects \n     of our children. Providing incentives and rewards to \n     educational institutions for increasing SMET enrollments and \n     graduates is an excellent approach to jumpstart that process.\n       We applaud your dedication and foresight in protecting and \n     enhancing America's future workforce.\n       If we can be of further assistance, please contact Patti \n     Burgio at 202.785.7385.\n                                  ____\n\n         GE Corporate Research & Development, The General Electric \n           Company,\n                                                 October 12, 2001.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: The General Electric Company highly \n     commends you, along with Senators Bond, Mikulski, Frist, and \n     Domenici and Representatives Boehlert and Larson, for \n     introducing the ``Tech Talent'' bill. We fully endorse and \n     support the revival of a highly technical workforce in the \n     United States.\n       While our company embraces technical expertise from around \n     the globe, we believe it is vital to our nation's long-term \n     economic strength to grow and develop our domestic talent as \n     well. This legislation will create that strength without \n     discriminating against global technical talent.\n       We applaud your approach to creating a grant program that \n     itself inspires colleges and universities to take a creative \n     and innovative approach to broadening science, mathematics, \n     engineering and technology enrollment. We believe that this \n     approach will not result in a one-time spike in enrollment, \n     instead it enables a fundamental change in philosophy for a \n     long-term increase in technical education.\n       There is no better time for this legislation. Our nation's \n     economy is heavily dependent on a highly skilled workforce, \n     with more than 50 percent of our economic growth stemming \n     from technological progress. We look forward to assisting you \n     in any way possible with this legislation. Thank you for your \n     continued support of technology and innovation initiatives in \n     America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Scott C. Donnelly,\n                                            Senior Vice President.\n\n[[Page S10706]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                              State Colleges and Universities,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 12, 2001.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: On behalf of the American \n     Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU) I am \n     writing to express our strong support for the, ``Technology \n     Talent Act of 2001.'' AASCU is comprised of more than 430 \n     public colleges, universities and systems of public higher \n     education located throughout the United States and its \n     territories. Our Connecticut members include: Central \n     Connecticut State University, Eastern Connecticut State \n     University, Southern Connecticut State University, Western \n     Connecticut State University and the Connecticut State \n     University System.\n       AASCU truly appreciates your leadership in recognizing the \n     need to increase the nation's technically trained workforce, \n     as well as your commitment to address this need by \n     introducing legislation that will, if adequately funded, go a \n     long way towards achieving this goal. AASCU strongly supports \n     the legislation's requirement that at least one principal \n     investigator be in a position of administrative leadership at \n     the institution of higher education. This requirement will \n     ensure that the commitment for increasing the number of \n     bachelor's degrees will be institution wide. Additionally, we \n     believe the legislation's priority to award grants to \n     institutions that draw on previous and existing efforts in \n     improving undergraduate learning and teaching is right on \n     target.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership on this issue. We look \n     forward to working with you as the ``Technology Talent Act of \n     2001'' progresses through the legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Edward M. Elmendorf,\n\n                                     Vice President for Government\n     Relations and Policy Analysis.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              American Society for\n\n\n                                        Engineering Education,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 12, 2001.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: On behalf of the members of the \n     Engineering Deans Council (EDC) of the American Society for \n     Engineering Education (ASEE), we are writing to thank you for \n     introducing the Tech Talent bill, which is intended to \n     increase the technically trained workforce of our nation. Now \n     more than ever it is important for Americans to focus on \n     strengthening and increasing the science and technology \n     workforce of the United States.\n       Engineering schools have a major role to play in efforts to \n     expand the nation's technical workforce. We are very \n     interested in examining the provisions of the competitive \n     grant program to be established at the National Science \n     Foundation. Those that are intended to increase the number of \n     U.S. citizens or permanent residents obtaining degrees in \n     science, mathematics, engineering or technology (SMET) can be \n     helpful to all of us in engineering education. The incentives \n     to degree-granting institutions to encourage creative ways of \n     recruiting students who may not earlier have felt they could \n     succeed in these fields will insure innovative, aggressive \n     program proposal submissions. We are glad to see that strong \n     emphasis will be placed on an evaluation of methods employed \n     in the grant activities.\n       This legislation will provide an opportunity to build on \n     the activities that many of our colleges have underway, \n     including mentoring high school students and engaging them in \n     other activities designed to interest them in enrolling in \n     SMET programs. Earlier this year we held the first \n     Engineering Deans Council panel discussion on opportunities \n     for collaboration between engineering and education schools. \n     At the beginning of October pairs of deans of engineering and \n     deans of education met for the ``Deans Summit'' in Baltimore. \n     The purpose of this conference was to stimulate these deans \n     to develop collaborations, which would result in programs to \n     improve the quality of preparation of students for SMET \n     careers. As participants in the Deans Summit, we can testify \n     that many innovative programs were developed by pairs of \n     deans from the institutions represented. We think this \n     legislation will be very helpful to these collaborations. \n     Many of the institutions will be very eager to develop \n     proposals in response to its provisions. The incentives \n     provided in this bill will certainly attract attention, and \n     we think will achieve the purpose of increasing enrollments \n     as well as improve the quality of preparation.\n       The Engineering Deans Council of the American Society for \n     Engineering Education (ASEE) is the leadership organization \n     of the more than 300 deans of engineering in the United \n     States. Founded in 1893, ASEE is a nonprofit association \n     dedicated to the improvement of engineering and engineering \n     technology education.\n       We greatly appreciate your strong and continuing interest \n     in and support for the development of our nation's scientific \n     and technical workforce. If we can be of further assistance, \n     please do not hesitate to get in touch with us.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl E. Locke, Jr.,\n       Dean of Engineering, University of Kansas-Lawrence, Chair, \n     Engineering Deans Council.\n     David N. Wormley,\n       Dean of Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, Vice \n     Chair, Engineering Deans Council.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Lieberman, \nMikulski, Bond and Domenici in introducing the Tech Talent bill. This \nlegislation will build on and compliment legislation I introduced \nearlier this year, the Math and Science Partnership Act.\n  Today, we are talking about college math and science majors and their \nrole in our economic and scientific future. But, precollege science and \nmath instruction has an important relationship to the future supply of \nU.S. scientific and technological personnel as well. For example, \nstudents who take rigorous mathematics and science courses in high \nschool are much more likely to go on to college than those who do not.\n  Data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study reveal that 83 \npercent of students who took algebra I and geometry, and nearly 89 \npercent of students who took chemistry, went on to college, compared to \nonly 36 percent of students who did not take algebra and geometry and \n43 percent of students who did not take chemistry. Yet 31 percent of \nour college bound high school seniors did not take four years or more \nof mathematics, and 51 percent of college bound high school seniors did \nnot take four years or more of science.\n  There is another link between precollege and college math and science \ninstruction: before you can major in science or math in college, you \nmust have a strong understanding of the basics. Yet, the most recent \nNAEP science assessments showed that only approximately one-third of \nour 4th, 8th and 12th grade students were performing at the basic \nlevel. And only 3 percent of the students at all three grade levels \nreached the advanced level of scientific proficiency.\n  The Math and Science Partnership program, which is now part of the \neducation reform bill, authorizes $900 million in 2002 to enhance K-12 \nmath and science education. It will help more of our children learn the \nbasics of math and science and encourage more of them to go to college.\n  The Tech Talent Bill will make sure that once they get to college, \nthey are encouraged to complete the loop: major in science, engineering \nor computer science so that we can fill the high tech jobs that are \nfundamental to our nation's future prosperity and to our ability to \nremain competitive in an increasingly global marketplace.\n  The Tech Talent Bill rewards colleges and universities that increase \nthe number of math and science majors that graduate. And the bill lets \nthe universities figure out the best way to do so. It will not stifle \ncreativity. Our economy needs a workforce highly trained in science, \nmathematics, engineering and technology, and that is why I believe this \nbill is very important, and should be a top priority.\n  I am proud to support this bill, and I commend Senator Lieberman for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, innovation drives a significant part of \nour domestic economy; it's absolutely vital in maintaining our standard \nof living. Estimates are that at least half of our economic growth in \nthe post-WWII period was driven by advanced technologies.\n  Innovation is especially critical today at a time when our economy \nhas shown significant weaknesses. We need to continue to look toward \nour ability to innovate, to bring new products and processes to the \nmarket place, to help spur recovery.\n  Innovation depends on many factors, ranging from the research done in \nour superb universities and laboratories to the flow of capital \ninvestments into entrepreneurial start-up companies. One of the very \nkey factors is the existence of a well qualified workforce, ready to \nsupport high technology industries. Increasingly, preparation of that \nworkforce is at risk in the United States, this should be cause for \ngreat concern.\n  That's why I welcome this opportunity to join with Senators \nLieberman, Bond, Mikulski, and Frist, as well as with Congressmen \nBoehlert and Larson, to provide my support as an original co-sponsor of \nthe\n\n[[Page S10707]]\n\nTech Talent Bill. This bill can help to reverse disturbing trends in \nthe technical credentials of our future workforce.\n  Studies show that the number of jobs requiring technical training \nwill increase by 51 percent over the next decade. Six million new \ntechnical openings are projected to be needed by 2008. But the trend is \nexactly the opposite, our number of bachelor's degrees has dropped 21 \npercent in engineering and 32 percent in math and computer science over \nthe last decade.\n  In the last few years, we've filled many technical positions with \nforeign workers, and we've heard repeated cries from our high tech \nindustries about their need for larger visa programs to allow these \nworkers to enter the country. In addition, increasing numbers of our \nundergraduate and graduate students are citizens of another country.\n  Frequently, both foreign students who have completed technical \nstudies in the United States and foreign technical workers admitted \nunder special visas return to their native lands. That fuels a \ncontinuing outflow of technical expertise from our country.\n  That's good for other countries, who are striving to build up their \ntechnical capabilities, but it sure isn't good for the United States. \nThe trend is ominous. In 1985, we led most countries in the number of \nresearch personnel as a percent of our workforce. In 1998, we were well \nbehind countries like Japan.\n  This trend is even worse if we look at young technical workers, \nbecause much of our strength is from older workers from past years when \ntechnical education was more popular here. If we look at the fraction \nof 24 year-old workers with technical training, the U.S. lags behind \nmany countries including Japan, Korea, Germany, Ireland, Canada, France \nand the United Kingdom.\n  This problem is even more evident if we look at the fraction of \nbachelor-level degrees awarded in science and engineering. In the \nUnited States, the figure is about one-third. But in China, our one-\nthird is replaced by their 72 percent, and Japan, Russia and Brazil \nexceed 60 percent. In all of Asia, 47 percent of all degrees are in \nscience and engineering. It's even worse if we focus on engineering, \nwhere 5 percent of our bachelor's degrees are awarded. In China, that \nfigure is 46 percent. And that figure is 30 or more percent in \ncountries like Germany, Russia, Singapore, and Finland, and over 20 \npercent in many countries including Japan, France and Sweden.\n  Traditionally, the United States has led the world in patents. But if \nwe look at the growth in patenting in the U.S. and elsewhere, the trend \nis serious. Countries like Japan have higher growth rates in patenting \nthen we do.\n  I already noted the importance of innovation in driving our economic \ngrowth. We don't compete well in the international marketplace on \nmanufacture of low-tech goods. In fact, where a product has been on the \nmarket for awhile, other countries tend to capture the manufacturing \nmarket. That's why it's so critical that we maintain a strong flow of \ninnovative products it's in the newest, highest technology, products \nthat we are most competitive.\n  We can't afford to maintain some of the current trends. We were \ngraduating about 18,000 students a year with bachelor's degrees in the \nphysical sciences in the 1970s, today that figure is around 15,000. As \nanother bad example, our graduates in mathematics have fallen to about \nhalf the 25,000 graduates per year in the 1970s.\n  We need to reverse these trends. We need to excite more students to \npursue technical careers. We need to do far better at showing students \nthe opportunities that can open for them if they pursue technical paths \nin their education.\n  This bill will help in this quest. By providing grants to schools and \ncommunity colleges to increase their production of technical workers, \nwe are providing direct motivation to the schools which have a \nsignificant hand in guiding students into various fields. These grants \nwill serve to challenge schools to find better, more convincing, \napproaches to encourage student behavior.\n  It was particularly important to me that this bill offer these \nincentives at the community college level. Students are increasingly \nfinding that these institutions offer the best match to their \neducational needs. It will be at the community college level that we \ncan excite many new students who might have chosen other specialities.\n  Reversing the trends I've described won't happen overnight, it will \ntake many years. But the future benefits to our your people and to our \nnation are immense. I'm pleased to join the co-sponsors of this \nimportant bill in seeking to address this very real issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/15/senate-section/article/S10707-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1902.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The safety and security of the civil air transportation \n     system is critical to the United States' security and its \n     national defense.\n       (2) A safe and secure United States civil air \n     transportation system is essential to the basic freedom of \n     Americans to move in intrastate, interstate, and \n     international transportation.\n       (3) The terrorist hijackings and crashes of passenger \n     aircraft on September 11, 2001, converting civil aircraft \n     into guided bombs for strikes against civilian and military \n     targets requires the United States to change fundamentally \n     the way it approaches the task of ensuring the safety and \n     security of the civil air transportation system.\n       (4) The existing fragmentation of responsibility for that \n     safety and security among government agencies and between \n     government and nongovernment entities is inefficient and \n     unacceptable in light of the hijackings and crashes on \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (5) The General Accounting Office has recommended that \n     security functions and security personnel at United States \n     airports should become a Federal government responsibility.\n       (6) Although the number of Federal air marshals is \n     classified, their presence on both international and domestic \n     flights would have a deterrent effect on hijacking and would \n     further bolster public confidence in the safety of air \n     travel.\n       (7) The effectiveness of existing security measures, \n     including employee background checks and passenger pre-\n     screening, is impaired because of the inaccessibility of, or \n     the failure to share information among, data bases maintained \n     by different Federal and international agencies for criminal \n     behavior or pertinent intelligence information.\n\n     SEC. 102.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) money laundering, estimated by the International \n     Monetary Fund to amount to between 2 and 5 percent of global \n     gross domestic product, which is at least $600,000,000,000 \n     annually, provides the financial fuel that permits \n     transnational criminal enterprises to conduct and expand \n     their operations to the detriment of the safety and security \n     of American citizens;\n       (2) money laundering, and the defects in financial \n     transparency on which money launderers rely, are critical to \n     the financing of global terrorism and the provision of funds \n     for terrorist attacks;\n       (3) money launderers subvert legitimate financial \n     mechanisms and banking relationships by using them as \n     protective covering for the movement of criminal proceeds and \n     the financing of crime and terrorism, and, by so doing, can \n     threaten the safety of United States citizens and undermine \n     the integrity of United States financial institutions and of \n     the global financial and trading systems upon which \n     prosperity and growth depend;\n       (4) certain jurisdictions outside of the United States that \n     offer ``offshore'' banking and related facilities designed to \n     provide anonymity, coupled with special tax advantages and \n     weak financial supervisory and enforcement regimes, provide \n     essential tools to disguise ownership and movement of \n     criminal funds, derived from, or used to commit, offenses \n     ranging from narcotics trafficking, terrorism, arms \n     smuggling, and trafficking in human beings, to financial \n     frauds that prey on law-abiding citizens;\n       (5) transactions involving such offshore jurisdictions make \n     it difficult for law enforcement officials and regulators to \n     follow the trail of money earned by criminals, organized \n     international criminal enterprises, and global terrorist \n     organizations;\n       (6) correspondent banking facilities are one of the banking \n     mechanisms susceptible in some circumstances to manipulation \n     by foreign banks to permit the laundering of funds by hiding \n     the identity of real parties in interest to financial \n     transactions;\n       (7) private banking services can be susceptible to \n     manipulation by money launderers, for example corrupt foreign \n     government officials, particularly if those services include \n     the creation of offshore accounts and facilities for large \n     personal funds transfers to channel funds into accounts \n     around the globe;\n       (8) United States anti-money laundering efforts are impeded \n     by outmoded and inadequate statutory provisions that make \n     investigations, prosecutions, and forfeitures more difficult, \n     particularly in cases in which money laundering involves \n     foreign persons, foreign banks, or foreign countries;\n       (9) the ability to mount effective counter-measures to \n     international money launderers requires national, as well as \n     bilateral and multilateral action, using tools specially \n     designed for that effort; and\n       (10) the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and \n     Supervisory Practices and the Financial Action Task Force on \n     Money Laundering, of both of which the United States is a \n     member, have each adopted international anti-money laundering \n     principles and recommendations.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to increase the strength of United States measures to \n     prevent, detect, and prosecute international money laundering \n     and the financing of terrorism;\n       (2) to ensure that--\n       (A) banking transactions and financial relationships and \n     the conduct of such transactions and relationships, do not \n     contravene the purposes of subchapter II of chapter 53 of \n     title 31, United States Code, section 21 of the Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Act, or chapter 2 of title I of Public Law \n     91-508 (84 Stat. 1116), or facilitate the evasion of any such \n     provision; and\n       (B) the purposes of such provisions of law continue to be \n     fulfilled, and that such provisions of law are effectively \n     and efficiently administered;\n       (3) to strengthen the provisions put into place by the \n     Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. 981 note), \n     especially with respect to crimes by non-United States \n     nationals and foreign financial institutions;\n       (4) to provide a clear national mandate for subjecting to \n     special scrutiny those foreign jurisdictions, financial \n     institutions operating outside of the United States, and \n     classes of international transactions that pose particular, \n     identifiable opportunities for criminal abuse;\n       (5) to provide the Secretary of the Treasury (in this title \n     referred to as the ``Secretary'') with broad discretion, \n     subject to the safeguards provided by the Administrative \n     Procedures Act under title 5, United States Code, to take \n     measures tailored to the particular money laundering problems\n\n[[Page S10724]]\n\n     presented by specific foreign jurisdictions, financial \n     institutions operating outside of the United States, and \n     classes of international transactions;\n       (6) to ensure that the employment of such measures by the \n     Secretary permits appropriate opportunity for comment by \n     affected financial institutions;\n       (7) to provide guidance to domestic financial institutions \n     on particular foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions \n     operating outside of the United States, and classes of \n     international transactions that are of primary money \n     laundering concern to the United States Government;\n       (8) to ensure that the forfeiture of any assets in \n     connection with the anti-terrorist efforts of the United \n     States permits for adequate challenge consistent with \n     providing due process rights;\n       (9) to clarify the terms of the safe harbor from civil \n     liability for filing suspicious activity reports;\n       (10) to strengthen the authority of the Secretary to issue \n     and administer geographic targeting orders, and to clarify \n     that violations of such orders or any other requirement \n     imposed under the authority contained in chapter 2 of title I \n     of Public Law 91-508 and subchapters II and III of chapter 53 \n     of title 31, United States Code, may result in criminal and \n     civil penalties;\n       (11) to ensure that all appropriate elements of the \n     financial services industry are subject to appropriate \n     requirements to report potential money laundering \n     transactions to proper authorities, and that jurisdictional \n     disputes do not hinder examination of compliance by financial \n     institutions with relevant reporting requirements;\n       (12) to fix responsibility for high level coordination of \n     the anti-money laundering efforts of the Department of the \n     Treasury;\n       (13) to strengthen the ability of financial institutions to \n     maintain the integrity of their employee population; and\n       (14) to strengthen measures to prevent the use of the \n     United States financial system for personal gain by corrupt \n     foreign officials and to facilitate the repatriation of any \n     stolen assets to the citizens of countries to whom such \n     assets belong.\n\n     SEC. 303. 4-YEAR CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW-EXPEDITED \n                   CONSIDERATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Effective on and after the first day of \n     fiscal year 2005, the provisions of this title and the \n     amendments made by this title shall terminate if the Congress \n     enacts a joint resolution, the text after the resolving \n     clause of which is as follows: ``That provisions of the \n     International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist \n     Financing Act of 2001, and the amendments made thereby, shall \n     no longer have the force of law.''.\n       (b) Expedited Consideration.--Any joint resolution \n     submitted pursuant to this section shall be considered in the \n     Senate in accordance with the provisions of section 601(b) of \n     the International Security Assistance and Arms Control Act of \n     1976.

BULK CASH SMUGGLING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) effective enforcement of the currency reporting \n     requirements of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code \n     (commonly referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act), and the \n     regulations promulgated thereunder, has forced drug dealers \n     and other criminals engaged in cash-based businesses to avoid \n     using traditional financial institutions;\n       (2) in their effort to avoid using traditional financial \n     institutions, drug dealers, and other criminals are forced to \n     move large quantities of currency in bulk form to and through \n     the airports, border crossings, and other ports of entry \n     where it can be smuggled out of the United States and placed \n     in a foreign financial institution or sold on the black \n     market;\n       (3) the transportation and smuggling of cash in bulk form \n     may, at the time of enactment of this Act, be the most common \n     form of money laundering, and the movement of large sums of \n     cash is one of the most reliable warning signs of drug \n     trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, racketeering, tax \n     evasion, and similar crimes;\n       (4) the intentional transportation into or out of the \n     United States of large amounts of currency or monetary \n     instruments, in a manner designed to circumvent the mandatory \n     reporting provisions of chapter 53 of title 31, United States \n     Code, is the equivalent of, and creates the same harm as, the \n     smuggling of goods;\n       (5) the arrest and prosecution of bulk cash smugglers is an \n     important part of law enforcement's effort to stop the \n     laundering of criminal proceeds, but the couriers who attempt \n     to smuggle the cash out of the United States are typically \n     low-level employees of large criminal organizations, and are \n     easily replaced, and therefore only the confiscation of the \n     smuggled bulk cash can effectively break the cycle of \n     criminal activity of which the laundering of bulk cash is a \n     critical part;\n       (6) the penalties for violations of the currency reporting \n     requirements of the chapter 53 of title 31, United States \n     Code, are insufficient to provide a deterrent to the \n     laundering of criminal proceeds;\n       (7) because the only criminal violation under Federal law \n     before the date of enactment of this Act was a reporting \n     offense, the law does not adequately provide for the \n     confiscation of smuggled currency; and\n       (8) if the smuggling of bulk cash were itself an offense, \n     the cash could be confiscated as the corpus delicti of the \n     smuggling offense.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (1) to make the act of smuggling bulk cash itself a \n     criminal offense;\n       (2) to authorize forfeiture of any cash or instruments of \n     the smuggling offense;\n\n[[Page S10732]]\n\n       (3) to emphasize the seriousness of the act of bulk cash \n     smuggling; and\n       (4) to prescribe guidelines for determining the amount of \n     property subject to such forfeiture in various situations.\n       (c) Bulk Cash Smuggling Offense.--\n       (1) In general.--Subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec. 5331.
