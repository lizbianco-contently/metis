This week, as we prepare for the Fourth of July celebration, we \nremember that freedom cost the signers of the Declaration of \nIndependence a great deal. On that hallowed document, 56 men placed \ntheir names beneath the declaration and pledged their lives, their \nfortunes, and their sacred honor. And they did, indeed, pay the price \nfor freedom.\n  Of the 56 men, few were long in service: Five were captured and \ntortured before they died; twelve had their homes ransacked, looted, \noccupied by the enemy, or burned; two lost their sons in the Army; one \nhad two sons captured; 9 of the 56 men died during the war from its \nhardships. They served in Congress without pay and they loaned their \nmoney to fight the war and were never reimbursed.\n  Thank You, Lord, for great leaders in every generation. We are \ngrateful for the men and women of this Senate as they commit their \nlives and sacred honors for our beloved Nation and the cause of \nfreedom. ``Long may our land be bright, with freedom's holy light!'' \nAmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6049-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Jack Reed led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6049-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the period of these past weeks, a \nnumber of us have tried to report to our Senate colleagues and to the \nAmerican people about the state of education in the nation, and of our \npublic school system. We had supported and passed a very important \npiece of legislation last year called Leave No Child Behind. That was a \nbipartisan effort.\n  We take a great deal of pride in working together to achieve what I \nthink is most families' number one concern. Perhaps lurking in their \nminds are questions about terrorism, but if you go beyond that, if they \nare young couples, they are concerned about education. Perhaps if they \nare older, they are concerned about prescription drugs and the issue of \nhealth care. But the quality of education is something that is \nuniversal in terms of the concerns of families across this country.\n  Most parents want their children educated. They want their schools to \nteach. And the actions that were taken last year gave us a great \nopportunity to achieve this goal.\n  Over the period of the past weeks, we have tried to point out where \nwe are on this road toward achieving quality education. We have tried \nto go over the various aspects of the legislation.\n  Our committee is now focused on implementation, and following the \nadministration's proposal as it is drafting the rules and regulations. \nWe want to make sure they are going to be in accord with the law that \npassed. There is no reason to doubt that will be the case, but it takes \ncareful review. Our constituents want us to make sure that is the case.\n  Secondly, as we saw during the course of the debate, money in and of \nitself is not going to provide reform. But reform without resources is \nno reform at all.\n  Last year we had education reform, and we had resources. But we are \nnow in a situation, as we are looking forward to this fall--and it is \nnot that far away; many children will go back to school in August; and \nwe are almost to the 1st of July--that at the present time we have to \nask ourselves, how did we end up last year, and what can we look \nforward to this coming year in terms of our public school system?\n  This morning I would like to talk about what is happening in the \npublic school system to a very special group of children--Hispanic \nchildren--that are emerging as an enormously important force. Hispanics \nare already an important force in every aspect of American life.\n  Last week our Committee released ``Keeping the Promise: Hispanic \nEducation and America's Future.'' When we talk about the words, ``no \nchild left behind,'' we mean no child left behind. No child in any part \nof our country being left behind.\n  This excellent report, which was co-authored by the Congressional \nHispanic Caucus, and our Democratic Hispanic Education Task Force, is \nan excellent report that is available to our colleagues in the Senate \nand also to the American people, to tell us about what is happening. \nThe news is not good.\n  We are committed on our side of the aisle, and we hope we will be \njoined by others, to try and do something about it. Because if we are \ntruly going to be committed to leaving no child left behind, we do not \nwant to see Hispanic children being left behind. But that is what is \nhappening.\n  We have legislation that has the title, ``No Child Left Behind,'' but \nit is irresponsible to not live up to our commitment. Look at what is \nhappening in the schools across the country. When you look at the state \nof education, you'll find that we are leaving Hispanic children behind.\n  The fact is, we have seen, over the period of the recent years, an \nimportant growth in terms of those Hispanic children.\n  The number of Hispanic school children has grown by 61 percent since \n1990--a rate faster than any other community. If we look at the growth \nin the immigrant student population from 1970 to 1995, that population \nhas grown from 3.5 million to 8.6 million. If we look at the growth in \nlimited English proficient students, we see, again, the dramatic growth \nby 105 percent and these are children that are attending our public \nschools. So, we have seen the growth in the numbers.\n  It is interesting, a great deal of that growth has been in different \nareas of the country. We have had an over 250 percent growth in the \npopulation of Hispanic children in Arkansas, Georgia, North Carolina, \nand Tennessee; a growth of over 140 percent in Iowa, Kentucky, \nNebraska, Minnesota, Nevada, and South Carolina. Many of those school \ndistricts have not had the opportunity of developing either bilingual \nor language support programs to help these children develop their \nEnglish and other academic skills. They need help and we can't set them \nadrift.\n  As a result, we find many of these communities are not serving these \npopulation. The results are coming in, and they are enormously \ndistressing. Across the country, Hispanics--Hispanic children in the \nNation's largest Hispanic serving school districts--are trailing Anglo \nstudents in reading achievement by an average of 30 points. In math, \nthey fall behind by an average of 27 points. We also have the rather \nstartling statistics that on average across the country we are spending \n$1,000 less per student in economically disadvantaged schools than in \nschools with large concentrations of high-income students, in terms of \ninvesting in those children for education. Again, not that money is \neverything, but we're finding out that students are being shortchanged, \nnot only in terms of investment, but in terms of qualified teachers \ninstructing Hispanic students in many classrooms.\n  Those teachers who are working in some of the most difficult \ncircumstances often need training and support to help those students, \nand may not be qualified in terms of technical training. We want to \nmake sure they are going to get that training. But these are dedicated \npeople working in very difficult circumstances. The fact is, they lack \nthose kinds of professional qualifications. The number of unqualified \nteachers working with Hispanic students in predominantly minority \nschools is twice the national average.\n  We have unqualified teachers, we are not investing in these children, \nand we are seeing the results.\n  The fact is, you can say there must be other circumstances \ncontributing to it. Sure, there are circumstances. But the good news \nis, when you invest in these children, you find that they make progress \ntowards meeting high standards. We have seen examples of that. In \nMiami, the gap in math between Hispanics and Anglos has been narrowed \nby 6.7 points--faster than the progress made in the state of Florida. \nIn the most recent years Houston has narrowed their achievement gap in \nmath by 6.5 points over Texas. The gap has been narrowed very \nsignificantly in recent years, and that is because we have invested in \nthose programs, have invested in an infrastructure to serve Hispanic \nkids in those districts, and that has made a difference: extra academic \nassistance for those children; supplementary services; afterschool \nprograms; upgrading the skills of their teachers; and reducing class \nsize.\n  As a Nation, we are moving away from that. Instead of moving in the \ncorrect direction, we are moving in the wrong direction.\n  We have a responsibility here. When we look at the budget submitted \nby the administration in key areas of investment in quality teachers, \nin recruitment and professional development and retention of teachers, \nwe find there is an empty promise. We had a significant increase that \nwas worked out by the Democrats and Republicans last year, some $742 \nmillion. The increase this year is effectively zero.\n\n  We have to ask ourselves: Don't we need to invest in quality \nteachers? The answer is yes. Are there results if we do not? The answer \nis yes. How is it reflected? By the deterioration in the quality of \neducation that is reaching a major constituency.\n  We can ask: Does the administration understand what is happening out \nthere in terms of children, in terms of limited English proficient and \nimmigrant children? Last year we had an increase of $219 million in \nprograms to serve those children, empowering local communities to \nimplement proven, effective programs to help in the successful \ntransition of these children into American Society.\n  What do we have this year? Zero. Don't we take into consideration the\n\n[[Page S6051]]\n\nresults of what is happening across the country? Last year we saw a \ndownpayment. This year ``no child left behind'' ought to be a priority \ninstead of some of the tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals. That \nis the result. We have zero. We have zero in terms of the quality of \nteachers, zero in terms of helping these children move into the \neducation system.\n  This is one of the most discouraging aspects of the President's \nbudget. Let's look at the dropout rate by ethnic group. What every \neducator will tell you, if these children are 20 to 30 points behind in \nterms of a particular grade level and they slip one grade and perhaps \ntwo, you can predict, as certain as we are standing here, that child is \nready to drop out. One-third of Hispanic high school children are \nenrolled below grade level.\n  What has been happening in recent times? We find out we are not \ninvesting in these children. We are not giving them the teachers, not \ngetting the smaller class sizes. What is the result? We see a dropout \nrate by ethnic group. Over four million Hispanic immigrant children--\n800,000 migrant children. We made a commitment in that bill last year \nto help States, as many of these children are moving among the States, \nto assist the States in terms of following records and coordinating \ntheir academic efforts. Without that, we see what happens: a 44 percent \ndropout rate for the children of immigrant students.\n  Many of these are legitimate immigrants who come here whose children \nare American citizens. These are American citizens that are going to be \na part of the American dream. They are dropping out at 44 percent, \nHispanics at 28 percent, which is four times the rate of Anglo \nstudents.\n  Our leader on this issue has been the Senator from New Mexico, Jeff \nBingaman, who has made the most compelling case about trying to develop \na program to identify the dropouts, to figure out what can be done, \nmodel programs that can assist school districts.\n  Last year we had a very modest program. Unfortunately, this is one \narea where we could not get the administration to agree. We did have \ninclusion of a dropout prevention program--a very modest program of $10 \nmillion. But this year, zero. Here we go, with a 44-percent dropout \nrate, and now we see how we are going to respond to that. The \nadministration says zero. It is not important; it is not on our \nnational priorities.\n  This is going to mean, we all ought to understand, when we are out \nhere making statements and speeches about the conditions and what are \nthe tests and what others show, the challenges out there in terms of \nHispanic children, they are going to slip and fall further and further \nbehind. Unless we are going to address these issues, this promise about \nno child left behind is an empty promise.\n  I want to mention one of the most distressing and disturbing \ndevelopments we have seen with the cutbacks taking place. This is with \nregard to Los Angeles County. They are reducing their school year by 17 \ndays because they haven't got the resources to hold classes for 187,000 \nof the children just in Los Angeles County. We have the facts about \ndifferent communities that are under a similar situation, and that \nreplicates this.\n  So, Mr. President, I think this is the result of a really almost \nindifference by the administration in terms of this commitment. I see \nmy friend from Nevada who is also a key figure in the whole issue on \nthe dropout prevention. He has spoken eloquently about this. I am so \ngrateful for his work. I hope he will continue to take that interest in \nthis issue. We cannot let this continue to fester.\n  Mr. REID. May I ask a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The reason the Senator has talked about dropouts is because \nby keeping a child in school we save our society money, time, and \naggravation; is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is exactly correct, Mr. President. If we have a \ntroubled youth, for example, who is held in Massachusetts inside route \n128, it is about $80,000 a year; it is anywhere from $35,000 to $45,000 \noutside of route 128. We need to make sure we are going to have \nprograms that are going to encourage those children to stay in school, \nand work with them for supplementary services and develop programs that \ncan be helpful to parents and members of their family to keep them \nmotivated.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. May I add 10 seconds to what Senator Kennedy said. \nThis would have to be confirmed. There was a wonderful judge in \nMinnesota who said to me there is a higher correlation between high \nschool dropouts and incarceration than cigarette smoking and lung \ncancer. Just think about that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 87 percent of the people in our prison \nsystem are high school dropouts. I think that says it all.\n  We have a number of Senators in the Chamber. It is my understanding \nthe Democrats have approximately 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 12 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senator from Minnesota wishes to speak for 5 \nminutes, and the Senator from Vermont wants 10 minutes. I ask unanimous \nconsent, even though this will go over into the Republican time for a \ncouple minutes, that the Senator from Minnesota be recognized for 5 \nminutes and the Senator from Vermont be recognized for 12 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I am inconveniencing my colleague, I \nwill follow him if that is better.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. No, that is fine.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that be the order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6051-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 JUSTIN DART--AN INSPIRATION TO US ALL\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I think it is important to come to the \nfloor of the Senate today and briefly respond to the President's \nstatement of 2 days ago on the Middle East. I want to say to the \nPresident that I think his vision is very important. His statement has \na very strong beginning and a very strong end.\n  There is one gap in his statement that concerns me and about which I \nwish to discuss. The President, rightfully so, talked about the need \nfor reform and the need for democracy for the Palestinian people. He is \nquite right to put on this emphasis. Right now, what we also have to \nfocus on is how we change the environment on the ground, so that the \nelections that our President has called for actually lead to a more \nresponsible leadership. I think this is a gap in what the President \noutlined on Monday. That is to say, we might not like the result we get \nfrom the democratic elections he has called for. It could well be that \nChairman Arafat can say right now: Fine, I will be chosen, no question \nabout it. Some have suggested that Hamas might win such elections, or \neven worse.\n  From my point of view, one of the things we have to understand is \nthat none of this will work in terms of the vision the President laid \nout--two states and two peoples living peacefully, side by side with \nsecure borders. None of this will work unless the conditions on the \nground are changed so that indeed when there are elections, we see a \nresponsible leadership elected to office.\n  When I talk about the need for ``conditions on the ground'' being \nchanged, there are at least three factors, if you will. Factors: One, \npeople have to have hope. The Palestinian people have to have some \nhope. Two, there has to be a growing economy. Three, people have to be \nable to move from place to place.\n  So what I want to emphasize is, yes, when the President says the \nterror has to stop, we can all agree, and we should be strong and \nunited in making sure we\n\n[[Page S6052]]\n\nsay that on the floor of the Senate and say it in every possible way. I \nalso think it is true that all parties have to be engaged. There is a \nrole for European leadership and a role for Arab leadership.\n  Certainly, Israel and the United States have to be engaged, also. \nThat is the good part of the President's statement. I think there has \nto be active support from the U.S., the EU, and the Arab States in \nstrengthening indigenous Palestinian pressure for reform, in advancing \nthe consolidation and control of these competing militias, and \ninsisting on the transparency of government and judicial operations and \non more effective leadership. Second, we have to attend to urgent \nhumanitarian needs. Basic public services are breaking down. Power cuts \nare frequent and there are shortages in a range of products, from \nschool books to critical medical supplies. Ordinary Palestinians are \nunable to get the medical treatment they need.\n  The Palestinian economy has to be allowed to develop. We have to \nrebuild the physical infrastructure and revitalize the economy as the \nPalestinian Authority is effectively bankrupt, and any semblance of a \nmodern economy is disappearing. We need to understand that vital \nsocial, economic, and security functions have broken down. This is \nleaving an enormous vacuum. I fear that far more radical and more \nextremist groups would be eager to fill this vacuum.\n  I believe this was an important missing piece in what the President \nsaid. The conditions on the ground for the Palestinian people have to \nchange if, in fact, the democracy that we call for and the reform we \ncall for will lead to the election of what we would consider to be \nresponsible leadership. We are going to have to be very engaged in this \nprocess. Israel is going to have to step up to the plate and be very \nengaged.\n\n  Yes, we need to be clear on the need to end the terror; yes, we need \nto be clear on the need for reform; but also, yes, we need to be clear \nin calling for the sustained and vigorous engagement of key actors--the \nUnited States, Israel, moderate Arab leadership, the European Union, \nand we must be clear that the conditions on the ground change.\n  All you have to do is read the paper every day and look at the \nconditions on the ground. You see a complete lack of hope among \nPalestinians. You see people not being able to move. People have no \naccess to jobs or to schools. There is very little hope, and this is \nnot the stuff of social stability. We need to address these issues if, \nin fact, we are to be able to get this crisis back on the political \ntrack, with some sort of political process that truly might lead to an \nend to this violence.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to shift the talk now to \npollution and spend a few moments talking about homeland security in \nrelationship to that.\n  The citizens of this Nation have been hearing a lot about the war on \nterrorism. They read daily in the papers about our troops overseas. I \nthink often of our men and women overseas and pray for their safe \nreturn to their homes and families. I have the greatest respect for \nthose who serve in the national armed services. I have fond memories of \nmy time in the service myself. I learned about the world, about \ncommitment, and about service during my years in the Navy. I would not \nhave traded that time for anything.\n  There is a war on, and we all need to remember that we conduct the \nbusiness of this Nation in accordance with that reality. This war \ncontinues to be a top priority for this administration. The \nadministration indicates that we have the opportunity to protect \nhundreds of thousands and possibly tens of thousands of people by \ntaking the right steps now to root out terror. In fact, this Congress \npassed a massive supplemental appropriations bill to assist in those \nefforts. We are also debating a Defense Department authorization bill \nthat adds to that cause.\n  Here in the Capitol, we have begun debating the need for increased \nsecurity at home and the creation of a new homeland security agency. I \nfully support the President in his efforts to address these great \nchallenges, and I agree with the efforts the President has put forth \nfollowing the lead of Senator Lieberman.\n  I think this Congress should move quickly and pass legislation \ncreating the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Let us all pause for a moment and consider what we are doing.\n  Over the last few months, we have listened carefully to the \nadministration about their efforts to conduct this war both home and \nabroad. We can prevent the loss of life in the future, they say, by \ninvesting in homeland security and the war on terrorism, and I do not \ndisagree with these efforts.\n  But if homeland security is about protecting our citizens from harm \nand even death, I have a suggestion for this administration that they \nmay not like to hear.\n  I hope they are listening.\n  It has to do with public health. It will not cost the Federal \nTreasury a penny. It will save thousands of lives. It will reduce \nhospital visits. It will save consumers money.\n  What is my grand idea?\n  Well, it is not new. And it is something we can do today with long \nlasting results for every man, woman, and child in this Nation. Here it \nis. It is simple. Reduce powerplant emissions. Let me repeat that: \nReduce powerplant emissions.\n  Studies show that 30,000 Americans die every year due to powerplant \npollution--30,000 deaths from powerplant pollution alone. Incredible.\n  Let me work slow through a list of real, but depressing, statistics \non powerplant pollution.\n  Powerplant pollution results in 20,000 hospitalizations each year, \n600,000 asthma attacks, 5 million days of lost work due to pollution-\nrelated illness, and 18,000 cases of bronchitis.\n  Powerplant pollution has resulted in mercury advisories in 44 of the \n50 States. In these 44 States, our citizens are asked not to eat the \nfish caught in the lakes and streams.\n  Because of powerplant pollution, 6 million American women and \nchildren are exposed to mercury levels well above those considered safe \nby Federal health authorities.\n  According to the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n10 percent of women in the United States have mercury levels above \nthose considered protective of newborns. As a result, as many as \n390,000 children are born each year at risk for neurological \ndevelopment problems due to exposure to mercury in the womb.\n  The March issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association \nfound that millions of people who live in areas polluted by fine \nparticles have about the same increased risk of dying from heart or \nlung disease or lung cancer as people who live with a cigarette smoker. \nHere is the problem. You can ask a smoker to go outside or to quit, but \nyou cannot kick a dirty powerplant out of your backyard.\n  This is simply the beginning of my list regarding the impacts of \npowerplant pollution.\n  There is acid rain, smog, lung disease, heart disease, asthma, on and \non.\n  Actually, I would like to touch on asthma for one minute. I have a \nchart indicating what is happening because of these problems. Many of \nus know children who have contracted asthma. For asthmatics, like the \nboy in the picture beside me, it is a frustrating and dangerous \ncondition that disrupts many lives.\n  Just this year, a respected public health journal published the first \nstudy showing a direct connection between the onset of asthma in young, \nhealthy children and their exposure to ozone.\n\n[[Page S6053]]\n\nThe journal found that children exercising outdoors are more likely to \ncontract asthma if they live in areas polluted with high ozone \nconcentrations. This dangerous ozone is created by pollution from old \npower plants.\n  Just last week, the General Accounting Office issued this report \nsaying that older power plants are responsible for up to 50 percent of \nthe harmful air emissions released into the air today--50 percent from \nold power plants.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, there has been no \nchange in the average coal-fired power plant efficiency in the last 40 \nyears. Older powerplants emit about twice the amount of harmful \npollutants for every increment of electricity generated than newer \npowerplants.\n  But even some of these issues pale in comparison to the impact that \nthe release of carbon dioxide from powerplants will have if we do not \nact soon. Carbon dioxide emissions have been proven to contribute to \nclimate change, and this climate change will have a number of dramatic \nimpacts on our Nation.\n  Let me list a few. Heat-related deaths will increase 100 percent in \ncities such as New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Los Angeles, and \nothers. In most of New England, the hardwood forest will vanish. In \nDelaware, a predicted 20-inch rise in sea level will flood 50 percent \nof Delaware Bay wetlands. Brook trout nationwide may lose 50 percent of \ntheir habitat. Drought will be pervasive.\n  Coastal States, such as Alaska, will see a massive impact, including \nflooding of coastal villages, storm surges, and extensive \ninfrastructure damage from temperature change, like the melting of the \npermafrost in northern regions.\n  Even the administration's recent Climate Action Report recognizes the \ngrave impacts that climate change will have on our health, economy, and \nthe environment.\n  What are we doing about this air pollution and global warming crisis?\n  What action is this administration taking to reduce harmful emissions \nfrom old polluting powerplants?\n  What is the Environmental Protection Agency doing to save lives and \nreduce the health impacts from powerplant--related air pollution?\n  Let me tell you. Brace yourself. The answer is nothing. This \nadministration is doing absolutely nothing to reduce pollution from old \npolluting powerplants like this one in the picture.\n  Why are they doing nothing? I ask that question often, but there does \nnot seem to be an adequate answer.\n  They are doing something. Let me tell you what they are doing.\n  The administration just last week announced what could be the biggest \nroll back in the Clean Air Act in its history. The White House \nannounced a proposal to allow these old polluting powerplants to live \non forever, almost unregulated. Remember, these old powerplants are \nresponsible for 50 percent of harmful air pollution.\n  The White House, along with EPA, has decided to exempt most of these \nold powerplants from further regulation.\n  These are the same powerplants causing asthma in our Nation's \nchildren. These are the same powerplants causing neurological problems \nin newborns. These are the same plants killing our forests and lakes. \nThese are the same powerplants adding billions of tons of carbon \ndioxide to the atmosphere. And they just got a ticket to pollute \nindefinitely.\n  What else is the administration doing? They have a policy paper, \ncalled Clear Skies, that outlines a proposal to reduce three of the \nfour most harmful pollutants from old powerplants. I commend the \nPresident for directing the EPA to develop this policy paper. But what \nhave they done to follow up on the announcement of the Clear Skies \nInitiative? Nothing.\n  They have not developed legislation. They have not produced \nsupporting analysis on why their proposal works. They have not begun to \nnegotiate with Members of the Senate or the House. They have been all \nbut silent on the issue.\n  Why? Why are they letting this massive public health crisis continue? \nIt is a great mystery.\n  Congress, led by the Senate, isn't going to wait any longer. This \nweek, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will pass the \nClean Power Act.\n  The Jeffords-Collins-Lieberman-Snowe Clean Power Act sets real \npollution targets. This bill will quickly reduce the harmful air \nemissions that result in sickness and death. We want to give these old \npolluting powerplants the tools and guidance to clean up and meet \nmodern standards.\n  I hope this administration can embrace the Clean Power Act. I am \nskeptical though, that they will. Why? they argue that it will cost too \nmuch.\n  But let's look at the analysis. According to the Department of \nEnergy, a four pollutant bill could lower Americans' electric bills by \n$30 billion a year. That's $30 billion each year. The DOE report \noutlines that the longer we wait to enact real powerplant pollution \nreductions, the more expensive it will be.\n  The other reason this administration refuses to embrace real air \npollution reductions is carbon. They are scared of regulating carbon.\n  Even though the President committed to controlling carbon emissions \nfrom old powerplant, today this administration can't even discuss the \nissues. Even though the President finally acknowledged in his own \nreport this month that global warming is a real problem. Even though \nthe entire international community is working to implement the Kyoto \nTreaty to reduce carbon emissions.\n  What is this administration doing about carbon? Nothing. This doing \nnothing seems to be a pattern. I would like to ask the administration, \nhow do we get from nothing to something?\n  I will make it my full-time job to convince the White House that \nprotecting public health is equally as important as public security. \nThe facts are overwhelming, Homeland Security starts at home. It is \nabout saving lives. The greatest threat are the polluters and we can \nstop them. That is where we will get the best return on homeland \nsecurity. And I support it.\n  We can save thousands of lives, and prevent lots of disease and \nenvironmental degradation if we act now to reduce powerplant pollution.\n  I hope and pray the administration will see the light, if they can, \nthrough the smog.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow).

Madam President, I have listened carefully to the \nSenator from Vermont, and I think how ironic it is that we are at this \ntime contemplating the disposition of the nuclear industry in this \nState, a nuclear industry that does not emit pollution associated with \nair quality, an industry that supplies us with 20 to 21 percent of the \ntotal power generated in this country. We have an obligation to address \nwhat to do with the nuclear waste. The House has done its job. The \nSenate is postured to act.\n  The proposal will come up when we return from the July 4 recess. It \nis anticipated that on July 9 there will be a motion to proceed \nfollowed by 10 hours of debate. I urge my colleagues to recognize our \nresponsibility. As the Senator from Vermont suggests, the problems \nassociated with hydrocarbon pollution, of burning oil, gas, and coal, \nwe do not have with nuclear.\n  We have an obligation, though, as to what to do with the waste. As a \nconsequence, a number of sites were selected for consideration on the \neast coast and the west coast. The reality that nobody wants the waste \nis evident, but factually it has to go somewhere. The Japanese and the \nFrench are proceeding with reprocessing. Unfortunately, we have chosen \nnot to do that. I personally think that was a mistake. We should \nreprocess, and I think eventually, regardless of the disposition of \nYucca Mountain, that Yucca Mountain should be a retrievable depository. \nAt some point in time, we will take the waste and reprocess it and \nsubstantially eliminate some of the concerns, whether proliferation or \nthe long-term concerns, over any water that may go in the site.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6053-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6053-S6056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             YUCCA MOUNTAIN\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am going to talk a little this \nmorning\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\non procedures under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act for the pending \nconsideration of the joint resolution on Yucca Mountain. Yesterday, we \nhad some discussion. Following the procedures laid out in the nuclear \nWaste Act is contrary to some, who criticize that this is a break with \nSenate tradition or somehow it would set a precedent.\n  What we are doing is following the law that was established for the \ndisposition of this particular matter, giving the State of Nevada an \nopportunity for a veto, and also providing procedures for overriding \nthat process by action of both the House and the Senate. As I have \nindicated, the House has acted.\n  The expedited procedures under discussion are set forth in the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. One of the elements of the procedures \nis a specific provision that states once a resolution is on the Senate \ncalendar, it shall be in order for any Member of the Senate to move to \nproceed to the consideration of the resolution.\n  We have heard the majority leader and others suggesting the provision \nis outside the Senate rules and turns the rules on their head. That is \nsimply not true. It is the law. We are following the law.\n  I grant that the provision is unusual, but it is neither unique nor \ncontrary to Senate rules. As a matter of fact, it is part of the Senate \nrules. The entire expedited procedure was adopted as part of the rules, \nand the Senate reserved its right to change the procedure. I want to \nquote from the statute because I think it is important every Member \nunderstand we are not setting precedent.\n  The provision enacted is:\n\n       A, as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate, \n     and as such they are deemed a part of the rules of the \n     Senate, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to \n     be followed in the Senate in the case of resolutions of \n     repository siting approval, and such provisions supersede \n     other rules of the Senate only to the extent that they are \n     inconsistent with other rules.\n\n  I grant you, it sounds as if it was written by a Philadelphia lawyer, \nand it probably was:\n\n       B, with full recognition of the constitutional right of the \n     Senate to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of the Senate) at any time, in the same manner and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of the \n     Senate.\n\n  What that means is, obviously, the Senate can change its own rules. \nIt is that simple. I do not know why they did not say it that way. \nNevertheless, we have to live with what we have.\n  So let's be clear. What we are doing on procedure is following the \nrules of the Senate that were agreed to in 1982 and that have been in \nplace under both Republican and Democratic control of this body since \nthat time. These were not last-minute additions, something that just \ncame up, that was slipped into the legislative conference in the wee \nhours of the morning. The expedited procedures included, one, the \nprovision for any Member to move to the consideration of the resolution \nand, two, the provision that the procedures were adopted as an exercise \nof rulemaking in the Senate, and both were contained in the underlying \nlegislation in 1982.\n  The provisions were not necessarily novel. In fact, they were almost \nidentical to those considered in the previous Congress and that passed \nthe Senate as part of S. 2189.\n  For historical information, S. 2189 passed the Senate in the 96th \nCongress in 1980 under Democrat leadership and was sponsored primarily \nby Senators Johnston of Louisiana and Jackson of Washington.\n  When the Senate changed hands in the 97th Congress, the identical \nprovision was included in S. 1662 when it was introduced by the new \nchairman of the Energy Committee, Senator McClure of Idaho.\n  That measure was jointly referred to both the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources and the Committee on Environment and Public Works. \nBoth Committees reported the legislation favorably with substitute \namendments and both substitutes contained the same expedited procedures \nas a rulemaking of the Senate.\n  This was not a surprise. The Senate was well aware of the provisions. \nThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act was debated at length in the Senate in \n1982 and no one objected to the expedited procedures on the language \nproviding that ``any Member'' could make the motion to proceed.\n  So for those who are reflecting on the generalization somehow this \nwas an arbitrary action and not thought out, I again refer to the \nhistory of this matter as it has been presented in this body. Let's put \nthat behind us.\n  It is fair everyone understood that the language was essential to any \nconcept of a State objection, whether the State had the obligation to \ncarry the argument and obtain an affirmative vote as the authorization \ncommittees wanted or if the administration had the burden to obtain a \nJoint Resolution of approval as proposed by Congressman Moakley--\nchairman of the House Rules Committee at that time--and eventually \ncontained in the floor legislation.\n  The language was before the Senate during debate leading to the \ninitial passage in April of 1982, and again a final agreement was \nreached in December of 1982. All Members understood the heart of the \nprocess was that each House would have to vote--the House already \nvoted; now it is our obligation--and further says: and the only way to \nguarantee that was an expedited process where any Senator could make \nthe motion to proceed.\n  We will have any Senator make that motion on the 9th or thereabouts \nbut we still have not determined who that is.\n  Previously, the Senate understood the majority leader or the chairman \nmight make that motion or they may not want to carry out the mandate of \nthe statute, so it provided explicitly in the event the majority leader \nor the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction did not do so, and any \nSenator could bring this issue before the Senate. That is obviously \nwhat will happen.\n  We did it, however, with full knowledge of the Senate rules, and the \nSenate adopted it as an exercise in rulemaking.\n  Finally, the process is not the usual way, but it is part of the \nrule. Second, it is not a precedent and by its terms is limited only to \nthis resolution. Senator George Mitchell characterized in 1982 when it \nwas adopted, it was designed to eliminate any ``dilatory or \nobstructionist'' provisions.\n  Therefore, I hope we can end the rhetoric on this that somehow we are \nnot following the Senate rules, that this is some novel provision of \nwhich the Senate was not aware. I hope we can focus on the substance of \nthe joint resolution and move to its consideration as the Senate \nprovided in 1982.\n  The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, of which I have been a \nmember, former chairman, and now ranking member, has favorably reported \nthe resolution, and we have a good report that I suggest my colleagues \nread. The report filed by our chairman, Senator Bingaman, disposes of \nevery objection raised by the State of Nevada and reflects the \ncommittee's considered recommendation. Our committee has discharged its \nresponsibility. Now it is time for the full Senate to discharge its \nobligation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the need to move \nforward with a permanent nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, \nNV. Doing so is in the best interest of America's national security, \neconomy, energy policy, public safety, and environment.\n  Special interest groups and activists have capitalized on this \nissue--using scare tactics and doomsday scenarios to alarm the public. \nBut as a member of the Senate Energy Committee, I have listened to both \nsides, reviewed the information presented by the experts, and attended \nthe hearings. It makes sense to store our Nation's high-level nuclear \nwaste in a single, scientifically and environmentally sound, secure, \nand remote location.\n  Twenty years have passed since Congress called for the creation of an \nunderground repository for the Nation's spent nuclear fuel--under the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. Senator Murkowski has referred to the \nhistory of that act. During that time, about $7 billion from U.S. \nelectric consumers have been invested in finding the most suitable \nlocation for this project.\n  More than 45,000 metric tons of nuclear waste is currently stored at \n131\n\n[[Page S6055]]\n\nsites in 39 States--including my State of Nebraska, with 650 metric \ntons of waste stored at its two nuclear power plants.\n  This nuclear waste is stored above ground in facilities built for \ntemporary storage only. Many of these storage sites are near major \ncities and waterways.\n  Yucca Mountain represents two decades of the most comprehensive \nenvironmental and technical assessments ever conducted anywhere on the \nplanet. The mountain is located in one of the most isolated and arid \nlocations in the United States. Only 30 miles to the west lies Death \nValley; to the north is the Department of Energy's nuclear test site \nwhere some 900 nuclear weapons have been tested.\n  The repository itself would be located about 1,000 feet underground \nin sold rock to keep its contents safe from significant impacts, \nincluding major earthquakes. The mountain's natural geological \nattributes would be reinforced with man-made barriers.\n  Some opponents of the repository have centered this debate on the \ntransportation issue. They point out that there are risks involved. Of \ncourse there are risks involved--we do not live in a risk-free society. \nThere is risk with everything we do. What is important is that the risk \nis acceptable in order to accomplish the objective. In this case, the \nrisk is absolutely acceptable--because it is a risk we can control, we \ncan manage, we can deal with.\n  Shipments of nuclear material have been taking place in the United \nStates for the past three decades and will continue, with or without \nYucca Mountain.\n  About 3,000 shipments of spent nuclear fuel have occurred since \n1965--covering 1.7 million miles--with no injuries, no fatalities, and \nno environmental damage due to radioactive release. In that time, not \none spent fuel container has ever been breached.\n  Spent nuclear fuel, which is nonexplosive and nonflammable, is \nshipped in specially designed and tested multilayered steel casks. \nThese casks have been designed to withstand extreme heat, prolonged \nsubmersion in water, and severe impacts--such as being broadsided by a \n120-ton locomotive traveling at 80 miles per hour. If the Yucca \nMountain repository becomes a reality, the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission must survey and approve all routes, and all shipments would \nbe monitored 24 hours a day through a satellite tracking system--with \nthe coordinated effort of local, State, and federal law enforcement \nagencies.\n  A ``no'' vote on Yucca would be devastating for the future of nuclear \npower in this country. While that is the objective of the activists, we \ncannot afford such a catastrophic loss.\n  Nuclear power accounts for 20 percent of the Nation's electric power. \nIt powers 40 percent of our Navy's combat vessels. Experts in the fuel \ncell industry say that nuclear power plants are the only way to produce \nenough hydrogen if America is to ever become a country powered by fuel \ncells, instead of fossil fuels. This is all directly connected to Yucca \nMountain.\n  We should not forget that there will be a large financial burden if \nthis project is rejected. The Federal Government will be in default of \nits obligations, and would owe utilities and contract holders as much \nas $100 billion. This is on top of the billions of dollars already \ninvested in the project. Then we would be forced to begin a new process \nof looking at other options for a repository. If not Yucca, where? \nHanford, WA, is often mentioned as a viable alternative. The fact is, \nor we must deal with, 45,000 metric tons of nuclear waste--and more on \nthe way.\n  The bottom line is that this problem is not going to disappear, and \nthe world will not become any safer by deferring this problem. We \neither deal with this problem today--or we pass it onto future \ngenerations. That is not an acceptable option. We do have an \nacceptable, safe and responsible option.\n  We must move forward with the Yucca Mountain repository. It is the \nright and responsible thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, we will save rebutting the comments of \nour colleague from Nevada for another time. We do want to talk about \nthe Yucca Mountain project this morning, but I want to talk about the \nprocedure in the Senate on which people have been focusing.\n  In the modern history of the Senate, nobody other than the majority \nleader or his designee has successfully offered a motion to proceed. \nThat being said, supporters of Yucca Mountain claim that breaking \ntradition would be alright because the process outlined in the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act is supposedly unique.\n  The procedure in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act is not unique, nor is \nit required--it is merely permitted. There are many statutes containing \nexpedited procedures. When the Congress has determined that it is \nappropriate to override the traditional power of the majority leader to \nschedule the floor, it has drafted legislation like the War Powers Act \nwhich does so.\n  The War Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1544 et seq.) states:\n\n       Any joint resolution or bill so reported (from Committee) \n     shall become the pending business of the House in question \n     (in the case of the Senate the time for debate shall be \n     equally divided between the proponents and the opponents), \n     and shall be voted on within three calendar days thereafter, \n     unless such House shall otherwise determine by yeas and nays.\n\n  Unlike this War Powers provision, there is no requirement in the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act that Congress take any action with regard to \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act resolution. Congress in the past has used \na variety of techniques to expedite privileged business, and in the \ncase of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act did not choose to use some of the \nmore time-sensitive techniques. Indeed, the 1982 act anticipates that a \nvote on the Yucca Mountain resolution might not occur--that it might be \nblocked. If the deadline passes, then the statute giving the State of \nNevada a veto will have been carried out. That was part of the 1982 \ncompromise.\n  It is true that an expedited procedure was put into law, pursuant to \nthe rulemaking power of the Congress, as Congress has put in law many \nexpedited procedures. But no one other than the majority leader or his \ndesignee has ever moved successfully to go to any resolution, or bill, \nwhich has expedited procedures written into law. Any successful attempt \nto do that now would change forever the way that the Senate sets its \nagenda.\n\n  The junior Senator from Alaska stated that he does ``not know that it \nreally matters very much'' who makes the motion to proceed to the Yucca \nMountain resolution.\n  I say that it does matter. It matters very much. It is the Senate \nrules that allow any Senator to move to proceed to a matter, or to \nforce a vote on the motion to proceed, but it is now a well-established \npractice that the Senate will only proceed to a matter the majority \nleader wishes to call up, and that the Senate has not proceeded to any \nmatter that the majority leader has declined to call up for decades \npast. It is the proposed change in this practice that is a direct \nchallenge to the role of any majority leader.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act does not make the resolution the pending \nbusiness of the Senate, even though some laws--such as the War Powers \nResolution--do take away the prerogative of the majority leader by \nmaking a resolution the pending business without any motion to proceed \nbeing required. Had the Senate wished to do that in this case, it could \nhave followed the language of the War Powers Resolution.\n  If a Senator other than the majority leader feels he or she has the \nright to call up privileged matters without deferring to the majority \nleader, then the Senate will have undergone a dramatic sea change in \nthe way it operates.\n  The procedures in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act were put in place \npursuant to the rulemaking power of the Senate, and they have no higher \nstanding because they are written into law. There is no more \nfundamental prerogative that attaches to the majority leader than the \nright to set the Senate agenda.\n  I hope my colleagues on this side of the aisle will think long and \nhard before they challenge the historic role of the majority leader. \nThe traditions of this institution deserve to be protected.\n  Madam President, in the coming days leading up to the vote, we will \nbe laying out some of the things my colleague from Nebraska has asked. \nWhat\n\n[[Page S6056]]\n\ndo we do if we do not build Yucca Mountain? There are many \nalternatives, and we will get into detail, why the alternatives to \nbuilding Yucca Mountain are better for the United States of America. \nThey are cheaper, they are safer, and they are better for national \nsecurity. We will lay out in detail, as we have in the past, exactly \nwhy our colleagues, we believe, should vote against proceeding with the \nYucca Mountain project.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I was unable to listen to the full \nstatements of the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from Alaska, \nbut I have been told by my staff some of the things they said.\n  I have to say basically the same thing I have been saying for a long \ntime. The American public has come to the realization that what the \nproponents of Yucca Mountain are saying is absolutely without \nfoundation. For example, one of the issues they talk about is moving \nthe nuclear waste out of the many sites where it sits now and putting \nit into one site. Isn't that the best thing to do?\n  Of course, but we have had articles in papers all across America \nshowing that it is a sham because you can never get rid of the waste \nwhere it is being generated. They will have to move 3,000 tons a year. \nThey have 46,000 tons stored now. They generate 2,000 tons. When you \ntake a spent fuel rod out of a nuclear generator, you have to put it in \na cooling pond for 5 years because it is so hot and so radioactive. \nThey only use 5 percent of the power and radioactivity in one of those \nrods. After 5 percent is used, they have to take it out and cool it. \nThey can't move it for 5 years. For anyone to suggest there is going to \nbe one place where all the waste will be; someplace in the western part \nof the United States is foolishness.\n  This is not the Senator from Nevada talking. It is in newspapers and \nscientific journals all over America.\n  For the first 18 or 20 years, the nuclear waste issue centered on the \nscience of Yucca Mountain. I could lay out a picture to the Chair for \nthe people of Michigan or any other State showing how science at Yucca \nMountain is very bad. But that doesn't matter anymore because that is \nnot the question. The question is, How are we going to get the waste to \nYucca Mountain? You can do it three ways: highways, railroad, and \nbarges on the water. That is all you can do. Nuclear waste will travel \nthrough 43 or 45 different States.\n\n  There is a Web site that has been developed, Mapscience.com. Pull it \nup, and it shows any address in America and how near the nuclear waste \nwill travel to your home, or to your school, or to the playground, or \nto your business. This site has alerted many people to the dangers of \nthe transportation of nuclear waste. Since that site was put up 2 weeks \nago, there have been over 200,000 hits. People want to find out from \nwhere the waste will go. What they find out is not good, so these \npeople have been sending letters to their Senators and talking to their \nneighbors.\n  The transportation of nuclear waste is wrong. My friend from Nebraska \nsaid the risk is acceptable. Acceptable to whom? The Chairman of the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, when asked last week about what would \nhappen if Yucca Mountain didn't go through right now, said ``nothing.'' \nThere is room to store waste onsite at every reactor in America. There \nare power generators now that are storing nuclear waste onsite in dry-\ncask storage canisters. That is what a large segment of the scientific \ncommunity said we should do. It is safer than trying to move it.\n  To transport this is unacceptable. We are talking about 100,000 \ntruckloads of nuclear waste, 20,000 trainloads, and thousands of barges \nfull of nuclear waste.\n  Recently, there were editorials in the Denver Post and in the St. \nPetersburg Times, the largest newspaper in Florida and the largest \nnewspaper in Colorado, criticizing the program--and in places all over \nthe country; places where the nuclear power industry has spent tens of \nmillions of dollars in campaign contributions; there are articles \ndescribing the trips sponsored by the nuclear power industry. They take \npeople to Las Vegas and wine and dine them so they can show them Yucca \nMountain. They spend 2 hours at Yucca Mountain and several days in one \nof the fine hotels in Las Vegas. Congressional staff have been taken \nback out there on numerous occasions. Lobbying activities are intense.\n  For example, for the first time in the State of Nevada, Governor \nGuinn said we should hire somebody to help lobby back here. You have no \nidea how hard it is to find somebody to help us because the nuclear \npower industry has bought Washington, DC.\n  So I appreciate the power of the Nuclear Energy Institute. It is \npowerful, and I understand that. But I also understand the American \npeople, and they now--since September 11--realize every truckload, \nevery trainload, every barge is a target of opportunity for terrorists.\n  No matter what the problems may be where these nuclear generators are \nlocated, the problems are amplified by trying to move nuclear waste. We \nwould have, around the country, the potential not for ``a'' ``dirty'' \nbomb, but hundreds and thousands of ``dirty'' bombs. How are you going \nto transport nuclear waste safely? You cannot. We know a shoulder-fired \nweapon will pierce one of these containers. We know that if you leave \nthem on site and cover them with cement, it will be very safe.\n  So, Madam President, I try to be as quiet and nonresponsive as I can \nbe when these statements are made. But today I had to respond because I \nthink it just simply was out of line for someone to say the risk is \nacceptable. It is not acceptable. It is not acceptable at all.\n  We are going to have, probably, sometime shortly after the Fourth of \nJuly recess, an opportunity to vote on the procedure, which violates \nwhat we do around here. The majority leader does not want this to come \nforward. We are going to see how people will vote on that because my \nfriends in the minority have to understand someday they will be in the \nmajority, I am sorry to say, and when they are in the majority, the \nsame rules will apply to them.\n  You have to be very careful who brings matters to the floor. I have \nthe greatest respect for the junior Senator from Alaska. He is my \nfriend. I have worked with him on many different issues. On this, we \nhave a basic disagreement in philosophy.\n  My friend, the senior Senator from Nebraska, is a fine man, certainly \nan American patriot. But for him to come to the floor and say the risk \nis acceptable is something I cannot let go without a response. It \nsimply is wrong, and I want him to know I believe he is wrong.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, how much time remains in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes remain.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me take that 4 minutes because I know \nmy colleagues want to move forward with DOD authorization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6056-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6056-S6057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE TRAGEDY OUT WEST\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I come to the floor one more time this \nweek to speak about the tragedies in the West as they play out. While \nmy time is limited this morning, I thought it was important that I talk \nabout the human side of this tragedy.\n  Let me read this wire story about Jackie Nelson of Globe, AZ, driving \nher pickup into a makeshift shelter yesterday morning to try to find \nfood for a 7-month-old granddaughter of hers. She left her home on a \nhillside in Arizona to burn in the wildfires that play out there. She \ndoes not know whether she will go home to that home or whether\n\n[[Page S6057]]\n\nshe will literally be adrift and have to seek shelter from public \nsources.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       That lament resounded across the West today, as 18 large \n     blazes burned in six states, consuming acreage at a pace \n     roughly double the 10-year average.\n\n  The reason I want to talk about that very briefly, as I did yesterday \nmorning, is that today in the West over 2.5 million acres of public \nland have now been charred into a smoldering rubble--homes, beautiful \nwildlife habitat, timbered acreages--that simply we forgot because the \npublic policy of this country said, over a decade ago: Leave the land \nto Mother Nature and walk away. And in our walking away, in the pursuit \nof the environment, Mother Nature took charge.\n  Today, Mother Nature rules the West, and her mode of operation is a \nmonstrous wildfire consuming the public timber reserves of the West, \nthe wildlife habitat, and the watershed.\n  To put in context 2.5 million acres having burned currently, on the \nsame date in 2000--a year when we burned over 7.3 million acres, in \n2000--at this point in time, we had only burned 1.2 million acres. So \ntoday we have already burned double what we burned by this time in \n2000. And 2000 was the worst in recorded history of fires on public \nlands.\n  Why is this happening? Again, neglect. Again, an irresponsible public \npolicy that took people off the land and did not allow us to manage it \nin wise and responsible ways for all of the multiple-use values we hold \ndear to our public lands.\n  It is a tragedy of nature. It is a tragedy we have made. It is a \ntragedy we can solve. We well ought to solve it by a much more prudent \npublic policy. But it will take decades now to begin to reverse what we \nhave allowed to happen.\n  Where there were once 150 trees per acre in the public forests, today \nthere are 400 or 500 trees per acre, oftentimes growing like weeds, and \nresulting in equivalent Btu's of 10,000 to 15,000 to 20,000 gallons of \ngasoline per acre. And when the temperature is right, and the humidity \nis right, and the drought is running rampant across the Southwest, as \nit is today, we set in motion the ``perfect storm,'' only in this case \nit is the perfect firestorm that has now consumed nearly 500 homes in \nColorado, in Arizona, and in New Mexico. And our summer, our fire \nsummer--the long hot summer in the West--has just begun.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6057-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 2514, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2514) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2003 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will await the distinguished chairman, \nbut it is my anticipation that we will move to the issue pending; that \nis, missile defense. I will send to the desk at this time an amendment \non my behalf and that of the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Miller.\n  I will not ask it to be the pending business, as a courtesy to my \nchairman, until he arrives. I anticipate upon his arrival that we will \nwork out a procedure by which a second degree will be added. As a \ncourtesy, I will wait until he arrives.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, it is my understanding he will \nsend his amendment to the desk but not call it up.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. I will call it up, but I would prefer, \nas a courtesy, to allow Mr. Levin to examine it and then hopefully we \ncan agree upon a procedure whereby he would then file a second degree, \nand then we can have hopefully the Senate address the two issues.\n  Mr. REID. I think if we want this to be the pending business, what we \nshould do is have the amendment called up. I ask unanimous consent, \nbecause we have talked about this for some time, that Senator Levin or \nsomeone on his behalf would have the right to second degree the \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am perfectly willing to agree to that at this point and \nask that it be the pending business, if that is the guidance you wish.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent then, in keeping with the statement \nof the Senator from Virginia, that Senator Levin or his designee would \nbe allowed to offer a second-degree amendment and no one would have a \nright to offer one prior to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask that my amendment be the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator objecting?\n  Mr. WARNER. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Given that the chairman will arrive in a few minutes, I \nam happy to yield the floor to my colleague for such purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself, Mr. \n     Miller, Mr. Lott, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Allard, Mr. \n     Kyl, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Thurmond, \n     Mr. Sessions, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \n     Helms, Mr. McCain, Mr. Nickles, and Mr. Hagel, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4007.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide an additional amount for ballistic missile defense \nor combating terrorism in accordance with national security priorities \n                           of the President)\n\n       On page 217, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1010. ADDITIONAL AMOUNT FOR BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE OR \n                   COMBATING TERRORISM IN ACCORDANCE WITH NATIONAL \n                   SECURITY PRIORITIES OF THE PRESIDENT.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--In addition to other \n     amounts authorized to be appropriated by other provisions of \n     this division, there is hereby authorized to be appropriated \n     for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2003, \n     $814,300,000 for whichever of the following purposes the \n     President determines that the additional amount is necessary \n     in the national security interests of the United States:\n       (1) Research, development, test, and evaluation for \n     ballistic missile defense programs of the Department of \n     Defense.\n       (2) Activities of the Department of Defense for combating \n     terrorism at home and abroad.\n       (b) Offset.--The total amount authorized to be appropriated \n     under the other provisions of this division is hereby reduced \n     by $814,300,000 to reflect the amounts that the Secretary \n     determines unnecessary by reason of a revision of assumptions \n     regarding inflation that are applied as a result of the \n     midsession review of the budget conducted by the Office of \n     Management and Budget during the spring and early summer of \n     2002.\n       (c) Priority for Allocating Funds.--In the expenditure of \n     additional funds made available by a lower rate of inflation, \n     the top priority shall be the use of such additional funds \n     for Department of Defense activities for combating terrorism \n     and protecting the American people at home and abroad.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4009\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of Senator \nWarner for one moment, it is my understanding the amendment which I \nwill send to the desk very shortly has been approved on both sides. It \nis cosponsored by Senators Biden, Lugar, Landrieu, Hagel, Bingaman, \nMurkowski, Carnahan, Lincoln, and Mikulski.\n  I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration. I assume I have to ask that the pending amendment be \nlaid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Is there objection to laying aside the pending amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will ask my good friend if he will allow \nthe two managers to have a chance to consult on this. It is my \nunderstanding\n\n[[Page S6058]]\n\nthat the amendment is cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wouldn't have come here unless it had.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am certain of that. Our attention was diverted by other \nmatters to get started this morning. If you will just forebear for a \nbrief period, we will see if we can't accommodate the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few moments \non the subject they will clear shortly, the amendment to which I \nreferred and listed the cosponsors, to whom I am extremely gratified \nfor their support. Senator Biden is my principal cosponsor. We hope \nthat this bill will move along and be known as the Domenici-Biden \nnonproliferation amendment.\n  This amendment supports the nonproliferation program proposed in a \nbipartisan Senate bill, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 2002. \nToday, Senators Biden, Lugar, Landrieu, Hagel, Bingaman, Murkowski, \nCarnahan, Lincoln, and Mikulski are cosponsoring this amendment.\n  The end of the Soviet Union in 1991 started a chain of events, which \nin the long term can lead to vastly improved global stability. Concerns \nabout global confrontations were greatly reduced after that event.\n  But with that event, the Soviet system of guards, guns, and a highly \nregimented society that had effectively controlled their weapons of \nmass destruction, along with the materials and expertise to create \nthem, was significantly weakened. Even today, with Russia's economy \nwell on the road to recovery, there's still plenty of room for concerns \nabout the security of these Russian assets.\n  The tragic events of September 11 brought the United States into the \nworld of international terrorism, a world from which we had been very \nsheltered. Even with the successes of the subsequent war on terrorism, \nthere's still ample reason for concern that the forces of al-Qaida and \nother international terrorists are seeking other avenues to disrupt \npeaceful societies around he world.\n  In some sense, the events of September 11 set a new gruesome standard \nagainst which terrorists may measure their future successes. There \nshould be no question that these groups would use weapons of mass \ndestruction if they could acquire them and deliver them here or to \ncountless other international locations.\n  One of our strongest allies in the current war on terrorism has been \nthe Russian Federation. Assistance from the Russians and other States \nof the former Soviet Union has been vital in many aspects of the \nconflict in Afghanistan.\n  President Putin and President Bush have forged a strong working \nrelationship, and the summit meeting was another measure of interest in \nincreased cooperation. As this amendment seeks to strengthen our \nnonproliferation programs, it provides many options for actions to be \nconducted through joint partnerships between the Russian Federation and \nthe United States that build on this increased cooperative spirit.\n  The Nunn-Lugar program of 1991 and the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici \nlegislation of 1996 provided vital support for cooperative programs to \nreduce the risks that weapons of mass destruction might become \navailable to terrorists. They established a framework for cooperative \nprogress that has served our Nation and the world very well. But \ndespite their successes, accomplished in the face of some enormous \nchallenges, there remain actions that should be taken to further reduce \nthese threats.\n\n  This amendment would expand the current nonproliferation programs of \nthe Department of Energy, most of which trace their origins to those \noriginal Nunn-Lugar and Nunn-Lugar-Domenici bills. Before I discuss \nthis amendment, I would like to review some our progress to date.\n  For example, the Nuclear Materials Protection, Control and Accounting \nprogram has improved the security of at least one-third of the fissile \nmaterials in the former Soviet Union. Comprehensive upgrades have been \nlargely completed on the Russian Navy's stocks of weapons usable \nmaterials, with work completed at 10 of their 11 storage sites.\n  Border security is being improved through the Second Line of Defense \nprogram. I recall when I participated in the initial ribbon-cutting of \nthis system at Moscow's main airport in 1998. Now this equipment is at \nover 20 sites in Russia and the Ukraine.\n  Programs to counter ``brain drain'' have moved ahead. The Initiatives \nfor Proliferation Prevention of IPP program has shown excellent \nprogress in recent years in the daunting task of creating commercial \nopportunities for weapons scientists throughout the former Soviet \nUnion. To date, over $50 million of venture capital has been attracted \non several major projects and more than 10,000 technical personnel have \nbeen engaged since the program began.\n  Under IPP, about 100 American businesses are working in Russia, and \nthey've contributed over $100 million of their own funds in support of \nefforts in which our Government has invested about $70 million. About \n400 projects are currently in progress with 100 of those in the closed \nnuclear cities. American businesses are sharing costs on 132 of those \nprojects.\n  The Nuclear Cities Initiative has one of the most challenging tasks \nof all the programs--to work cooperatively with the Russians to down-\nsize their vast nuclear weapons complex. The closed nuclear cities that \nmake up this complex have immense technical capabilities, but they have \nto be, at least in the past, one of the most business-unfriendly places \nin the world.\n  In 1998, I visited Sarov, the Russian version of Los Alamos. It was a \nfascinating place where the hospitality of my hosts was most \nimpressive. I still remember visiting their weapons museum and standing \nbeside a 60-megaton bomb that was once destined for our shores. Despite \ntheir history, they displayed significant interest in shifting their \nweapons focus to commercial interests.\n  Today, there's been real progress in Sarov. For example, there is a \nsigned agreement with the Russians to terminate all weapons \nconstruction work at Sarov by 2003. Many commercial ventures are now \nunderway including an Open Computing Center, which provides employment \nopportunities for former weapons scientists through software \ndevelopment and computer modeling.\n  The HEU deal has largely remained on track, although it's required \nsome help from Congress to keep from derailing. That program has the \ngoal of rendering 500 tons of weapons grade highly enriched uranium un-\nusable for weapons by converting it into ordinary reactor fuel. To \ndate, 146 tons have been converted, enough for about 6,000 warheads.\n  Despite the successes of the Nunn-Lugar and Nunn-Lugar-Domenici \nlegislation, there remain many actions that should be taken to further \nreduce these threats. This new amendment expands and strengthens many \nof the programs established earlier, to further reduce threats to \nglobal peace.\n  It addresses one of the most important realizations from September \n11--that the forces of terrorism span the globe. It's now clear that \nour nuclear nonproliferation programs should extend far beyond the \nstates of the former Soviet Union.\n  This amendment expands the scope of several programs to world-wide \ncoverage. It focuses on threats of a nuclear or radiological type, \nwhich largely fall within the expertise of the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration.\n  Just today, the National Research Council released their major report \non ``The Role of Science and Technology in Countering Terrorism.'' They \npresent a number of critical recommendations to address threats of \nnuclear and radiological terrorism. I'm very pleased that the \nlegislative basis for most of their suggestions is in this amendment.\n  This amendment expands programs to include the safety and security of \nnuclear facilities and radioactive materials around the world, wherever \ncountries are willing to enter into cooperative arrangements for threat \nreduction. It recognizes that devices that disperse radioactive \nmaterials, so-called ``dirty bombs,'' can represent a real threat to \nmodern societies. This is one of the key recommendations of the \nNational Research Council.\n  Dirty bombs could be used as weapons of mass terror, property \ncontamination, and economic disaster. We need\n\n[[Page S6059]]\n\nbetter detection systems for the presence of dirty bombs that are \nappropriate to the wide range of delivery systems for such a weapon, \nfrom trucks to boats to containers. And we need to be far better \nprepared to deal with the consequences of such an attack.\n  The new legislation includes provisions to accelerate and expand \nexisting programs for disposition of fissile materials. These \nmaterials, of course, represent not only a concern with dirty bombs, \nbut also the even larger threat of use in crude nuclear weapons.\n\n  It includes a program to accelerate the conversion of highly enriched \nuranium into forms un-usable for weapons. It addresses one of the major \nconcerns associated with this material that, many years ago, both the \nUnited States and the Soviet Union provided HEU to many countries as \nfuel for research reactors. That fuel represents a proliferation risk \ntoday. This accelerated conversion is another of the prime \nrecommendations of the National Research Council.\n  It authorizes new programs for global management of nuclear \nmaterials, in cooperation with other nations and with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency. It recognizes that modern societies use \nradioactive materials as essential tools in many ways, and offers \nassistance in providing new controls on the most dangerous of these \nmaterials.\n  It suggests that many of the program elements involve international \ncooperation with the Russian Federation and with other nations. In \nfact, it recognizes that the global nature of the current threats \nrequires such cooperation, and provides authorizations for the \nSecretary of Energy to assist the Secretary of State in offering \nsignificant help to other nations. We cannot accomplish these programs \nwithout such cooperation.\n  This amendment includes provisions extending the First Responder \ntraining programs, originally created under Nunn-Lugar-Domenici. These \nprograms have already made real contributions. In fact, the training \nprovided under this program in New York City helped mitigate the \ncatastrophe there on September 11. That program was authorized for only \n5 years in the original legislation, this bill extends that \nauthorization for another 10 years.\n  The amendment requires annual reports demonstrating that all our \nnonproliferation programs are well coordinated and integrated. The \noriginal call for this coordination was in the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici \nlegislation.\n  The report must disclose the extent of coordination and integration \nbetween federally funded and private activities. That is very \nimportant, because of the excellent work being done by private \norganizations, like the Nuclear Threat Initiative, that are providing \ncritical assistance toward similar nonproliferation goals.\n  With this amendment, our programs to counter threats of nuclear and \nradiological terrorism will be significantly strengthened and risks to \nthe United States and our international partners greatly reduced.\n  The amendment authorizes $15M for a new R and demonstration program \nto address nuclear or radiological (``dirty bombs'') terrorism. \nIncludes new responsibilities in First Responders program. Includes a \npartnership with Russia and extends assistance to any country in \ndealing with either stray radioactive sources or with a dirty bomb \nincident. (Section 3156);\n  Extends the expired authorization for training of First Responders. \n(Section 3155);\n  Authorizes $40 million to accelerate the ``blend-down'' of Highly \nEnriched Uranium. Authorizes new approaches, in addition to the HEU \nDeal, to increase the rate at which HEU is modified to render it \nincapable of weapons use. Extends an option to all nations with HEU to \nreceive compensation in return for providing their stocks of HEU now. \n(Section 3158);\n  Authorizes $5 million to extend MPC to the international community \nand develops options, working jointly with Russia, to accelerate \nconversion of reactors fueled with HEU. (Section 3157);\n  Encourages the Secretary to finalize an agreement with Russia for \nplutonium disposition that meets specific criteria. (Section 3159A);\n  Authorizes $20 million for the Department to work with the \ninternational community to develop options for a global program for \ninternational safeguards, nuclear safety and proliferation-resistant \nnuclear technologies. Amount includes $5 million for the Department to \nincrease nuclear safety work related to sabotage protection for nuclear \npower plants and other nuclear facilities overseas and $10 million, led \nby DOE/NE, for advanced, proliferation resistant fuel cycles. (Section \n3159B);\n  Authorizes $15 million to expand programs supporting the IAEA in \nstrengthening international nuclear safeguards. (Section 3159B);\n  Authorizes $5 million for assisting nations develop stronger export \ncontrols. (Section 3159C);\n  Requires development of a comprehensive ten year plan to develop a \nsustainable approach to MPC in the Russian Federation. (Section \n3159D);\n  Requires annual report on coordination and integration of all U.S. \nnonproliferation activities describing programs, synergies, \ncoordination including with private efforts, opportunities for new \njoint cooperative programs with foreign countries, and funding requests \nintegrated across all federal agencies. Extends reporting requirement \nin FY2002 Defense Authorization Act to an annual report. (Section \n3159E); and\n  Streamlines contracting by other agencies with DOE labs for anti-\nterrorism work. Agencies may elect to follow the new procedures or may \nuse standard Work For Others model. (Section 3159F).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we simply need a little time on this side \nto give it consideration. The chairman and I have just commenced a \ndiscussion on how we will proceed on the bill today. I would hope in \ndue course we can indicate to the Senator that it will be accepted on \nboth sides.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have already sent the bill to the \ndesk. It obviously will not be referred to committee unless and until \nit is cleared by the managers pursuant to the conversation we have had.\n  I would ask that we follow the course I have just indicated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, does the Senator have a copy of the \namendment handy?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Surely. I will provide it to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are pretty sure this is the one we already have.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we support the amendment on this side. We \nhave cleared it. We are willing to see it adopted by voice vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we now have clearance on our side. I thank \nthe chairman. We are ready to move forward on the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside and the Domenici-Biden amendment be the pending \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The pending amendment is laid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for himself and \n     Mr. Biden, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Hagel, Mrs. Carnahan, \n     Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Lincoln, and Ms. Mikulski, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4009.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today my good friend \nand colleague, Senator Domenici, in introducing a vital amendment to \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill to reduce the odds that \nterrorists or rogue states will acquire the necessary ingredients \noverseas for nuclear and radiological terrorism. This amendment takes \nimportant steps to expand the legal mandate for specific U.S. nuclear \nnonproliferation programs and lays down a marker on the necessary \nfunding levels.\n\n[[Page S6060]]\n\n  We have every expectation that, before this bill emerges from \nconference, the additional money will indeed be made available through \nboth the supplemental fiscal year 2002 appropriations and regular \nfiscal year 2003 appropriations. Senator Domenici is to be both \ncommended and supported for drafting this amendment, and the underlying \nbill, S. 2545, from which it is derived.\n  This amendment will lead to greater levels of effort and, I believe, \ngreater levels of achievement in U.S. nuclear nonproliferation \nprograms.\n  For example, it authorizes $40 million to accelerate and expand \ncurrent international programs to blend down highly enriched uranium \n(HEU) needed to make nuclear bombs, making it less likely that \nterrorists or rogue states will get their hands on lethal nuclear \nmaterials.\n  It authorizes $35 million to develop options for a global program for \ninternational safeguards and proliferation-resistant technologies to \nensure that civilian nuclear reactors in other nations are not \nillicitly producing significant quantities of weapons-grade material or \nare vulnerable to terrorist assault.\n  This amendment also allocates $30 million in funding for a new \nresearch, development, and demonstration program to help respond to \nnuclear or radiological terrorism. For example, the program would fund \nexpanded research into monitors and gauges capable of detecting nuclear \nand/or radiological materials, for use at border crossings and ports of \nentry. It will help identify and account for radioactive sources \nlocated abroad. And all of these efforts will be carried out in \ncooperation with Russia and the rest of the international community.\n  On May 8 Jose Padilla, an American citizen working with al-Qaida, was \narrested on the charge of planning to attack the United States with a \nRadiological Dispersion Device, more commonly called a ``dirty bomb.''\n  Padilla is only the first person associated with a major terrorist \ngroup to have been caught plotting an attack using a radiological \nweapon. It would be folly to think that he will be either the last or \nthe most competent and successful.\n  The fact that radiological terror is real and a threat to the nation \nwill come as no great surprise to the Senate. On March 6 the Foreign \nRelations Committee held a public hearing on the twin threats of \nnuclear and radiological terrorism. On March 5 we held a classified \nbriefing on the same subject, followed a month later by an even more \ndetailed classified session for all Senators.\n  We assembled the finest scientists from government, the nuclear \nweapons laboratories, public interest groups and academia to speak of \nthe dangers of dirty bombs. Without exception they told us that there \nwas a real possibility that terrorists could obtain radioactive \nmaterial and blow it up with a conventional bomb, spreading the \nmaterial for miles.\n  But they also agreed on the likely consequences of a radiation attack \non an American city.\n  Despite Attorney General John Ashcroft's statement from Moscow on \nJune 10 that a dirty bomb can ``cause mass death and injury,'' the \nfacts are very different. The Foreign Relations Committee learned that \neven the worst credible radiological attack will not be catastrophic. \nFew, if any, Americans will die from the radiation or even experience \nthe symptoms of radiation poisoning. Most, if not all, of the \ncasualties will come from the conventional explosive used to spread the \nradioactive material.\n  The bottom line on casualties is: A dirty bomb won't kill very many \npeople.\n  But a dirty bomb could still be an economic crime of the first \nmagnitude. We do not know how to decontaminate large buildings and \nlarge areas to the degree that the Environmental Protection Agency \nmandates.\n  The levels EPA uses in the case of accidents within a laboratory are \nextraordinary: clean-up must be so complete that out of 1,000 people \nliving on-site 24 hours a day for about 40 years, only 1 additional \nperson would die of cancer.\n  We must begin to examine the radiation protection rules in the light \nof homeland security in the event of an attack instead of just applying \nthe strict environmental guidelines appropriate to peacetime.\n  Our witnesses estimated that if a small device, containing only a few \ncuries of cobalt-60 or cesium-137, had been detonated in lower \nManhattan on September 10, 2001, and if existing EPA rules were applied \nto the clean-up, more buildings would have had to be evacuated, razed, \nand trucked away to low-level radioactive waste dumps than were lost or \ndamaged by the al-Qaida attack of September 11. That is more damage, \nmore financial loss, than was caused when the Twin Towers came down, \nbut with this difference: almost nobody would be killed. At most a few \ndozen people might get sick.\n  We must do more to prepare for an attack, and also to prevent one. \nFortunately, we can, in fact, make such an attack much harder to pull \noff and much easier to recover from.\n  Proper preparation for an attack will make a world of difference; we \nneed to begin putting response plans into place and testing them \nrigorously, both in the field and in table-top exercises.\n  First responders need the tools to act. You cannot see or smell \nradiation; it can only be detected with special instruments.\n  Small radiation detectors are the size of a pocket pager; larger ones \ncould easily be built into a squad car.\n  A network of detectors in fixed locations could be erected, a few per \nsquare mile, in cities such as Washington or Wilmington at a cost of a \nfew million dollars per city.\n  Such sensors might provide early warning of smuggled material on the \nroads and information on affected areas if somebody brings radiological \nterror to our cities.\n  Avoiding panic among the American people will be an important goal of \nresponders, and that will require education. Claims of probable mass \ncasualties from a radiological attack do an injustice to the American \npeople. If repeated over and over again this doom-saying will be a \nself-fulfilling prophecy spreading panic if an attack actually does \nhappen.\n  Should we be attacked by radiological terrorists, there are very \nsimple things those who have been exposed can do to reduce their \nchances of being a casualty to nearly zero.\n  The first is to remain calm.\n  The next is to stay near the point of exposure long enough for \nnuclear response crews to check for radioactive contamination.\n  And the last, the easiest, is to put your clothes in a plastic bag \nand then take a good shower and shampoo. Radioactive dust washed off \nthe body is radioactive dust no longer available to do harm to you.\n  We need to look to the radioactive material itself. Radioactive \nsources must be kept in responsible hands; but that is difficult \nbecause they are used throughout industry, for example, to take x-ray \npictures of oil pipelines, and even to tell if a can of soda is \nproperly filled.\n  Radioactive sources are indispensable to modern medicine, where they \nare used to treat cancer or to perform crucial diagnostic tests. We \nshould not eliminate these sources from our society.\n  We can, however, provide greater protection for such sources.\n  Before September 11, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission focused its \nefforts on safety. It assumed that licensed users were responsible \nusers. Since September 11, the Commission has begun to reevaluate its \nrules with the added assumption that some folks might seek licenses in \norder to gain access to the material as part of a plot to attack this \ncountry or its allies.\n  We need tighter rules, and we also need a bigger Federal effort to \ntrack down and secure missing radioactive sources. The fact is that \nsometimes sources just go astray; they are ``orphaned,'' in the jargon \nof that business. There are very few places where companies can safely \ndispose of sources they no longer need.\n  The Department of Energy ``Off-Site Source Recovery Program'' is \nsupposed to take charge of excess sources. But the administration has \ncut this vital program from $5.7 million in fiscal year 2001 to a \npaltry $2.2 million requested for fiscal year 2003. Congress should fix \nthat.\n  Overseas, the greatest threat is likely to come from the poorly \nguarded radioactive materials from the former Soviet Union.\n\n[[Page S6061]]\n\n  Late in 2001, two containers containing enormous amounts of \nradioactive strontium-90 were found by hunters in the woods of the \nRepublic of Georgia. The sources were so hot that they melted the snow \nfor yards around, leading the three woodsmen to cart them off to warm \ntheir tent. By the next morning all were sick with radiation poisoning, \nincluding severe burns where they had touched the containers.\n  Those two radioactive sources were left over from a Soviet program to \nbuild compact, powerful, and very portable electrical generators for \nuse in remote areas. Nobody knows where all of the Soviet-produced \ngenerators wound up, but wherever they are, they are very dangerous.\n  Other countries, including Brazil and Mexico, have seen old sources \nstolen, broken into, melted down to make reinforcing bars and patio \nfurniture, with resulting injuries and deaths to some of their \ncitizens.\n  The United States must work through the International Atomic Energy \nAgency to ensure the physical protection and accountability of \nsignificant radioactive sources throughout the globe. This will require \nadditional U.S. voluntary contributions to the IAEA and may also \nrequire additional non-proliferation assistance to the states of the \nformer Soviet Union. After all, that is where the majority of the \nunaccounted for hot sources are thought to have been made.\n  I commend the administration for yesterday's announcement of a new \njoint United States-Russian program to spend $20 million this year to \nsecure and safeguard radiological materials in the former Soviet Union. \nThe program would focus on the radioactive power generators I mentioned \nearlier, as well as a dozen poorly guarded storage areas for \nradiological materials. Of course, the former Soviet Union is not the \nsole overseas repository of radioactive sources attractive to \nterrorists. But this program may serve as a model for future efforts.\n  So there is plenty for us to do to lessen the risk and the impact of \nradiological terrorism. The United States has begun to contribute to \nthe IAEA's Program Against Nuclear Terrorism. Today's amendment is a \ngood step in increasing U.S. assistance in this area.\n  But I worry far more about something even worse than radiological \nterrorism. I worry about terrorists building or stealing a real atomic \nbomb. Our committee learned in chilling detail, in classified session, \njust how easy it is to make a bomb, given only a comparatively small \namount of highly enriched uranium-235. In those sessions Senators were \nable to see and handle a full-scale mockup, complete in almost every \ndetail, but using inert material instead of uranium.\n  I won't reveal the design; I don't want to give away any information \nthat could be used against us. But building that device is easy. It \ncould be done in a machine shop with ordinary lathes and drills and \nmills without any need for computer-controlled and export-controlled \ndual-use equipment.\n  And it would fit in the trunk of a compact car or the back end of a \npickup.\n  Those who attended the briefing also saw a small tactical nuclear \nweapon, again a full-scale mockup of a real one once in the U.S. \ninventory. With one of those you don't need a fancy brief-case bomb; \nyou can lift it with one hand.\n  I am not worried about American nuclear weapons going missing, but I \nam very worried about the tens of thousands built by the Soviet Union. \nTheir tactical nuclear weapons are no bigger than ours, and unless \nRussia's security for those weapons is a lot better than for its \nchemical weapons, our colleagues in the Russian Duma should be as \nworried as I am.\n  Terrorists with an improvised nuclear device or a stolen weapon could \nkill tens or hundreds of thousands of people, not a mere handful. A \ncrude nuclear weapon set off at Metro Center would likely kill people \nnear the Capitol complex. A Hiroshima-sized bomb detonated near the \nWhite House would leave the Capitol in ruins.\n  And, talk about a dirty bomb, a small nuclear blast at ground level \nwould spew out hundreds or thousands of times more radioactive material \nthan the biggest dirty bomb imaginable. That much fallout would kill \nAmericans.\n  We must invest in new technologies to detect bomb-grade uranium and \nplutonium. That is not an easy task. Neither material is particularly \nradioactive, at least not compared to cesium-137, cobalt-60, strontium-\n90 and iridium-192, the isotopes of choice for a dirty bomb. Frankly, \nwe do not know how to detect most bomb-grade fissile material today; \ncertainly not if the weapon is shielded a bit, concealed in a cargo \ncontainer being whisked through our ports or stashed in the hold of a \nfreight aircraft.\n  None of us knows how long we have to prepare for nuclear terrorism, \nbut we know for sure that the terrorists are shaping their own plans. \nWe, this body, must act sooner rather than later: to provide our \nresponders the tools they need; to secure radioactive and fissile \nmaterial, both here and abroad, to the greatest extent possible; and to \nsecure our borders against smugglers who would literally flatten our \ncities.\n  The Baker-Cutler report card on Department of Energy non-\nproliferation programs with Russia proposed spending about $30 billion \nover 8 to 10 years to secure Russia's excess plutonium and bomb-grade \nuranium, improve security controls on its nuclear materials, and \ndownsize its nuclear complex without leaving its weapons scientists \nprey to offers from rogue states or terrorists.\n  Senator Baker and Mr. Cutler called this ``the most urgent unmet \nnational security threat to the United States today.'' In my view, they \nwere absolutely right. Indeed, we must build on their recommendations: \nby adding support for programs to secure radioactive sources; and by \nsecuring any weapons-grade material in nuclear reactors around the \nworld.\n  This amendment Senator Domenici, I, and our fellow co-sponsors are \nintroducing today takes some sensible steps toward these goals. For \nexample, the new research, development, and demonstration program I \nmentioned earlier will help fund efforts to assist other nations in \ndeveloping means for the safe disposal of radioactive materials and a \nproper regulatory framework for licensing control of radioactive \nsources.\n  But we all must recognize that this amendment is only a first step to \naddress a threat of this urgency and magnitude.\n  Today we spend $7 or $8 billion a year to guard against the unlikely \nevent of Iran, Iraq, or North Korea putting a nuclear weapon on an \nintercontinental ballistic missile with a return address, and firing it \nat us despite the assurance of overwhelming retaliation. We need to \nshow the same sense of urgency in combating the more immediate risk of \na more anonymous nuclear weapon without that missile.\n  In the wake of the World Trade Center attacks, committees of the \nHouse and Senate are rightly asking whether more could have been done \nto detect and prevent that attack and how we can do a better job in the \nfuture.\n  What sort of investigation will we have? How will we rebuild our \npeople's trust in government? And what will we tell our children and \ngrandchildren, if we fail to do everything we can to prevent terrorists \nfrom doing a hundred times more harm?\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support amendment No. \n4009 to the Defense Authorization Act introduced by my colleague from \nNew Mexico.\n  This legislation is a significant step forward in the protection of \nour Nation from weapons of mass destruction.\n  Since the end of the cold war, the United States has taken \nconsiderable steps to reduce the spread of these weapons.\n  Senators Domenici and Lugar, along with former Senator Nunn, have \nbeen true visionaries in this field.\n  Because of their efforts, we face less of a threat from the Soviet \nUnion's nuclear legacy than we would have otherwise.\n  The Department of Defense's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and \nthe related programs at the Department of Energy are truly ``defense by \nother means.''\n  While these far-sighted programs have been very successful, they were \nnot designed to address some of the terrorist threats we now face.\n  To address these shortcomings, I introduced the Global Nuclear \nSecurity Act. This legislation attacks the problem in three ways.\n\n[[Page S6062]]\n\n  First, it calls on the Departments of Energy, State, and Defense, to \ndevelop a plan to encourage countries to adhere to the highest security \nstandards for all nuclear material.\n  Second, it requires the DOE to develop a systematic approach to \nsecure radiological materials outside the United States that could be \nused to create a so-called ``dirty bomb.''\n  Third, it directs the DOE, in consultation with the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency, to \ndevelop plans for reducing the threat of terrorist attacks on nuclear \npower plants outside the United States.\n  I was pleased to work with Senators Landrieu, Roberts, Levin, and \nWarner to incorporate this legislation into the Defense Authorization \nbill.\n  Now, I am pleased to join Senator Domenici, and many other colleagues \nin supporting legislation that will build on the accomplishments of our \nthreat reduction programs and the Global Nuclear Security Act.\n  This amendment would broaden and extend several existing threat \nreduction programs.\n  Among its many provisions, it calls for the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration to increase research efforts to identify technologies \ndirected at protecting us from weapons of mass destruction.\n  It echoes my call for the NNSA to produce a plan, and to move quickly \non that plan, for expanding the nuclear material protection and control \nprogram outside of the former Soviet Union, and focusing on protection \nand control of material that could be used to create ``dirty bombs.''\n  This amendment also seeks to accelerate the disposal of highly \nenriched uranium and plutonium found around the world through a variety \nof methods.\n  Senator Domenici's amendment greatly complements the Global Nuclear \nSecurity Act.\n  And the combination of these two pieces of legislation makes this \nDefense Authorization bill stronger. Not only are we authorizing the \nAdministration to develop strategies for curbing the spread of \ndangerous materials, but we are mandating swift action to implement \nthese plans.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The amendment (No. 4009) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member. \nI believe the cross section of Senators cosponsoring the amendment \nindicates the broad support for it.\n  There is nothing more important than the United States doing its \nutmost in this era of nonproliferation, where we do everything we can \nto make sure that terrorists now, and in the future, have the most \ndifficult time getting their hands on weapons of mass destruction.\n  There is even a significant American effort in this amendment with \nreference to ``dirty'' bombs. The Senators and staff who have reviewed \nit think it gives America and the world a better chance of finding out \nwhere the components are before things happen, and sets up guidelines \nand criteria so that many different discernment points are available \nbut not just in the United States.\n  So after a lot of work on this amendment by many, I thank the Senate \nfor adopting it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend and congratulate Senator \nDomenici. He has been very active in the fight against proliferation. \nThis gives the DOE important additional capability and authority to \nhelp us win the war against proliferation. This is a very important \ncontribution to the nonproliferation effort. I was proud to cosponsor \nthis amendment. Again, I commend the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join the chairman in that commendation.\n  Regarding the Domenici amendment, I move to reconsider the vote at \nthis time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Defense authorization bill has been \nbrought to the floor by the chairman and ranking member, two Senators \nfor whom I have high regard--Senator Levin and Senator Warner. They \nhave done a masterful job for many years dealing with defense issues. I \napplaud them for their work and think they do this country a great \nservice.\n  Having said all that, I wish to speak about a number of issues \nrelated to this Defense authorization bill. This is a time, obviously, \nwhen the President has called for and the Congress will respond with an \nincrease in funding for our Nation's defenses. We are at war. We have a \nwar against terrorists, and clearly we are going to need some \nadditional funds to prosecute that war. The President has asked for the \nfunds, and we will provide them.\n  Following the attack on this country on September 11 of last year, \nthe men and women of our Armed Forces were called on once again to \ntravel far from home and serve in our Armed Forces to defend our \ncountry's interests and our liberties.\n  I have in recent months visited, as some of my colleagues have, our \nmen and women in the Armed Forces who serve in central Asia. I have \nbeen to a former Soviet airbase in Uzbekistan. I have been to Baghram \nairbase in Afghanistan. I have been to see the troops in other of the \ncountries surrounding that area of central Asia.\n  I have visited many defense installations during my time as a member \nof the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, but I have never before \nseen the kind of pride that I saw in the eyes of the men and women who \nserve our country post 9/11, serving our country in difficult \nconditions, in places far from home.\n  At an old Soviet airbase in Uzbekistan, I saw soldiers living in \ntents, walking through mud and snow up to their ankles and preparing to \nbe involved in actions and operations in Afghanistan. I could see in \ntheir eyes and hear in their voices the pride they have in serving this \ncountry in this difficult and important time.\n  I salute those men and women who are in the Armed Forces today who \nare doing dangerous work all around the world in prosecuting this war \nagainst terrorism.\n  The question for the Congress is not whether we will increase funding \nfor our defense needs--we will--the question is exactly how do we use \nthat money in a way that represents an effective investment in this \ncountry's strength and in this country's defense.\n  It is the case in this area, just as it is in other areas, that \nsimply throwing money hoping some of it will stick will not necessarily \nimprove this country's defense. So if there are areas where we just \ncast money about hoping enough of it makes some kind of a difference so \nwe can say we made a difference, I think we do not serve the taxpayers \nvery well in that circumstance. That brings me to the question of \nnational missile defense.\n  I know there is disagreement about that subject. For some time there \nhas been an appetite in the Senate to dramatically increase funds for \nnational missile defense so we can deploy very quickly a national \nmissile defense system.\n  Mr. President, from time to time I have shown my colleagues some \nitems that I keep here in my desk. The items are a piece of a backfire \nbomber wing that was sawed off a Soviet bomber not too many years ago. \nIn addition to that, I have copper wiring from a Soviet submarine. We \ngot this copper wiring from a Soviet submarine, a Russian submarine, by \ngrinding up the wiring under the Pentagon's Nunn-Lugar Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program.\n\n  The Nunn-Lugar program allows us to destroy our one-time adversary's \nweapons without firing at them. We reached arms control agreements and \nthe US and the Soviet Union agreed to reduced nuclear warheads and \ndelivery systems. Then we used the Nunn-Lugar program to help countries \nof the\n\n[[Page S6063]]\n\nformer Soviet Union actually destroy there excess weapons because they \ncould not afford to do so themselves. Because of the Nunn-Lugar program \nthere is not one missile with a nuclear warhead left in the Ukraine, \nKazakhstan or Belarus, and there are lots fewer in Russia.\n  In Russia, and in the old Soviet Union, we have large circular metal \nsaws cutting the wings off Backfire bombers. We did not shoot them \ndown. We just sawed the wings off, and we paid for it because we were \ndestroying the weapons of a former adversary and reducing nuclear \nweapons and reducing delivery systems.\n  That is one way to defend this country: Get rid of nuclear weapons \nand delivery systems around the world, reduce the stockpile of weapons \nhave threatened this country--the missiles with nuclear warheads that \nused to be targeted on American cities. On one plot in the Ukraine \nwhere there existed an SS-20 missile that was aimed at an American \ncity, there now exists sunflowers. I showed a picture of the sunflowers \none day. There used to be a missile buried underground with a nuclear \nwarhead aimed at America. It is now simply dirt with sunflowers. The \nsilo is gone. It is destroyed. The missile is gone. It is destroyed. \nAnd the nuclear weapon is dismantled. That makes good sense. That is a \ndefense program that has given us enormous rewards.\n  That is one part of defending our country: working on arms control \nand arms reduction agreements and on threat reduction programs that \nhelp pay for the destruction of delivery systems and nuclear weapons. \nThat has been enormously successful.\n  Another approach is developing and building new weapon systems, most \nof which I support. Take the F-22 fighter, for example. We now know \nwith respect to the gulf war a decade ago and with respect to the war \nin Afghanistan against the Taliban and the al-Qaida terrorists that if \nyou control the skies, you can control virtually everything.\n  The F-22, for example, is expensive, but it is the next generation of \nfighters that will allow us to control the skies, and I support it. I \nthink it makes sense. We must develop and fund those advanced systems \nthat allow us anywhere in the world to defend liberty and give our \nArmed Forces the latest weapons technology in defense of America. That \nbrings me to the question of national missile defense.\n  Missile defense has been a desire by many for a long while. Would we \nlike to have kind of a catcher's mitt of sorts by which if someone \nshoots a missile at our country we can catch it before it gets here, \nstop it, and destroy it? I think everyone in this Chamber believes that \nwould be advantageous. Of course, the technology does not exist at this \npoint. It is the equivalent of hitting a bullet with a bullet. It is a \ntechnology we have spent billions of dollars trying to develop, but it \ndoes not yet exist.\n  Some say let's keep throwing money after it as quickly as we can \npossibly throw money at it. I say, no, let's invest substantial amounts \nof money in research and development, but lets not spend more than is \njustified.\n  The chairman of the committee authorizes $6.8 billion in this \nauthorization bill--that is ``billion'' with a ``b''--to continue the \nactivities on national missile defense. That is roughly $800 million \nshort of what the administration asked for, and that is what the Senate \nis now debating.\n  It seems to me, when we take a look at the threats to this country, \nwe should get ourselves a meter. What is the threat meter? With what \nare we threatened? One threat is that a terrorist, a rogue state, or a \nterrorist group would get access to an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile, put a nuclear warhead on it, and shoot it at America.\n  We have had that threat for a long while with respect to other \ncountries. We lived for 40 years with the Soviet Union having literally \nthousands of missiles with nuclear warheads aimed at America's cities. \nWhy did they not use those missiles? Because they knew if they sent one \nmissile with a nuclear warhead into this country, we would vaporize \ntheir country because we had a deterrent capability with so many \nmissiles and so many warheads that anyone who attacked our country \nwould immediately be vaporized.\n  Nuclear exchange is an exchange no other adversary, under any \ncondition, could win. They knew that. We knew that. It was called \nmutually assured destruction.\n  Some say that does not work with terrorists, it does not work with \nrogue nations. So we must create a national missile defense system.\n  Now I speak with at least some small amount of authority in this \nChamber because I come from the only State in the United States that \nhad an antiballistic missile system built in it.\n  In the year 1972, following years of funding, this country built one \nantiballistic missile site. It was built in Nekoma, ND, a very small \ncommunity in northeastern North Dakota. If one drives there today, they \nwill see a huge concrete pyramid, and they will see other buildings \nthat are now in mothballs.\n  In 1972, we had the one and only antiballistic missile site in the \nUnited States of America. Within 30 days of its activation, it was \nmothballed. It cost billions, was operational for 30 days, and it was \nmothballed.\n  Now, that was a different technology from the one we are discussing \nnow. Back then they decided what we will do is if someone shoots \nmissiles at us we will send up an interceptor missile with a nuclear \nwarhead and we will explode that nuclear warhead up in the heavens \nsomewhere and we will destroy everything that is coming in. It was a \nvery different technology.\n  The United States decided that nuclear technology really is not \nsomething that would be workable. So now the research since 1972 has \nbeen on technology to try to find a way to hit a bullet with a bullet. \nWe have spent billions and billions of dollars to do so.\n\n  The question today for the Congress is, Do we want to spend another \n$800 million above that which the authorizing committee has authorized? \nSome say we need that. Others say, no, that is throwing money around, \nand it is not an effective investment and can be more effectively used \nin other areas. I mentioned that one threat on the threat meter is an \nincoming intercontinental ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead that \nis sent to us by a terrorist, a terrorist group, or a rogue nation. \nThat is perhaps the least likely threat, if we have a threat meter, \nthat we face.\n  Perhaps more likely would be a terrorist, a terrorist group, or a \nrogue nation getting access to a cruise missile, which would be perhaps \neasier to get access to. It is the size of a couple of 100-pound \npropane tanks with a nuclear warhead. It flies very low to the ground, \nnot very fast, following the terrain. It is more likely a terrorist \nmight get access to a cruise missile than to an ICBM.\n  Would the national missile defense system, once we get it built, \nprotect us against a terrorist's or a rogue state's cruise missile? No, \nit would not.\n  So we are planning to spend billion and billions on a national \nmissile defense to defend against ICBMs that even if it works, and it \nis highly suspect whether the technology does exist today, will not \nhelp defend us from the more likely threat posed by cruise missiles.\n  Then what about the rest of the threat meter? Let me describe the \nthreat meter these days since September 11. The threat meter shows that \nwe are much more likely to face a threat that comes in at 2 miles an \nhour rather than something that comes through at 12,000 miles an hour. \nLet me describe what that is.\n  A suspected terrorist in the Middle East about last October or \nNovember put himself in a container and had himself loaded onto a \ncontainer ship. A container ship has all of these containers. They look \nlike the box that an 18-wheel truck hauls behind it. So container ships \ncome into the ports of this country, they have all these containers \nstacked on board, and a suspected terrorist put himself in a container, \ngot himself nailed in a container.\n  He had a supply of water on board. He had a GPS. He had a radio. He \nhad a wireless computer. He had a bed. He had a toilet. He put himself \nin a container and put himself on a container ship to ship himself to \nCanada.\n  We have 5.7 million containers come into this country to our ports \nevery single year; 100,000 of them are inspected, which leaves 5.6 \nmillion that are not.\n  I saw a container one day at a port I visited. They had opened up the \nback of\n\n[[Page S6064]]\n\nthis container, picked one at random out of the ship. I said, what is \nin that container? They opened the door for me and they said that is \nfrozen broccoli from Poland.\n  I said, that is interesting. Do you know anything about what is in \nthat frozen broccoli? We see bags in the back. Do we know what is in \nthe middle of this truck or this container?\n  Well, no.\n  Do we know the conditions under which it was grown?\n  No.\n  Do we know much about it?\n  No.\n  That was one container with frozen broccoli from Poland. We get 5.7 \nmillion containers coming into this country's ports every year, and 5.6 \nmillion are not inspected. When they pull up to the dock of an American \nport, they are pulling up at 2 to 3 miles an hour with a big ship. That \nis a much more likely delivery vehicle for a weapon of mass destruction \nthan a terrorist getting ahold of an ICBM and putting a nuclear tip on \nthe top of it.\n\n  So what are we doing about that? Is there anyone who suggests we \nought to spend the money so we have some satisfaction and some feeling \nthat we are going to protect ourselves against a weapon of mass \ndestruction in a container on a container ship that comes up to a dock \nin Los Angeles or New Jersey or some other port in this country at 2 \nmiles an hour, and then is loaded on a bank of tires and is pulled by a \ntruck across the country and then sits in a lot somewhere outside a \nfactory or outside a key installation, perhaps a nuclear power plant?\n  Is anybody going to do anything about that?\n  How much money are we going to spend on that? We are told we do not \nhave enough money to solve that problem. So now we are debating $800 \nmillion on the issue of national missile defense. The authorizing \ncommittee says let's spend $6.8 billion, and others, including the \nPresident, say no we need to boost that by $800 million.\n  I look at the threat meter and I say, what are the threats and what \nare we doing to respond to those threats? Do we have enough to deal \nwith the threat of the 5.7 million containers that come into our ports \nevery year with the prospect that one of those containers might come \ninto one of those ports with a weapon of mass destruction, sent to us \nby a terrorist? Everyone knows that it is far easier to do that than to \nfind access to an ICBM with a nuclear weapon.\n  Before I close let me say a few words about the recent nuclear arms \nagreements with Russia. I give to the President my compliments that he \nis dealing with the right subject. When you reach an agreement with \nRussia with respect to nuclear weapons, that is the right subject. But \nit is not enough to have a new agreement to simply put nuclear weapons \nin storage nuclear weapons and to allow their delivery systems to be \nkept intact.\n\n  We need to be the world's leader, to try to stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons. And we need to be the world's leader in trying to \nachieve meaningful reductions in nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles.\n  Frankly, agreements just to put weapons in storage do not reduce the \nthreat. There are over 30,000 nuclear weapons in this world, and if one \nnuclear weapon is missing, just one, we have a very serious problem. If \njust one nuclear weapon gets in the wrong hands, we have a very serious \nproblem. If just one additional country becomes a country that is part \nof the club that has nuclear weapons, this country is less safe and \nthis world is less safe. It is our responsibility, this country's \nresponsibility, to lead in the area of arms control and arms \nreductions.\n  We need to do two things. I spoke about one today--and I compliment \nSenator Warner and Senator Levin--we do need to increase our funding \nfor national defense. But we need to do that in the right way that \nproduces muscle and strength for this country. That is one area.\n  Second, it is just as important we be as aggressive in this country \nin pursuit of a world leadership role because it is our job and our \nrole to reduce the spread of nuclear weapons, stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons, and reduce the number of nuclear weapons in this \nworld. If September 11 tells us anything, it ought to tell us that.\n  Mr. President, the murder of thousands of innocent Americans by \nterrorists who want to do additional harm to this country should alert \neveryone once again that we must be a world leader in stopping the \nspread of nuclear weapons. That means we must be the world leader in \nnot just mothballing or warehousing weapons, but also in reducing the \nstockpiles of nuclear weapons.\n  As we work our way through these discussions about defense, national \nmissile defense, arms reductions and arms control treaties, I hope this \ncountry understands its special obligation and also its opportunity to \nbe a leader in something that will make a big difference for this \ncountry's future and for the future of the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I inquire of the distinguished majority whip, in the \nperiod of time until the chairman and I have a consensus as to how to \nproceed, could Senators be recognized for the purpose of just debate on \nthe question related to this bill?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Virginia, I had a long conversation \nwith the manager of the bill, the chairman of the committee. Probably \nabout 12:30 we would be ready to offer the second-degree amendments. \nStaff is working as we speak.\n  It is my understanding that the two managers of the bill have a \nnumber of amendments that could be cleared. It would be appropriate to \ndo that if at all possible. The more time that goes by, the more \ndifficult it is.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am unable to hear. I would like to understand what the \nprocedure is.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Levin indicated he will offer his amendment about \n12:30, a second-degree amendment. That is the next order of business.\n  In the meantime, the comanagers will clear a number of amendments \nthey and their staffs have worked on the last several hours. And the \nSenator from Virginia asked when they completed that, prior to the time \nthat Senator Levin was available to offer the second-degree amendment, \nwould it be appropriate for others to speak on the bill. Senator Levin, \nI am sure, agrees it is totally appropriate. I want to make sure it is \ncleared. If he would want to speak, there is nothing wrong with that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think that is constructive. We are anxious to proceed \nto the extent we have amendments which are cleared. Subject to the \nchairman's desire, we can proceed to clear those. Senators would be \nfree to discuss any portion of the pending bill. I think they so \ndesire.\n  There would be an understanding, we will put it in unanimous consent \nform, that no further amendments can be offered until, say, the hour of \n12:30.\n  Mr. REID. I believe the unanimous consent request now in effect \ncovers that.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will make certain.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No amendments are in order to the Warner \namendment prior to filing the Levin second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is our understanding.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that in the time \nbetween now and when I lay down the second-degree amendment to Senator \nWarner's amendment, others be recognized to speak or we clear \namendments between now and that time. Is that in order for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Consent is not required for that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Defense \nAuthorization Act. I begin by congratulating and thanking Senators \nWarner and Levin for their leadership on this important issue to ensure \nthat our military men and women have the resources and tools to get the \nimportant job done of protecting America's homeland and our interests \nabroad.\n  I would also like to thank a colleague of ours who was called away. \nThat is Senator McCain, from Arizona. He bears the scars of battle, \nhaving served our Nation in the military. There is no one more \ndedicated to the defense of America than Senator McCain. He was \ninstrumental in the provisions of this bill that will make it possible \nfor more young Americans to serve our Nation in the military. It is \nironic that at this\n\n[[Page S6065]]\n\ntime when we face greater national security challenges than at any time \nin a generation, so few Americans, particularly young Americans, have \nserved our country in uniform.\n  Senator McCain and I would like to change that by opening up greater \navenues for Americans to serve in the military to protect this country, \nto attract America's best and brightest to military service. There are \nprovisions in this bill that will do exactly that.\n  Specifically, we establish a shorter track for military service: 15 \nmonths of active duty following basic training with the balance of the \nservice to be served in other capacities. In exchange for this, we will \nrelieve up to $18,000 of student loans for each man or woman who has \nserved in the military and goes on to higher education or has studied \nin higher education previously. In addition, we provide full 1-year GI \nbenefits following leaving the military and two-thirds of GI benefits \nfor up to 36 months following leaving active service.\n  This, colleagues, will serve as a powerful incentive for those in our \nsociety who want to get a higher education to first or subsequently \nserve in the U.S. military and the cause of protecting America.\n  At a time when a college degree is so important to success in the \nprivate sector, we believe it is equally important not only for our \nsociety as a whole but for the military particularly to attract more \nmen and women with a background in college and higher education in the \ndefense of our Nation. These provisions will accomplish exactly that.\n  In addition, I am hopeful we can use the national service provisions \nincluded in this bill as an additional motivation and incentive to \nattract more Americans to serving our country in civilian capacities as \nwell.\n  The amendment of Senator McCain and I will accomplish exactly that. \nWe will extend the AmeriCorps provisions a full fivefold, from 50,000 \nto 250,000 Americans each and every year, so that every 4-year period 1 \nmillion of our citizens, particularly young people, will have served \nour Nation in capacities that are important, and half of those new \nAmeriCorps members will be serving America in a homeland defense \ncapacity.\n  At a time when we need to secure our infrastructure, ports, airways, \nand railways, at a time when we need to protect our country against \nbiological and other threats, it is important we do so to the extent we \ncan using highly trained and motivated volunteers. It will not only \nhelp to instill the ethic of service but protect our country in \ntangible ways in a manner that is most cost effective.\n  We seek to reach out and enlist more senior citizens in the cause of \nputting something back in our society. On the cusp of the baby boom \ngeneration beginning their retirement, we will have more Americans \nliving longer, healthier lives than ever before, with more energy and \nresources to put back into this country. We think senior citizens have \na lot to offer America and will seize this opportunity to serve our \ncountry if we give it to them, as I believe we must.\n  We seek to challenge young people involved in our work/study programs \nto give back to the country that has made their higher education \npossible. Currently, only 7 percent of those involved in work/study are \nrequired to be involved in public service. Senator McCain and I seek to \nexpand that to a full 25 percent over the course of the next 9 years, \nensuring a corps of young Americans who are not only getting a higher \neducation but, in the process, building and rebuilding the country that \nhas helped to make that higher education possible.\n  In all these capacities, we seek to harness the good intentions that \nhave arisen from 9-11--the surge in patriotism, the desire to put \nsomething back in this country, to harness those intentions and to \nchannel them into concrete action that will improve America for \ngenerations to come. This Defense Authorization Act will do that in \nterms of encouraging more young Americans to serve in uniform in ways \nthat will tangibly protect this country from military aggression.\n  At the same time, we seek to enact the Call To Service Act, to \nchannel more energy into civil service as well, to help students learn, \nto help senior citizens lead independent, productive lives out of their \nhomes, and to meet the other challenges that will make our country not \nonly safe militarily but make our Nation more decent, more \ncompassionate, more just; to remember the challenges we face at home \nand meet them, just as our brave military young men and women are \nmeeting the security challenges we face abroad.\n  In summary, the call to service, whether in the military or in the \ncivilian sector, is in the finest of American traditions. It was Thomas \nJefferson who once said, in reflecting upon the accomplishments of his \nown life:\n\n       I would much prefer to be remembered for what I have been \n     privileged to do for others than for what others have so \n     kindly done for me.\n\n  This spirit of national service could not be more timely, colleagues. \nThe eyes of the world are upon us today, and they are asking: Does this \ngeneration of Americans have what it takes to sacrifice, even for a \nmoment, even in part, the ease and comfort to which we have been \naccustomed, in the cause of championing and protecting the ideals we \nclaim to cherish? I believe we can. I believe we must.\n  I thank Senators Warner and Levin for including the military \ncomponents of our service legislation within this authorization act. I \nthink it will do a lot to strengthen the military in years to come and \nwill strengthen the fabric of society as more Americans, and \nparticularly young Americans, will have had the experience of serving \nin uniform, with all that that means in forming their own citizenship \nin future years. At the same time, I urge my colleagues to carefully \nconsider and support our Call To Service Act, which would do exactly \nthe same in the civilian sector, strengthening America in ways that are \nbeyond measure.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, recently, ABC canceled country music \nsinger Toby Keith from its July Fourth TV special. They did not want \nhim to sing his song about the September 11 attacks. ``Courtesy of the \nRed, White & Blue (The Angry American).''\n  Earlier, a similar thing happened with PBS and Charlie Daniels.\n  This is a disgrace and the rankest kind of hypocrisy from these \nadvocates of free speech.\n  I therefore ask unanimous consent that the lyrics of these two \npatriotic songs by Toby Keith and Charlie Daniels be entered into the \nCongressional Record. And just for good measure, I also ask to include \nthe lyrics of another great patriotic country song from my generation, \n``Fightin' Side of Me,'' by Merle Haggard.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (Angry American)\n\n                            (By Toby Keith)\n\n     American girls

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4046 to amendment No. 4007:\n       On page 3, strike subsection (c) and insert the following:\n       ``(c) Priority for Allocating Funds.--In the expenditure of \n     additional funds made available by a lower rate of inflation, \n     the top priority shall be the use of such funds for \n     Department of Defense activities for protecting the American \n     people at home and abroad by combating terrorism at home and \n     abroad.''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, just very briefly--I know the majority \nleader wants to be recognized if he returns to the floor--the amendment \nof the Senator from Virginia specifies two purposes for additional \nfunds which would become available as a result of an adjustment to the \ninflation factor, a recalculation of the inflation factor.\n  The Senator from Virginia has been assured that at least $814 million \nwill become available. He made that representation to us yesterday. \nBased on that representation, he has offered an amendment which \nprovides that the money be spent for one of two specified purposes. \nThese are the purposes, I emphasize, that are set forth in the Warner \namendment: whichever of the following purposes the President determines \nthe money should be spent for--``(1) Research, development, test, and \nevaluation for ballistic missile defense programs of the Department of \nDefense.'' The second purpose specified in the Warner amendment is: \n``Activities of the Department of Defense for combating terrorism at \nhome and abroad.''\n  What the second-degree amendment provides is that combating terrorism \nat home and abroad is the highest priority for allocating these funds. \nProtecting the American people in this way, under the second-degree \namendment, should be the top priority for these funds.\n  We have all said that over and over again, that combating terrorism \nis now our No. 1 priority. And these funds, which will be made \navailable as a result of the readjustment of inflation, should be \ndedicated, in our judgement, to that purpose.\n  The amendment does not preclude the President from spending \nadditional funds on missile defense should he determine that is a \nhigher priority. This amendment does not preclude the President from \nreaching that judgment. It expresses our judgment that, of those two \nspecified purposes in the underlying amendment, combating terrorism is \nthe top priority to protect the American people at home and abroad.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the chairman for providing this \namendment at this time, precisely at the stroke of 12:30. We will have \nthe opportunity to examine it.\n  You have basically reached the point where you are saying that the \nPresident wants to follow the law. And if this were adopted, it is my \nunderstanding it is not the intention of the second-degree amendment, \nthe proposers of it, to in any way abrogate the flexibility to allocate \nthese funds between the two stated purposes in my amendment--namely, \nmissile defense and homeland security--in any way. In other words, he \nretains full flexibility to do so. Am I correct in that?\n  When we talked yesterday that was the purport of the amendment the \ndistinguished chairman was proffering yesterday. I presume this \namendment continues your representation that the purpose of the \namendment was not in any way to abrogate his flexibility to allocate \nbetween the two specific purposes as stated in the underlying \namendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. This second-degree amendment does two things which the \namendment I was going to offer yesterday would have done; that is, it \nstates that in our judgment, the top priority for the use of these \nfunds is to combat terrorism at home and abroad. But it does not \npreclude the President from\n\n[[Page S6067]]\n\nspending this additional money on missile defense should that be his \ndetermination. It does both of those things. It does not preclude the \nPresident from spending the money on missile defense should he reach \nthe judgment that is a higher priority than combating terrorism, that \nthose additional funds above the $7.6 billion on missile defense is a \nhigher priority than combating terrorism. This amendment would not \npreclude him from doing that, but the heart of this amendment remains \nas it was last night, expressing our judgment--that is, between these \ntwo specified purposes in the underlying amendment--that the top \npriority is combating terrorism at home and abroad.\n  The majority leader is in the Chamber.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could add further, that is the proportions of the \nallocation--it is implicit in there--he can make the allocation in such \nproportions to the two accounts as he deems appropriate?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The President is not precluded by this language from \nreaching a different conclusion and allocating as he chooses. It is \npretty clear what our judgment is as to the top priority. That is the \npurpose of this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my colleague. We will examine \nthis amendment. Yesterday, at one point we were willing to accept the \nsecond degree. Let's see whether or not that can be achieved in the \nnear future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, let me compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan for his work in accommodating the dual priorities \nour two managers have attempted to address over the course of the last \ncouple of days as we consider the issue of missile defense and the need \nto ensure adequate resources for homeland defense.\n  We are debating what may be one of the most significant amendments to \none of the most important pieces of legislation to come before the \nSenate this year. I am surprised, frankly, that objections have been \nraised to the Levin amendment. Both the Warner and Levin amendments \nagree that if additional resources become available to the Pentagon, \nonly two programs, missile defense and counterterrorism, would be \neligible for these resources.\n  The only difference, as has just been described in the colloquy \nbetween our two colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, the only \ndifference is that Senator Levin's amendment would put Congress on \nrecord that combating terrorism should be our top priority.\n  After what America and the world witnessed on September 11 and the \nsubsequent actions discussed in reports from intelligence agencies \nsince, I question how anybody could challenge that this should be our \ntop priority.\n  How could anyone think, in the short term at least, we are more \nlikely to be a target of a ballistic missile attack than another \nterrorist incident? The heinous terrorist attacks of September 11 did \nnot involve ballistic missiles, and none of the warnings of possible \nfuture attacks issued by this administration since September 11 even \nmentioned the possibility of a ballistic missile attack.\n  The steady stream of recent warnings from this administration have \nwarned us about crop dusters, gasoline trucks, shoe bombers, ``dirty'' \nbombers, attacks on our financial institutions, shopping malls, nuclear \npowerplants, and large apartment buildings. All of these have been \ncited as possible attacks. More money for ballistic missile defense \nwould not make any of them more preventable.\n  This debate is about the best use of our national resources to \nprotect our national security. It is not about whether to proceed with \nthe construction of a missile defense facility at Fort Greeley, AK. \nAlthough I have many questions about the merit of and need for this \nfacility, the underlying bill already fully funds the administration's \nproposal for constructing this test site.\n  This debate is not about whether to provide missile defense with \nbillions of dollars, although I have concerns that a huge missile \ndefense program could crowd out funding for more important security \nprograms such as counterproliferation and homeland defense. The \nunderlying bill already provides missile defense with $6.8 billion, \neasily making it the largest acquisition program in the Pentagon's \nentire budget.\n  And, if this body adopts both the Warner and Levin amendments, it \nwill be possible for missile defense to receive additional resources if \nthey become available.\n  Nor is this debate about the proper timetable for deploying missile \ndefense. Although I have strong reservations that the administration's \nrush to deployment could have some negative ramifications for our \nsecurity, the underlying bill does nothing that would affect the \nadministration's timetable for deploying missile defense.\n  In short, this debate is not about who supports missile defense. In \nfact, where one stands on these amendments bears no relation to how one \nfeels about missile defense. I strongly support a substantial missile \ndefense program and the Levin amendment. Anyone who believes there is \nsomething inconsistent about this should read the underlying bill and \nthe amendments before us.\n\n  Rather, the pending amendments raise a larger, more fundamental \nquestion. In particular, what is the most immediate action we can take \nto make America more secure? Providing the funds that will help us \ndismantle al-Qaida and prevent acts of terrorism, or providing funds \nbeyond the $6.8 billion already in this bill to help us deploy a \nmissile defense system at some point in the future? That is the \nquestion. Your answer ought to be the former, not the latter.\n  We should all be able to agree that terrorism is a threat that \nconfronts us here and now. Therefore, I hope my colleagues will make \nfighting terrorism their first priority.\n  I support the Levin amendment. I congratulate him on drafting it. I \nurge our colleagues to support it as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I listened very carefully to the \ndistinguished majority leader's comments. I am not so certain we have \nany major differences. I assure you, this administration and, indeed, \nthe Senate as a whole is focused, as it should be, on homeland defense \nand taking those measures to protect the American people here at home \nand, indeed, abroad. There is no lack of emphasis I can find in the \noverall framework of legislative proposals now in law and hopefully to \nbe enacted in law, making it very clear this President, under his \nleadership, is moving on a number of fronts to combat terrorism in the \nUnited States and where it affects our citizens abroad.\n  Yes, I listened carefully, and others have mentioned the warnings we \nare receiving. They do address the weaponry--the weapons that are known \nto be in the hands of those who have interests antithetical to our \ngreat United States, our people, our freedom, and our way of life.\n  But in this particular bill, as it relates to missile defense, we are \nlooking into the future. There are many signs that clearly justify \nactions being taken, hopefully by this legislation, and to begin to \ntake those steps to put in place such defenses as our technology can \ndevise, and promptly, which would enable us to provide a limited \nsystem--not some giant umbrella but a limited system of defenses \nagainst a limited attack of missiles.\n  So we are looking to the future. I share with the distinguished \nleader the fact that we have to forewarn our citizens today with regard \nto the weaponry available, whether it is biological, chemical, or \npossibly some mocked-up type of nuclear weapon by a rogue nation or \nsome terrorist organization. I think we are all pulling together in the \nsame direction.\n  I hope we can address these amendments very promptly. I ask for a \nreasonable period of time within which to address the second-degree \namendment.\n  I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to speak about the amendment \nproposed by the Senator from Virginia and the second-degree amendment \nproposed by the Senator from Michigan.\n  As I understand the amendment of the Senator from Virginia, it does \nseveral things. First, it assumes there will be approximately $814 \nmillion in savings because of the inflation figures. Then it sets up \ntwo categories of funding that this extra money, if found, is\n\n[[Page S6068]]\n\nto be used for: missile defense or counterterrorism activities.\n  But then at the end of the amendment, it proposes to set the \npriorities for allocating these scarce resources. As I read the \npriority, it is everything that the Department of Defense does, because \nthe priority would be activities for combating terrorism and protecting \nthe American people at home and abroad.\n  I suggest--and I doubt anyone would argue--that the crew of an \nAmerican nuclear submarine patrolling the depths of the Atlantic or the \nPacific are protecting Americans at home and abroad. I argue that \nMarine guards in embassies throughout the world are protecting \nAmericans. I argue that troops that are training for possible \ndeployments overseas are protecting Americans at home and abroad.\n  The fact is that this priority is no priority at all. The fact is, \nthis debate is a debate about whether we will use extra resources to \nfight terrorism or for a national missile defense shield. If you ask \nany American, their answer would be obvious and automatic: Protect us \nfrom terrorism. Why? I don't know if they have read the national \nintelligence estimate of December 2001. It says:\n\n       In fact, U.S. territory is more likely to be attacked with \n     [weapons of mass destruction] from non-missile delivery \n     means--most likely from terrorists--than by missiles, \n     primarily because non-missile delivery means are less \n     costly, easier to acquire, more reliable and accurate. \n     They can also be used without attribution.\n\n  They might not have read in detail the national intelligence \nestimate, but that is what our intelligence officials are telling us: \nThe most likely and immediate threat is terrorists attacking us, and \nperhaps with weapons of mass destruction, but not an intercontinental \nballistic missile attack on the United States.\n  On September 23, 2001, a few days after September 11, the Federal \nAviation Administration grounded crop duster aircraft nationwide \nbecause of concerns that they might be used in chemical or biological \nterrorist attacks. This marks the third time since the September 11 \nterrorist attacks that crop duster aircraft have been grounded. The \nother two groundings were from September 11 through September 14, and \nfrom September 16 through September 17.\n  Again, ask yourself, is that a threat that national missile defense \ncan prepare for? I should add that, as the Senator from Virginia said, \nwe are concerned about the future; but this authorization is for next \nyear. This issue is what funds will be spent next year--the extra funds \nthat will be available. This year and next year, the American people \nwill say unhesitatingly: Protect us from terrorism. That was September \n23, 2001.\n  October 11, 2001: The Federal Bureau of Investigation issues a \nwarning that there may be additional terrorist attacks in the United \nStates and against U.S. interests overseas in the next several days.\n  I do not suspect that any of those warnings were tied into the use of \nan intercontinental ballistic missile to attack.\n  October 29: The Federal Bureau of Investigation issues a warning that \nthere may be additional terrorist attacks in the United States and \nagainst U.S. interests overseas in the next several days and that \nAmericans and police should be on the highest alert.\n  Again, that is not coupled with any specific indication that an \nintercontinental ballistic missile would be involved.\n  December 3, 2001: Director of the Office of Homeland Security Tom \nRidge at a White House press briefing said: `` . . . the quantity and \nlevel of threats are above the norm and have reached a threshold where \nwe should once again place the public on general alert, just as we have \ndone on two previous occasions since September 11th.''\n  December 22: Flight attendants and passenger subdue a man reportedly \ntrying to set his shoes on fire on American Airlines Flight 63 from \nParis to Miami carrying 185 passengers and 12 crew members. The plane \nis diverted to Boston's Logan International Airport, escorted by two \nU.S. Air Force F-15 fighter jets. Boston Airport authorities say the \nman appears to have been carrying C-4, a powerful plastic explosive, in \nhis shoes. The suspect is identified as Richard C. Reid on his British \npassport.\n  Once again, ask yourself, if you are allocating money, do you \nallocate it to screening passengers better, or to x-ray baggage better, \nor to doing things for a national missile defense?\n  January 29, 2001: In his State of the Union Address before Congress, \nPresident George W. Bush says U.S. forces in Afghanistan `` . . . have \nfound diagrams of American nuclear power plants and public water \nfacilities, detailed instructions for making chemical weapons, \nsurveillance maps of American cities, and thorough descriptions of \nlandmarks in America and throughout the world.'' Warning that \n``thousands of dangerous killers . . . often supported by outlaw \nregimes, are now spread throughout the world . . . '' The President \npromises to continue the war on terrorism at home and abroad.\n\n  Were those plans and diagrams used to target an ICBM, or were they \nused to infiltrate terrorists into the U.S. to attack those facilities?\n  January 31, 2002: An internal alert warning that Islamic terrorists \nare planning a major attack against American targets appears in a \nclassified document issued by U.S. intelligence agencies. The alert \nreportedly specifies several potential methods of attack and targets: a \nnuclear powerplant or nuclear facility bombing, bombing a U.S. warship \nin Bahrain, a suicide airliner attack on a building, and bombing a \nvehicle in Yemen.\n  Again, none of those threats raise an ICBM attack, or even a theater \nmissile attack on the United States.\n  February 11: Federal Bureau of Investigation issues a warning that \nmore terrorist attacks may take place within the United States and \nagainst U.S. interests in the country of Yemen on or around February \n12, 2000. In its warning, the FBI specifically identifies Yemeni \nnational Fawaz Yahya al-Rabeei and several of his associates as \nsuspects, and Yemen as their possible target based on information \ngathered an detainee interrogations at Camp X-Ray on the U.S. Navy base \nat Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and in Afghanistan. The warning advises \nAmericans and law enforcement agencies to be on the highest alert and \nrequests help in identifying these suspected terrorists.\n  April 19: Federal Bureau of Investigation issues a terrorist threat \nalert identifying U.S. financial institutions in the Northeast as \npossible targets.\n  April 24: The FBI issues a terrorist threat alert identifying \nshopping malls and other public places as possible targets, according \nto news sources.\n  May 13: U.S. authorities have received reports from different \nintelligence sources of a threatened July 4, 2002, attack against an \nundetermined U.S. nuclear powerplant in the Northeast by al-Qaida \nterrorists.\n  May 20: FBI Director Robert Mueller tells a gathering of the National \nDistrict Attorneys Association that walk-in suicide bombings, such as \nthose that have taken place in Israel, are likely to occur in the U.S. \nThe Director says, ``We see that in the future. I think it is \ninevitable.''\n  News sources report that the FBI has issued informal warnings that \nterrorists might rent apartments at large apartment complexes, pack the \napartments with explosives, and detonate them.\n  Ask yourself: How much will a missile defense system protect us \nagainst a suicide bomber walking into a mall or walking in and \nexploding an apartment building?\n  May 21: The FBI issues a terrorist threat warning to New York law \nenforcement agencies that it has received ``unsubstantiated and \nuncorroborated information that terrorists are considering attacks \nagainst landmarks in New York City.''\n  May 28: Hans Beth, director of the antiterrorism and organized crime \ndivision at Germany's BND foreign intelligence service, says at a \nconference in Bonn, Germany, that the al-Qaida terrorist network is \nactive, regrouping, and recruiting new members, according to the \nAssociated Press. The director says:\n\n       We believe that bin Laden himself and several of his \n     confidants are still around to give the impulses for attacks.\n\n  May 29: Customs Commissioner Robert Bonner, in an Associated Press \ninterview, says that every Customs inspector will be equipped by \nJanuary 2003 with a pocketsize radiation detector, and that Customs is \nworking with\n\n[[Page S6069]]\n\nother countries to screen cargo containers before they are shipped to \nthe United States. The Commissioner cautions, however, that ``there are \nno guarantees'' that improved border security will prevent a terrorist \nfrom smuggling a nuclear weapon into the United States.\n  Again, this is not something with which a national missile defense \nsystem could cope and for which it is not even designed.\n  May 30: New sources report that the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nissued an alert on May 22, 2002, to Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement agencies warning that al-Qaida terrorists may be trying to \ntarget commercial aircraft by using shoulder-fired antiaircraft \nmissiles. Reportedly, the warning was issued after U.S. military \npersonnel found a spent portable missile tube outside the Prince Sultan \nAir Base in Saudi Arabia earlier in May 2002.\n  May 31: The Washington Times reports that classified U.S. Government \nintelligence reports indicate that Islamic terrorists may have smuggled \nportable shoulder-fired Russian SA-7 surface-to-air missiles or U.S. \nStinger antiaircraft missiles into the United States.\n  Again, ask yourself how we should be allocating extra funds to \nprotect the people of the United States if those funds become \navailable.\n  June 7: Reuters News Service reports that CDR Jim McPherson, a U.S. \nCoast Guard spokesman, says the Coast Guard issued a warning to all of \nits units to be on alert during the June 7 through 9 weekend for \n``possible acts of terrorism targeting the Nation's ports, bays, \nrivers, and shores.''\n  June 10: Attorney General John Ashcroft announces the disruption of \n``an unfolding terrorist plot to attack the United States by exploding \na radioactive `dirty bomb.' ''\n  June 12: CBS News reports the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nissued a June 6, 2002, security alert instructing INS agents at U.S. \nairports, borders, and ports to do ``[a] complete and thorough search \nof all baggage'' carried by Yemeni travelers, except those carrying \ndiplomatic passports, and make ``an inventory of all effects.'' The \norder was reportedly prompted by the discovery of several thermos \nbottles--some rigged with batteries and wire--during a raid in the \nnortheastern United States of an apartment that housed several Yemeni \nnationals. The alert instructed agents to look for ``large sums of \ncurrency, night vision goggles, or devices.'' It also warned against \nagents opening any thermos bottles.\n  June 14: A suicide bomber drives a car filled with explosives into a \nguard post outside the U.S. Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan, killing 11 \nPakistanis and injuring at least 45 people, including one U.S. marine \nwho was slightly wounded by flying debris.\n  June 16: The Washington Post reports that three Saudis seized in \nMorocco told interrogators that they fled Afghanistan and came to \nMorocco on a mission to use bomb-laden speedboats for suicide attacks \non U.S. and British warships in the Strait of Gibraltar. The three \nSaudi men were captured in May 2002 in a joint Moroccan-Central \nIntelligence Agency operation.\n\n  June 21: The Federal Bureau of Investigation issues a terrorist \nthreat alert warning that terrorists might be plotting to use fuel \ntankers to attack undetermined Jewish neighborhoods and synagogues, \naccording to the Associated Press.\n  June 25: The New York Times reports that, according to congressional \nofficials, Capitol Police in Washington, DC, are stockpiling up to \n25,000 gas masks to protect tourists, lawmakers, and their staffs in \ncase of a terrorist attack.\n  If you ask the American people how this money should be prioritized, \nthe answer is clear, overwhelming, and irrefutable. The highest \npriority should be the war against terrorism, certainly at this moment \nand certainly in this next fiscal year. As a result, I believe Senator \nLevin's amendment is not only crucial but essential so that the \ndirection, at least the sense of this Congress, is clear. I hope we \nwill support this second degree amendment.\n  In addition, I should point out again that we are robustly funding \nmissile defense activities. We have done that. Our proposal is $6.8 \nbillion for fiscal year 2003. We expect an additional $4 billion to be \navailable since it was not spent last year. This gives us in the next \nfiscal year over $10 billion to use on national missile defense--\ntheater missile programs, national missile programs, boost phase, \nmidcourse phase, terminal phase, the latest system which this \nadministration is pursuing. That is adequate and sufficient in our \nview, but in addition, as Senator Levin pointed out, recognizing the \ntop priority of terrorism, the language still would allow, even as \namended, some resources to be devoted to additional national missile \ndefense activity, if the President determines that.\n  Having listened to this litany of warning emanating from the \nadministration itself, it is hard to think that there is a higher \npriority at this moment and next year than counterterrorism.\n  We have supported robust activities to test and deploy missile \ndefense systems. There is full support for the Alaskan system. There is \nfull support for research, experimentation, and testing. In fact, we \nhave added money to these categories.\n  We have added money for the Arrow missile, an important theater \nmissile system we are developing jointly with the Israelis.\n  We have added money for radars for Navy sea-based systems.\n  What we have cut are those ill-defined, duplicative programs that are \nnot going to advance, we feel, the development of this missile system, \nand we are looking to the future.\n  A $10 billion investment next year, a combination of our \nauthorization and residual funds, is an important downpayment, a \nsubstantial, robust downpayment on a future system that will counter \nfuture threats.\n  What we are suggesting in this bill is that when you look closely at \nthe suggestions and recommendations of the Department of Defense with \nrespect to terrorism operations and contingencies, there is a long list \nof items not funded. Senator Levin's priority and my priority would be \nto fund these counterterrorism activities.\n  There is, for example, $871 million for improved security on the list \nof unfunded priorities by the services. The Special Operations Command \nfound an additional shortfall of $42 million in items that they could \nnot provide to protect units fully, from their perspective, against \nterrorism on their installations.\n\n  The second item, for example, on the Air Force list of unfunded items \nis $149 million for improved physical security at its bases.\n  The Navy's list included an additional $263 million for improvements \nto Navy installations.\n  The Army identified $110 million of unfunded force protection needs.\n  These funds will be used to protect military installations, naval \nstations, shipyards, fencing off installations, airfields, and keeping \nintruders away. All of them are very necessary. But because we were \nmaking difficult judgments about priorities--and that is what our job \nis--we could not fund these compelling needs. I suggest if there are \ninflation savings, that is where they should go, and that is what the \nLevin amendment will direct, suggest, at least make as the policy of \nthis Congress: That our highest priority is counterterrorism.\n  In addition to this $914 million of unfunded force protection \nrequirements, the services and Special Operations Command identified \n$184 million in unfunded priorities for defending against and managing \nthe consequences of attacks using weapons of mass destruction.\n  As a national intelligence estimate suggests, if such an attack takes \nplace within the foreseeable future, it will not be as a result of a \nmissile strike, but terrorists detonating some type of weapon of mass \ndestruction in the United States. Our services are asking us for $184 \nmillion to respond, to defend against, and manage the consequences of \nsuch an attack. The Marine Corps, for example, identified over $27 \nmillion in shortfalls for their chemical and biological incident \nresponse force. The Air Force had an unfunded priority of $92 million \nfor equipping installation first responders to manage WMD attacks.\n  The Navy had a $20 million unfunded priority of this same line, the \nfirst responders within the services to respond to a weapons of mass \ndestruction attack. The Air Force also had a $33 million unfunded \nrequirement for bolstering the defenses of their personnel\n\n[[Page S6070]]\n\nagainst weapons of mass destruction attack, and Special Operations \nCommand had a $12 million shortfall for counterterrorism activities. If \nwe add the $914 million of unfunded priorities related to protecting \nthe Armed Forces by attack from terrorists to the $184 million of \nunfunded priorities related to defeating and managing WMD attacks, we \nreach a total of over $1 billion.\n  So it is clear that the Special Operations Command have urgent, \nindeed critical, need to combat terrorism.\n  So when we pass legislation that says there are two categories of \nspending for additional resources made available through inflation \nsavings, one is missile defense, and one is combating terrorism, I \nthink we need the Levin amendment to say our highest priority is \ncombating terrorism, equipping our military forces to protect \nthemselves and to protect us, at a minimum. But we also understand, \neven if we are able to provide these resources to our Department of \nDefense, where are the additional resources for the Department of \nCommerce to make sure that all of their activities complement and \nsupplement the activities of the Department of Defense? What about the \nCoast Guard? Do they have enough resources to protect all of our ports? \nWhat about the FAA installing additional security measures in airports? \nAll of these priorities are immediate, extraordinarily important, and \nhave to be addressed.\n  We have the opportunity today to make it clear that if these \nresources are available, they will be going to the most immediate, the \nmost dire, threat we face, based upon our intelligence estimates, based \nupon the numerous statements by the administration, and we should do \nthat confident we are providing a robust funding source for national \nmissile defense development in every phase of their multilayered \noperation.\n  I hope my colleagues will support enthusiastically the Levin \namendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I sometimes think we are like ships in \nthe night as we discuss this issue and what the priorities of this \ncountry ought to be. I know Senator Reed is an esteemed colleague and a \ncapable advocate, but I would like to talk about a few of the things he \nsaid that I think really do not give us the right perspective.\n  Of course, terrorism is the No. 1 issue. We voted on a $40 billion \nFY01 supplemental budget. We have an FY02 supplemental in conference. A \nhuge part of what we are spending in defense, transportation, and in \nall agencies of our Government, from the FBI to the CIA, is focused on \nsecuring this homeland. The arguments the Senator from Rhode Island \nmake that suggests any other expenditure is not as valuable as homeland \ndefense and that we can spend on nothing else apparently but homeland \ndefense I do not believe are sound.\n  In other words, are we going to stop all R for missile defense? Are \nwe going to stop developing the future combat system we have been \nworking on down the road that may be a decade in development? Are we \njust going to stop that because we have an immediate threat? The Navy's \nDD(X)program or other weapons systems we are developing, the new and \nsuperbly efficient precision guided munitions, should we continue to \ndevelop them? Well, of course we should.\n  We cannot stop all that because we are into this war on terrorism. We \nneed to fund every dime that is needed on homeland defense. As a matter \nof fact, I just left a hearing in Judiciary where we heard from \nGovernor Ridge as he laid out the proposal to completely reorganize our \nGovernment, one of the biggest reorganizations in the history of the \nU.S. Government. The homeland security Cabinet agency that is being \nproposed by President Bush would be an unprecedented move to focus a \nhost of existing Federal agencies on one thing: Making sure their top \npriority is defending America.\n\n  Back in 1999, a study done by a commission authorized by Congress \ncame back and unanimously concluded we are under a growing threat from \nnations around the world, that 16 nations now have missile capability--\nmany of them are developing long-range capability--and that by 2005 \nthis Nation will be faced with and vulnerable to a missile attack. That \nis a reality with which we are faced.\n  We voted in this Senate 97 to 3--and I quote--to deploy a national \nmissile defense system as soon as technologically feasible. President \nClinton signed that and supported it. Vice President Gore supported it \nduring the past campaign. Senator Joe Lieberman, his Vice Presidential \ncandidate, has been a champion of establishing a national missile \ndefense system. President Bush made it a priority in his campaign, and \nhe spoke openly about it. I submit this past election by the American \npeople affirmed that commitment.\n  So the President proposed a larger budget. Last year, he proposed \n$7.8 billion for national missile defense, $2.5 billion more than \nPresident Clinton had proposed over his $5.3 billion budget.\n  This year, he is proposing roughly $200 million less for national \nmissile defense, but fundamentally the President has laid out a \nsophisticated, long-term plan to get us prepared by the rapidly \napproaching time when we will be vulnerable to a potential missile \nattack.\n  I know one of my colleagues quoted from the National Intelligence \nEstimate by the CIA on foreign missile developments that was issued \nearlier this year, and some other things in that report that I think \nare noteworthy. This is what the report says:\n\n       The probability that a missile with a weapon of mass \n     destruction will be used against the United States forces or \n     interests is higher today than during most of the cold war.\n\n  That was when we were facing the Russians and their missiles.\n\n       And it will continue to grow as the capabilities of our \n     potential adversaries mature.\n\n  Is there anybody in this body who is sorry we invested money in \nprecision guided munitions? Are they sorry we invested money in \ndeveloping a satellite system that has been the key to our \ncommunications and our military capabilities in Afghanistan? Are they \nsorry we developed bombers capable of delivering those things in the \npast, recognizing it would be necessary in the future? So that is what \nwe are talking about: How do we get ready for this?\n  The report adds further comments:\n\n       Some of the states--these are countries--armed with \n     missiles have exhibited a willingness to use chemical weapons \n     with other delivery means. In addition, some non-state \n     entities are seeking chemical, biological, radiological and \n     nuclear materials and would be willing to use them in other \n     ways than employing them simply on a missile. In fact, the \n     U.S. territory is more likely to be attacked on the ground \n     with these materials primarily because a non-missile delivery \n     system is less costly, easier to acquire and more reliable \n     and accurate. They can also be used without attribution. \n     Nevertheless, the missile threat will continue to grow, in \n     part because missiles have become important regional weapons \n     in the arsenals of numerous countries. Moreover, missile \n     systems provide a level of prestige, coercive diplomacy and \n     deterrence that non-missile systems do not.\n\n  We are dealing with a threat that is developing and is really here to \nsome degree right now. We need to recognize that.\n\n  I point out some of the other testimony we have heard in the Armed \nServices Committee. In addition to the 1999 Rumsfeld report, we have \nreceived a number of other bits of information and important reports in \nthe Armed Services Committee and I am sure in the Intelligence \nCommittee and Foreign Affairs Committee. These are areas I share with \nMembers as we think about the question of the type of threats we face \nfrom hostile nations with missiles.\n  Vice Admiral Wilson, the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, \nin his testimony about Iran, said that they continue ``the development \nand acquisition of longer range missiles and weapons of mass \ndestruction''--that is nuclear, biological, chemical weapons--``to \ndeter the United States and to intimidate Iran's neighbors.'' Also, he \nsays: Iran is buying and developing longer range missiles.\n  They are buying these missiles and developing these missiles right \nnow. This is a nation the President referred to as part of the ``axis \nof evil,'' a nation whose government is not in the hands of its people, \nand a nation which could veer off into the extreme at any time. Admiral \nWilson further notes that Iran already has chemical weapons and is \n``pursuing biological and nuclear capability.''\n\n[[Page S6071]]\n\n  Admiral Wilson concludes on Iran that it will ``likely acquire a full \nrange of weapons of mass destruction capabilities, field substantial \nnumbers of ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, including perhaps an \nICBM,'' capable of reaching this country. That is what they are seeking \nto do. That is what we need to prepare for today. We do not need to end \nup in 2005, 2006, or 2007 being totally vulnerable to a missile attack \nfrom Iran.\n  With regard to Iraq, Admiral Wilson said:\n\n       Baghdad continues to work on short-range 150 kilometer \n     missiles and can use this expertise for future long-range \n     missile development.\n\n  Is that not a threat to us? It troubles me. He adds:\n\n       Iraq may also have begun to reconstitute a chemical and \n     biological weapons program.\n\n  That seems to be clear. He has rejected any inspection that he at one \ntime agreed to.\n  Admiral Wilson continues:\n\n       It is possible that Iraq could develop and test an ICBM \n     capable of reaching the United States by 2015.\n\n  On North Korea, Admiral Wilson said:\n\n       North Korea continues to place heavy emphasis on the \n     improvement of its military capabilities and continues its \n     robust efforts to develop more capable ballistic missiles. \n     They made a good deal of progress, as everyone knows and read \n     in the papers, about the launches they have demonstrated.\n\n  Specifically, as to North Korea, Admiral Wilson said:\n\n       It is developing an ICBM capability with its Tapeo Dong 2 \n     missile, judged capable of delivering a several hundred \n     kilogram payload to Alaska or Hawaii and a lighter payload to \n     the western half of the United States.\n\n  This is one of the most bizarre nations in the world, or in the \nhistory of the world. I was in South Korea in January 2002. I was on \nthe DMZ. I saw what was occurring. It is one of the most dramatic \ndemonstrations anyone could ever see on the difference between a free \nsociety and a totalitarian Communist society. The people of North Korea \ncannot feed themselves. Yet their obsessed leadership is driving the \nnation to spend more and more money on missiles, technology, and war \nwhile their people cannot feed themselves. Go just south of that DMZ in \nSouth Korea. I was in Seoul and traveled around that country. We \nvisited our military people. It is a nation of impressive progress. \nThey are producing some of the finest materials and products the world \nknows. I was pleased this year South Korea announced they would invest \n$1 billion in my State of Alabama to build an automobile plant. They \ncontinue to have greater increases in sales than almost any other \nautomobile country.\n\n  This is free South Korea compared to the totalitarian north.\n  I asked why we could not send messages to the group in North Korea, \ndo a Radio Free Europe-type message, to get our message out and maybe \ndestabilize this regime. I was told the television stations only have \ntwo or three channels, and those are all government channels. You \ncannot even turn to another channel. The same is true with the radio. \nIt is virtually impossible to get an outside message in there. People \nare afraid that the leadership in North Korea could act in a bizarre \nand illogical way and even trigger an attack on the United States.\n  For example, Admiral Wilson noted that North Korea ``probably has the \ncapability to field an ICBM within the next couple of years.''\n  That is frightening. When our President gets into a dispute, an \nargument, a disagreement with the leadership in North Korea or Iraq or \nIran, and they end up in the final analysis saying: You do that, and we \nare going to launch our missiles, and you know we can hit your cities \nand you have no defense.\n  It affects our foreign policy and affects deeply the ability of the \nPresident to lead and be bold and courageous on behalf of the just \ninterests of the United States and freedom in the world.\n  He also noted with regard to North Korea that they continue to \n``proliferate weapons of mass destruction, especially missile \ntechnology.'' So they are selling missile technology around the world \nto countries, leaving them, although they may not have the development \ncapability, leaving them capable of threatening us.\n  CIA Director George Tenet, March 19 of this year--and the reports I \nhave been reading from earlier this year--March 19, Director Tenet said \nthis about the Chinese military: They announced a 17.6-percent increase \nin defense spending replicating last year's increase of 17.7 percent. \nIf this trend continues, China could double its announced defense \nspending between 2000 and 2005.\n  Tenet, on China, continues that they are near ``toward fielding its \nfirst generation of road mobile strategic missiles, the DF-31, a longer \nrange version capable of reaching targets in the United States that \nwill become operational later in the decade.''\n  Those are some of the reasons we made a decision in 1999 to start now \nto develop a missile defense system. We have a clear threat to our \nmilitary in the field. They are subject to the shorter range missiles, \nthe 150-kilometer type missiles. Those type threats are also important. \nThe proposal floated earlier that came out of committee, unfortunately, \non a party line vote, would have cut our research into THAAD, our \ntheater missile defense system. We cannot put our troops in the \nbattlefield and have them subject to missile attack. We lost more \npeople from missile attack in the gulf war than anything else. It is \ndefinitely a threat to us and our allies in the region. We need our \nallies to know we can deploy missile defense systems in the case of \ncombat in their region that can give them hope of being protected from \nattack, or how can they support us when they go forward? We need to go \nforward with this.\n  I believe if we can give the President the authority to go forward, \nwe will have done a good day's work.\n  Frankly, I do not want to vote, and I hope we are not required to \ncast a vote that says this is less important than other defense \nspending items. I think it is part of the whole defense bill. I think \nit is critical to our national defense. I think it is an integral part \nof it.\n\n  I would not like to have a vote here to say we think it is not \ncritical, that it is not somehow as important as any other effort to \ndefend America. But I do say it appears we are making some progress. I \nhope we can reach an agreement on this.\n  The American people expect us to protect this country. The American \npeople still do not fully understand we have absolutely no defense \nagainst incoming missiles. When they are told that, and when this \nmatter is discussed with them, and when they are told that we have an \nofficer such as Lieutenant General Ron Kadish, directing this program \nproviding it extraordinary leadership, professionalism, and production, \nand that he is moving this national missile defense program forward and \nwill soon be able to deploy a successful missile defense system, they \nare frustrated some might try and slow down the progress needed to \nprovide the nation the protection it requires. That is where we need to \ngo.\n  Let's protect our homeland through attacks on terrorism around the \nglobe. Let's harden our defenses here at home in every way possible. \nLet's also continue this steady development of a national missile \ndefense system that can save the lives of innocent Americans who are \nnow vulnerable to attack.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, \nI rise in support of the Levin second degree to Senator Warner's \namendment restoring $814 million either to the President's missile \ndefense request or to combating terrorism. Senator Levin's amendment \nclarifies what we know to be true, that the need to address the scourge \nof terrorism is urgent and is the top priority of our Nation.\n  I want to mention that I do have some concerns about Senator Warner's \namendment. I am not aware of the committee receiving any information \nfrom the administration that the suggested savings from inflation might \nin fact be realized. I sincerely hope that we are not just talking \nabout ``funny money,'' and that we could be sure that the funds are \nthere before we start talking about how to spend them.\n  The Levin amendment makes clear that, while both missile defense and \nefforts to defeat terrorism are important, our priorities are obvious. \nLet me be clear, I do understand the need to defend our country against \nmissile attack. I believe that all of us here in\n\n[[Page S6072]]\n\nthis chamber would do everything in our power to ensure that U.S. \ncitizens are protected against vicious attacks from those who would do \nus harm, including those who would launch those attacks with missiles. \nHowever, I believe that the reductions taken in this bill to the \nPresident's fiscal year 03 budget request for the missile defense \nprogram are judicious and based on sound reasoning. I support a missile \ndefense effort that is sensible, thoroughly tested, and progresses in a \nrational manner. I believe that the $6.8 billion included in this bill \nprovides ample funding for reasonable missile defense efforts.\n  I also believe that there are many immediate threats that we know all \ntoo well. The horror of September 11 is seared forever in our minds and \nshows what these terrorists are capable of. If additional funds become \navailable, I believe we have no choice but to direct them to actions we \ncan take immediately to help us win the war on terror.\n  As chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, I am acutely aware of the \ncosts incurred by the Department of Defense as we continue to send our \nmilitary men and women around the globe to hunt down terrorists. Even \nbeyond the supplemental appropriations which may be provided this year \nand funds for the war already included in this bill, the military \nservices still have war-related needs that are not being met. When we \nbegan consideration of the fiscal year 2003 budget, the Chiefs of Staff \nof the Army and Air Force, the Chief of Naval Operations, and the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps provided us with a prioritized list of \nthose needs that remain unfunded.\n  For those who may not have had a chance to review those lists, let me \nnote just a few examples. Over the last few years, we have suffered \nrepeated attacks on U.S. embassies overseas, on the USS Cole, and on \nKhobar Towers. These attacks make clear that terrorists will strike \nU.S. assets all over the world, and that we have been engaged in this \nwar for longer than we realized. September 11 showed us that we can no \nlonger assume we are safe within our own borders, and that they will \ntry to attack us here at home as well. We are a trusting nation, and, \nafter the earlier attacks, had expected to improve the security of our \nmilitary installations over time. The atrocities of September 11 made \nit clear that time may be a luxury we no longer have. If in fact these \ninflation savings are real, one of the key areas where the money could \ngo is for anti-terrorism and force protection improvements to our bases \nand installations.\n  The Service Chiefs agree--the Army, Navy and Air Force included $863 \nmillion for improved security for our installations in their list of \nunfunded priorities for fiscal year 2003. The second item on the Air \nForce's list was $491 million to improve physical security systems at \nits bases, to enhance its detection capabilities with night vision \ndevices and thermal imagers, to strengthen its facilities to minimize \nthe impact of possible explosions, and to improve security measures at \nnuclear security storage areas.\n  The Navy's list included an additional $263 million for improvements \nto Navy installations. These funds would be spent strengthening the \ngates at various naval stations and shipyards, fencing off \ninstallations and airfields so that intruders would face some obstacle \nbefore just walking on to military property, establishing emergency \noperations centers, and installing better lighting to deter and improve \ndetection of possible incursions.\n  The remaining $110 million would go to fund the Army's unmet force \nprotection needs, number eight on General Shinseki's list of \npriorities. This includes installing fencing, more robust gates and \nbarriers, and improving lighting for active, guard and reserve posts.\n  There are other key war-related needs as well. When the Department \ndeveloped the budget for the coming fiscal year about 2 years ago, DOD \nobviously did not know that we would be at war. Therefore, the budget \nincluded assumptions about fuel prices that were based on normal \ntraining and deployments needs, and about where that fuel would be \npurchased.\n  The global war effort has changed the reality underlying those \nassumptions. For example, the Defense Logistics Agency, which is \nresponsible for providing fuel to all of the military services, has had \nto deploy its personnel to areas in and around Afghanistan to make fuel \npurchases. Moving fuel to and from areas that do not have adequate \ninfrastructure and where there is little competition has proven \nextremely expensive. In its latest estimates, the General Accounting \nOffice, which monitors fuel prices, projects that DOD will face a fuel-\nrelated shortfall of $1.5 billion by the end of the next fiscal year. \nIf these funds are not restored, DOD will be forced to reallocate funds \nfrom other sources so that the military continues to have adequate fuel \nsupplies. This is an immediate need, made worse by the war, where any \npotential savings could easily be redirected.\n  The Service Chiefs included other priorities on their list of \nunfunded needs that also deserve consideration. For example, the Air \nForce needs an additional $92 million to purchase protective equipment, \nchemical senors, medical treatment materials, and training for the \nteams that respond to nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons attacks. \nImproving security at the sites where the Army stores chemical weapons \nwould cost an additional $103 million. The Marine Corps needs an \nadditional $39 million for ammunition, and the Army's ammunition \nshortfalls total over $500 million more. These bullets would be used to \nsupport deployed troops and to train the soldiers and Marines who will \nreplace them in future operations. The Navy, whose ships have been out \non surge deployments since the September 11 attacks, needs an \nadditional $164 million to maintain the fleet so that it can continue \nto support future operations.\n  These are just a few examples of the costs of this war that remain \nunfunded because of resource constraints. If savings materialize in the \nmid-session review, I believe they are better spent on programs that \nour forces need right now. They need better protection on the \ninstallations where they live and work. They need more ammunition, and \nthey need enough fuel to chase terrorists down wherever they are \nhiding.\n  This budget provides for an adequate missile defense. Senator Levin's \namendment ensures that funds are used where they are needed most \nurgently. We know where those needs are, because the Nation's top \nmilitary leaders have told us. We need these funds to fight the scourge \nof terrorism. I urge my colleagues to support Senator Levin's \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise to respond to some of the arguments made today.\n  First, my colleague, the Senator from Alabama, at least suggested the \nLevin amendment somehow would curtail additional spending on future \ncombat systems, on R, and on technology. Frankly, if there is any \ncurtailment, as has been suggested, it is the underlying amendment by \nSenator Warner. It is very clear. He said, if we have additional \nsavings from inflation adjustments, they will go to two categories of \nspending: Missile defense, or counterterrorism.\n  The Levin amendment simply says: Listen, we want to prioritize those \nexpenditures. The President has the right to decide, but it should be \nthe law and the view of Congress--that the most pressing and urgent \nneed of those two is counterterrorism. That is the essence of the Levin \namendment.\n  There is also a suggestion made that somehow this underlying \nlegislation is oblivious to the missile threats we face. That is not at \nall correct.\n  Let me go back to the intelligence estimates. I suggested--and, in \nfact, I read--that U.S. territories are more likely to be attacked \nusing materials from nonmissile delivery means--most likely from \nterrorists--than by missiles, primarily because nonmissile delivery \nmeans are less costly, easier to acquire, more reliable, and accurate.\n  I suggest if the national intelligence is already telling us the most \nimmediate and the most dire threat we face is a terrorist attack using \nunconventional munitions, that goes a long way in suggesting the \npriorities we should adopt in spending the money.\n  Let me quote further.\n\n\n[[Page S6073]]\n\n\n       They also can be used without attribution. Nevertheless, \n     the missile threat will continue to grow in part because \n     missiles have become important regional weapons.\n\n  Here we are talking about regional missiles, which were referred to \nin the old parlance as theatre missiles or medium-ranged missiles.\n  We are funding and supporting robustly the development of a missile \ndefense for the United States.\n  The PAC-3 system--our most advanced development--is fully funded in \nthis proposal, both R and procurement. We propose in fiscal year 2003 \nto buy 72 of these missiles. The first set of operational tests is \nscheduled for this year. They will complete the first set of \noperational tests. Soldiers are already operating these systems. And it \nis capable of prompt deployment to protect U.S. troops from the types \nof regional missile threats that have been identified by national \nintelligence assessments. These regional missile threats are different \nfrom the long-range, intercontinental ballistic missiles that are the \nsum and substance of the rationale for a national missile defense.\n  So we are fully cognizant of the missile threat we face, and we are \nrobustly funding missile defense systems.\n  Let me also suggest with respect to THAAD--that is another theater \nmissile defense we are developing--that this legislation fully funds \nthe testing and development program. First flight tests are scheduled \nfor fiscal year 2005. That is fully funded at $985 million--almost $1 \nbillion.\n  What we don't support in the proposal by the administration that they \nwant to buy 10 extra missiles before the first missile is flight-\ntested. That is not the way you effectively develop a system that will \nprotect the people of the United States. It makes some sense, I think, \nto at least have the first test flight before you acquire the \nadditional missile.\n\n  We have increased the resources available for the sea-based, \nmidcourse--formerly, Navy theatre-wide.\n  We have added $40 million for the shipboard radar system, which we \nbelieve is important if this is ever to work properly.\n  We increased the administration's request for the Arrow missile, \nprecisely the type of system that will counter a threat from Iran and \nfrom Iraq, because long before those missiles could effectively reach \nthe United States, they would likely be targeted on Israel. The Arrow \nmissile system is an Israeli-United States partnership designed to \ncounter some of those threats. We added $40 million.\n  No one would suggest--at least I won't suggest--that the \nadministration was oblivious to the real needs of defense in that \nregion of the world when they requested $66 million. But I would \nsuggest that we were more sensitive, in a way, to the regional missile \nthreat. So we added $40 million to that. This legislation fully \nsupports and is consistent with the threat.\n  One of other things I think we have to understand--again, it goes to \nthe point of why we should, if we have to prioritize, be more sensitive \nin this year and the next fiscal year to terrorism--is that, frankly, \nour opponents, much to our dismay, are clever, cunning, calculating, \nruthless people. They know where our strengths are. They do not attack \nus on our strength. They find our weaknesses and our vulnerabilities. \nThey will look for these vulnerabilities. As a result, they will \nconduct, I think, unconventional means of attack. They will challenge \nus in a host of different ways.\n  What we are simply saying is, if there are additional resources, and \nif the choice, as suggested by the amendment from the Senator from \nVirginia is between missile defense and counterterrorism, the obvious \nanswer, I believe, is counterterrorism. That is what the Levin \namendment does. That is what the American people, I believe, will \ndemand.\n  I think it is also illustrative that the military professionals, the \nuniformed officers, the men and women who have sworn their lives to \nprotect this country, have a long list of unfunded needs just to \nprotect the security of DOD installations and to respond to incidents \nof mass destruction caused by some type of weapon. You could fund those \nneeds upwards of $1 billion with the extra moneys available.\n  So, again, I rise not only to respond, but to place in perspective \nthe point that before we adopt this Levin amendment as a second-degree \namendment we must look very closely at what the Senator from Virginia \nis proposing. Simply, he is saying if we have extra money through \nsavings, through inflation adjustments, then they will apply to two \ncategories--missile defense or counter-terrorism. Of course, our \nhighest priority is everything the Department of Defense has requested \nin the President's budget. I think we have to make it clear our highest \npriority today and for fiscal year 2003 is countering the obvious, \nimmediate, dramatic threat of terrorism here at home and abroad in the \ncontext, of course, of robust and full funding for national missile \ndefense, and in particular theater missile defense, that precisely \nresponds to the issues raised by the Intelligence Estimate of the \ngrowing regional threat from missiles.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a few items. The \ninflation index is an index that is in all of our budgetary \nprojections. We figure out how our budget is going to be. When that \nindex altered, it did free up some money previously committed to \ninflationary cost increases. It left that money available.\n  I point out that in our Armed Services Committee, as we discussed \nthis, we did not hear, when the budget passed, that we had to have more \nmoney for homeland defense or any particular item that amendments were \noffered on and voted down. It was only after this index became altered \nand funds were freed up. The President said: I will accept what the \nSenate Democrats offered in the Armed Services Committee for extra \nspending. He said: The money they took from missile defense--that he \nrequested and was spent on other items that they wanted--I will allow \nthat to go. I suggest we use this extra money so I can complete my \nprojections for national missile defense.\n  That is where we are today. Hopefully, we will be able to work \nthrough this and be happy with it. But I think we will have that \ninflation index money. I think it will be available.\n  There is strong bipartisan support in this country for developing a \nnational missile defense program and keeping it on track.\n  The House passed their Defense authorization bill recently. They \nincreased the President's request for national missile defense by $21 \nmillion. The House bill passed by a huge margin, 359 to 58. It is a \ntotally bipartisan bill. Liberals, Conservatives, Democrats, and \nRepublicans supported it. It had more in it for national missile \ndefense than the President is asking for or that Senator Warner has \nasked for.\n  I suggest that before we get real pure about spending money for a \ncritical national need such as national missile defense, and developing \nthis program, that we ask ourselves what we did a few weeks ago when \nthe President asked for a $28 billion fiscal year 2002 emergency \nsupplemental for homeland defense and the war on terrorism. Members of \nthe body have increased that supplemental to $32 billion and it has all \nkind of pork and special interest items in it. So I do not know where \nwe are going to go on that supplemental, but the President is very \nconcerned about this additional spending and pork that went into that. \nThose are just some comments I wanted to make.\n  I believe we are on track to maintain the steady development of \nnational missile defense. It is something I support.\n  I point out, with regard to the threat, that threats are not \nexclusive. In our Armed Services Committee, which Senator Levin chairs \nso ably, the Director of CIA, George Tenet, testified that we don't \nhave the luxury of choosing between threats. He noted that missile \ndefense threats have sometimes developed more rapidly than the \nintelligence community has predicted. And, indeed, the Rumsfeld \ncommission, in 1999, unanimously concluded that missile programs of \nsome of the rogue nations, and some other nations hostile to the United \nStates, were developing far faster than had previously been predicted.\n  Then there is this question about the money that is building up in to \nthe counter-terrorism account. There is\n\n[[Page S6074]]\n\nsome $10 billion available for missile defense in the year 2003 if the \nbill is approved as is. But I think to do so would really be creative \nbookkeeping.\n  The new budget authority for missile defense in this bill is $6.8 \nbillion. That is $1 billion less than was appropriated last year. And \nthe President proposed a modest reduction this year. There is another \n$814.3 million by the committee. That is a big cut by any standard.\n  Senator Reed gets his $10 billion figure by mixing apples and oranges \nor, precisely, old fiscal year 2002 funding and new fiscal year 2003 \nfunding. All funding for the Missile Defense Agency is for research and \ndevelopment. Research and development is what we are funding. R \nfunding is available for obligations for 2 years and for expenditures \nover 5 years. That is the way we do it. We do not give money for \nresearch and development and say you have to spend it all this year, \nready or not. That is by design because R projects, by their nature, \nrequire some flexibility in execution and stability in funding and \nplanning.\n  If Senators disagree with that, we can take away that extended \navailability of funds. But most Senators, I suspect, would say that the \nflexibility in execution and stability in funding and planning is a \ngood thing. I think that is the way we need to continue to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Armed Services Committee conducted an \nexhaustive examination of the proposed missile defense budget request. \nWe held two strategic subcommittee hearings on missile defense under \nSenator Reed's leadership. We reviewed 400 pages of missile defense \nbudget documentation, participated in more than 25 hours of staff \nbriefings by the Department of Defense. Based on that exhaustive \nreview, the committee recommended funding the vast majority of the \nDepartment's missile defense request, an amount that is sufficient to \naggressively fund all the specific systems that the Department wants to \ndevelop.\n  At the same time, the committee identified roughly $810 million of \nthe missile defense request--about 11 percent--that the Department did \nnot justify, after a detailed review of available documentation and \nrepeated hearings and briefings.\n  For example, the budget request included $1.1 billion in the \nballistic missile defense program element, an increase of $258 million \nover the current funding level. The major purpose of this program \nelement is to develop integrated architecture ballistic missile defense \nsystems.\n  While this is an important goal, most of the systems that will \ncomprise the ballistic missile defense architecture are years away from \nbeing deployed, making the development and definition of a detailed BMD \narchitecture impossible at this point.\n  After receiving more than $800 million for this program element in \nfiscal year 2002, the Missile Defense Agency has yet to provide \nCongress any indication of what the overall BMD architecture might be. \nIn fact, the committee determined that of the $800 million appropriated \nfor this program element in 2002, only $50 million--5-0--of the $800 \nmillion appropriated had been spent halfway through the fiscal year.\n  Because of that slow execution, the Missile Defense Agency informed \nus that $400 million of these funds will be available for expenditure \nin fiscal year 2003. Under these circumstances, it is hard to see why \nthe Department would need a $250 million increase in the program \nelement in 2003.\n  So we made a choice. We made a choice to make some careful and well-\njustified reductions in missile defense requests of $7.6 billion. Our \nbill provides the Missile Defense Agency as much money as can \nreasonably be executed for the Missile Defense Program in the year 2003 \nand would ensure that this money is expended in a sound manner.\n  The Senator from Virginia has assured this body that the midyear \nreview will make sufficient funds available to cover added spending \nwhich would be authorized by his amendment. We assume that would be the \ncase, based on what he has been told and based on his statement to this \nbody.\n  The underlying amendment of Senator Warner provides that the \nadditional $800 million, approximately, would be spent as the President \ndetermines in one of two ways--and they are very specific--one, \nresearch, development, test, and evaluation for ballistic missile \ndefense programs, or, two, activities of the Department of Defense for \ncombating terrorism at home and abroad. Those are the two specific \nprograms on which the President could spend this authorized additional \nmoney under the underlying Warner amendment.\n  Under my second-degree amendment, we simply state our view that the \nhighest priority at this time is the war against terrorism. The \namendment states that, in the expenditure of additional funds made \navailable by a lower rate of inflation, the top priority shall be the \nuse of such additional funds for combating terrorism at home and \nabroad.\n  Our second-degree amendment does not preclude the President from \nspending some or all of the money for missile defense. It does not \npreclude him from spending that additional money on missile defense, if \nthe President determines that the additional money on missile defense \nis more necessary, more vital than combating terrorism at home and \nabroad.\n  I believe we should put the money into the fight against terrorism \nbecause we have no higher priority than the war against terrorism. Over \nand over again we are informed and we believe--I think every Member of \nthis body believes--that we are vulnerable to a terrorist attack. We \nhear warnings of attacks against our cities, our banks, our nuclear \npowerplants, sporting events. We hear warnings about more attacks by \naircraft, about car bombs, about truck bombs, ``dirty'' bombs. As a \nmember of the Intelligence Committee, a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I believe there is a good reason to be concerned about these \nthreats.\n  The likelihood of these threats is far greater than the likelihood of \nbeing attacked by a missile from North Korea when such an attack would \nlead to the immediate destruction of North Korea, of the attacker. \nNorth Korea can attack us with a truck bomb or a car bomb or an \nenvelope full of anthrax, if she chose, with greater accuracy, far \ncheaper and with a much lesser possibility of our identifying the \nattacker so as to respond with a massive attack of our own.\n  These are real threats. The war on terrorism is here and now. We have \nnot adequately funded the war on terrorism. With all the funds we have \nput in here, there are additional places that we can usefully spend \nmoney in the war against terrorism.\n  To give some specific examples of where the Department of Defense has \nidentified areas where it needs additional funds which could be funded \nby this $800 million--these are what we call the ``unfunded priorities \nlist''; in other words, where there is a priority of the Department of \nDefense that they have identified but we have not been able to find the \nfunds to put into these priorities so they have given us the unfunded \npriorities list--$491 million for improved security at Air Force \nfacilities, including the security of nuclear weapons areas; $92 \nmillion to help prepare our first responders to help address weapons of \nmass destruction. These are just two of the items which total about $1 \nbillion in what are the unfunded priorities list of the Department of \nDefense.\n\n  We should be making a choice, at least expressing a preference and a \njudgment as to where the highest priorities are. That is our \nresponsibility. We serve on these committees. We listen to testimony. \nWe should make a judgment. If $891 million is available for additional \nspending, which we hope it will be, then the question is, What is the \ngreatest need at this time?\n  We express that need in the second-degree amendment. We say the war \non terrorism; of those two identified, specified items in this \nunderlying amendment, the war on terrorism is the highest priority this \ncountry faces. And we have unmet needs in meeting this priority.\n  The President can make a different choice. We do not preclude that. I \nemphasize that.\n  The President, if he determines it is more essential to spend even \nmore\n\n[[Page S6075]]\n\nmoney on missile defense than we provide, more than the almost $7 \nbillion we provide, if the President determines that spending \nadditional funds on missile defense is a higher priority than the war \non terrorism, we do not preclude him from doing so. But we express our \nperspective and our point of view that the war on terrorism is the \nhighest priority.\n  Should we address all threats that face us? Of course, we should \naddress all threats that face us. And we do. But we have to allocate \nresources. We should allocate resources against the greatest threats \nthat we face. Those greatest threats are the terrorist threats. We have \nhad so much evidence of this that we have all reached that basic \nconclusion. I hope we express that perspective by adopting the second-\ndegree amendment which has been offered.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

PROHIBITION ON TRANSFER OF MEDICAL FREE ELECTRON \n                   LASER PROGRAM.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law the Medical Free \n     Electron Laser Program (PE0602227D8Z) may not be transferred \n     from the Department of Defense to the National Institutes of \n     Health, or to any other department or agency of the Federal \n     Government.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am proposing this amendment, along with Senators \nKerry, Helms, Thompson, Edwards, Frist, Boxer and Feinstein, which will \nretain the Medical Free Electron Laser Program, (MFEL); in the \nDepartment of Defense. This program was initiated in 1985 and the \nbenefit to military personnel and all Americans was realized \nimmediately. This successful and visionary program has benefited the \nmilitary in many ways. For example, new and innovative methods \ndeveloped in the MFEL program to diagnose and treat burns, the number \none combat casualty injury, are now in practical application. Current \nresearch involving tissue-welding and tissue-bonding is going to be of \ngreat value for treating battlefield injuries by allowing for the \nimmediate repair of soft tissue and vascular wounds.\n  This technology also has some special applications, such as for \npilots with ocular injuries. Of particular interest to me, however, is \nits potential to help diagnose and deactivate other types of biological \ncontamination and injury. This research has yielded very promising \nresults.\n  The Office of Management and Budget is attempting to move the program \nfrom the Department of Defense to the National Institutes of Health. \nMoving the program from DoD would be detrimental to the MFEL program \nand would jeopardize many promising research and development efforts. A \nproposed transfer of the MFEL program to the NIH is ill-advised since \nso much of the work centers around combat injury and specifically \ntargets biological injury. The program has a track record of success, \nand moving it would disrupt, delay and possibly impede this crucial \nresearch. The Department of Defense is without question the best place \nfor the MFEL program.\n  Congressional intent is clear on this subject. This peer-reviewed, \ncompetitive MFEL program must remain in DoD, where it was originally \nincluded and funded.\n  I am pleased to offer this amendment, along with my colleagues, on \nbehalf of this most worthy program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I propose a timely and important \namendment to increase the grade for the Chief Nurses of the Army, the \nNavy, and the Air Force to that of two stars. The existing law limits \nthe position of Chief Nurse of the three branches of the military to \nthat of brigadier general in the Army and Air Force, and rear admiral, \nlower half, in the Navy.\n  Chief Nurses have a tremendous responsibility--their scope of duties \ninclude peacetime and wartime health care delivery, plus establishing \nstandards and policy for all nursing personnel within their respective \nbranches. They are responsible for thousands of Army, Navy, and Air \nForce officers and enlisted nursing personnel in the active, reserve, \nand guard components of the military. The military medical mission \ncould not be carried out without nursing personnel. They are crucial to \nthe mission in war and peace time, at home and abroad.\n  Organizations are best served when the leadership is composed of a \nmix of specialties--of equal rank--who bring their unique perspectives \nto the table when policies are established and decisions are made. This \nincreased rank would guarantee that the nursing perspective is \nrepresented on critical issues that affect the military medical \nmission, patient care, and nursing practice. I believe it is time to \nensure that the military health care system fully recognize and utilize \nthe leadership ability of these outstanding patient care professionals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But the fact is, CDR Scott Speicher, \nwho, by the way, our Armed Services Committee and this Senate has now \npromoted to Captain, was the first U.S. serviceman shot down in the \ngulf war. Then there was a series of incredible mistakes. For example, \nhis buddies flying with him gave the proper coordinates, but when the \ncoordinates were transmitted for our surveillance assets to look, the \nnumbers were transposed so they didn't look in the right place.\n  Through one thing and another, suddenly a press conference is held in \nWashington with the then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, and the \nthen-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, GEN Colin Powell. Out of \nthat press conference came the statement that Commander Speicher was \ndead. In fact, we have since learned that through this series of \nmistakes we never looked in the right place. Testimony was convoluted. \nThen, lo and be hold, years later comes forth an eye witness account \nthat someone actually drove him to a hospital. Through several \ncorroborations, that testimony was determined to be true.\n  So, what we want to do, as Senator Roberts has done so eloquently and \nso courageously over the years, is keep this matter alive and find out \nwhat happened and where is CDR Scott Speicher, and is he living? And, \nif he is not, then to have proof. Because what we have back in \nJacksonville, FL, is a family wanting to know what is the fate of their \nloved one. That is the very least the U.S. Government can do.\n  So the question now comes up about what we are going to do in Iraq. \nThat is something that Senator Roberts and I do not know. But we do \nknow that there is the question of a delegation going to Iraq. Should \nit be a low level delegation or a high level delegation? What we want \nare some answers.\n  I have taken every opportunity--where I have been in a place that I \nsensed was the right place at the right time--to talk about Commander, \nnow CAPT Scott Speicher and the need of us to press the issue, to find \nout from Iraq about his status.\n  I talked to the young President of Syria in Damascus about him and \nasked him to use his intelligence apparatus to help us. I talked to the \nKing of Jordan. I have talked to the Secretary of Defense and the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense. I have talked to the Secretary of State \nand the Deputy Secretary of State.\n  When there was someone to talk to, I tried to bring the loss and \npossible abandonment of Navy fighter pilot CAPT Scott Speicher to their \nattention.\n  With that introduction, I ask unanimous consent that after Senator \nRoberts has finished his statement, I be allowed to conclude my \nstatement. We would like for him to share with our colleagues what has \ntranspired over the past several years. I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe able to finish my statement after Senator Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida, who has joined what I call the Speicher Team. I thank him for \nhis interest, for his leadership, for his perseverance, and for his \nvery aggressive action with regard to legislation I am cosponsoring as \nof today in behalf of Scott Speicher.\n  I rise today in support of the amendment. The amendment simply \nrequires frequent reports by the Department of Defense on their efforts \nto determine the fate of CAPT, Select, Scott Speicher.\n  Why on Earth would we have to pass legislation requiring the \nDepartment of Defense to report back to Congress with periodic reports?\n  It is all about Scott Speicher--Scott Speicher--a lieutenant \ncommander who was shot down in his Navy F-18 fighter within the first \nfew hours of the start of the gulf war. He was streaking towards \nBaghdad on a strike mission. Within 24 hours, he was declared a \nfatality by the U.S. Navy and the Department of Defense--our first \ncasualty in the Persian Gulf war.\n  Unfortunately for Scott, as we have learned since that time through a \nseries of mistakes and still very unexplained action--and when I say a \n``series of mistakes,'' I am talking about an unbelievable set of \ncircumstances that are so bizarre and so unexplainable that it is \ndifficult to imagine. At any rate, through this series of mistakes, \nthere was no confirmation--no confirmation--that Scott Speicher died in \nthe shootdown. Tragically, there was not 1 minute of search and rescue \neffort made in behalf of Scott Speicher. He was declared a fatality \nbased solely on the report of a fellow flier who saw a bright fireball \nin the direction of Scott's plane and determined that nobody could have \nsurvived that hit.\n\n  That was relayed up the command to the point that the Secretary of \nDefense--Vice President Cheney, today--was told that he was a casualty, \nwhich he announced on national television.\n  So Scott was dead. He was killed in action. And he remained dead in \nthe eyes of the Department of Defense and the Department of the Navy \nuntil investigations forced upon the DIA--the Defense Intelligence \nAgency--and the CIA by Congress made it so obvious that the probability \nwas that he survived the shootdown and ended up in the hands of Iraqis, \nas has been pointed out by the distinguished Senator.\n  But even with this information, the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of the Navy again had to be pressured to change his status \nfrom killed in action--i.e., KIA--to missing in action. Finally, in \nJanuary of 2001--10 years later--the Secretary of the Navy changed the \nstatus of Scott from KIA to missing in action. It took a lot of effort \nto get that done on the part of\n\n[[Page S6081]]\n\nsome of my colleagues and what I call the Scott Speicher Team.\n  In February of this year, I wrote to the Secretary of Defense and \nrequested that CAPT, Select, Scott Speicher be designated not as \nmissing in action but as a prisoner of war.\n  My request was based upon ``The Intelligence Community Assessment of \nthe Lieutenant Commander Speicher Case.'' That is what it is called. \nThat is the title. That assessment actually concluded that ``Scott \nSpeicher probably survived the loss of his aircraft, and, if he \nsurvived, he was most certainly captured by the Iraqis.''\n  My colleagues, today is the 25th of June, and yet the Department is \nstill delaying on the obvious. CAPT, Select, Scott Speicher was, and \nis, and should be a prisoner of war.\n  Let me be clear. I don't know if Scott is alive today. I hope and I \npray so. But let me be equally clear. There is no evidence that he is \ndead either. Either way, colleagues, ``prisoner of war'' is the \nappropriate designation for the warrior we left behind.\n  Today, we are not here to argue the status of Scott Speicher but, \nrather, whether or not Senator Nelson, I, others who support this bill, \nand the Senate go on record as requiring the Department of Defense to \nreport frequently on their efforts to resolve his whereabouts and \nstatus.\n  Sadly, my colleagues, my history with the Scott Speicher case says we \nmust keep pressure on the Department if we are to finally determine the \nfate of an American warrior we left behind in the desert of Iraq.\n  This Nation prides itself on the commitment to our men and women who \nsacrifice for our freedom. My colleagues, we saw that commitment in the \neffort to recover the remains of the victims of the 9/11 terrorist \nattack. We saw that effort on a hilltop in Afghanistan in our efforts \nto recover a lost Special Forces member. We saw that commitment in the \nstreets of Mogadishu when a Blackhawk helicopter was shot down. We saw \nthat effort in Kosovo and in Bosnia when downed airmen were heroically \nrescued.\n  In each of our wars or conflicts, the American servicemen were told \nthey would never be left behind. We owe no less to Scott Speicher.\n  If we are to maintain any credibility with the fighting men and women \nof our military today--that is why it has special pertinence today in \nthe war on terrorism--we must honor our commitment to leave no one \nbehind.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to keep the pressure \non the Department of Defense to determine the fate of Scott Speicher.\n  Senator Nelson indicated that I have a story to tell. Actually, \nSenator Smith, I, and Senator Grams, who is no longer a Member of the \nSenate, and others of us became interested in this case by accident.\n  By the way, it is quite a chronology of trying to piece together what \nhappened to Scott with some cooperation or degree of lack of \ncooperation from the authorities. Let me go over a short history, if I \nmight.\n  January 18, 1991: Secretary of Defense Cheney--as I referred to \nearlier in my remarks--received word that he was a casualty, and it was \nannounced over national television. He referred to the ``death'' of \nCommander Speicher.\n  January 26, 1991: His status was established as ``missing in \naction,'' however, by his commanding officer.\n  May 22, 1991: While the law requires a 1-year interval--let me repeat \nthat. While the law requires a 1-year interval before changing an MIA \ndetermination to ``killed in action,'' Commander Speicher's status \nchanged to ``killed in action.'' The Office of Naval Intelligence \navailable evidence did support the KIA status at that particular time--\nclear back in 1991.\n  January 13, 1993: We have moved ahead 2 years. The report of the \nSenate Select Committee on POW-MIA Affairs concludes that the Defense \nIntelligence Agency's POW-MIA Office--now called DPMO, the acronym we \nuse--has historically--I am not talking about today's operation, I am \ntalking about the operation back in the early 1990s--has historically \nbeen, No. 1, guilty of overclassification; No. 2, defensive toward \ncriticism; No. 3, handicapped by poor coordination with other elements \nof the intelligence community, i.e., not asking for it; and, No. 4, \nslow to follow up on live-sighting and other reports.\n  September 30, 1996--another 3 years--May 22, 1991, presumptive \nfinding of death ``was determined to have been in error after a \nthorough analysis of classified information and status review \nprocedures.'' Chief of Naval Personnel backdated--backdated--the \npresumptive finding of death. Navy staff states to Senator Smith, on \nJune 22, 1999, that they did not review the intelligence community's \ninformation for this finding--did not review the intelligence \ncommunity's information for this finding, did not take into \nconsideration the available intelligence.\n  Let's move to December 7, 1997 and a front page, New York Times \narticle by Tim Weiner, titled ``Gulf War's First Casualty Leaves \nLasting Trail of Mystery,'' in which he writes the story about Scott.\n  When asked by Weiner if Speicher could have survived the crash, he \nsaid, ``We don't know.'' That was from ADM Stanley Arthur, Vice Chief \nof Naval Operations at the time of the loss. He is quoted as believing \nthat ``Commander Speicher had ejected successfully and survived.''\n  Arthur also said, ``The Warriors believed they had a responsibility . \n. . You lose one of your own, you go back and get him.''\n  Move ahead to January 5, 1998: Our Committee on Intelligence in the \nSenate tasked the Director of Central Intelligence for an intelligence \ncommunity chronology of the Speicher case.\n  February 19 of 1998: The head of DPMO, the Department of Missing in \nAction, Mr. Liotta, updates our Senate Committee on Intelligence on the \nSpeicher case and concludes that this loss is the only unresolved U.S. \ncase of Desert Storm.\n\n  July 1, 1998: Restatement of Federal regulations--a finding of \npresumptive death is made by the Secretary of the Navy when a survey of \nall available sources of information indicates beyond doubt that the \npresumption of continuance of life has been overcome for the purpose of \nNaval administration that he is no longer alive, that the person is no \nlonger alive.\n  That was not done with Scott Speicher. That was a clarification that \ncame back.\n  It took us until September 9 of 1998: The Senate Committee on \nIntelligence receives the report of the Director of Central \nIntelligence in regards to the chronology of the Speicher case.\n  March 12, 1999: Our staff in the Intelligence Committee receives an \nupdate on the Speicher case and requested additional rigor by the \nDefense Intelligence Agency.\n  May 13, 1999: The committee letter to the Director of Central \nIntelligence. We say the September 1998 chronology report does not \nenable Senator Smith, Senator Grams, Senator Roberts to make informed \njudgments about the intelligence process nor the analysis. We request \nadditional data.\n  July 30, 1999: I ask the Intelligence Committee to conduct an inquiry \ninto the Speicher matter, stating that it is my understanding that it \nis a primary role of U.S. intelligence to assist our military \ncommanders in making informed decisions, and suggest that the \nassignment of the killed in action status may be in error. Scott's \nwife, Joanne Speicher Harris, asks the Senate Committee on Intelligence \nfor a full accounting regarding the fate of her former husband. This is \nsome 10 years later.\n  September 15, 1999: The Senate Intelligence Committee holds a member-\nlevel briefing with the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, \nAdmiral Wilson, the Department of State, and the Secretary of the Navy. \nFollowup questions for the record are sent to the executive branch.\n  October 28 of 1999: We hold a closed, on-the-record hearing with the \nsame folks, and ask them followup questions for the record, and sent \nthat to the executive branch.\n  May 4 of 2000: I author legislation to force the Pentagon and the \nU.S. intelligence community to better handle cases of military \npersonnel missing in action or unaccounted for. It was passed by this \nbody in the intelligence authorization bill.\n  Then we initiated in the committee to task the Director of Central \nIntelligence for an assessment.\n  Finally, after learning there was no intelligence wrapped up in this \nparticular case on the fate of Scott Speicher, we ask the DCI, we ask \nthe head of the CIA: Please, please, come in\n\n[[Page S6082]]\n\nand make an assessment on the fate of Commander Speicher.\n  I also had the committee request the CIA and the DOD inspectors \ngeneral to jointly and expeditiously examine the intelligence to \nsupport the Speicher case.\n  July 25, 2000: The committee holds another on-the-record briefing in \nregards to the Speicher case. Questions for the record then follow.\n  September of 2000: Congress receives the Intelligence Committee's \nfirst ever assessment of the fate of Commander Speicher. I believe the \npreponderance of evidence does not support the KIA status.\n  Since that time he has been changed to MIA. I might point out that \njust before President Clinton left office, he reported to the country \nthat he may be alive.\n  Now, since that time, we have followed very closely, in the \nIntelligence Committee, all of the intelligence assessments that have \ncome in. And let me say the people in charge today are doing that with \ndue diligence. I am not trying to point any fingers of blame. I just do \nnot understand how on Earth this case could have been so badly handled \nover an 11- or 12-year period. Without really pointing any fingers of \nblame, we are receiving good cooperation from those people in charge \nnow.\n  But what this legislation will do, what the Nelson-Roberts-Smith \nlegislation will do is make sure that, on a timely basis, we have these \nreports.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my letter to \nSecretary Rumsfeld, dated February 12, 2002, because I think it is very \nclear that Scott Speicher should be classified a POW. And I feel in my \nheart--as I say, again, I do not know whether he is alive or not, but I \nfeel in my heart, with continuing intelligence assessment and open-\nsource assessments that we are receiving on a roller coaster timely \nbasis, and more and more publicity and attention given to this issue, \nand all of the foreign policy discussion and military mission \ndiscussion in regards to Iraq, he may be alive. I say he may be alive. \nI do not know if Scott is alive. But, my colleagues, we must press \nahead in behalf of everybody who wears the uniform to determine his \nfate.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                February 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Donald Rumsfeld,\n     Secretary of Defense, Department of Defense, The Pentagon, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I write to request that you designate \n     and use the title Prisoner-of-War (POW) for Captain Michael \n     Scott Speicher. Captain Speicher was the first and only \n     Coalition pilot shot down the first night of the Persian Gulf \n     War in January 1991. He was not returned with all other POWs \n     at the end of the war. After being listed improperly as \n     Killed-in-Action (KIA) in May 1991, and reaffirmed in that \n     status in 1996, Captain Speicher's status was changed to \n     Missing-in-Action (MIA) in January 2001. President Clinton \n     stated on January 11, 2001 that Captain Speicher ``might be \n     alive,'' and ``if he is, where he is; and how we can get him \n     out. . . . Because since he was a uniformed service person, \n     he's clearly entitled to be released, and we're going to do \n     everything we can to get him out.''\n       I wrote to Secretary of Defense Cohen on October 2, 2000, \n     requesting that Captain Speicher's status be changed to a \n     category less decisive and final than KIA (see attachment). \n     At the time, I felt that there was considerable evidence that \n     Captain Speicher had not been killed during the crash of his \n     aircraft. This was based on The Intelligence Community \n     Assessment of the Lieutenant Commander Speicher Case, that \n     concluded ``LCDR Speicher probably survived the loss of his \n     aircraft, and if he survived, he was almost certainly \n     captured by the Iraqis.'' This strongly suggested the more \n     appropriate designator or status of POW. However, I find it \n     odd that Title 10, USC 1513(2)(D) does not identify POW as an \n     officially recognized status although it does define a \n     subcategory under ``missing'' status as ``captured.'' Captain \n     Speicher clearly fits the term ``missing, captured.'' \n     Subparagraph E2.1.20.4 of DOD Instruction 2310.5, the \n     regulation that implements the statute, contains identical \n     language.\n       Common usage of the status of ``missing, captured'' is that \n     of POW.\n       There is a precedent for maintaining the status of an \n     American as POW many years after a war. Long after virtually \n     all Vietnam War MIA's had been given a presumptive finding of \n     death, one American, Colonel Charles Shelton, USAF, remained \n     listed as a POW for symbolic reasons, although U.S. analysts \n     felt that available evidence suggested that Shelton died in \n     captivity. He remained in POW status to indicate that the \n     U.S. Government had not ruled out the possibility that POWs \n     might still be alive in Southeast Asia after the end of the \n     war. Colonel Shelton's status was finally changed to KIA on \n     September 20, 1994.\n       Mr. Secretary, the Shelton precedent establishes that clear \n     evidence of continued survival is not required for \n     identifying the status of a captured American as a POW. \n     Therefore, I am asking that Captain Speicher's designator or \n     status be that of POW and that the Department use the term \n     ``POW'' in all future references regarding Speicher.\n       As often happens on the battlefield, this matter relates \n     very much to what happens in the hearts as well as the minds \n     of those who serve, and those on whose behalf they serve. By \n     stating to the world that we indeed believe that Captain \n     Speicher survived--at least for some period of time--in Iraqi \n     custody, we would acknowledge his unique and honored service \n     as an American Gulf War POW. A change in status and \n     terminology would add credibility and urgency to efforts to \n     secure his release. Finally, if Captain Speicher lives, we \n     must make every effort to attain for him the freedom he has \n     so long been denied. His case reaffirms to our nation, albeit \n     somewhat belatedly, that we will never abandon our soldiers \n     even if some embarrassment befalls to our Government. It \n     would render its service-maybe Captain Speicher's greatest \n     service--in the inevitable next war. If the natural tendency \n     of a bureaucracy is to take the easy way out and to declare \n     an American soldier dead, when in fact it is really not clear \n     what happened to him, then this is not the America our \n     forefathers envisioned, nor one I proudly support.\n       I believe the status of POW sends a symbolic message not \n     only to the Iraqis, but to other adversaries, current and \n     future--and most importantly, to the men and women of the \n     U.S. Armed Forces and the American people. It would tell the \n     Iraqis what we now believe that they have much more to tell \n     us about his fate and increases our leverage of \n     accountability. It tells our military that we will not stand \n     for anything less than full disclosure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Pat Roberts.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized under \nthe previous order.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Thank you, Mr. President. And thanks to \nSenator Roberts, the distinguished Senator from Kansas, for his \nperseverance and for his dedication.\n  I am glad that Senator Smith has come to the Chamber so we can hear \nfrom him and his perspective, as he has been one of the leaders over \nthe years in calling this matter to the attention of the American \npeople.\n  As I said earlier, I have spoken with a number of world leaders, \nincluding the Prime Minister of Lebanon, asking them to task their \nintelligence apparatus to see if they can get any kind of information \nabout Scott Speicher. And while intelligence is central to the \npotential for our success in resolving his fate, it is not the only \naspect of this situation that certainly merits the congressional \nattention that we are trying to give it right now.\n  This amendment that is offered by me, Senator Roberts, Senator Smith, \nSenator Graham of Florida, as well as the majority leader, Senator \nDaschle--and his name should be on the amendment. If it is not, I ask \nunanimous consent that he be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. This amendment sets in place a firm schedule \nof updates on actions taken by the Departments of Defense and State as \nwell as the Central Intelligence Agency. It sets a firm schedule of \nreports to determine the fate of Captain Speicher; a schedule of \naccountability, if you will, that puts the department squarely and \nclearly within the view of Congress and America so that we can take the \nmeasure of their efforts and their progress. And they must make \nprogress.\n\n  In American military philosophy, no one is left behind on the \nbattlefield. That is particularly the creed among pilots. If a pilot \ngoes down, you know that there is a rescue team coming in to get you.\n  Our effort today, through this amendment, is to encourage those whose \nresponsibility it is in government to find our missing and to leave no \neffort unturned in the search for Captain Speicher.\n  To that end, this amendment requires regular updates to the Congress \non contacts with the Government of Iraq, on contacts with foreign \ngovernments and intelligence services, and on current leads in the \ncase, and efforts to coordinate with groups such as the United Nations \nand the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\n[[Page S6083]]\n\n  We expect to see action and progress in these reports. We expect to \nshake loose any bureaucratic inaction that has slowed the search until \nnow.\n  I spoke as recently as 2 hours ago with the Deputy Secretary of State \nand the Deputy Secretary of Defense on this matter. As a nation, we \nhave come a long way in living up to our philosophy over the years of \nnot leaving anyone downed behind. There are nearly 79,000 Americans \nstill missing from World War II. There are almost 8,000 missing from \nKorea. There are fewer than 2,000 still missing from Vietnam. Slowly \nbut surely, we have reduced these numbers as the new information, the \nnew evidence on the remains of those missing is recovered from around \nthe world.\n  Scott Speicher is the only American missing from the gulf war. Over \n11 years after, his fate still remains unknown. The horrors of war and \nthe frailty of the human body make it impossible to guarantee that we \nknow with certainty the fate of every American who may be lost in \nbattle. Nonetheless, Americans must have the confidence that the sons \nand daughters, the brothers and sisters, the fathers and mothers we \nsend into harm's way will find their way home, even if it is only to \ntheir final honored resting place. We owe this to those who go and \nthose they leave behind.\n  I am confident some day we will know what happened to Scott Speicher. \nI hope it is soon. I pray that he will return to us safe and sound, \nalive. In the meantime, we must watch this effort closely and pray that \nresolution will bring peace to the shipmates and the Navy squadron and \nthe family of CAPT Scott Speicher.\n  I thank the Senate for what they will do in a few minutes, which is \nadopt this amendment. I look forward to the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I compliment my \ncolleagues, Senators Nelson and Roberts, for their continued leadership \non this issue. I rise in strong support of the amendment.\n  The case of Scott Speicher is a terrible tragedy that never should \nhave happened. I know my distinguished colleague is not familiar with \nall of the background I have had on the issue. I began in the mid-1990s \nto question our Government based on information I was receiving from my \nown sources within the intelligence community, which, much to their \nconsternation, they have not been able to identify yet, thankfully, \nthat there was something wrong, that there may be information \nsuggesting that Speicher may not, should not have been declared KIA or \nkilled in action.\n  As has been said, Speicher was shot down on the first night of the \ngulf war and immediately declared killed in action. The truth is, as I \nstand here today, that a search and rescue mission for Commander \nSpeicher, now Captain Speicher, was never launched.\n  At a Department of Defense press conference shortly after the \nshootdown, it was announced that he was killed in action and that was \nit.\n  We told Saddam Hussein and the world that Speicher was dead and, \ntherefore, there would have been absolutely no incentive for Hussein to \nprovide him to us or any information on him to us.\n  It was a mistake. That announcement, pure and simple, was a mistake. \nIt was based on incomplete information which can happen in wartime. We \nunderstand that. But it was passed up the chain of command, and it was \na mistake. Mistakes can be rectified. We didn't rectify it. Mrs. \nSpeicher and the children were told that he was killed in action. There \nis a big difference between being killed in action and missing in \naction. Missing in action, there may be some hope, or POW there may be \nsome hope you may be found alive. She made her decisions in life based \non that information which was never corrected, never changed until \nrecently.\n  At the conclusion of the war, the Iraqis returned remains. I don't \nknow if my colleague mentioned this; I was not in the Chamber at the \ntime. They sent remains back that they claimed belonged to a pilot \nnamed Michael. When we tested the DNA, it was not Speicher. You have to \nask yourself, why would the Iraqis return remains that were not \nSpeicher if they didn't have some ulterior motive.\n  In spite of that, Speicher was officially declared killed in action \nin May of 1991, and the status was reaffirmed again in August of 1996.\n  Supposedly, all of these decisions were based on a comprehensive \nreview of the case. The truth is, there was not a comprehensive review. \nI can assure you these decisions were a terrible mistake.\n  When the U.S. Government finally visited the crash site in December \nof 1995, it was determined that Speicher had ejected from his aircraft. \nThere was no information given to Mrs. Speicher about that. Our \ninvestigators were able to determine that, despite the fact that the \nIraqis clearly tampered with the crash site to confuse us. We had that \ninformation. Navy statistics show that 90 percent of pilots who eject \nfrom an F-18 survive the ejection. Speicher was flying an F-18. He \nejected. The ejection seat came out of the plane.\n  In over 7 years that I have been involved in this case, I have never \nseen--I want to be clear about this--any information remotely \nsuggesting that Scott Speicher was killed in action. I don't say that \nin any way to encourage anybody or enhance anybody's hopes. I am \ntelling you that there has never been any information I have seen that \nwould suggest that Scott Speicher was killed in action.\n  Under the laws and rules of the Defense Department and the way we \ndetermine the definition of KIA, he should not have been declared \nkilled in action. Yet he was. In spite of the fact that month after \nmonth, year after year, more and more information was coming forth, \nthey still left him killed in action.\n  In March of 1999, I sent a letter to then-Secretary of the Navy \nDanzig requesting that the ``finding of death'' determination made by \nthe Navy in May of 1991 be changed because there was no evidence \nsupporting the determination that Speicher was killed in action. In \nfact, there is information to the contrary--a lot of information to the \ncontrary, which my colleagues have already discussed.\n  I encourage my colleagues--and I know the Senator from Florida has \ndone this, and I am not suggesting that this could be done prior to the \nvote. I think this amendment will pass overwhelmingly. I encourage \ncolleagues to read the intelligence on this case. It is a fascinating \ncase. Some of the things we cannot talk about. But I can tell you that \nthere is an overwhelming amount of evidence out there that suggests \nSpeicher could have survived. There is no evidence that suggests he was \nkilled. There is a very important distinction here. Yet he was declared \nkilled, and his wife made decisions in life that people do make, such \nas getting remarried and so forth, based on that information.\n  In spite of the fact that I challenged it month after month, year \nafter year, beginning in the mid-1990s, to try to get more information \nfrom my own sources who were saying, They are not telling you the truth \nin the intelligence community or giving you all the information--in \nspite of that, they would not change the designation.\n  As a matter of fact, I say to my colleague--because I know this is \nhis constituent--I was trashed by some in the agency to the family \ndirectly. The family will tell Senator Nelson that if he talks to them. \nThey said I was a troublemaker, causing undue stress to the family. \nThis was given by bureaucrats in this Government in the DPMO office. \nThey provided information to Mrs. Speicher that I was a troublemaker \nfor getting involved in this because, as one who lost his dad in the \nSecond World War and was raised without a father, I wanted the son and \ndaughter of Mrs. Speicher to know what happened to their father. That \nis what I was declared a troublemaker for.\n  After working closely with Danzig for a number of months, the \nSecretary, to his credit, prior to the Clinton administration leaving \noffice, changed the status of Commander Speicher from KIA to MIA. That \nis exactly what it should be. It should never have been otherwise.\n  I think this has been read into the Record, but I will give one \nparagraph of the intelligence community's assessment of the Speicher \ncase. This is unclassified:\n\n\n[[Page S6084]]\n\n\n       We assess that Iraq can account for Lieutenant Commander \n     Speicher, but that Baghdad is concealing information about \n     his fate. Lieutenant Commander Speicher probably survived the \n     loss of his aircraft, and if he survived, he almost certainly \n     was captured by the Iraqis.\n\n  We know, because there is a lot of information to indicate, that he \ncould have survived the ejection from the aircraft and that there is \nall kinds of intelligence information about what may or may not have \nhappened to him afterwards. We also know that the Iraqis know the \nanswer. They could return Speicher one way or the other, dead or alive, \nor give us information that would indicate one way or the other.\n  I don't know if Commander Scott Speicher is alive, but I do know \nthere is no information that he is dead. A lot of information suggests \nhe may be alive. I want to again re-encapsulate this because it is very \nimportant. In spite of all the information we had at our disposal up \nuntil the last 2 or 3 years, from the early nineties, crossing two \nadministrations, the previous Bush administration and the Clinton \nadministration--in spite of the fact that information was in the DPMO \noffice and in the intelligence office and the Navy, in spite of all of \nthat information that showed an overwhelming amount of evidence that he \nmay have survived, they still declared him KIA and refused to change \nthe status.\n\n  When I asked to change the status, I was declared a troublemaker in \nthe secret conversations and documents to which I was not privy. I \ndon't care because the issue is not me. If we can find out that Scott \nSpeicher is alive and could come home to his family, I would like to \njoin my colleague in Jacksonville for that homecoming. But we owe \nnothing less to the Speicher family than that. All the men and women \nwho serve in uniform in our Nation's military deserve nothing less than \nthat--that the U.S. Government finds out what happens.\n  We realize we are dealing with a nation and a leader who isn't \nexactly willing to cooperate and is not the greatest humanitarian the \nworld has ever seen. I don't blame the U.S. Government for that. I do \nblame the U.S. Government for not sharing this with me. I was not a \nmember of the Intelligence Committee, so I was basically kept from \ngetting the information, frankly, by the chairman of the committee. I \nwasn't able to get it.\n  Finally, after raising enough ruckus, I began to challenge the \nintelligence reports and documents and evidence we were getting, and I \nwas able to get before the committee--even though I am not a member--\nand ask some questions, and then, subsequently, all this information \nbegan to come out. It is amazing.\n  We know the Iraqis do hold prisoners. They released an Iranian pilot \nin 1998 who had been held for 18 years. So it is not unprecedented. I \nhope sincerely that we will move forward. I think the Senator's bill \nwill help. I just caution one thing, which is that we don't turn this \nthing into a 90-day reporting period and get off focus. The main focus \nshould be, let's find him, or find out what happened to him. And let's \ndo it quickly so that the Senator's legislation will be over with \nquickly because, hopefully, in the first 90 days we will get the \nanswers. I hope it will not be a series of 90-day reports in succession \nas we see years and years go by.\n  If Scott Speicher is alive, the thought of him languishing in some \nprison cell somewhere in Iraq--God knows what is going on--is a \nhorrible thing to even think about. If he is dead, then Saddam Hussein \nshould tell us what happened to him.\n  I want to make it clear, before I conclude, that the current \nintelligence community, starting in the previous administration and \nthen into this one, Admiral Wilson of DIA, and others have been very \nhelpful and very responsive in helping us to get the answers. We have \nhad a number of occasions where we could do that. So I am optimistic \nand I know the Senator's legislation will help.\n\n\n                 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Ruling\n\n  Before I yield the floor, this has an impact here. I want my \ncolleagues to know this because here we are talking now about a missing \npilot who was shot down in 1991 in the Persian Gulf war, fighting for \nhis country, for the flag, fighting for this Nation under God, the flag \nwe salute every single day, ``one nation under God.'' I want to \nannounce to my colleagues a decision that just came down from the Ninth \nCircuit Court--the infamous Ninth Circuit court. Listen to this article \non the ruling:\n\n       A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that the Pledge of \n     Allegiance is an unconstitutional endorsement of religion and \n     cannot be recited in schools.\n\n  That is the wording of the Ninth Circuit Court.\n\n       The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a 1954 act \n     of Congress inserting the phrase ``under God'' after the \n     words ``one nation'' in the pledge. The court said the phrase \n     violates the so-called Establishment Clause in the \n     Constitution that requires a separation of church and state.\n\n  I will be very brief in deference to my colleague. But they further \nsaid:\n\n       A profession that we are a nation ``under God'' is \n     identical, for Establishment Clause purposes, to a profession \n     that we are a nation ``under Jesus,'' a nation ``under \n     Vishnu,'' a nation ``under Zeus,'' or a nation ``under no \n     god,''\n\n      because none of these professions can be neutral with \n     respect to religion,'' Judged Alfred T. Goodwin wrote for \n     the three-judge panel.\n\n  I wonder what Scott Speicher would have to say about that. \nUnbelievable.\n  I sponsored, in 1999, at the request of a constituent of mine, \nlegislation to require the Senate--which ironically was not doing it--\nto cite the Pledge of Allegiance before convening every day. Until \n1999, we never recited the Pledge of Allegiance. A constituent was \nwatching C-SPAN one day and said: What in the world is going on? Why \ndon't you guys salute the flag?\n  I said: I don't know; let's find out.\n  We implemented it. The House of Representatives recites the Pledge \nevery day. We had a unanimous resolution that passed the Congress. I \nwish to recite from the resolution because it shows we ought to be \npretty outraged by that judicial decision:\n\n       Whereas the Flag of the United States of America is our \n     Nation's most revered and preeminent symbol. . . .\n\n  And it goes on to talk about the flag and it even talks about the \nPledge.\n  Here we are talking about a Naval officer who may or may not be alive \nin Iraq who is basically not looked for by his own Government for 10 \nyears, and now we get an appeals court decision in the Ninth Circuit \nthat says we have to take ``under God'' out of the Pledge of Allegiance \nto the flag of the United States of America.\n  Frankly, to Judge Goodwin: May God bless us all and pray for us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we are going to wind up the \ndebate on our amendment having to do with Scott Speicher, but since the \ndistinguished Senator has told me of two events, I want to comment.\n  First, the Senator from New Hampshire told me that certain \nbureaucrats label him a troublemaker. If that is the case, I like that \nkind of troublemaker.\n  Second, the Senator from New Hampshire referred to a recent decision \nby a Federal district court of appeals, of which I was not aware, to \ntake the words ``under God'' out of the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  I have faith in our judicial system. Senator Byrd, the distinguished \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, reminds all of us to carry around a \ncopy of the Constitution and a copy of the Declaration of Independence. \nI remind my colleagues the second paragraph of the Declaration of \nIndependence has these immortal words:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\n  Whether it be the judicial system that would correct a decision by a \ncourt of appeals which absolutely stuns me or whether it would be the \nchecks and balances found in this Constitution of the United States, to \nwhich constitutional amendments can be initiated by this body, then I \nhave the confidence to know that the constitutional system will work \nunder this time-tested document.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for bringing that to our \nattention.\n  Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the Scott Speicher \namendment. I ask the Presiding Officer to put the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S6085]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Levin is not here. I cannot allow \nthat to happen.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If the Senator will yield, Senator Levin has \njust come into the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand the pending amendment is the \namendment of Senator Nelson of Florida; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Which Senator Roberts and Senator Smith have cosponsored. \nI commend them on their amendment and their continuing efforts to \nremind us of the missing hero of whom we can never lose sight. As long \nas there is hope, we are going to remain targeted on trying to locate \nour wonderful American who is always on our minds.\n  I do not know if there is further debate on the amendment. If not, I \nhope that amendment can be adopted at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I believe that amendment has been cleared \non this side. I also compliment my colleagues on their tenacity in \nsticking with this issue. I was on the Intelligence Committee when this \nwas called to our attention. I believe Senator Smith was one of the \nfirst to get involved, as well as Senator Roberts and then Senator \nNelson from Florida.\n  We need to get to the bottom of this matter.

Mr. President, a few minutes ago, late-\nbreaking news was called to our attention. As a matter of fact, it was \nwhile we were debating the Scott Speicher amendment, which was adopted \nunanimously on this Defense authorization bill. Sadly, I have confirmed \nthat that news is accurate. A Reuters statement says:\n\n       A Federal appeals court found the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance \n     unconstitutional on Wednesday, saying it was illegal to ask \n     U.S. schoolchildren to vow fealty to one Nation under God.\n\n  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco overturned a 1954 \nact of Congress that added ``under God'' to the pledge, saying the \nwords violated the basic constitutional tenet of separation of church \nand state.\n  It is with a heavy heart that I would have to take the floor--I \nimagine I am just the first of many--to call to the attention of the \nSenate, and indeed to call to the attention of the courts, that I think \nthere is substantial legal justification. There is a huge difference \nbetween separation of church and state--which we all support--and the \nseparation of the state and of God. There is a huge difference.\n  The opening ceremony of the U.S. Senate each morning that we go into \nsession is a very solemn occasion. Overlooking this Chamber are the \nwords inscribed in gold, above the middle entrance into this Chamber, \nabove the two stately columns--inscribed in gold: ``In God We Trust.''\n  The opening ceremony, for those who have not participated in it, is a \nmost solemn occasion about which the historian of this Chamber, one of \nour own, the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia--who has \nbeen in Congress, if not over a half a century, certainly close to it, \nSenator Byrd--has taken it upon himself to educate the freshman \nSenators as to the dignity, the decorum, and the solemnity of the \nopening ceremony.\n  When the opening bells ring and those two doors to the left of the \nrostrum open, in walks the Presiding Officer accompanied by the Senate \nChaplain or the especially designated Chaplain for the day.\n  As the Presiding Officer walks in and starts to mount the rostrum, \nthe Presiding Officer steps up three of the four steps but does not \nascend on the fourth step, which is the level of the Presiding \nOfficer's desk and chair. Rather, the Presiding Officer remains on the \nthird step as the Chaplain ascends to the higher level, the level of \nthe rostrum.\n  This is the symbolic act. It is a symbolic act of raising the dignity \nof the position of the Chaplain of the Senate, or the designated \nChaplain of the Senate for the day, recognizing and elevating the \ndeity, or the representative of divine providence to that position. We \ndo that each day in the Senate.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am happy to yield to the distinguished \nSenator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I share the shock and dismay expressed by my colleague, \nmy friend from Florida, over the ruling of the Ninth Circuit Court \nrelative to the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools.\n  Without having read the decision, other than what has been released \nwithin the hour through the media, it would appear that ruling of the \nthree-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit--the Senator will concur that \nthis is only one of our appellate circuits--applies only to the States \nof that circuit.\n  Certainly, it would be my hope that this matter would be appealed to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, and that the Supreme Court would not accept \nthis decision and, hopefully, in my view, overrule the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  Is that the progression of events that my friend and colleague from \nFlorida hopes will be the next step that this particular controversy \nmight take?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Indeed, under our constitutional system--that \nis part of what I wanted to point out, and I pointed out to the Senate \nearlier today--we have a mechanism of checks and balances. The check \nand balance here is the right of appeal from this court of appeals in \nSan Francisco to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I have the confidence that the Supreme Court's nine Justices \nrepresenting the entire Nation would understand the difference between \nseparation of church and state as being the difference between the \nseparation of the state and God.\n  As I was saying, the dignity of this institution is started off each \nday under the watchful words inscribed in gold above the center door, \n``In God We Trust,'' with an opening ceremony in which the position of \nthe Chaplain is actually elevated above the Presiding Officer until the \nChaplain delivers the opening prayer which opens the business of the \nSenate.\n  Furthermore, I point out to our colleagues that as part of our \nconstitutional heritage--including the Constitution--one of the most \nimportant documents in our governmental archives is the Declaration of \nIndependence. I call to the attention of the Senate the words of the \nsecond paragraph:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\n  Then I point out that there are similar words at the end of the \nDeclaration:\n\n       And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm \n     reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually \n     pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred \n     Honor.\n\n  I have the confidence to know that when there is a judicial opinion \nthat I think so violates the national understanding and national sense \nof the proper perspective of a state and divine providence as opposed \nto the issue that we all support, the separation of church and state so \nthat anyone can worship as they wish if at all, then I think that \ndistinction needs to be clearly made as well as it needs to be reminded \nof all of the historical significance of our reliance upon divine \nprovidence that is a part of the very fabric of this Nation, of this \nGovernment, and of the documents upon which this Government was \nfounded.\n\n  I see the great Senator from Connecticut standing and I am anxious to \nhear what he has to say. Should all else fail, even in a judicial \ninterpretation, there is another check and balance given to us by this \ndocument; that is, the will of this Nation can be expressed by the \namending or an addition to this document, the Constitution. We can \nstart right here in this legislative body by the process of adding to \nthe Constitution, amending the Constitution\n\n[[Page S6090]]\n\nby the legislative branch's initiative of proposing a constitutional \namendment.\n  I have great confidence in the system--that this judicial decision by \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is not going to stand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise to join my friend and colleague from Florida, \nSenator Nelson, in expressing dismay, outrage, and amazement at the \nnews today of the decision by the Ninth Circuit Court declaring the \nrecitation of the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional.\n  I say to my friends from Florida and friends in the Chamber, when my \nstaff members told me this, I, frankly, thought they were joking. This \nis a decision that offends our national morality, that rejects the most \nuniversally shared values of our country, that diminishes our unity, \nand that attempts to undercut our strength at a time after September 11 \nwhen we need the strength, unity, and our shared belief in God which \nhas historically brought the American people together, and does so \ntoday.\n  There may have been a more senseless, ridiculous decision issued by a \ncourt somewhere at some time, but I have never heard of it. I find the \ndecision by this court hard to believe.\n  I remember a day, I say to my friends, a decade or so ago when the \nSupreme Court issued a ruling saying that it was unconstitutional for a \nclergymen--in that case, it was a Rabbi--to give an invocation at a \nhigh school graduation in Rhode Island. I couldn't believe that \ndecision. In some sense this decision is its progeny. It offends the \nvery basis of our rights as Americans.\n  My friend from Florida read from the Declaration of Independence. \nAccording to their decision of the Ninth Circuit Court, the reading of \nthe Declaration of Independence is unconstitutional.\n  If that isn't turning logic and morality on its head, I do not know \nwhat is, because the paragraph is the first statement by the Founders \nof our independence and the first declaration of the basis for our \nrights that have so distinguished our history in the 226 years since.\n  First paragraph:\n\n       When in the Course of human events . . . and to assume \n     among the powers of Earth, the separate and equal station to \n     which the Laws of Nature and Nature's God entitle them.\n\n  Right there is the basis of the assertion of independence--the rights \nthat we have under ``the Laws of Nature and Nature's God.''\n  And then the second paragraph, famous to every schoolchild and \nAmerican citizen:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\n  So that the premise of the rights that have distinguished America for \nthe 226 years since, that were embraced in the Constitution as an \nexpression of the declaration, all come from God, not from the Framers \nand the Founders, as gifted as they were, not from the philosophers of \nthe enlightenment who affected their judgments, but were the endowment \nof our Creator.\n  And that judgment has framed our history in two ways. It has been the \nbasis of our rights because it is from our shared belief in God, and \nthe foundation place it has in our system of government, as stated \nright here in the first statement of the first Americans, the \nDeclaration of Independence, that we are all children of the same God. \nThat means we all have the rights.\n  It also has meant that we feel a deep sense of unity with one \nanother. I remember, after the terrible events of September 11, how \nstruck I was by the classically American reaction that not only at that \nmoment when we were so shaken by the horror of inhumanity of what had \nhappened did we go to our houses of worship to ask for strength and \npurpose and comfort, we went to each other's houses of worship--that is \nthe American way--and gained strength and purpose from it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  We are privileged to serve on the Armed Services Committee.\n  When I first heard of this, I thought to myself about the hundreds \nand hundreds and hundreds of thousands of men and women who have worn \nthe uniform of our country and have gone beyond our shores to fight for \nfreedom. All of them were proud to stand in their schoolhouses and on \ntheir military bases, or whatever the case may be, and pledge \nallegiance to the flag of the United States of America.\n  Madam President, I join my friends in expressing our grave concern \nover this opinion.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Virginia.\n  I want to say a few words more.\n  One is that your statement reminds me, my dad served in World War II. \nMy dad passed away 18 years ago. One of the treasured possessions of \nhis that I have is a small Bible that he was given with a written \nstatement in it from President Roosevelt. All who served in defense of \nour liberty in World War II got similar Bibles--and to carry it with \nthem as a source of strength.\n  It has been my honor, each time I have been sworn in as a Senator up \nthere, to put my hand on that Bible. It meant a lot to me personally.\n  But under the twisted logic of this decision, it was unconstitutional \nfor the U.S. military, the Pentagon, to give my dad, and the \ngenerations of others since him, a Bible as a source of strength.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I have to say to my friend, my father \nserved in World War I as a doctor in the trenches. He was wounded and \nhighly decorated. And he carried, in his tunic, throughout every hour \nof the day, his prayer book which his mother had given him. And he \nnoted in it every single battle and engagement he was in which he \ntended to the sick and the wounded and those who died.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I appreciate my friend from Virginia sharing that \nmoving story.\n  I will conclude in a moment because I know----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Of course I will yield to my friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senator from Connecticut had a distinguished \nlegal career prior to coming here. I believe the Senator was attorney \ngeneral of the State of Connecticut; is that right?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I practiced law many years prior to coming back here and \ntried lots and lots of cases. We had a rule that when a judge ruled \ncontrary to the interests of your client, you were not to comment on \nthe judge.\n  I say to my friend, I am not constrained in this instance. I can say \nanything I want about the judge who wrote that opinion. And I say to my \nfriend from Connecticut, that judge, who is no youngster, was \nappointed. He graduated from law school in 1951 and was appointed by \nPresident Nixon to be a member of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I say to my friend, it is things like that that take away from what I \nthink is a great institution; that is, the people who serve in the bar \nof the United States, lawyers.\n  This is just so meaningless, so senseless, so illogical. I cannot \nimagine that a judge, who has graduated and been a lawyer for 50 years, \nmore than 50 years--does the Senator from Connecticut have any idea \nhow, logically, you could come up with an opinion such as this? I read \nthe highlights of the opinion. It is, for me, illogical, irrational. \nCan the Senator figure any rationality to this opinion?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Nevada.\n  In my opinion, having seen a precis of the decision, it offends all \nlogic. The facts of the circumstances are that students, by previous \ncourt decisions, are allowed, if they are offended by a part of the \npledge that says we are ``one nation under God,'' to not say the pledge \nor, in fact, to leave the room.\n  Secondly, this decision is the most extreme and ridiculous expression \nof what I take to be a fundamental misunderstanding of the religion \nclauses of the Constitution, which, to me, promised--if you will allow \nme to put it this way--freedom of religion, not freedom from religion. \nThey protect the American people against the establishment of an \nofficial religion but have always, in the best of times, acknowledged \nthe reality that our very rights, our very\n\n[[Page S6091]]\n\nexistence comes from an acknowledgment of the authority and goodness of \nAlmighty God, and that people of faith, throughout the 226 years since \nthen, in our history, are the ones who repeatedly have led movements \nthat have made the ideals of the Declaration and the Constitution \nreal--the abolitionists, the suffragettes, all those who worked, \nbeginning in the 19th century, and then in the 20th century, on social \nwelfare, child labor legislation, and, of course, the civil rights \nmovement of the 20th century.\n  So I do not see any logic. In fact, I think this decision offends \nlogic. It will outrage the public. And if there is anything positive \nthat comes out of it, it will unify this most religious and tolerant of \npeople.\n  We have found a way in this country, that is unique in world history, \nto express our shared faith in God, and to do so in a way that has not \nexcluded anyone. I was privileged to benefit from that and feel that in \na most personal and validating and inspiring way in the election of \n2000.\n  So I thank the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Virginia. I \nthank the Senator from Florida for initiating this discussion. I agree \nwith him, this decision will be appealed. I hope and trust it will be \noverturned. But if, may I say, God forbid, it is not overturned, then \nwe will join to amend the Constitution to make clear that in this one \nNation of ours--because we are one Nation under God--we are one Nation \nbecause of our faith in God, that the American people, children, \nforever forward will be able to stand and recite the pledge.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. If my two friends would allow me to propound a unanimous \nconsent request, we waited for 2 days to do this. As soon as I complete \nthis, the Senator from Connecticut will regain the floor.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6091-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 27, 2002\n\n  Mr. REID.

However, Senator Warner's amendment does not choose which \narea is more worthy of attention, and therefore it risks compromising \nboth.\n  Our job in deciding the budget is about making hard choices. Senator \nLevin's amendment simply sets priorities and it states that combating \nterrorism should be this administration's top priority.\n  I do not think this is a difficult decision. We must remember that \nthis amendment only authorizes funding for fiscal year 2003. And in the \nnext 18 months, the citizens of the United States are going to be \nanxious, and even afraid, of a car bomb, an explosion in a harbor, an \nexplosion in a mall, a dirty bomb, a biological attack. I think the way \nto protect Americans is clear: put resources into counterterrorism.\n  The senior Senator from Virginia has been assured by the Office of \nManagement and Budget that there will be over $800 million in inflation \nsavings at the midsession review. At that time, the President will have \na choice. He can invest $800 million more into a missile defense \nprogram that has already been robustly funded at $6.8 billion or the \nPresident can invest the funds in the $1 billion of counterterrorism \nrequirements that the military has asked for and not received.\n  The Levin amendment expresses the views of Congress, and I believe \nthe views of the American people, that resources directed toward the \nmost immediate need, the most immediate threat, fighting terrorism, \nwill best protect the United States and its citizens.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I would just like to take a moment to \nexpress my thanks to Senator Levin and Senator Warner for working with \nme to clear this amendment in such a timely fashion. I think special \nthanks should also go to Senator Carnahan, a member of both the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship and the Senate Armed \nServices Committee for her support of this amendment. Senator \nCarnahan's work was vital to this amendment's acceptance by the Armed \nServices Committee, and I thank her for her assistance as well as for \nher continuing interest and advocacy for America's small business \nFederal contractors. I would also like to thank Senator Bond for his \nhelp on the Republican side. Concern for our Nation's Federal \ncontractors remains an important area of bipartisan interest on the \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, and I am pleased to have \nhis support on this amendment.\n  Briefly, our amendment requires the Secretary of the Army to conduct \na study on the impact the creation of an Army Contracting Agency will \nhave on small business participation in Army procurement, especially at \nthe local level where many small businesses provide support services to \nArmy installations. When we first received word of Secretary of the \nArmy Thomas E. White's plan to consolidate army procurement activities \ninto a central location, I was very concerned about its possible \naffects on small businesses. And despite briefings from Army personnel \nand assurances that small business participation will not be negatively \naffected, I remain concerned as do my colleagues. This is a critical \ntime for our armed forces, and I do not wish to cause any confusion in \nthe procurement process that could affect our military preparedness. \nTherefore, we are taking a ``wait and see'' approach to the Army's \nplan.\n  Our amendment will help monitor the situation at the Army by \nrequiring them to keep track of small business participation in their \nprocurement, especially at the local level. The amendment requires the \nArmy to track any changes in the use of bundled contracts, sometimes \ncalled consolidated contracts, as a result of this new procurement \nagency, as well as track small business access to procurement \npersonnel.\n  Let me be clear. Removing contracting authority from Army \ninstallations and centralizing it will result in less small business \nparticipation, but steps can be taken to overcome this. These steps \nmust be proactive and represent a real commitment to maintaining small \nbusiness access to procurement opportunities. And while I do not \nbelieve Congress should dictate every detail of how the Army chooses to \nstructure itself for procurement purposes, Congress must be concerned \nabout the consequences of that structure.\n  I look forward to working with the Secretary to ensure that an \nappropriate level of small business participation in Army procurement \nis maintained.\n  Once again, I would like to thank Senator Bond and Senator Carnahan \nfor their support on this issue, as well as Senator Levin and Senator \nWarner for accepting this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I am pleased that Chairman Levin and I \nhave been able to come to agreement on my amendment to restore $814 \nmillion that the President can allocate to ballistic missile defense \nand to activities of the Department of Defense to counter terrorism and \non Chairman Levin's second-degree amendment.\n  Prior to their approval, I would like to offer some clarifying \nremarks concerning the intent and effect of these two amendments.\n\n[[Page S6098]]\n\n  The underlying Warner amendment takes advantage of the fact that the \nOffice of Management and Budget is undertaking a midyear reassessment \nof the inflation assumptions built into the administration's fiscal \nyear 2003 budget. I was informed 2 weeks ago that this reassessment \nwill result in a new estimate that inflation in 2003 will be lower than \nearlier thought. What this means, in practical terms, is that the \nDepartment of Defense budget has an inflation ``bonus'' built in less \nfunding will be required to purchase the goods and services in the \nDepartment's budget. Since these funds are excess to the Department's \nneeds, there is no programmatic impact resulting from the inflation \nsavings being used for other purposes.\n  Thus the Warner amendment will allow the President to reallocate, as \nhe determines to be in the national interest, $814 million toward two \nof the highest defense priorities, ballistic missile defense and DOD \nactivities to combat terrorism, with no other programmatic impact.\n  This amendment will provide the President the option to restore all \nthe missile defense funds that were cut by the Armed Services \nCommittee. In my view, these reductions would impede progress, increase \nprogram risk, and undermine the effort to provide for the rapid \ndevelopment and deployment of missile defenses for our Nation, our \nallies and friends, and our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen \ndeployed overseas. I believe that the President would be completely \njustified in using the authority provided in this amendment for the \nmissile defense effort.\n  I believe that Senator Levin shares this opinion of my amendment, \neven in light of the effect of his second degree amendment. Our \ncolloquy this afternoon indicates clearly that that the chairman's \nintent is not to restrict the President's options in any way.\n  Again, I am please that Chairman Levin and I were able to come to \nagreement on this difficult issue.\n  I would ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter \nChairman Levin and I received this afternoon from the Office of \nManagement and Budget stating the view of the Director of OMB that the \npresident retains the options of using the funds provided in my \namendment on missile defense.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2002.\n       Dear Chairman Levin and Senator Warner: It is the \n     understanding of the Office of Management and Budget, based \n     on the Levin-Warner colloquy, that if the Levin 2nd degree \n     amendment is adopted, the funds provided in the underlying \n     Warner amendment, if appropriated, could be expended on \n     missile defense and other activities determined by the \n     President.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the second degree amendment which I have \noffered expresses the determination and decision of Congress that the \nwar on terrorism should be ``the top priority'' for spending the \nadditional funds identified by the pending Warner amendment. The Warner \namendment specifies two possible purposes for the expected additional \nfunds following the inflation recalculation in the midsession review. \nThe first specified purpose is ballistic missile defense programs. The \nsecond specified purpose is combating terrorism at home and abroad.\n  My amendment is based on the large number of unmet needs in our war \nagainst terrorism, including those identified by the members of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. We should put additional resources where the \ngreatest threats exist, and the terrorist threat is clearly the number \none threat that we face.\n  There have been a number of efforts in the last twenty-four hours to \npersuade me to weaken my amendment or to dilute its intention away from \nfocusing resources on combatting terrorism. I, along with my \ncolleagues, including Senators Harry Reid and Jack Reed, have resisted \nthese efforts. We will soon determine whether my amendment is adopted \nby voice vote or whether there will be a rollcall on it. But whichever \nway we decide to proceed, one thing needs to be clear, which is that \nthe express language and intent of my amendment is that Congress speak \nclearly as to what it views as the top priority for the expenditure of \nany additional funds from the inflation recalculation. That priority is \n``combating terrorism at home and abroad.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support my second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam president, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLevin's amendment No. 4046 be agreed to; Senator Warner's amendment No. \n4007, as amended, be agreed to; that the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; and that the preceding all occur without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, not to object, I just ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison be added as a cosponsor to my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to the request?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4046) was agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4007), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I would like to take a few moments to \ndiscuss an important issue that is covered in this bill: the need for \nthe Department of Defense, as well as the entire Federal Government, to \nhave the capability to continue essential operations after a direct \nattack on primary facilities. The importance of ensuring Continuity Of \nOperations (COOP) is a lesson that we all elevated in priority after \nSeptember 11, 2001. Many of us in Congress and the Federal Government \nhad begun to recognize the vulnerability of our critical \ninfrastructures--especially our information networks--to disruption or \ndestruction, prior to 9/11. I had even initiated an information \nassurance scholarship program to begin developing a cadre of \nprofessionals in DOD to address this potential problem area.\n  There were, however, many in private industry that learned this same \nlesson almost 10 years earlier, and as a result, were far more prepared \nthan the Federal Government when terrorists attacked the World Trade \nCenter.\n  The financial services industry is one that has historically handled \nan extraordinary amount of information. They track and record every \nfinancial transaction that occurs each day on Wall Street. In addition \nto an enormous amount of information, the financial services industry \ndeals with information that is extremely critical in nature.\n  After the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in May, 1993 \nthis industry asked the question: ``What if the terrorists had been \nsuccessful in bringing down these buildings?'' Their conclusion was \nsobering. It would have resulted in an extraordinary disruption of the \nU.S. economy for years.\n  Accordingly, the New York financial institutions tasked the data \nstorage industry to develop a technology that would allow information \nto be stored, in a second-by-second identical state, in two \ngeographically separate locations. The goal was for each financial \nentity to have a primary data center in the city and a secondary \n``mirrored-site'' in another State. If there was ever an outage at the \nprimary location, no financial transaction would be lost, and all of \nthe systems and networks could ``fail-over'' to the secondary center \noutside of the city and immediately put to use.\n  In 1994 this technology was developed, validated and delivered. For \nthe first time, information of all types, coming from computer systems \nof all makes and models could be replicated between two geographically \nseparate locations. The ``mirrored'' data center, using sophisticated \nremote data storage technologies, had been born.\n  No one ever envisioned that this remote data storage technology would \nbe tested to the degree it was on September 11, 2001. The financial \nservices industry's dedicated focus to protecting Wall Street's \nfinancial information resulted in that industry being more prepared \nthan any other to handle an unanticipated natural or man-made disaster. \nAs the World Trade Center towers collapsed, tragically ending the lives \nof thousands of hard working\n\n[[Page S6099]]\n\nAmericans, numerous data centers containing massive amounts of \nfinancial information vanished in an instant. The institutions \nutilizing this technology, however, did not lose a single piece of \ninformation and the financial markets were able to reopen almost \nimmediately. Some could have opened that same afternoon.\n  On the opposite end of the spectrum of information assurance \nreadiness, unfortunately, is our Federal Government. Many of our key \ngovernment agencies have their information backed-up only through out-\ndated tape systems, and with the back-up tapes stored on site, they \nwould also be destroyed in any deliberate attacks. If destroyed, that \ninformation could never be recovered or restored.\n  For years, agencies within the Federal Government have neglected the \nrequirement to make the necessary investments in back-up data centers \nand remote data storage technology. At the same time, however, every \nFederal agency has grown extremely dependant on their data centers and \nthe information contained within. The Department of Defense creates, \ndisseminates, and relies more and more on electronic information to \nexecute its mission and manage its organizations and people. The loss \nof a critical database and the information it contains could be \ncatastrophic for our national security. We must ensure that the U.S. \nmilitary has the same level of capability that was resident in the data \ncenters of the financial institutions operating in the World Trade \nCenter.\n  Nothing can diminish the tragedy that occurred on September 11 or \nerase the pain that so many suffered. The foresight of private \nindustry, however, in developing the capability to ``mirror'' \ninformation between geographically separate locations, resulted in \nprotecting trillions of dollars in financial transactions and other \ncritical records--the loss of which would have crippled the American, \nas well as the global economy, for years. I commend the exceptional \ncompetency of American industry's engineering talent, as well as the \ncommitment of the private sector's leadership to invest the millions of \nresearch and development dollars to develop this capability. I also \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to ensure \nthat the ``mirror'' capability is expeditiously and thoroughly employed \nwithin the Department of Defense. The protection of our critical \ninformation infrastructure is something we all need to be mindful of, \nand an area that deserves our best efforts to ensure its security.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I commend ranking member Warner for his \nstewardship of the fiscal year 2003 defense budget process in the \nSenate. We face many challenges to our national security in this day \nand age and I am thankful for his leadership.\n  One of those emerging challenges we face is the terrorist threat to \nour food supply, specifically U.S. agriculture. On the Federal, State, \nand local level, we need to establish procedures to detect, deter, and \nrespond to large scale coordinated attacks against livestock and \nagricultural commodities.\n  Toward that end, I ask the Senate to support my amendment to \nauthorize, with an offset, $1,000,000 for research, development, test, \nand evaluation, defense-wide in-house laboratory independent research, \nPE 0601103D8Z, for research, analysis, and assessment of efforts to \ncounter possible agroterrorist attacks. It is my hope that universities \nwith established expertise in the agricultural sciences can conduct \nstudies and exercises that lead to better coordination between Federal, \nState, and local authorities as they attempt to detect, deter, and \nrespond to large-scale coordinated attacks on U.S. agriculture.\n  Most importantly, I envision universities assisting the Department of \nDefense in determining what role, if any, our military or Defense \nagencies play in countering agroterrorism. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport my amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, the administration version of the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill included a provision that \nwould modify the Marine Mammal Protection Act, MMPA, with respect to \n``military readiness activities.'' While acknowledging the need for a \nwell-trained military, it is my strong view that this provision should \nnot be included in the bill.\n  The administration proposal on MMPA would alter the current \ndefinition of ``harassment'' for ``takings'' of marine mammals under \nthe MMPA--a cornerstone of the statute. Action on this provision via \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill is problematic for several \nreasons.\n  First, the MMPA is a complex statute. These provisions have not been \nappropriately examined in a Senate hearing--no testimony is in the \nrecord from experts and others who need to consider the validity of the \nissues raised and the ramifications of the proposed language.\n  Second, the MMPA has many stakeholders and end users. It would be \ninappropriate to alter the statute for one set of users and not others. \nThe MMPA needs to be taken as a whole, and not amended piecemeal.\n  Third, it is not clear that these changes are needed, or that the \nproposal brought forward by the administration would be the correct way \nto address concerns.\n  For these reasons, I want to make it clear that I oppose inclusion of \nthis provision in the Department of Defense authorization bill--whether \nvia floor amendments or via conference with the House. The committee of \njurisdiction--the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation of \nwhich I am chairman--is the appropriate venue for considering the \nmilitary's concerns and any proposals for change.\n\n\n navy airborne radar technology capable of all-weather attack on time \n            critical targets and enemy mobile ground forces\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I come to the floor today to discuss \nwith the distinguished chair of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee, \nSenator Landrieu, and the senior Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, \nabout developing Navy airborne radar technology capable of all-weather \nattack of time critical targets and of the enemies' mobile ground \nforces.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my good friend for bringing this issue to the \nattention of the Senate. This research area is important to the Navy \nand the defense of the United States. Technology being developed to \nsupport this capability is currently planned to be ready for transition \nto Navy aircraft in the fiscal year 2006 time frame, but can be \ncompleted sooner with additional funding in fiscal year 2003. The House \nof Representatives included an additional $9 million for this purpose \nin its version of the Defense authorization bill.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am delighted to discuss this important technology \narea with my good friends from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Technologies associated with one of the Navy's \ndesignated Future Naval Capabilities, ``Time Critical Strike,'' are \nbeing implemented through a team effort at the Office of Naval Research \nin conjunction with the responsible acquisition program management \norganizations within the Navy. This technology area addressed the \ndocumented requirement for reducing the target cycle to below 10 \nminutes and enhancing the ability to detect, locate and strike these \ntargets under all weather conditions--a current operational deficiency.\n  Mr. DODD. As I mentioned earlier, the House bill includes $9 million \nfor this purpose. My understanding, however, is that at least $12 \nmillion in fiscal year 2003 funding is needed to fully accelerate this \nprogram.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is my understanding as well. In light of recent \nhostilities, this technology area is an excellent example of the things \nthe military will need to defeat a highly mobile enemy. We certainly \nhope that we can work with the distinguished chairman to provide \nnecessary resources for the development of these capabilities when we \nconference this bill with the House.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am aware of the value of time critical to strike the \nwar fighter and look forward to working with my good friends from \nConnecticut on this important issue as we move to a conference with the \nHouse.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my good friend for her support for this program.\n\n\n                              section 241\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I am pleased to join the chairman of \nthe\n\n[[Page S6100]]\n\nArmed Services Committee in a colloquy regarding the extending \nauthorization of pilot programs for revitalizing Department of Defense \nlaboratories. I seek to clarify the congressional intent of Section 241 \nof the bill before the Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Section 241 is part of the Senate's continuing efforts to \nimprove the Department's labs and test centers. This pilot program \nexpands and authorizes a number of innovative business practice and \npersonnel demonstrations that are very important to developing the \ntechnological superiority that our military needs. The legislation will \nextend the time period for the pilot program authority for three years. \nThis extension is consistent with the Department of Defense's \nlegislative proposals that the Armed Services Committee received. I \nwould like to thank Senator Landrieu, chair of the Emerging Threats and \nCapabilities Subcommittee, for taking the lead in developing this \nlegislation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The language stipulates that not more than one \npartnership may be established as a limited liability corporation, or \nLLC. Has that site been designated?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If he choose to establish an LLC as part of the program, \nthe Secretary of Defense will designate its location from among the DoD \norganizations participating in the pilot program.\n  Ms. MIKUKSKI. I understand that the Aberdeen Test Center in Maryland \nhas invested great effort into pursuing this opportunity. I also note \nthat the Secretary of the Army has approved Aberdeen's LLC program as \none of the new initiatives under the Army's Business Initiative Council \nto improve efficiency in business operations and processes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am familiar with the Aberdeen proposal and this \nlegislation could be used to implement their plans, if the Secretary of \nDefense designates it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. How will the membership from the private and academic \nsectors be determined?\n  Mr. LEVIN. A competitive process will be used to select participants \nin any of the partnerships established by the legislation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The legislative language permits the members of the LLC \nto ``contribute funds to the corporation, accept contribution of funds \nfor the corporation, and provide materials, services, and use of \nfacilities for research, technology, and infrastructure of the \ncorporation,'' if doing so will improve the efficiency of the \nperformance of research, test, and evaluation functions of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes, you are correct. The committee believes that \ninnovative partnerships, better business practices, and the \ncontinuation and expansion of the innovative personnel demonstrations \nauthorized in this and other programs are all important for the \nrevitalization of the Department's labs and test centers.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the chairman for his support on this important \nissue.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I support the Hutchison-\nBingaman amendment and am pleased to cosponsor it.\n  The purpose of my addressing the issue is two fold: One, to impress \nupon my fellow Members that if Congress intends to have input into the \nBRAC process, the only real time to do this is during the current \nsession. While ``BRAC 2005'' leads people to believe that we have \nseveral years before we have to worry about this, the truth is that the \ncriteria must be published prior to the end of 2003, and hence we \nshould provide our input in 2002; two, this legislation, sponsored by \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchinson sets up criteria that must be met before \nconsideration in closing a military facility. We are not eliminating \nthe ability of DoD to run the process, we are pursuing legislation that \nwill clarify the process. To bring the process out into the open \nallowing us all to see how a decision was derived and these are \ndecisions that affects thousands of people and cost many millions or \nbillions of dollars.\n  It is time to bring--businesslike competitive accounting into the \nconsideration process when dealing with issues of BRAC. The Hutchison \nlegislation will accomplish that by simply establishing some minimal, \nmeasurable, and articulated standards to be used in making major \ndecisions. Some of these issues are: environmental costs, costs of \nFederal and State environmental compliance laws; costs and effects of \nrelocating critical infrastructure; anticipated savings vs. actual \nsavings; current or potential public or private partnerships in support \nof Department activities; capacity of State and localities to respond \npositively to economic, and this bill requires the SecDef to publish \nthe formula to which different criteria will be weighed by the DOD in \nmaking its recommendations for closure of realignment of military \ninstallations.\n  Not only do I support this move on its stand alone merit of bringing \naccountability and transparency to major defense and economic \ndecisions, I also support it as a Senator who has had personal \nexperience with the secretive BRAC process as it affects my own \nconstituents and friends.\n  The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is a national asset to the defense \nindustry and naval service. It has a long history of supporting the \nU.S. Navy, yet despite this long history, it has appeared on the DoD \nBRAC his list. Having seen the work this facility and its people \ncontribute I will continue to support and work to enhance PNSY's \ncapabilities. Its outstanding work performance, value to the Navy, and \nvalue to the America people are critical in ensuring national defense, \nand continue to examine innovative roles PNSY can perform in addition \nto its critical job of keeping America's nuclear submarines at sea.\n  If the Secretary of Defense chooses to examine facilities across the \ncountry, he may do so and I encourage his attempts at streamlining DoD \nand enhancing its financial practices--to make sure the taxpayers get \nthe most for their hard-earned dollars. However, clearly defined \nstandards of accountability, and the decisionmaking process itself, \nshould be open to congressional scrutiny and openness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6100-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6100-S6105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS DECISION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I yield the floor to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I wanted to ask this of my \nfriend from Connecticut, who I think has variously served in so many \ndifferent role models to the Senate, variously described as the Senator \nwho is the conscience of the Senate, certainly as a former attorney \ngeneral of his State, someone who understands the legal ramifications \nof arguments such as this.\n  In my earlier comments today, I had said that I thought there was in \nlaw, and the development of law, and the development of the \nConstitution, which you and I both quoted from, the Declaration, a \nclear distinction, as the distinguished Senator has noted, of the \nfreedom of religion. And that part of that body of law that would make \nup that freedom, that religious freedom, would be a freedom to worship \nas one would want, if at all, and that that is a right we jealously \nprotect, just as we protect the other freedoms--freedom of speech, \nfreedom of the press, freedom of assembly, and so forth--and that when \nyou look at this freedom, there is a distinct difference, as the case \nlaw has developed, of the separation of church and state which would \nembody that idea that we don't cram religion down anybody's throat, \nthat we leave it up to them individually to express their own beliefs, \nif they want to at all, and to believe as they want to, if at all. That \nis the concept of separation of church and state, as distinguished from \nthere not being necessarily a separation of the state and of God.\n  Quite to the contrary, on these historical documents, as I pointed \nout in that statement above the center door, in the fact that we \nelevate the Chaplain in the opening prayer, in the very formal and \ndignified opening ceremonies of the Senate, that the Chaplain is \nelevated on the top level and the Presiding Officer, while the Chaplain \noffers the prayer, is on a lower level, the fact that we have minted in \nour coins, ``In God we trust.''\n\n  I would ask the distinguished Senator from the great State of \nConnecticut if he would share with us his commentary about that \nseparation of those two concepts.\n\n[[Page S6101]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Florida.\n  We have worked our way along a jurisprudential path that has taken us \nin our time to a result that I believe was totally unintended by the \nFramers of the Constitution, by the writers of the Declaration of \nIndependence, by the drafters of the Bill of Rights particularly. This \ndecision today is the most extreme and senseless expression of it.\n  We believe in the separation of church and state. We believe in \nfreedom of religion. We believe in every individual's freedom to \nobserve and worship as he or she is moved in his or her heart to do so. \nWe have always respected nonbelievers. But we have asked that the great \nmajority of Americans who may approach the altar from different paths, \nnonetheless worship the same God, that we not be deprived of our rights \nto do so, and to do so in a public context that does not diminish the \nrights of any one of us but enlarges and strengthens the rights of the \nwhole. That has been the gift of this country.\n  I heard it once described, I read it once described by someone, as \nAmerica's civic religion, nondenominational, deistic, God centered, \ninclusive, and tolerant. There is a great book that had a profound \neffect on me, written by Father Neuhaus, which was called ``The Naked \nPublic Square.'' It commented on some of the earlier generation of \ndecisions that had put the expressions of this civic religion, this \nshared faith in God, out of our public places and said we would suffer \nfrom that because the vacuum doesn't remain for long; other forces, \nless humane, less moral, less unifying, tend to fill the public square.\n  I always believed this pledge, with this simple statement that was \nadded under President Eisenhower, that we pledge our loyalty to this \none Nation under God, was beyond question, beyond rebuke. It is the \nbaseline, most accessible statement of the source of this country's \nvalues and strengths.\n  To my way of thinking, it obviously in no way compromises the most \nimportant freedom of religion, which is the most important aspect of \nthe religion clause--the freedom of religion. It doesn't compromise any \nsingle American's ability to worship God or not to worship God as they \nchoose. It certainly does not establish religion in the sense that the \nFramers clearly intended because they came from a country that had an \nofficial religion and discriminated against them because of their \nreligion. In this sense, the American people have not lost their way. I \nthink a lot of our judges have in their decisions. This one is so far \nout, so offensive, that I hope it draws a reaction that is unifying and \nconstructive.\n  Again, I say to my friend from Florida, my expectation is that this \ndecision will be appealed. My hope is that the Supreme Court will \noverturn this decision. If they do not, then we will all join as one, I \nwould guess, to offer a constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator further yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I would hope also, as he has accurately \noutlined the legal course of appeal, that there would be a rush to the \njudicial chambers to stay that ruling, as it applies to the Ninth \nCircuit, because under existing law that would mean people could not \npledge allegiance anywhere in that circuit, which includes the great \nState of California, and others in the immediate vicinity. I would \ncertainly hope there would be a stay of that ruling until it would come \nup to the U.S. Supreme Court so that they could render their decision.\n  Then, as the Senator says, God forbid that they should rule that it \nwere constitutional; then we could start our process here of adding to \nthe Constitution that would allow that.\n  I just want to associate my thoughts with those articulated so \neloquently by the Senator from Connecticut, who comes from a different \nfaith perspective than mine but with whom we are joined in the \nhistorical development of this Nation to which, as he pointed out, so \nmany people fled from a country of established religion, and, indeed, \neven documented in the Mayflower Compact, and then memorialized in the \nDeclaration of Independence, that there was something different about \nthis country. It was not going to have a state-sponsored religion; \nrather, it was going to be an enclave, an oasis, a place to which \npeople of all faiths could come, and those with no faith, and within \nthe protection of the laws they could believe and express their beliefs \nas they so chose.\n\n  As a result, we have this wonderful, and sometimes messy, experience \nof democracy. Sometimes we make mistakes, but we have the ability under \nthis document to correct those mistakes, because of all the checks and \nbalances that are inherent within this document.\n  So I appreciate very much the Senator's comments. They will mean a \nlot to the rest of us.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Florida very much for his \nleadership and eloquence. I will yield to the Senator from Nevada in a \nmoment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Before the Senator yields the floor, I would like to \nassociate myself with this colloquy, before we close this extraordinary \nchapter of Senate history.\n  I say to my colleagues, let us not wait for the Supreme Court to act. \nWhy don't we go ahead and formulate this amendment, put it together, \nhave it in place, presumably with all 100 U.S. Senators, and they can \ntake judicial cognizance of what is about to happen. I think that might \nnot be a bad idea. The Senators have initiated it, so let us join and \nwe will start the recruiting today.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I accept the challenge and the opportunity. We will \nwork on that together.\n  A final thought on Senator Nelson's comments. This decision is so \ntwisted. We both referred to the Declaration of Independence. There it \nis stated that the rights we enjoy as Americans are the endowment of \nour Creator or are a gift from God. So this court has interpreted the \nrights that we have to mean that we cannot join to pledge our \nallegiance to the one nation under God, whose endowment was the source \nof the rights. It is just a twisted piece of logic that is offensive to \nour values and, I believe, also to our minds.\n  I thank my colleagues. I am delighted to see my friend and colleague \nfrom Nevada. I yield the floor to him at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for coming to the \nfloor so quickly to respond to what I believe to be an outrageous \njudicial decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Let me read from the Declaration of Independence:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights.\n\n  The fact that our Founders referred to a Creator means that they \nunderstood that we were a Nation founded under God.\n  In the judicial decision, which I have with me--Mr. Newdow's daughter \nwas the subject of this decision--it says:\n\n       Mr. Newdow does not allege that his daughter's teacher or \n     the school district requires his daughter to participate in \n     reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Rather, he claims that his \n     daughter is injured when she is compelled to ``watch and \n     listen'' as her state-employed teacher and her state-run \n     school leads her classmates in a ritual proclaiming that \n     there is a God and that ours is ``one nation under God.''\n\n  It goes on further to say in a footnote that:\n\n       Compelling the students to recite the pledge was held to be \n     a first amendment violation in the West Virginia Board of \n     Education v. Barnette in 1943.\n\n  That has been clear. They were not alleging that she was forced to \nrecite the pledge; she was just injured for having to sit there and \nlisten to the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  I think that our courts are completely out of control. If we study \nthe history of our country, the founding principles of our country, we \nread about the proceedings of the Continental Congress. We read that \nour Founders would actually stop in the middle of a session when they \nwould be in a logjam, and that they would get down on their knees right \nby their desks and pray together--pray for divine guidance for the \ndecisions they were about to make.\n  Does anybody really believe that our Founders, when they were \ndrafting the Bill of Rights and the first amendment, where it says that \n``Congress shall make no law,'' forbidding the establishment of a \nstate-run religion, that this\n\n[[Page S6102]]\n\nNinth Circuit Court decision is what they meant? No, our founding \nfathers explicitly ensured the free exercise of religion. Do we think \nthat the Founders believed that a Pledge of Allegiance saying that our \nNation is ``under God,'' or that we see up here ``in God we trust,'' or \nthat we see on our money ``in God we trust,'' that was a State-\nestablished religion?\n  The beautiful thing about our Creator is that he gave us the freedom \nto worship him or not. In America, we have the freedom to worship or \nnot, according to what our conscience tells us.\n  But to somehow say that having a child listen to the Pledge of \nAllegiance is establishing a religion and impeding on an individuals \nfree exercise of religion, is outrageous.\n  Let me read from part of the dissenting opinion of the circuit, \naccording to Judge Fernandez:\n\n       Such phrases as ``in God we trust'' or ``under God'' have \n     no tendency to establish a religion in this country, or to \n     suppress anyone's exercise or non-exercise of religion, \n     except in the fevered eye of persons who most fervently would \n     like to drive all tincture of religion out of public life or \n     our polity. Those expressions have not caused any real harm \n     of that sort over the years since 1791, and are not likely to \n     do so in the future.\n\n  I think it is up to this body to take it upon itself to correct what \nthe Ninth Circuit has done. I agree with the senior Senator from \nVirginia that we need to reestablish in this country what this \ndocument--the Constitution of the United States--really says and really \nwas about. Part of that is studying the history of the founding of this \ncountry.\n  What did the Founders intend when they wrote this document? Based on \ntheir practices, they did not want the state to say this is how you \nwill practice a religion. The Baptists are not going to be our official \nreligion, nor the Methodists, who came from Europe, where they had an \nofficial state religion. They, our Founders, wanted the free exercise \nto practice their religion, not according to how the state dictated, \nbut to recognize that individuals have rights given by our Creator to \nworship as they, as individuals, see fit, as they were given by our \nCreator. To say that these Founders would have somehow said that it \nwould be against the Constitution they were writing to recognize the \nrights given to an individual by the Creator is outrageous.\n  So I hope that all Americans will be as outraged as I am by this \ndecision. I think they are going to be. I was on an aircraft carrier \nthis last weekend talking to a lot of the sailors that sacrifice so \nmuch for this country. It was during the middle of a training session \non the U.S.S. Constellation that I was visiting with them. Like we in \nCongress do, they take an oath to defend the Constitution. I would have \nliked to have heard what their opinions would have been regarding this \njudicial decision.\n  As my father taught me when I was a young man, there are no atheists \nin foxholes.\n  Any time our young men and women go in to battle, God is there to \ncomfort them. We have chaplains in our military to counsel people \nbecause we recognize that during times of battle and war, people need \nspiritual guidance, not to establish a religion, but to understand that \nwe have a Creator who has blessed this country and that we need His \nguidance.\n  In conclusion, Madam President, I believe this country needs to \nreestablish that we are one nation under God. Madam President, you \nexperienced that in New York City on September 11. We saw the people of \nyour state and the rest of the people in the United States turn to God \nfor guidance. We saw posters everywhere: ``One nation under God,'' \n``United we stand, under God.''\n  This country recognizes its history, and because we have been \nestablished under God, and remain under God, we have been blessed. If \nwe abandon that now and allow the courts to abandon that, I believe \nthis country will be in trouble. We simply cannot allow that to happen.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I wanted to come to the floor to share \nwith our colleagues my intent to bring a resolution to the floor this \nafternoon expressing our strong disagreement with the decision the \nSenator from Nevada has just addressed.\n  I will soon propound a unanimous consent request to bring the \nresolution to the floor and to have a rollcall vote and then to allow \nSenators to express themselves once the vote has been cast. Just as \nsoon as we can get agreement to set the time--I would like to do it \nwithin the next 15 or 20 minutes, if we can reach an agreement with the \nmanagers of the bill.\n  Madam President, I have not had the opportunity to hear all of what \nthe Senator from Nevada said, but this decision is nuts. This decision \nis just nuts. We ought to recognize that there are those who differ \nwith the overwhelming sentiment expressed by Americans of all stripes, \nof all regions of the country, young and old.\n  We added the language, ``under God'' in 1954. Then-President Dwight \nEisenhower said:\n\n       In this way, we are reaffirming the transcendence of \n     religious faith in America's heritage and future; in this \n     way, we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons \n     which forever will be our country's most powerful resource in \n     peace and war.\n\n  I agree with President Eisenhower. I agree with the overwhelming \nnumber of people who have already expressed themselves in the hours \nsince this decision.\n  The resolution we are propounding this afternoon really will state \ntwo things: First, our strong disagreement with the decision; and, \nsecond, it will authorize the legal counsel of the Senate to intervene \non behalf of the Senate in the Supreme Court when the case comes before \nthe Court. This is not unprecedented; we have done it before.\n\n  I hope overwhelming support will be demonstrated on both sides of the \naisle. I hope we can do this quickly. I think we need to send a clear \nmessage that the Congress disagrees, the Congress is going to \nintervene, the Congress is going to do all it can to live up to the \nexpectations of the American people.\n  We have been drawn together to face a tremendous tragedy in the last \n9 months. In part, that healing process has come by our belief in the \nSupreme Being and our belief in the faith that comes in the strength \nthat we draw from our faith.\n  I hope our colleagues will support the resolution. I hope we can \naddress it within the next few minutes. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I commend our distinguished leader, and \nthe Republican leader will soon come to the floor and join him on this \nmatter. We had a marvelous little debate here. The distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut, the distinguished Senator from Florida, my \ndistinguished colleague from Nevada, and I suggested that this body \ntake action and take it fast. And here we are, ready to act.\n  I respectfully and humbly ask that my name be added as a cosponsor \nbehind my colleague from Connecticut and my colleague from Florida, \nwherever they might be on the roster, and those rallying to the cause.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I simply wish to respond to the Senator \nfrom Virginia and thank him for his kind words and tell him I will be \nhappy to add his name as a cosponsor to the resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have listened with some interest to \nwhat has been discussed on the floor with respect to the Ninth Circuit \nCourt opinion. I have great respect for courts in this country, but it \nraises the question: Is there one ounce of common sense left when you \nhear a decision announced today that suggests that the Pledge of \nAllegiance somehow is in contravention to the principles of the \nConstitution of the United States?\n  I do not understand for a moment how a majority of that court could \nhave made this ruling. Some people need their collective heads examined \nwhen we hear opinions such as this.\n  We had a celebration on the 200th birthday of the writing of the \nConstitution in that room in Philadelphia. Fifty-five people went back \nto that celebration. I was selected to be 1 of the 55. Two hundred \nyears before, 55 white men were in that room in the hot summer of \nPhiladelphia, and they wrote the Constitution. Two hundred\n\n[[Page S6103]]\n\nyears later, 55 of us went back--men, women, minorities--and we had a \nceremony and a celebration of the 200th birthday of the writing of that \nwonderful document.\n  As my colleague from West Virginia, I think the resident scholar on \nthe Constitution, knows, in that room sits the chair where George \nWashington sat as he presided over the Constitutional Convention, and \nBen Franklin sat on one side, and Mason, and Madison. They debated \nduring that summer the provisions of a constitution for this country.\n  I sat in that room that day and thought to myself: What a remarkable \nthing it was for a man from a town of 300 people in a farming community \nin southwestern North Dakota to be able to sit in that room and \ncelebrate with 54 of my colleagues the 200th birthday of the writing of \nthe Constitution.\n\n  I do not know the Constitution as my colleague, Senator Byrd, does. I \nhave read it many times and studied it as best I can, but I guarantee \nyou, there is not any way to creatively read that document that allows \na court to say that somehow the Pledge of Allegiance abridges that \ndocument called the U.S. Constitution.\n  As my colleague said, that is just plain nuts. I do not for the life \nof me understand where common sense has gone. Is there not a shred of \ncommon sense left when we hear these kinds of decisions coming out of a \ncourt, in this case the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals?\n  I am very pleased my colleague from South Dakota, the majority \nleader, will bring a resolution to the floor. I will ask to be a \ncosponsor and to speak on that resolution. We ought to not waste a \nminute in saying to that court, in responding to that opinion that says \nthat is not what the Constitution says, it is not the way the \nConstitution is written, and there is not any creative way for a group \nof people to make that judgment.\n  I am very pleased the Senate will this afternoon apparently have a \nrecord vote to say: No; absolutely not; there is not any way on Earth \nwe can agree with what this court has determined.\n  Madam President, I know the Senator from West Virginia is waiting to \nspeak, and I will be anxious to hear his words of wisdom because he, in \nmy judgment, knows more about the Constitution than anybody else in the \nSenate. He carries it with him every day, all day. He has studied it \nmore than any other Member of the Senate. I know that document is \nrevered by all of us, but perhaps revered by none of us quite as much \nas it is by the Senator from West Virginia. Let's hope we find ways in \nthis country not to have to turn on the news and discover the next news \ncycle, the next opinion of a majority of a court that defies all common \nsense and something that requires us this afternoon to respond to, to \nrestore some faith with the American people that there are some people \nat least who are able to read that Constitution and read what it says \nand understand what it says.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, it would be my suggestion that this judge \ngo back and read the Declaration of Independence. I wonder if he can \nhold that Declaration to be unconstitutional--the Declaration of \nIndependence.\n  This is what it says:\n\n       When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary \n     for one people to dissolve the political bands which have \n     connected them with another, and to assume among the powers \n     of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the \n     Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent \n     respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should \n     declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n\n  Let that judge read further, ``We hold these truths to be self-\nevident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed,''--by \nwhom?--``by their Creator.''\n  It is in the Declaration of Independence, ``by their Creator with \ncertain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the \npursuit of Happiness.''\n  Let that same judge go a little further and read in this same \nDeclaration of Independence, in case he has not read it lately, and let \nhim declare it unconstitutional, the reference to ``the Supreme Judge \nof the World.'' Who is this ``Supreme Judge of the World?'' Certainly, \nnot some atheist. Nor is it a judge who sits on the Ninth Circuit and \nwhose name is Goodwin.\n  The final words of the Declaration state, ``with a firm Reliance on \nthe Protection of divine Providence.'' Let atheists find something to \nbring before that judge in this Declaration of Independence. Let that \natheist lawyer do that. Let that judge sit in his black robe and \naddress the court and the Constitution and the people of the United \nStates as to whether or not the words I have quoted from the \nDeclaration of Independence are unconstitutional.\n  Here are these words printed in the Declaration of Independence, \n``with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence.'' That \njudge should not be a judge in my opinion--and I can say this: I hope \nhis name never comes before this Senate, while I am a Member of it, for \nany promotion. He will be remembered. Let him declare this Declaration \nof Independence unconstitutional. Do the words I have quoted offend the \nConstitution?\n  I am the only Member of Congress today, bar none, in either body, who \nwas a Member of the House on June 7, 1954, when the words ``under God'' \nwere included in the Pledge of Allegiance. Coincidentally, may I say, \non that same day, June 7, one year later, 1955, the House of \nRepresentatives voted to inscribe the words ``in God we trust'' on the \ncurrency and coin of the United States. Some of the coins already bore \nthe inscription, but on that day, June 7, 1955, the House of \nRepresentatives, of which I was a member, voted to make that the \nnational motto and to have it inscribed on the currency and the coin.\n  Let that judge's name ever come before this Senate while I am a \nMember, and he will be blackballed--if Senators know what \n``blackballed'' means--fast. I say the sooner we can pass a \nresolution--and I want my name to be third because I am the only Member \nof Congress--let him who would challenge that stand--in either body \ntoday who was in Congress on the day we voted to include the words \n``under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  That same judge ought to go back and read the Mayflower Compact.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nresolution is presented, Senator Byrd's name appear third following the \ntwo leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Democratic whip.\n  That is all I have to say for now. I hope the Senate will waste no \ntime in throwing this back in the face of this stupid judge.\n  Think of the history of this country, the men and the women who have \nshed their blood for this country. The men who founded this country, \nwho wrote the Constitution in Philadelphia, George Washington, James \nMadison, Benjamin Franklin--what would they say if they were living \ntoday?\n\n  A country that was founded by men and women who believed in a higher \npower--we do not all have to be Baptists, we do not all have to be \nMethodists, we do not all have to be Christians. But the people by and \nlarge who founded this country, who hewed the forests, who dredged the \nrivers, who built the bridges and who created a country from sea to \nshining sea believed in a higher power.\n  What is this country coming to? What is it coming to? ``Blessed is \nthe Nation whose God is the Lord.'' He can be your Lord. He can be \nmine. What are we coming to when we cannot speak God's name? Let them \nput me in jail. I will read that Bible right here on this desk. I have \ndone it before. I will do it again. I have recited the pledge and so \nhas every other Member of this body time and time again. Come, Judge \nGoodwin of the Ninth Circuit, put us in jail.\n  I say the people of America are not going to stand for this. I, for \none, am not going to stand for this country's being ruled by a bunch of \natheists. If they do not like it, let them leave. They do not have to \nworship my God, but I will worship my God and no atheist and no court \nis going to tell me I\n\n[[Page S6104]]\n\ncannot do so whether at a school commencement or anywhere else. I say \nlet's let the people speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from West Virginia, the distinguished \nsenior Senator, the distinguished Member of this body, I have had the \ngood fortune that two of my sons have been law clerks for the chief \njudge of the Ninth Circuit. In fact, one of my sons was his \nadministrative assistant. He was a judge from Nevada, served in the \nvery prestigious Ninth Circuit.\n  I have had calls from my sons today. They are embarrassed about what \nhas taken place in that Ninth Circuit. They said: Dad, don't worry \nabout it because the court will meet en banc and reverse it.\n  These are the two most liberal members of the court. They come up at \nrandom. It was by chance Goodwin and Reinhardt were thrown together, \nbut they have done the mischief they have done to embarrass every \nlawyer in America, every judge in America except those two, and the \npeople of this country are repulsed.\n  I have great faith that court will reverse itself when they sit en \nbanc. If they do not, I applaud the majority leader, whom I now \nunderstand has the support of the Republican leader, to move forward \nexpeditiously tonight to let the world know the Senate is not going to \nstand idly by while these people--I had a little dialogue with Senator \nLieberman on the floor today, with his experience as attorney general, \nbeing the legal scholar that I believe he is, who said without question \nthat what they did was illogical.\n\n  I agree with what the Senator from West Virginia said--it is stupid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is, indeed, a shocking culmination \nof a decade-long trend of liberal activist courts that have been \nmisreading the first amendment of the Constitution. The first amendment \nprotects the free exercise of religion. That is what it says. It says \nCongress shall make no law respecting the establishment of a religion \nnor prohibiting the free exercise thereof. There is no word in the \nConstitution, the document ratified by the people of the United States, \nabout a wall of separation. There is nothing in the Constitution that \nsays we cannot have any reference in public life in America to a higher \nbeing.\n  As the Senator from West Virginia has eloquently stated, our founding \ndocuments make multiple references to God.\n  Indeed, the Declaration says we are created with certain inalienable \nrights. We did not create ourselves but were, indeed, created by a \nhigher being. That is a strong part of our belief as a nation.\n  Our courts have been on the wrong track for a long time. They have \nconsistently gotten this thing wrong. Not all the courts, but the \nFederal courts to a large degree. Particularly the Ninth Circuit is out \nof the main stream, in my view. This trend has been there for some \ntime. It is not part of the American tradition. In America, we need to \nrespect people's religion. We need to give people a full chance to \nexpress their faith wherever they may choose. We should not put down or \nlaugh or demean somebody else's religious belief. That is a cornerstone \nof our country.\n  Madison was passionate that no State had the right to mandate \nsomebody's religious faith. However, the entire trend of this country \nand the whole understanding of what we are about is that we have the \nfree exercise of religion. We are entitled to exercise that faith in a \npublic way. It has been part of our public life since the founding of \nour country. Somehow, the courts have gotten the idea that they should \nreverse this.\n  Some say this is just one court and they are out of step. It is \ndeeper than that. We have been affirming judges who have shared these \nphilosophies without looking into it very closely. We have allowed \njudges to carry on a more activist view of what they think life is \nabout.\n  We had a recent decision of the Supreme Court, that is activist, when \nthe author of the opinion declared that evolving standards call us to \nnot execute a retarded person. I am not for executing retarded persons. \nI am willing to support a law to that effect. What is that saying? This \njustice and a majority on the Supreme Court were saying that they could \nchange the law if they thought somebody was ``evolving'' and changing \ntheir views about life in general.\n  Who reflects the American people in the changed views? It is the \nlegislative branch. Federal judges are given lifetime appointments. \nThey hold office for the rest of their life. They are required to \ndiscipline themselves. If they love the law, if they love the \nConstitution, as all in this country must do, they must discipline \nthemselves and simply enforce that law. This trend has been unhealthy. \nWe have allowed it to continue unchallenged. It is afoot in our law \nschools. They teach you cannot have any reference to faith.\n  Right on the wall we have ``In God We Trust.'' The anteroom has a \npicture of a woman on the wall holding a Bible in her hand. There are \nthree words engraved on the sides of the wall: One is ``government,'' \none is ``philosophy,'' and one is ``religion.'' That is the nature of \nthe founding of our country. We never doubted that religion played a \npart in American life. What we did not want was the Government to \ndictate to someone how they ought to worship. We have never done that. \nI defend anyone who thinks they are being forced to do anything with \nwhich they disagree.\n\n  Life is complex. We work together and live together in harmony. If \nsomeone does not like the Declaration of Independence, if someone does \nnot like the Constitution, they do not have to read them. If someone \ndoes not believe in the Pledge, they do not have to recite it. That is \nclear constitutional law.\n  This is a big mistake by the court. I hope this Senate will take \naction to express the views of the people of the United States. I hope \nwe will not hear talk that this is something that will be dismissed. It \nis a serious, pernicious, antireligious trend. There is a tendency and \na trend in America by the courts to eliminate from public life any \nreference to a higher being and anybody who reads the newspapers or \nreads court opinions knows that is true.\n  The Ninth Circuit is the worst. One year 27 out of 28 cases were \nreversed. They have consistently been reversed more than any other \ncircuit in America.\n  The New York Times, in writing about the Ninth Circuit, says a \nmajority of the Supreme Court of the United States considers the Ninth \nCircuit to be a rogue circuit.\n  I have been the most outspoken Member of this Senate in the years I \nhave been here, over 5 years, in expressing my concern about some of \nthese trends in the court, particularly in the Ninth Circuit. I have \ntalked about the issues in the Ninth Circuit. We have to do better. I \nencouraged President Clinton and I encourage President Bush to send \nnominees to that circuit who will bring it back into the mainstream of \nAmerican law.\n  I hope on full rehearing en banc, the court will reverse the opinion. \nI am not absolutely sure it will, because there are others on that \ncourt I have no doubt will join in this opinion. Then it will go to the \nSupreme Court of the United States. They are going to have to wrestle \nwith this a little bit more. They have not yet fully thought through \ntheir position on the free expression of religious faith in American \nlife.\n  It is a difficult thing. We have to cherish our freedom of religion, \nour freedom to practice religion, as well as our freedom not to have \nsomeone coerce any American into any religious belief. That is so much \na part of our life that so much distinguished America from nations that \nwant to have a government founded strictly on their view of faith. That \nis unhealthy.\n  I hope we can adopt an expression in this Senate of our disapproval \nof this decision, but, at the same time, we do not need to treat it \nlightly. We need to go back to the grassroots, the initial heritage of \nfaith in America. We need to look at some of these decisions of the \ncourt that have gone beyond prohibiting the establishment of a \nreligion, to prohibiting any expression of religious faith at all.\n  I remember Judge Griffin Bell, a great judge on the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, President Carter's Attorney\n\n[[Page S6105]]\n\nGeneral. He was speaking to an Alabama Bar Association meeting when \nPresident Reagan was in office, not long after he left as Attorney \nGeneral. The bar members asked: Judge Bell, what do you think about \nthis litmus test that President Reagan is supposed to be applying to \njudges? I will never forget, he walked up to the microphone and said: \nWe need a litmus test for judges. We don't need anybody on the Supreme \nCourt who does not believe in prayer at football games.\n  This is where we are. We have the courts of the United States \nprepared to send in the 82nd Airborne to some high school that allows a \nvoluntary prayer to be said before the ball game starts--an expression \nthat there is something more important than who is the biggest, \nmeanest, and toughest out on the football field.\n  I think we have a serious problem with the understanding of the first \namendment. I am glad this body is taking it seriously. Hopefully, we \ncan do something about it, but it is going to take a longtime effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6105-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6105-S6112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT FOR THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I indicated a few minutes ago that it was \nour intention, after consultation with the Republican leader and our \ncolleagues, to offer a resolution immediately on the matter of the \nNinth Circuit Court decision. That is our intention at this point.\n  I will propound a unanimous consent request that allows us to go to a \nvote. I know a number of other Senators wish to be heard, but I think \nit would be appropriate for scheduling purposes for us to have the vote \nand then accommodate other Senators who wish to be heard. We will \ncertainly allow the floor to be available for purposes of additional \ncomment by our colleagues.\n  Let me ask Senators to vote from their desks on this particular vote. \nI think it would be appropriate, given the strength of feeling we have \non the issue, that we draw a distinction between this and other votes. \nI ask Senators to vote from their desks.\n  I also note as we have already announced through our cloakrooms, \nevery Senator will be listed as a cosponsor unless they ask to be \nremoved from that list. So Senators will automatically be listed as a \ncosponsor. We have had so many requests on both sides of the aisle, it \nwas our view it would be appropriate for us to do that.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the resolution be submitted and \nstated for the record, prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of the resolution at the desk earlier introduced by \nmyself and Senator Lott regarding the Pledge of Allegiance, that no \namendments or motions be in order, the Senate immediately vote on \npassage of the resolution, that any statements thereon appear in the \nRecord as though read.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object only for parliamentary \ninquiry, is it the majority leader's intent to put the vote \nimmediately?\n  If I could, under my reservation, then just make a couple of points.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I certainly support this effort. I have no \nintent at all of objecting. I am very pleased the Senate is going to \nact so quickly on this matter.\n  Senator Daschle and I have been talking about it the last few \nminutes. We have developed what I think is very good language to \naddress this outrageous decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Just as the Supreme Court has recognized that elected officials may \ninvoke God's blessing on their work as we do here every day, and as in \nthe House Chamber they have over the Speaker's chair, ``In God We \nTrust,'' for our children to be allowed to invoke God's blessing on our \ncountry in the Pledge of Allegiance is certainly something we want to \ndo.\n  If there is ever a time when we need this additional blessing, \nperhaps it is now more than ever in our lifetimes. I have seen that and \nfelt that as I have gone around, not only my own State but this \ncountry. So I think it is essential the Senate speak immediately in \nclarification. I hope the Ninth Circuit will have an en banc panel that \nwill reverse this decision; failing that, that the Supreme Court will \nact on it expeditiously.\n  In our resolved clause, we state that we disapprove of the decision \nby the Ninth Circuit and that we authorize and instruct the Senate \nlegal counsel to seek to intervene in the case to defend the \nconstitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\n  Beyond that, to further make it clear, the Senate should consider a \nrecodification of the language that was passed in 1954. There was no \nuncertainty or ambiguity about what was done in 1954. The Congress, in \nfact the American people, spoke through their Congress. We should make \nit clear once again.\n  I commend you, Senator Daschle, for moving this matter forward \naggressively. For the Senate to have this vote is absolutely the right \nthing to do. I know the American people agree with that decision.\n  I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I compliment the Senator on his remarks. I appreciate \nvery much his cooperation in the last couple of hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the resolution.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 292) expressing support for the \n     Pledge of Allegiance.\n\n       Whereas, this country was founded on religious freedom by \n     founders, many of whom were deeply religious;\n       Whereas, the First Amendment to the Constitution embodies \n     principles intended to guarantee freedom of religion both \n     through the free exercise thereof and by prohibiting the \n     government establishing a religion;\n       Whereas, the Pledge of Allegiance was written by Francis \n     Bellamy, a Baptist Minister, and first published in the \n     September 8, 1892, issue of the Youth's Companion;\n       Whereas, Congress in 1954 added the words ``under God'' to \n     the Pledge of Allegiance;\n       Whereas, the Pledge of Allegiance has for almost 50 years \n     included references to the U.S. flag, the country, to our \n     country having been established as a union ``under God'' and \n     to this country being dedicated to securing ``liberty and \n     justice for all;''\n       Whereas, the Congress in 1954 believed it as acting \n     constitutionally when it revised the Pledge of Allegiance;\n       Whereas, this Senate of the 107th Congress believes that \n     the Pledge of Allegiance is not an unconstitutional \n     expression of patriotism;\n       Whereas, patriotic songs, engravings on U.S. legal tender, \n     engravings on federal buildings also contain general \n     references to ``God'';\n       Whereas, in accordance with decisions of the U.S. Supreme \n     Court, public school students cannot be forced to recite the \n     Pledge of Allegiance without violating their First Amendment \n     rights;\n       Whereas, the Congress expects that the U.S. of Appeals for \n     the Ninth Circuit will rehear the case of Newdow v. U.S. \n     Congress, en branc;\n       Resolved, That the Senate strongly disapproves of the ninth \n     circuit decision in Newdow v. U.S. Congress; and that the \n     Senate authorizes and instructs the Senate Legal Counsel to \n     seek to intervene in the case to defend the constitutionality \n     of the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Again, I ask Senators to vote from their desks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 99, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 163 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--99\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n\n[[Page S6106]]\n\n\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Helms\n       \n  The resolution (S. Res. 292) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this was the last vote of the evening.\n  Under the normal rules of the Senate, of course, it is the custom of \nthe Senate each morning to pledge allegiance to the flag. We will be \ncoming into session tomorrow morning at 9:30. It would be my \nsuggestion--not my original suggestion, I hasten to add--that we as \nSenators be here at 9:30 to pledge allegiance to the flag. I encourage \nSenators to be present at their desks at 9:30 to accommodate that \nsuggestion.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think the distinguished majority leader \nhas made an excellent suggestion. I also wish to express my \nappreciation to him for bringing up S. Res. 292 and doing so in a \nbipartisan fashion. I also express my appreciation to the staff of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee who worked so very hard to move on this \nresolution as quickly as they did. I appreciate the distinguished \nmajority leader requesting that we have such a resolution. He is \nabsolutely right. I have to assume that the Ninth Circuit will now hear \nthis case en banc, and I have to hope the decision will not be upheld.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I simply want to respond to the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont and, as always, thank him for his \nkind words and support for the resolution and, as always, his \nwillingness to be helpful. I am also pleased with the unanimity with \nwhich the Senate has expressed itself this afternoon. It was the right \nthing to do. It was important that we did it in a timely manner.\n  Again, let me reiterate my thanks to the distinguished Republican \nleader for the tremendous cooperation he has shown in allowing the \nSenate to move as quickly as it has. It sends as clear and unequivocal \na message as I believe we are capable of sending.\n  We strongly disagree with the decision made today. We will authorize \nour Senate legal counsel to intercede on behalf of our position before \nthe court. That is the right thing to do. I am very pleased we were \nable to say it as strongly as we have on a bipartisan basis that we \nhave today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, over the weekend I had the experience and \nthe pleasure of narrating Aaron Copeland's ``Lincoln Portrait'' in a \npresentation by an orchestra back home in Utah. I had not done that \nbefore.\n  Aaron Copeland took some of Abraham Lincoln's most stirring words and \naccompanied them with music, and it is a great opportunity for those of \nus who don't have as much musical ability as some others to participate \nin that kind of a presentation.\n  I was interested that one of the things in the ``Lincoln Portrait'' \nby Aaron Copeland is a quotation from the Gettysburg Address, when \nAbraham Lincoln prophesied that this Nation, under God, shall have a \nnew birth of freedom, and that government of the people and by the \npeople and for the people shall not perish from the Earth. If the Ninth \nCircuit Court position is upheld and made universal, that means that \nAaron Copeland's tribute to the memory of Abraham Lincoln will have to \nbe censored and that we will no longer allow our schoolchildren to \nlearn the Gettysburg Address.\n  Indeed, if this position is upheld, we will no longer be able to \nteach our children the Declaration of Independence because Thomas \nJefferson referred to our rights as having been endowed by the Creator.\n  The Ninth Circuit makes it very clear that they do not believe any \npublic official should speak of the Creator in a way that implies that \nhe exists or, if you prefer, that she exists.\n  The word ``God'' is sufficiently universal and nonspecific as to \nallow those who use it to ascribe any quality, any gender, any \ndoctrine, any position that those people might wish to ascribe to it. \nIt is inconceivable to me that the Ninth Circuit should suggest that \nthe generic term ``God'' is somehow endorsement of a specific religion.\n  It is interesting that the vote we have just taken takes place under \nwords carved in marble, literally carved in marble and gilded in gold \nhere in the Senate Chamber, that say: ``In God we trust.'' I would hope \nthat the judges on the Ninth Circuit would not attempt to send U.S. \nmarshals into the Chamber of the Senate with jackhammers in an effort \nto remove that marble from above our entryway. It has been there since \nthe Chamber was built. I hope it remains there as long as the Chamber \nremains, the judges on the Ninth Circuit to the contrary \nnotwithstanding.\n  As I walked over to come to this vote, I came under the flags of the \n50 States. They are displayed in the walkway in the tunnel that comes \nbetween the Senate Office Building and the Capitol. I noticed that on \ntwo of those flags, Florida and Georgia, there are the same words that \nwe have here in the Chamber, ``in God we trust.''\n\n  I wonder if the justices of the Ninth Circuit wish to order the State \nlegislatures of those two States to change the State flags in their \neffort to see to it that we remove any reference whatsoever to God from \nour public discourse. Oh, I understand that they do not wish to remove \nall references to God. It will still clearly be fine for the people in \nHollywood and on television to curse people in the name of God. It will \nonly be illegal for someone to bless people in the name of God. The use \nof the name of deity in oaths of blasphemy are protected under the \nfirst amendment. It is just the use of the name of God in expressions \nof belief that these judges wish to strike down--an inconsistency which \nI hope will enter into their hearts and make them realize how foolish \ntheir decision is.\n  Finally, my mind goes back to the experience in the Middle Ages when \nGalileo--who said that the Earth revolves around the Sun rather than \nthe Sun revolving around the Earth--was forced by the legal structure \nof his time to recant. And in order to save his life he did so. He \nstood there and proclaimed aloud that the Sun revolved around the \nEarth, and then as he stepped away from the place where he had made \nthat public recantation, he muttered--speaking of the Earth going \naround the Sun--``nonetheless, it still revolves.''\n  Regardless of what the courts may say, the American people still \ntrust in God. As long as they do, it will remain our national motto \nbecause it is a correct statement of how we feel, and it belongs in the \nPledge of Allegiance to our flag.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about \nthe resolution. Before I do, I know Senator Landrieu would like to \nspeak and perhaps others. Perhaps I could offer a unanimous consent \nagreement that directly following me--does Senator Burns wish to speak?\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That Senator Burns, and then Senator Landrieu, and \nSenator Allen have 5 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, was that a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would like some indication of approximately how long \neach\n\n[[Page S6107]]\n\nSenator plans on speaking. I have no desire to limit them, but I would \nlike to get an idea.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Not very long for me.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Five minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If it is 5 minutes each, that is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise as a Senator from California, a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, and one who has been trying to hold \ntogether the Ninth Circuit. I find this decision, at best, very \nembarrassing--embarrassing because perhaps the court doesn't know, but \nour coins have contained ``in God we trust'' for a century and a half. \nThis was put into action by the Congress in 1954, almost 50 years ago. \nSo we have had reference to God on our coins for a century and a half \nand reference to God in the Pledge of Allegiance for over a half \ncentury. In 30 years of public life, I have never had an objection from \nanyone about either.\n  When I heard about this decision, knowing how Senator Burns has felt \nabout the Ninth Circuit, I quickly looked to see who the judges were. I \nfound that one is a Nixon judge, one is a Carter judge, and the \ndissenting judge was a George Bush, Sr., judge.\n  I can only say that I would be hopeful that the full Ninth Circuit \nwould take up this matter and straighten it out, and, if they do not, \nthat it goes rapidly on appeal to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, and that the Supreme Court of the United States straightens it \nout.\n  From the beginning of our country, God has always played a role. All \nyou have to do is look at some of the remaining churches in the \nThirteen Colonies to know that God has always played a role in the \nfoundation and the continuation of our Nation. For the Ninth Circuit to \nsuddenly say that it is unconstitutional for the Pledge of Allegiance \nto make reference that we are one nation under God is incomprehensible \nto many of us. So our remedy must rest with the remainder of the Ninth \nCircuit.\n  For me, it is going to be interesting to see whether they will \nmeasure up to this challenge or whether they will let a three-judge \npanel speak for them. I strongly urge that, if they feel as strongly as \nthe Members of this Senate do, they sit en banc and take a look at this \nmatter. If not, it certainly should go to the Supreme Court.\n  I can only say this Senator is embarrassed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, words cannot express the outrage I felt \nwhen I heard this decision. There will be those of us who will express \nit in different words than probably lawyers will. A couple of weeks ago \nwe were visited and addressed by the Prime Minister of Australia, John \nHoward, when he related his feelings because he was in this country on \nSeptember 11 of last year. He said that, since then, this country has \nreacted in a way that reestablishes or reconfirms the very values on \nwhich this country is based.\n  Then we have a circuit court that comes down with a decision such as \nthis. It is absolutely unbelievable. Can our children no longer sing \n``God Bless America,'' or even ``America the Beautiful,'' or all the \nstanzas to our National Anthem?\n  Do you want to take a look at the dollar bill? On the back of it is \nthe symbol of this country, the eagle, and, of course, the eternal eye. \nThis is a value-based society, and to say those who are sheltered from \nbeing removed from office, unless the crime is really something, but \njust for an opinion such as this, I find that unbelievable.\n  We are a nation founded upon the acknowledgement of a Creator. It has \nbeen that way since day one, or even when the flame of freedom was \nignited in the men and women way back in the 1700s. Men and women have \ndied, given their lives, on the field of battle to protect it, just as \nthey have another symbol of this country called our flag.\n  It doesn't make a lot of sense. Of course, there are a lot of things \nthat do not make sense in this world. I always refer to this place as \n17 square miles of logic-free environment. Nonetheless, whenever you \njump across the street, we find another logic that I fail to \nunderstand. So I will stand here and tell America that those values--\nthis being one of them--that those men and women did not die in vain. \nAnd it did not take very long for this body, that represents \nconstituencies across the width and breath of our country, to react to \nit. That has to tell you something about who we are and what we are and \nhow we got here.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I wish to add my \nvoice to all of those who have risen in the last several hours to \nexpress my feelings and the feelings of people from Louisiana about \nthis unfortunate ruling.\n  It is clear to most of us at least that we believe God is infallible, \nbut clearly these judges are not. This case and this decision are very \ndisappointing to many of us, and I am sure around the Nation it has \ncaused a great deal of anxiety, anguish, disappointment, and anger.\n  We remember all too well the Dred Scott decision that relegated \nAfrican Americans to a status as property, and the Plessy v. Ferguson \ndecision that disgracefully upheld the Jim Crow laws of this Nation. In \nthese cases the American judiciary unfortunately demonstrated its \nability to be just plain wrong, and today is another one of those \noccasions.\n  A wonderful aspect, however, about our democracy is that when we make \nmistakes, those mistakes can be corrected, and there are a variety of \nways that can happen today.\n  I thank Senator Daschle, our leader, and Senator Lott for so quickly \nassembling a resolution in which we all have joined as coauthors \nstating our position in the Senate that reflects, I believe, the \noverwhelming views of the American people. The force of that resolution \nwill have a very positive impact.\n  I also understand the entire Circuit Court will hear this case en \nbanc, and I am almost certain, or at least very hopeful, that this \ndecision will be reversed and this wrong righted.\n  There have been many beautiful things read into the Record that \nremind us of our heritage, that remind us of why this country is so \ngreat, is so wonderful, is so unique, and so special; from the eloquent \nremarks of the Senator from West Virginia to the Senators who have \nrecently spoken.\n  I thought it might be appropriate at this time to read into the \nRecord for this occasion a wonderful quote from Abraham Lincoln--one of \nour greatest Presidents, if not our greatest on what he had to say \nabout our relationship to God and our Creator as a nation and as a \ncollective people. It was on the occasion of the first Presidential \nresolution to set aside at least 1 day for a national day of prayer and \nfasting. This was established many years ago in 1863.\n  In this statement, Abraham Lincoln calls for our Nation to come \ntogether in prayer and to acknowledge God and to acknowledge a Supreme \nBeing and our Creator. He said:\n\n       We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of \n     Heaven. We have been preserved, these many years, in peace \n     and prosperity. We have grown in numbers, wealth and power, \n     as no other nation has ever grown. But we have forgotten God. \n     We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in \n     peace, and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us; and \n     we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, \n     that all these blessings were produced by some superior \n     wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken \n     success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the \n     necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to \n     pray to the God that made us.\n  It behooves us then, to humble ourselves before the offended Power, \nto confess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and forgiveness.\n\n  This is just one of the many writings--hundreds, thousands--by \nPresidents, Senators, Congressmen, Governors, council members, mayors, \nelected officials, leaders of this great country that we call America \nacknowledging that we as a nation stand under God, acknowledging His \npresence, although we worship Him in different ways, we may call Him by \ndifferent names, and we strongly support the rights of those in our \nsociety to not acknowledge His presence. But we collectively as a \nnation will in no way back down in acknowledging His presence and His \ndivine creation.\n\n  Madam President, I wanted to submit my thoughts on this issue for the\n\n[[Page S6108]]\n\nRecord and also say that I am introducing a proposed constitutional \namendment to address this issue in the event that the court decisions \ndo not unfold the way I suspect they will. I send to the desk a joint \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The measure will be received \nand appropriately referred.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nthe Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, and I commend her for her \nresolution. With her consent, I would like to add my name to her \nresolution in the event the Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court \ncontinue this errant miscarriage of justice.\n  Madam President, we often talk about ``miscarriages of justice,'' but \ntoday I talk about an instance in which proper administration of \njustice was dragged into a dark alley and mugged.\n  Many of us are outraged to learn today that a divided three-judge \npanel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals believed it knew better \nthan the properly exercised wisdom of the people and their duly elected \nrepresentatives in striking down the Pledge of Allegiance and stating \nthat the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional. These judges ignored \nthe very basis of our democracy and representative Government. They \nhave ignored, right before Independence Day, the spirit of our country \nthat Mr. Jefferson, in the Declaration of Independence, proclaimed to \nthe British monarchy, which had an established religion, that our \nrights are God-given rights.\n  He stated in the Declaration of Independence that we are endowed by \nour Creator ``with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are \nLife, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.'' All of this came from the \nVirginia Declaration of Rights which expressed the same sentiments.\n  Let's understand, if these judges do not understand, with their \njudicial activist decisions such as this, the judges are to interpret \nthe laws, they are not to write the laws. The laws on the Pledge of \nAllegiance and the laws for the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance \nin our schools are passed by State legislatures all across our country. \nThey are reflecting the will, the desire, and the value of the people \nin their States and in their communities.\n  Let's also understand that these activist judges, like the two \ninvolved in this majority decision of the Ninth Circuit, often cite the \nfirst 10 words of the Establishment Clause, which says:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion . . .\n\n  But they too often forget the six words that follow:\n\n     or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\n\n  To understand the history of religious freedom in this country, one \nmust understand that this country, in the very beginning, starting with \nthe Virginia Company, which was a commercial venture--it still was a \ncrown colony, as were all the colonies, and as such it was associated \nwith the Church of England or the Anglican Church. People were \ncompelled to pay taxes to that church whether they wanted to go to that \nchurch or not.\n  The concept of the statute of religious freedom first started in \nVirginia with Thomas Jefferson. He drafted the Virginia Statute for \nReligious Freedom. It is on his gravestone as one of his three most \nproud accomplishments, along with the founding of the University of \nVirginia, and drafting the Declaration of Independence.\n  The statute of religious freedom was a novel idea. It was a radical \nidea because what you had in the 1700s and before then were monarchies, \ntheocracies in effect, where the monarchs were ruling because of \nbloodlines not because of merit or popular will. They also had a single \nchurch and that church was given that exclusive monopoly in that they \nwould then say that those monarchs were ruling by divine guidance and \ndivine right. In all of these monarchies, the idea that people could \nbelieve as they saw fit and not be compelled to join a church or be \ncompelled to support a church was a very radical idea and upsetting to \nthe tyrannical monarchs because that upset their whole justification \nfor being in power in the first place.\n  The Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom actually took 7 years to \npass in the Virginia General Assembly. Good ideas still sometimes take \na long time. Mr. Jefferson was the Minister to France when James \nMadison finally got this Statute through the Virginia General Assembly.\n  The Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom states very clearly, in \narticle I, section 16, of the Virginia Constitution, ``That religion, \nor the duty which we owe our Creator and the manner of discharging it, \ncan be directed by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and \ntherefore, all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of \nreligion, according to the dictates of conscience; . . . '' and so \nforth. It goes on to say that people's rights and individual's rights \nshould not be enhanced nor should they be diminished due to their \nreligious beliefs.\n  Now the purpose of the Establishment Clause, which was then put into \nthe Federal Constitution in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, \nwas not to expunge religion or matters of faith from all aspects of \npublic life. The Pledge of Allegiance should remain in our schools and \nother public functions, but it should be voluntary. The Commonwealth of \nVirginia has such a law but it is voluntary. If a student does not want \nto recite the Pledge of Allegiance, he or she is not compelled to do \nso. One needs to respect that individual conscience.\n  The way it is in the law, whether in this case in the Ninth Circuit \nor elsewhere, is that it allows, in accordance with the founding \ndocuments of our Nation, the ability of the majority to express their \nvalues and their wisdom. If somebody somehow does not want to recite \nit, they are not compelled to do so.\n  So the Establishment Clause, as well as our Bill of Rights, and our \nDeclaration of Independence, are all modeled on the Virginia Statute \nfor Religious Freedom, and the Virginia Declaration of Rights.\n  The Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, as drafted by Mr. \nJefferson and then carried forward by James Madison and adopted in \n1786, counsels against the impious presumption of legislators and \nrulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, who being themselves but \nfallible and uninspired men who have assumed dominion over the faith of \nothers.\n\n  The Virginia Declaration of Rights holds that all men are equally \nentitled to the free exercise of religion according to the dictates of \ntheir conscience. Minimal reference is made to a nondenominational \ncreator or natural rights or God and that is consistent with the values \nand the desires of the people. This is in step, and the laws are, \nfortunately, in this regard, in step with our society and the views of \nthe people, as they have been throughout our history.\n  It is my hope, and it is not without basis, that this decision of the \nNinth Circuit will be handily reversed by the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  I remind the Senate that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has by \nfar the most dismal reversal rate in the Supreme Court of any court of \nappeals in our land. In recent years, the reversal rate has hovered \naround 80 percent compared to about 50 percent for the next highest \ncircuit, which is the Eighth Circuit. In one recent session of the \nSupreme Court alone, an astonishing 28 out of 29 decisions of the Ninth \nCircuit Court were overturned. That is 97 percent. What ruling from the \nNinth Circuit will come next? Are they going to white out passages of \nthe Declaration of Independence? Will it be improper to recite on \npublic grounds the Declaration of Independence because it refers to our \nCreator giving us unalienable rights? Will the Ninth Circuit order \ncurrency and our coinage to knock out the insidious message of ``In God \nWe Trust''? Will they say that all coins have to be destroyed and \nmelted down? Will they imprison school choirs and have the school \ndirectors imprisoned because the children are singing ``God Bless \nAmerica''? Who knows what is next out of the Ninth Circuit.\n  At some point, though, a proper respect for the rights of the people, \ntheir desires, and also common sense and reason must be guiding our \ncourts, especially this particular circuit court, and today's activist, \noffensive decision.\n  Today's action by the Ninth Circuit is hit-and-run jurisprudence. It \nis smug judicial activism at its rankest. It is\n\n[[Page S6109]]\n\noutrageously out-of-touch with the desires and values of the American \npeople. It is striking down the basic concept that laws made by \nCongress or by State legislatures, unless they are clearly \nunconstitutional, ought to be respected.\n  I am proud today, only days before the 226th anniversary of our \nNation's birth, of our Declaration of Independence, where we ceded from \nthe monarchy of Britain, that we are going to stand for what is right. \nWe are going to stand by our flag and the principles of freedom and \njustice and with our Pledge of Allegiance.\n  I thank my colleagues for their united, bipartisan stand for what is \nright about America and what is right for our schools and our \nyoungsters, and that is stating the Pledge of Allegiance to our flag.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise today to discuss this recent \nFederal court of appeals ruling on the Pledge of Allegiance and to \nexpress with my colleagues the universal outrage of the court's ruling \ntoday, and the delight with how we have joined together so quickly, and \nI express this on behalf of all Americans that we believe ``In God We \nTrust.'' We believe that this is a nation under God. We believe in what \nis placed on the mantel above the Senate Chamber, ``In God We Trust.'' \nOur very Constitution itself signs off using the word, ``Lord.''\n  Can we declare the Constitution unconstitutional? I guess it would be \na legitimate question to ask the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Is the \nConstitution unconstitutional? Our Declaration of Independence refers \nto God multiple times including saying that our certain unalienable \nrights are endowed by our Creator.\n  George Washington's Farewell Address, which is read in the House and \nSenate each year, refers to God and faith and religion. Abraham \nLincoln's Gettysburg Address uses the word ``God,'' proclaiming that \nthis Nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom. Booker T. \nWashington repeatedly referred to God when speaking. Even Elizabeth \nCady Stanton and Sojourner Truth referred to God in their writings and \nspeeches. Will it now be unconstitutional to teach American history to \nour children, to require them to read some of the words of the great \nmen and women of our Nation because they mention God? Will those have \nto be stricken from all of the speeches of Lincoln and Washington and \nMartin Luther King? Will it have to be taken out of the Declaration of \nIndependence? According to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, this \ncould indeed be so. After all, if saying the Pledge of Allegiance \nviolates the establishment clause of our Constitution, how can these \nothers not do so as well?\n  What about our money--I think we are in a real problem here--which \nhas the motto ``In God We Trust'' on it, or the fact that every day we \nopen Congress with a prayer, maintain full-time Chaplains on each side \nof the Capitol Building, and in the very Chamber in which we stand \ntoday it twice says ``God''. Do we have to get the putty out and fill \nthem in?\n\n  Consider the very founding of our Nation. At that time, the brave men \nand women trusted in God and believed we owed our success to him. In \nfact, the first act of the first Continental Congress was a public \nprayer. As Sam Adams noted then in support of the idea, he was no bigot \nand could hear a prayer from any gentleman of piety and virtue who at \nthe same time was a friend of his country. And so on September 7, 1774, \nthe first official prayer before the Continental Congress took place \nwhen an Episcopal clergyman read aloud Psalm 35 from the Book of Common \nPrayer--a now unconstitutional act that he performed in 1774, the first \nContinental Congress.\n  In 1779, the Congress urged the Nation ``humbly to approach the \nthrone of almighty God,'' to ask ``that he would establish the \nindependence of these United States upon the basis of religion and \nvirtue.''\n  Just 2 years later, Congress passed ``The Congressional Decree of \n1781'':\n\n       Whereas, it hath pleased Almighty God, the father of \n     mercies, remarkably to assist and support the United States \n     of America in their important struggle for liberty, against \n     the long continued efforts of a powerful nation: it is the \n     duty of all ranks to observe and thankfully acknowledge the \n     interpositions of his Providence in their behalf. Through the \n     whole of the context, from its first rise to this time, the \n     influence of Divine Providence may be clearly perceived in \n     many signal instances, of which we mention but a few.\n\n  An unconstitutional act?\n  The founders also inscribed on the seal of our nation the Latin \nphrase, ``Annuit Ceoptis''--translated as ``God favors our \nundertakings.''\n  This belief infused those courageous risk-takers then when they faced \nan unimaginable and seemingly insurmountable undertaking--and it \ninspires many of us today, especially as we face an unimaginable and \nseemingly insurmountable undertaking in challenging terrorists around \nthe world.\n  Indeed, according to the 9th Circuit, it would be illegal to teach \nchildren about President Bush's address to Congress following the \nterrorist attacks.\n  That's not just sad, it is an injustice to our children, our nation \nand our government. It cries out for logic and commonsense--but clearly \nthis Court has neither. Although I am not surprised--it turns out that \nin recent years, more than 80 percent of the rulings by the 9th Circuit \nhave been overturned. Just a few years ago the 9th managed to compile \nan 1-28 record at the Supreme Court--that is, the Supreme Court \nreviewed 29 cases from the 9th Circuit Court and reversed a stunning 28 \nof them.\n  Although I must admit that I can't just criticize the 9th Circuit, \nas, interestingly enough, we can make an accurate and strong argument \nthat the Establishment Clause is clearly misinterpreted by the entire \nlegal system today. The concept of a ``wall of separation'' is actually \nfrom a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1802 that was completely \nunnoticed until a mistaken transcription of the original letter was \ncited by the Supreme Court in 1879 in Reynolds v. United States. The \nfocus in 1879 was not on ``separation'' but on the term ``legislative \npowers''--yet the transcriber had written that wrong; The original, in \nJefferson's neat handwriting, said ``legitimate power.'' This metaphor \nagain remained unused and virtually unknown until Justice Black drew it \nfrom obscurity in 1947--again using the erroneous translation.\n  So it is clear that our nation, perhaps even from the beginning, \nneeds commonsense, reasonable judges--judges who will defend our \nprinciples, ideals and way of life. Judges who understand the risks and \nsacrifices made both by those who founded our nation and fought for its \nprinciples--and by those who continue to do so today.\n  It is why today I thank Frank Bellamy, who wrote this beautiful poem \nthat our Pledge was based upon in 1892 when he lived in my home state \nof Kansas in the small town of Cherryvale. And why I thank those \nsincere leaders who in 1954 sought to reaffirm, as the Declaration of \nIndependence first declared, our ``firm Reliance on the Protection of \ndivine Providence.''\n  On a side note, Madam President, we have people every day who seek to \nemulate the model after the United States, thankfully. It is a great \ncountry. It is a country that stood for so much freedom for people \naround the world, people such as Mi-Hwa Rhyu and Sol-Hee Rhyu, a mother \nand daughter captured by police in Asia today, North Korean refugees \nseeking to flee North Korea and get to someplace like the United \nStates, to be free and be able to live in a nation that honors God. \nThey are now being detained and probably sent back to a country that \ndoes not honor God--North Korea--that does not believe, to suffer an \nill fate there.\n  Yet people yearn to be free, to come into a place that says, ``In God \nwe trust.'' And they are willing to risk their lives to come into a \nplace such as this. Countries seek to emulate our great land.\n  Why, why, why will we seek to remove the foundation of all those \nbasic beliefs that we have? I tell our schoolchildren not only is it \nwrong but unconstitutional to say ``under God'' or ``in God.''\n  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and \nto the\n\n[[Page S6110]]\n\nRepublic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with \nliberty and justice for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we have been discussing with some \npassion this afternoon, the ruling of the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals on the Pledge of Allegiance, their ruling that the Pledge of \nAllegiance violates the Constitution of the United States. I think it \nis important for us to note that this is not a total surprise, although \nit has been a surprise. It should not have been a total surprise, let \nme say, because we have had a number of decisions by courts in America \nthat have lost sight of the balance contained in the first amendment \nand have rendered opinions that go beyond the intent of the Framers of \nthe Constitution.\n  When we say go beyond the intent of the Framers, that is really not \nquite strong enough. The Constitution starts off saying:\n\n       We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the \n     general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this \n     Constitution for the United States of America.\n\n  We, the people, ordain and establish this Constitution--the one that \nwe have, not one somebody would like it to be, not one that they wish \nit would be, but the one that we ordained, passed, the one that was \nratified by the people of the United States.\n  Over the years, we have amended that Constitution, as we have chosen \nto do so, from time to time. That is the way it should be amended. What \nthe Constitution does not give is the power to judges to amend the \nConstitution. Some judges say: We will just redefine the Constitution. \nWe are just matching it up with modern, enlightened standards. They may \nhave meant that back then, but we want to reinterpret it today in the \nlight of the standards and values that we have.\n\n  And whose standards and values are they? It is the standards and \nvalues of the judge.\n  I was very troubled about this recent ruling, the way it occurred, \ninvolving the death penalty law with regard to retarded individuals. \nThe Court seemed to say that they had divined, somehow, that the \nAmerican people had evolved in their thinking and, therefore, the laws \ntheir legislatures had passed were not valid anymore; that they could \nnot execute people who were retarded.\n  However you feel about that, that is a dangerous philosophy, but it \nis a philosophy afoot in America today. It is a philosophy, I think, \nthat is dangerous to liberty. If you care about the Constitution, \nreally respect the Constitution, as Professor Van Alstyne, of Duke \nUniversity, one time said: If you respect the document, you will \nenforce it, the good and bad parts. You will enforce the parts you do \nnot agree with, if you love, respect, and revere the Constitution.\n  The way to erode the power of the Constitution to protect our \nliberties is to start playing around with the meaning of words, just \nredefining those words, and they come to mean whatever a judge says \nthey do. That is a particularly pernicious thing because, you see, \njudges are not accountable. Federal judges are not accountable to the \npublic. They are given a lifetime appointment.\n  The one thing we have is a moment in time to review their record, to \nmake sure they are committed to follow the Constitution. We vote on \nthem in the Senate, they are confirmed or not, and they go on to serve, \nand then they are there forever.\n  I think from a point of view of a democracy, our judges must show \nself-restraint. That is what President Bush has talked about in his \njudicial nominees--finding judges who follow the law, for the layman. \nNot make up law, not expand law, not make it say what they think the \nAmerican people want it to say today--even though they may be correct. \nThey may not be correct. They do not have the power to do that. It is \nan antidemocratic act when an unelected, lifetime-appointed judge \nsimply takes a political view and imposes that through the \nreinterpretation of words.\n  I remember Hodding Carter, President Carter's aide, was on ``Meet The \nPress.'' He used to be on there regularly. One time he said: We \nliberals have gotten to the point where we want the courts to do for us \nthat which we can no longer win at the ballot box.\n  I think that touched a nerve, really. I think that is too close to \nwhat I think is a problem in the legal system today.\n  I don't expect the courts to carry out my political agenda. I want \nthem just to enforce the law. I will be satisfied with that. As one \nprofessor testified with regard to the Bush nominees: If you appoint a \nnominee who says he is going to be faithful and in fact he is \nconsistently faithful to the meaning of the words in the statutes and \nthe Constitution, then what do we have to fear of that? How does that \nthreaten us?\n  What does threaten us is if a judge goes beyond that. I have been a \nbig critic of the Ninth Circuit. I have spoken in this body more on \nthis subject than any other Senator.\n  I have been shocked by the rate of reversals they have had.\n  Senator Brownback from Kansas had something to say about that.\n  There was a Law Review article published recently that went into even \nmore detail. The University of Oregon Law Review discussed this \nparticularly troublesome trend.\n  They said:\n\n       Another interesting phenomenon is that the Supreme Court \n     unanimously agrees----\n\n  That means the U.S. Supreme Court, across the political spectrum, \nunanimously agrees that the Ninth Circuit was wrong 17 times during the \n1996-1997 term. This is a fairly remarkable record considering that the \nrest of the circuits combined logged in with only 20 unanimous votes, 7 \nof which were affirmative.\n  We have liberals and conservatives on the U.S. Supreme Court, and 13 \nof these cases were unanimous reversals of the Ninth Circuit.\n  This article goes on to say that only 13 unanimous reversals were \nfound throughout the rest of the United States but 17 in the Ninth \nCircuit.\n  So that is the problem for us. We need to be concerned about it.\n  I opposed two judges I sincerely believed were good people but who \nclearly--I had concluded clearly--had activist tendencies. And I was \nparticularly concerned when President Clinton pushed those nominees \nbecause they were going to this circuit that has been out of step.\n  We have to understand why we need to confirm judges who will \nconsistently follow the law, whether they like it or not. That is what \nPresident Bush campaigned on; that is what he promised to do. That is \nwhat he has been submitting--men and women of the highest possible \nintegrity, and high legal ability. These men and women are clear in \ntheir record as being people who just follow the law, whether they like \nit or not. That is what we expect out of a judge. It is important or it \nundermines democracy otherwise.\n  I wanted to mention that.\n  I also want to discuss just briefly the trouble we are having \nthroughout the court system of America. The U.S. Supreme Court is not \nblameless in this issue. Somehow they have got it in their heads that \nvirtually any expression of religious faith in a public activity \nviolates the Constitution. We have problems with valedictorians making \nspeeches out of their own hearts. They cannot say certain things \nbecause we have gotten to that point, as I mentioned earlier.\n  That was criticized by Judge Griffin Bell, former Attorney of the \nUnited States under President Carter. Judge Bell said we ought to have \na litmus test. Nobody ought to serve on the Court who doesn't believe \nin prayer at football games.\n  How did we get to this point? How did we get to the point that a \nvoluntary prayer--you don't have to bow your head. There is no \nrequirement that anybody has to do anything before football games. We \ntake a minute, and somebody says a little prayer that acknowledges \nsomething more important than who is the toughest football player on \nthe field. I don't think there is anything wrong with that. I don't \nbelieve that violates anybody's right.\n\n[[Page S6111]]\n\n  Just as I believe I should respect somebody who has a different faith \nthan mine, just as I am required to respect the person who believes in \nno God whatsoever, and to have a decent respect for the opinions of \nothers who would say to me: If we want to have a little prayer and \neverybody wants to have a little prayer, it is not going to bother me. \nI don't believe in God anyway. Let them have it.\n\n  It is a part of our culture. It is not legitimate, in my view, for \nthe Supreme Court or its subsidiary courts to come in and declare that \nit is in violation of the Constitution. After all, what does the \nConstitution say? The first amendment is the only reference to \nreligion.\n  It says Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of a \nreligion or prohibit the free exercise thereof. That is what the \nConstitution says. There is nothing in the Constitution about a law of \nseparation between church and state.\n  Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the Baptist Association not long \nbefore he died in which he expressed an opinion that there ought to be \na wall of separation. What he meant by that, who knows? But judges have \nseized on that and rendered these opinions, many of them citing that \nquote as if it is somehow part of the Constitution. But the American \npeople didn't ratify that. They ratified the Constitution. That is the \nlaw of the land. What he wrote in a letter before he died is of no \nbenefit in interpreting the Constitution--or a minuscule benefit, if \nany.\n  In fact, Thomas Jefferson wasn't even at the Constitutional \nConvention when they were drafting the Constitution. He was off in \nFrance.\n  We are off base here. Somehow, under the idea that we have raised the \nestablishment clause higher than all reason dictates that it be raised, \nwe are saying anything that expresses religious faith publicly is \nsomehow an establishment of a religion. But everybody who knows the \nhistory of the deal understands that Virginia had an established \nchurch, and England had the established Church of England--the Anglican \nChurch, the Episcopal Church. Other countries had the Catholic Church \nas the established church. We didn't establish a church. No church was \ngoing to be given preferential treatment over another one.\n  That is what the Constitution was all about. That cannot be denied, \nin my view.\n  Congress shall pass no law respecting the establishment of a \nreligion.\n  That is what the Founding Fathers wanted to prohibit. They didn't \nwant to prohibit nor want to go back and strike the language from the \nDeclaration of Independence, for Heaven's sake.\n  For 150 years, we never had a problem with this. We rolled on--no \nproblem. We have chaplains. We have thanksgiving days. We have all \nkinds of things occurring that reflect an acknowledgment in general \nterms of religious beliefs, and of a higher being.\n  The Supreme Court said some things over the years. In recent years--\nduring the last 50 or 70 years--they have been inconsistent about it. I \nthink that has given some circuits, like the Ninth Circuit, and some \njudges the opportunity to perhaps run with some liberty to go further \nthan I hope the Supreme Court wants them to go. But the Supreme Court \nhas some fault here. We have had a long period of these kinds of \nopinions that go beyond reason, in my view.\n  For example, in Lynch v. Donnelly, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1984 \nrecognized ``an unbroken history of official acknowledgment by all \nthree branches of government of the role of religion in American life \nfrom at least 1789.''\n  And it adds, ``Our history is replete with official references to the \nvalue and invocation of Divine guidance in the deliberation and \npronouncements of the Founding Fathers and contemporary leaders.''\n  We just have to be relaxed here, and be natural in our understanding \nof what we mean by not establishing a religion.\n  We also do not need to forget the free exercise clause of the first \namendment that we shall not be denied the free exercise of our \nreligion. That is of equal value with nonestablishment of religion.\n  Other things are important.\n  Engraved on the top of the Washington Monument are the words ``Praise \nbe to God.''\n  I suppose the judges out there that rendered the opinion are going to \nhave to take a chisel up there and go after it.\n  The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier: At that tomb are these words \nengraved: ``Here rests in honored glory an American soldier known but \nto God.'' Is somebody going to take the chisel to that?\n\n  Let me mention this final quote. It shows how, in the middle of this \npast century, we were not so far out of sync about what the first \namendment really means.\n  Justice William O. Douglas, whom many would recognize as perhaps the \nmost liberal member ever to serve on the Court--certainly one of the \nmost, maybe, radical members of the Court; his background was quite \nunusual, but he was a brilliant man--he wrote many interesting \nopinions. This one, writing for the majority on the Court, in 1952, in \nZorach v. Clauson, he stated this:\n\n       The First Amendment . . . does not say that in every and \n     all respects there should be a separation of Church and \n     State. . . . Otherwise the state and religion would be aliens \n     to each other--hostile, suspicious, and even unfriendly. . . \n     . Prayers in our legislative halls; the appeals to the \n     Almighty in the messages of the Chief Executive; the \n     proclamations making Thanksgiving Day a holiday; ``so help me \n     God'' in our courtroom oaths--these and all other references \n     to the Almighty that run through our laws, our public \n     rituals, our ceremonies would be flouting the First \n     Amendment.\n\n  If that were the way we were going to interpret it. He is exactly \ncorrect.\n  So my concern is that we would be in error if we simply stood up and \nsaid that the Ninth Circuit made a mistake and somehow it is all going \nto get corrected. There are Members of this body who have advocated \naggressively for these kinds of opinions. There are Members of this \nbody who have fought hard to confirm the kind of judges who render \nthese rulings.\n  In fact, this ruling, I assume, is going to be compatible with the \nviews, probably, of a majority of law professors in America today--\nmaybe not, hopefully not--but a whole lot of them because that is what \na lot of the people think.\n  We have had a radicalized version of the establishment clause that is \nbeing taught, that has been adopted, and in significant part adopted by \nthe Supreme Court. So they have a problem now, as I see it. They are \ngoing to have to deal with this.\n  They say a schoolchild cannot say a prayer, cannot express religious \nfaith through a prayer that nobody has to listen to, but we can chisel \non a wall of the Senate: ``In God we trust.''\n  They are saying we can have paid chaplains in this Senate and in the \nArmed Forces by the taxpayers of the United States, but nonmandatory, \nfree expressions of faith all over the country they strike down in many \ndifferent ways.\n  So I think they have a problem. I hope this Supreme Court will \nreevaluate what they have done. I hope they will go back to the 1940s \nand 1950s, and all the century and a half of the founding of this \ncountry, and follow that history of jurisprudence. If they do so, they \ncan get us out of this thicket.\n  What we simply need to do is to respect other people's religion. If a \ngroup of kids want to have a little prayer, so be it. Let's let them \nhave it. It does not hurt me. I do not think it hurts anybody else. \nThat is the way I was raised: to respect people's faith, and not to \ndenigrate someone else's faith when they do not agree with you.\n  I hope that as we go through this whole debate, this resolution will \nhave some impact. I doubt it will have much. But I hope in the course \nof responding to this opinion, which is, unfortunately, too consistent \nwith some of the rulings of courts in America, that we will once again \nreattach ourselves to the great historic principles of America that \nvenerate respect and further and nourish religious faith, not attempt \nto eliminate it from public life, but, at the same time, not allow \nanybody to impose their will on somebody else.\n\n  I think we can reach that balance. I think we can show courtesy to \none another. I hope we will be able to do so. If we do, America will be \nbetter off for it. It is time for us to get to the bottom of it, \nconfront the issues honestly, and head on, and maybe we can make some \nimprovements.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am surprised and offended by the \ndecision of the Appeals Court of the Ninth Circuit and hope that it \nwill be promptly\n\n[[Page S6112]]\n\nappealed and overturned. I believe that the Court has misinterpreted \nthe intent of the Framers of the Constitution and has sought to \nundermine one of the bedrock values of our democracy, that we are \nindeed ``one nation under God,'' as embodied in the Pledge of \nAllegiance to the flag of the United States of America.\n  While our men and women in uniform are battling overseas and \ndefending us here at home to preserve the freedom that we all cherish \nfor our country and its citizens, we should never forget the blessings \nof Divine Providence that undergird our Nation. That includes the \nfreedom to recite the pledge of allegiance in our Nation's schools. I \ncan only imagine how they will feel about this decision as they risk \ntheir lives for our values.\n  And the children of America, who share a bond with each other and \nwith our Nation by reciting the pledge each day, what effect will a \ndecision like this have on them? It will cause them to wonder about the \nways in which our beliefs can be stretched, our heritage can be \nassaulted. It is the wrong decision, and it is an unfair decision, \nespecially unfair to those who defend our Nation, and to the young \npeople who will inherit our Nation's future.\n  Ours is a Nation founded by people of faith. People of faith have \nhelped lead some of the most significant movements of social justice \nthroughout our history: to end slavery, to win civil rights for all \nAmericans. No one is required to have faith, and our Government does \nnot impose faith on its citizens. But ours is the most faith-filled \nnation on Earth, and there is no moral or constitutional argument why \nour Pledge of Allegiance cannot acknowledge our commonly held belief \nthat ours is one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and \njustice for all.\n  I am honored to support S. 292, the Pledge of Allegiance resolution, \nand I hope that the rule of law will be upheld by an ultimate rejection \nof this wrongheaded decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am outraged with the \ndecision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the Pledge of \nAllegiance is unconstitutional because it contains the words ``Under \nGod.''\n  The pledge is part of the fabric of our society, a wonderful \ntradition that is observed in thousands of schools each day by millions \nof school children.\n  For two activist judges to decide for thousands of schools and \nthousands of parents that their children can't recite the pledge is the \nheight of liberal intolerance and arrogance.\n  The Declaration of Independence talks about our Creator. Our coins \nand dollars have ``In God We Trust'' imprinted on them. Our public \nofficials take their oath on the Bible. The Ten Commandments is posted \nin the U.S. Supreme Court. The House and Senate start off each day with \nthe Pledge of Allegiance. If it's good enough for Senators to say the \npledge each day, it's good enough for America's school children to do \nthe same.\n  There are countless more examples of religion in American public \nlife. The First Congress enacted the Northwest Ordinance, which \nprovided that ``religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to \ngood government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of \neducation shall forever be encouraged.'' President George Washington \noffered a prayer at his First Inaugural Address. Many of our nation's \nFounding Fathers and Framers of our Constitution commented publicly and \nprivately about the values and importance of religion in American \npublic life. Our armed services provide chaplains, priests and rabbis. \nThe U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate begin each day \nwith an opening prayer. For this court to single out the pledge for \nincluding the phrase ``One Nation, Under God,'' is simply incredible.\n  Nobody's forcing school children to recite the pledge. What we want, \nand what millions of parents want, is to simply give American children \nthe chance to pledge allegiance to our Flag and to everything that it \nrepresents: patriotism, sacrifice, courage, justice, perseverance. The \nlist goes on.\n  Now, more than ever, we should encourage our young people to learn \nand respect the patriotic values embodied in our Flag, the symbol of \nour country, and in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the judges who today declared the Pledge \nof Allegiance unconstitutional because of the words ``under God'' threw \nout reason and common sense and misread the Constitution. What we are \nleft with is an absurd result.\n  The first amendment of the Constitution allows for not only freedom \nof religion, but freedom to exercise religion. It is ludicrous that we \ncan't say ``under God.'' Using these judges' twisted logic, ``In God We \nTrust'' couldn't be on coins, and we would have to edit the Declaration \nof Independence because it says that all men are ``endowed by their \nCreator.''\n  When reason, common sense, and the correct interpretation of the \nConstitution return, this opinion will be reversed.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6112-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6112-S6121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003--Continued\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4111, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID.

RUSSIAN TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, in addition \n     to rogue states, are known to be working to acquire weapons \n     of mass destruction, and particularly nuclear warheads.\n       (2) The largest and least secure potential source of \n     nuclear warheads for terrorists or rogue states is Russia's \n     arsenal of non-strategic or ``tactical'' nuclear warheads, \n     which according to unclassified estimates numbers from 7,000 \n     to 12,000 warheads. Security at Russian nuclear weapon \n     storage sites is insufficient, and tactical nuclear warheads \n     are more vulnerable to terrorist or rogue state acquisition \n     due to their smaller size, greater portability, and greater \n     numbers compared to Russian strategic nuclear weapons.\n       (3) Russia's tactical nuclear warheads were not covered by \n     the START treaties or the recent Moscow Treaty. Russia is not \n     legally bound to reduce its tactical nuclear stockpile and \n     the United States has no inspection rights regarding Russia's \n     tactical nuclear arsenal.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--\n       (1) One of the most likely nuclear weapon attack scenarios \n     against the United States would involve detonation of a \n     stolen Russian tactical nuclear warhead smuggled into the \n     country.\n       (2) It is a top national security priority of the United \n     States to accelerate efforts to account for, secure, and \n     reduce Russia's stockpile of tactical nuclear warheads and \n     associated fissile material.\n       (3) This imminent threat warrants a special non-\n     proliferation initiative.\n       (c) Report.--\n       Not later than 30 days after enactment of this act, the \n     President shall report to Congress on efforts to reduce the \n     particular threats associated with Russia's tactical nuclear \n     arsenal and the outlines of a special initiative related to \n     reducing the threat from Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4134\n\n   (Purpose: to authorize, with an offset, $2,500,000 for research, \n development, test, and evaluation for the Navy for the DDG optimized \n                          manning initiative)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 214.

Korean War Veterans Association, Incorporated.....120101''.....\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4136\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to note that the Senate \nauthorizes $1.0M for efforts designed to enhance the development of key \nenabling robotics technologies that will support Army, Navy and Air \nForce transformational programs. These efforts will leverage and \ncoordinate capabilities that exist in the federal government, industry, \nacademia and not-for-profit entities.\n  The Department of the Army has embarked on a new and ambitious \nprogram to develop a Future Combat System (FCS). Robotic and unmanned \nsystems are expected to play a role in the platforms that are developed \nto support this Objective Force initiative. In addition to FCS, the Air \nForce and the Navy are pursuing the development of unmanned aircraft \nand, in the case of the Navy, underwater unmanned platforms.\n  These funds are to be used to begin work and continue work on key \nrobotics technologies that are identified by the Department of Defense \nand military services as essential to achieving transformational or \nleap ahead capabilities.\n  Currently, there is no single coordinated service-wide robotics \ninitiative that will support military efforts to transform. The \nauthorized funds would begin the process of advanced product \ndevelopment, prototype development, product testing, demonstration, and \nvalidation projects for defense-related unmanned and/or robotic \nplatforms.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4138\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I commend Ranking Member Warner for his \nstewardship of the FY 2003 defense budget process in the Senate. We \nface many challenges to our national security in this day and age and I \nam thankful for his leadership. One of those emerging challenges we \nface is the terrorist threat to our food supply, specifically U.S. \nagriculture. On the federal, state, and local level, we need to \nestablish procedures to detect, deter, and respond to large scale \ncoordinated attacks against livestock and agricultural commodities. \nToward that end, I ask the Senate to support my amendment to authorize, \nwith an offset, $1,000,000 for research, development, test, and \nevaluation, for basic research for the chemical and biological defense \nprogram (PE 0601384BP) for research, analysis, and assessment of \nefforts to counter possible agroterrorist attacks. It is my hope that \nuniversities with established expertise in the agricultural sciences \ncan conduct studies and exercises that lead to better coordination \nbetween federal, state, and local authorities as they attempt to \ndetect, deter, and respond to large scale coordinated attacks on U.S. \nagriculture. Most importantly, I envision universities assisting the \nDepartment of Defense in determining what role--if any--our military or \ndefense agencies play in countering agroterroism. I ask my colleagues \nto support my amendment. I thank the chair.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4160\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Fiscal Year 2002 Defense Appropriations \nAct directed the State Department to study and report on the United \nStates-People's Republic of China Science and Technology Agreement of \n1979, and its protocols. The Agreement has been the basis for nearly a \nquarter century of science and technology transfers from the U.S. to \nChina by twelve agencies of our government.\n  While the Cox Report of 1999 detailed how private companies in the \nUnited States have transferred technologies that have aided the \ndevelopment of China's military, up until now there has never been an \nassessment of the joint scientific activities between the governments \nof the U.S. and China. As the report on the science and technology \nagreement states, this report ``is the first major analysis of the \nagreement in nearly 25 years and is intended to provide a comprehensive \nreview of the agreement, its protocols, and their impact on the Chinese \neconomy, military, and defense industrial base.''\n  The report, which was developed in close consultation with the U.S.-\nChina National Security Review Commission, has been delivered to \nCongress. It is in both an unclassified form, with an executive summary \nand voluminous annexes, and in classified form, which is available in \nS-407 in the Capitol for my colleagues to review.\n  There are several troubling aspects of this report.\n  It makes clear, for example, that there is no coordinating mechanism \nto oversee the activities undertaken by the twelve agencies and dozens \nof offices and bureaus of our government that are carrying out the 1979 \nAgreement with China. In fact, the report, noting certain changes to \nthe State Department bureaucracy in 1996, ``there has been no mechanism \nwithin the U.S. Government since then to keep a systematic account of \nprotocols under the U.S.-China Science and Technology Agreement.'' \nFurthermore, this report was reportedly the first time that the \nintelligence community has had an opportunity to evaluate the range of \nprograms that are underway.\n  According to the State Department, we have spent an average of $5 \nmillion in taxpayer funds over each of the last five years to carry out \nthis Agreement and its protocols, yet there is no single office in our \ngovernment that oversees the spider's web of the technology exchange \nprograms that have spun from it.\n  The report fails to fully analyze the impact of the science and \ntechnology exchange programs on the development of Chinese military \npower. While it argues that the development of China's industrial and \nmilitary power has been based primarily on its economic growth and its \ngeneral efforts to acquire technology from the West, the State \nDepartment also states that ``the degree to which cooperative science \nand technology activities conducted under the Agreement may have \ncontributed to China's economic and military growth is difficult to \nassess.'' That amounts to, at the very least, a mixed message.\n  The report also notes that there is no regular reporting requirement \nto Congress on the range and types of programs that are carried out \nunder the Science and Technology Agreement. This lack of reporting \nindicates that no one is paying very much attention to what activities \nwe are undertaking with regard to the Agreement. Just who is minding \nthe store? Is anyone in the Executive Branch truly concerned with these \ntechnology transfer programs? Or is this Agreement considered just \nanother means to smooth over the inevitable hiccups in relations \nbetween our countries?\n  Finally, to no surprise, the State Department provided no \nrecommendations for improving the monitoring of the Science and \nTechnology Agreement. In essence, the report argues\n\n[[Page S6121]]\n\nthat whatever technology and scientific knowledge China might have \ngained through cooperative programs with the United States pales in \ncomparison to the knowledge China has gained through other channels. \nThe report points to the number of Chinese students studying in U.S. \nuniversities, China's investment policies, and scientific agreements \nwith other countries as other routes for technology transfer.\n  The State Department's contention is akin to arguing that the Chinese \nare gorging so heartily on science and technology through universities, \nprivate industry, and other countries, that another few morsels from \nUncle Sam cannot be very important. Ridiculous!\n  As a result of this analysis, the State Department's principal \nrecommendation is to ``allow the Agreement to operate, as heretofore, \nwithout the encumbrance of any special monitoring mechanism, which \nwe,'' referring to the State Department, ``do not believe is either \nnecessary or desirable.''\n  I do not think that it is going out on a limb to suggest that the \nU.S.-China Science and Technology Agreement has been used as a balm to \nsoothe the sore spots of our bilateral relations. As the State \nDepartment report says, ``In April 2001, at the height of the EP-3 \nplane incident, the U.S. and China quietly renewed the Science and \nTechnology Agreement despite the severe chill in political/economic \nrelations resulting from this diplomatic confrontation.''\n  It is astounding to note that in the very same month that a Chinese \nfighter jet crashed into one of our reconnaissance airplanes in \ninternational airspace, and the same month that China detained our \nmilitary personnel after executing an emergency landing at a Chinese \nairfield, we ``quietly'' renewed this significant bilateral agreement. \nI wonder if the Secretary of Defense was aware of the renewal of this \nagreement at that time? I wonder if the President knew about it?\n  Mr. President, I do not think that it is wise to view the transfer of \nadvanced technology and scientific knowledge as simply a diplomatic \ntool. The amendment I offer today takes very basic steps to improve \noversight of the 1979 Science and Technology Agreement. The amendment \nsimply designates the Office of Science and Technology Cooperation in \nthe State Department as responsible for monitoring the Agreement. \nAccording to its report, the State Department has not even kept track \nof the sixty protocols to this Agreement since 1996. This needs to be \nchanged. The amendment also requires the Secretary of State to see that \nactivities carried out under the Agreement are consistent with our laws \nand regulations that prohibit the transfer of sensitive technology.\n  Further, the amendment establishes a reporting requirement so that \nthe State Department will inform Congress every two years on what \nactivities have taken place under the Agreement. As I stated earlier, \nthe State Department report released in May 2002 was the first-ever \ncomprehensive assessment of the implementation of the 1979 U.S.-China \nScience and Technology Agreement. It does not make sense to wait \nanother 23 years for the next assessment.\n  Mr. President, China is embarking on a substantial military buildup. \nThey are using technologies that have been acquired from a vast number \nof sources. It is hard to believe that our own government has been \ncooperating with China in exchanging scientific information that has \nthe potential, in the words of the State Department, to facilitate \nChina's military research programs. My amendment takes very simple \nsteps to make sure that the government-to-government scientific \nexchanges that take place are focused on peaceful uses of technology. I \nurge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say that there has been a tremendous \namount of work done today. I know we were in long quorum calls and \npeople could not see the work that has been done. But one very \nimportant amendment dealing with national missile defense was \ncompleted. That was done by voice vote after many hours of work. Then, \ntoday and this evening, staff, with Senators Warner and Levin, have \napproved almost 50 amendments. So this very important bill is on the \nway toward being completed.\n  We are going to vote in the morning on cloture. People will have to \ndeal with germane amendments after that. But I just want to spread on \nthe Record comments about the work done by the staffs, today and \ntonight, and the two managers of the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might address the Senate, I wish to \nexpress my appreciation to the distinguished majority whip. We did \nsucceed on missile defense, but it could not have been done without the \ncooperation of the majority leader, the Republican leader, yourself, \nand our distinguished chairman, who departed a few minutes or so ago.\n  We did achieve a good deal of work. I am confident that tomorrow, \nwith the support of all the Senators, we will achieve a landmark bill \non behalf of the men and women in the armed services of this great \nNation.\n  I thank all Members, and particularly the Presiding Officer for his \npatience and guidance throughout the day, and the Senate staff.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague and friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6121-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

At least since the Enron scandal we have been \ndealing not just with recession but with what we must term a crisis in \ncorporate responsibility.\n  It is hard to imagine the ultimate impact this will have on average \nAmericans and their families, let alone other businesses. But it really \ncalls into question the responsibility and role of the Federal \nGovernment to respond to this crisis in corporate responsibility.\n  Very soon, we will be considering legislation reported from the \nBanking Committee that will seek to address some of the most glaring \nproblems in corporate governance in America today. It is talking about \nthe role of accounting firms that are serving both as consultants and \nauditors--in a dual and sometimes conflicting capacity--that will \nestablish standards for regulation of accounting firms so there is more \ncredibility in their findings for the American public. It will address \na number of other areas, such as strengthening the SEC. I believe all \nof these things are long overdue.\n  When we return from the Fourth of July recess, the Senate will be \naddressing this issue. There will be differences of opinion. There will \nbe some who will come to the floor and you will hear the debate. Some \nwill argue to leave business alone, Government should not meddle. Yet \nthe fact is that unless Government steps in in this situation offering \nsound advice, counsel, and regulation, we are going to continue to see \nthis crisis in America's confidence in corporate institutions. There \nwas a day when the robber barons ruled in America. Corporations, \nfrankly, cared little or nothing about public opinion. The richest \npeople in America were very powerful here on Capitol Hill. Those days \nhearken back to the era of Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican who came in \nand said: We are going to have an antitrust law and we are going to \nestablish the agencies that we need to make certain business is \nregulated.\n  About 35 years later, along came a relative, Franklin Roosevelt, \nfacing a recession which led to a depression, which again called into \nquestion whether Government was doing enough to regulate business. His \ndecision to create the SEC and other key agencies restored confidence \nin American business.\n\n[[Page S6122]]\n\n  I am afraid this year, in this new century, we face a similar \nchallenge. If Congress shirks its responsibility, if the administration \ndoes not accept its responsibility, we will continue to see a decline \nnot only in the stock market but in the savings, the pensions, the nest \neggs of American families across the board.\n  We really call on the leaders in the business community to step \nforward--and there are many honorable, hard-working people who have \ndone such a fine job in creating good business, good enterprises, \nopportunities for people to work and profits to be made. They need to \nstep forward and make it clear that the good people in the business \nsector will not tolerate what we are reading day in and day out in the \nWall Street Journal about corporate activity.\n\n  Recently, we had a hearing before the Governmental Affairs Committee \nand brought in some of the people from Enron who made the decisions. \nOne of them a person I have admired for many years, who is a medical \ndoctor in the Houston area, was head of the compensation committee for \nEnron. We asked him during the course of the hearing: How in the world \ncould you justify hundreds of millions of dollars to individual \ncorporate officials at Enron at a time when the company was clearly \nmisleading the public?\n  He said: We had to do it. We were the seventh largest corporation in \nAmerica and we had to have the seventh highest salary in America for a \nCEO.\n  It turned out the performance of the corporate officers really wasn't \nthe important issue here; the question was, within that click, that \nfraternity, whether they were being compensated as their peers would \nexpect.\n  What happened to the old days when an entrepreneur not only engaged \nin risk but accepted the consequences when it didn't work out? You \ndon't see that these days. People are being compensated hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in stock options and, with that compensation, we \nlook at the corporate records and find companies are losing money.\n  The board of directors seems oblivious to the obvious. the People \nleading these corporations are not doing a good job managing. They are \nnot creating the profitability for shareholders, and they are being \nrewarded with outrageous sums for salaries and stock options.\n  My colleague, Senator Levin of Michigan, who is not in the Chamber, \nhas been a leader in the whole question of stock options and the impact \nthese options have on corporate America. They create incentives for \ngreed, incentives for falsification in terms of companies' \nprofitability. Time and again, we have seen that these incentives have \nled to a disastrous outcome, such as the situation with WorldCom.\n  We are also seeing a gross disparity between the amount of money \nbeing paid to the average American working for a company and the \ncompensation for officials at the highest levels. It is the greatest \ndisparity in the history of our country. Truly, the rich are getting \nricher, the middle class is struggling, and the poor are getting \npoorer.\n  Kevin Phillips, who has written a book called ``Wealth and \nDemocracy'' analyzes the disparity of wealth and income in America. \nNow, it is understood in this country that if you are willing to take a \nrisk and work hard, you should be compensated. That is one of the great \nparts of America, part of the American dream. But we see at WorldCom \nand other corporations where they are falsifying their profitability, \nwhere the average person, whether buying a mutual fund or a share of \nthis stock, could not have a clue as to the reality and honesty of the \ncorporate books.\n  I say to President Bush and members of the administration: You cannot \nignore this problem. This is a problem that calls for Presidential \nleadership and congressional leadership on both sides of the aisle. \nThose who want to take a hands-off, laissez-faire attitude toward this \nbusiness crisis are inviting, unfortunately, even worse results in \nterms of our economy and our stock market.\n  There is a standing joke, I guess, some comedians talk about: My \n401(k) has now become a 201(k).\n  I guess we can laugh a little about that, but the fact is many people \nI meet in my home State of Illinois talk about postponing retirement. \nThey have to keep working because what they had hoped to rely on just \nisn't going to be there. Today, at end of the day, when we look at Dow \nJones, and NASDAQ, and other reports from financial communities, I am \nafraid we are seeing that even more wealth in America has evaporated.\n  It is not because of this one corporation, WorldCom; it is because of \nthis looming crisis in corporate responsibility, which is a specter \nover the economy of our Nation.\n  This calls on us to be honest and real in our dealings with corporate \nAmerica. It is not just a matter of their reporting accurately as to \nwhether they are profitable or losing money; it is a question of \ncorporate conduct. We have to demand corporate responsibility when it \ncomes to treating pensioners from their companies fairly. If a promise \nis made to someone that they will have health insurance and a pension, \nthat corporation should not be allowed to escape that responsibility or \nthat liability--to leave these poor people alone, after promises of a \nlifetime, and unprotected and unguarded with the perils of the economy \nliterally at their door.\n  Secondly, we have to insist that corporations, when it comes to their \nconduct involving world trade, do the responsible thing for America. \nWhen Stanley Tools recently announced they were going to move their \ncorporate operations to Bermuda to avoid American income taxes, this \nconsumer said I will never buy another one of their products because, \nas far as I am concerned, if they can go to that Bermuda Triangle where \ntheir tax liability and American jobs disappear, they may as well \ndisappear, too, as far as I am concerned.\n  That is the kind of corporate misconduct that has become rampant and \nis creating a cynicism among Americans about many corporate leaders, \nand that has to change.\n  In addition, when it comes to the whole question of the environment, \ntime and time again, we find corporations that have created a toxic \nimpact on the environment--those that have left behind toxic waste, for \nexample, that are trying to escape liability.\n  It is an issue being debated over Superfund sites. A Superfund site \nis a place in America where a corporation has done business and left \nbehind dangerous toxic waste. The question is, Who should pay to clean \nit up? I think the answer is simple. The polluters should pay it; the \nperson who makes the mess should pay it. That is not what we are \nhearing from this administration. We are hearing: No, no, you cannot \nask the businesses and corporate community to be responsible for their \nmisconduct; the taxpayers in general should pay for the cleanup.\n  That is wrong, just plain wrong. That is not fair and it is not just.\n  This issue of corporate responsibility is rising as the Dow Jones \nfalls. People across America are understanding that the great \ncorporations and the great businesses that are truly the backbone and \nstrength of our economy have to stand up and be responsible in their \nconduct.\n  As I said earlier, there are good ones. I know many great business \nleaders. In my State of Illinois and the city of Chicago, I can list \ndozens of them for you. But there are some who are bringing shame on \nthis sector of the economy and the people who are dedicated to American \nbusiness.\n  I hope this WorldCom scandal which has been announced this morning in \nthe Wall Street Journal is a wake-up call not only for the President \nbut for Congress as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6122-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6122-S6124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AMERICA CANNOT AFFORD AN AMTRAK SHUTDOWN\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to reiterate my steadfast \nand unwavering support for Amtrak.\n  I believe that President Bush, Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta, \nAmtrak President David Gunn, and the Congress need to work together \nimmediately to prevent our passenger rail system from grinding to a \nhalt and stranding millions of commuters coast to coast.\n  Amtrak's passenger rail service is an essential link in our \ntransportation system and our economy.\n  Every day Americans use Amtrak and local commuter rail systems that\n\n[[Page S6123]]\n\ndepend on Amtrak to get to and from work. And as we approach the July \nFourth holiday, more and more Americans are relying on Amtrak trains \nfor their vacation travel, especially this year because of security \nchanges at our Nation's airports.\n  I cannot think of a worse time for Amtrak to have run out of money \nand I find it unconscionable that Members of Congress and the President \nare not unified to see that our trains continue to run.\n  What will happen if Amtrak shuts down? You can be sure the roads will \njam up even more and air travel will become an even greater headache.\n  I agree with Secretary Mineta when he said Monday night that the \nburden is not on President Bush alone to save the rail system from \nbankruptcy. However, it is important to point out that President Bush \nalone can keep Amtrak out of bankruptcy by announcing today that he \nwill approve the company's application for a $200 million loan guaranty \nand support an additional appropriation of $200 million in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill that is now in conference \nnegotiations.\n  Here is how I believe we must respond to the current situation. \nFirst, I believe the $200 million emergency loan guaranty that Amtrak \nneeds to keep the trains running must be approved immediately. This \n$200 million will allow Amtrak to again find private financing that has \ndried up over the past several months because of the company's \ndeteriorating financial condition.\n  Second, the members of the conference committee on the supplemental \nappropriations bill are trying to include a $200 million emergency \nappropriation for Amtrak. If this bill can emerge from conference \nnegotiations this week and if the President agrees to sign the \nlegislation, the funds will get to Amtrak before the July Fourth \nholiday.\n  Third, I have joined many of my colleagues in a commitment to work \nfor $1.2 billion for Amtrak in fiscal year 2003. This is the amount \nAmtrak needs and I believe it is the amount Congress should deliver.\n  I cannot understand why President Bush continues to stand by his \npaltry budget request of $521 million and threaten to veto the \nTransportation appropriations bill if more than that amount is provided \nto Amtrak.\n  Fourth, I believe the Senate should take up Senator Hollings' \nlegislation to fund Amtrak for the next 5 years. The National Defense \nRail Act would authorize $4.6 billion annually from 2003 to 2007 for \npassenger rail service. The legislation, which passed the Commerce \nCommittee by a vote of 20-3 in April would fund rail security \nimprovements, high speed rail development, and operational costs for \nexisting rail routes.\n  I believe Congress must take each of these four steps to preserve and \nimprove Amtrak.\n  I strongly believe that Amtrak is not a failure, it is the government \nthat has failed Amtrak. If we do not properly fund our rail system, how \ndo we expect it to thrive?\n  Since 1971, when Amtrak was founded, only $25 billion has been spent \non passenger rail, compared to over $750 billion that has been invested \nin highways and aviation. The Federal Government has made a commitment \nto fund road construction and expand aviation capacity, but we have \nalways come up short to provide fair funding for our rail system.\n  The Federal Government provided $15 billion in payments and loan \nguaranties to aid the airlines after the September 11 terrorist \nattacks. Why can't we provide $200 million to keep our trains running?\n  Imagine the chaos that will ensue if Amtrak does shutdown this \nsummer. There will be even more traffic on our roads and air travel \nwill slow down if trains are not an option for commuters heading to \nwork or travelers on vacation.\n  On Monday, Senator Boxer and I wrote President Bush to ask him to \napprove Amtrak's $200 million loan guaranty. This letter illustrates \nhow important Amtrak is to California and why a shutdown would threaten \nthe State's economy.\n  As we mention in the letter, last week a transportation think tank \ndeclared southern California and the Bay Area as the two urban areas of \nthe country with the longest traffic delays. Californians do not need \nany more gridlock.\n  Yet if Amtrak shuts down, thousands of people in California who \ndepend on Amtrak service every day will be stranded. Amtrak trains that \ntravel throughout the State and regional commuter trains could both \ngrid to a halt if the $200 million loan guaranty is not forthcoming.\n  Since most rail lines in California are run by Amtrak or depend on \nAmtrak, everything is in jeopardy. These include three Amtrak routes \nfunded by the State and the Federal Government: 1. the Capitol Corridor \nroute between San Jose and Auburn; 2. the San Joaquin route between \nOakland and Bakersfield; 3. the Pacific Surfliner route between San \nDiego and San Luis Obispo.\n  These are three of the most successful routes in the United States. \nIn fact, all three are among the top five intercity rail corridors and \nthe Pacific Surfliner is the fastest growing route in the nation. \nOverall the State of California has added 28 new daily trains since \n1995 and over 1.5 million new passengers.\n  But a shutdown will also threaten some of California's largest \nregional transportation systems including: 1. Caltrain, the rail \nservice between San Francisco and San Jose 2. Metrolink, Southern \nCalifornia's regional transit system 3. The Coaster, San Diego County's \nregional train.\n  In fact, on Monday Metrolink passengers in Southern California found \nthese flyers on their seats. The flyer updates commuters on the \nimminent Amtrak shutdown and tells them to ``explore other commute \noptions.''\n  This week I also received a letter from the North County Transit \nDistrict on the impact an Amtrak shutdown will have on San Diego \nCounty's Coaster Commuter Rail Service.\n  It is clear to me that a shutdown of Amtrak will be devastating for \nrail passengers across the Nation. I believe we must act immediately to \navoid it. I urge President Bush to provide a $200 million loan guaranty \nto prevent a shutdown of Amtrak service in California and the rest of \nthe country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print additional material in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 2002.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to urge you to approve a \n     $200 million federal loan guaranty to allow Amtrak to \n     continue to operate. Amtrak is extremely important to \n     California. After New York, California has the second highest \n     ridership in the country. Without this funding, thousands of \n     people in California who depend on Amtrak service every day \n     will be stranded.\n       Just last week, a respected analyst rated Los Angeles and \n     San Francisco-Oakland as the two urban areas of the country \n     with the longest annual delays per rush-hour driver. \n     Californians have gridlock. Without Amtrak, the 69,000 daily \n     commuters that use the three Amtrak commuter train systems \n     will not be able to get to work. These services also have \n     financial support from the state of California, which spent \n     $72 million in the state's fiscal year 2002.\n       Amtrak is important and growing outside the Northeast \n     Corridor. For example, California has the second most \n     traveled line in the country: the ``Pacific Surfliner''--from \n     San Diego to Los Angeles. Amtrak West has increased the daily \n     number of trains from 36 intercity trains in 1995 to 64 \n     intercity trains in 2001, which is a 78 percent increase. All \n     but three of these are in California. The number of \n     passengers has increased by 52 percent and passenger related \n     revenues have increased by 49 percent during the same period \n     of time.\n       We strongly believe that the federal government must \n     continue to support Amtrak and the partnership with the State \n     of California for a viable national intercity passenger rail \n     service. Again, we urge you to provide a $200 million loan \n     guaranty to prevent a shutdown to Amtrak service in \n     California and the rest of the country.\n           Sincerly,\n     Dianne Feinstein,\n       United States Senator\n     Barbara Boxer,\n       United States Senator\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Metrolink Commuter\n\n                                                    June 24, 2002.\n       Dear Metrolink Commuters: Within the last few weeks, the \n     nation learned that Amtrak is facing urgent financial \n     challenges to continue national passenger rail services \n     through the end of the federal fiscal year (October 2002). As \n     of June 19, 2002, Amtrak\n\n[[Page S6124]]\n\n     had not been able to secure a needed $200 million bank loan. \n     David L. Gunn, the newly appointed Amtrak CEO, testified \n     before a U.S. Senate Sub-committee on that day that failure \n     to obtain $200 million in federal loan guarantees or cash by \n     July 1 would leave him no choice but to begin an orderly \n     shutdown of rail passenger service nationwide, to place the \n     company into bankruptcy, and to place the corporation's \n     assets under a court appointed trustee.\n       You may be aware that Metrolink dispatchers, locomotive \n     engineers and conductors are provided under a contract with \n     Amtrak. Our contract with Amtrak is similar to many other \n     passenger rail operator contracts with Amtrak throughout the \n     country. The Metrolink contract, which expires on June 30, \n     2004, covers all Amtrak costs of providing the 145 Amtrak \n     employees needed to dispatch trains and to operate \n     Metrolink's 138 weekday trains and 32 weekend trains.\n       At this time, we have no additional information as to \n     exactly how a shutdown of Amtrak passenger rail service would \n     affect Metrolink. Metrolink sent Amtrak and federal officials \n     a letter on June 10th stating that no federal subsidies are \n     used for the Metrolink contract and that there should be no \n     cash flow concerns for Amtrak by continuing to provide the \n     contract services. To date, Amtrak has not provided a \n     response. We have also begun to explore the limited options \n     we have to try to avoid an interruption in Metrolink services \n     in case Amtrak is unable or unwilling to meet its contractual \n     obligations. In order to ensure uninterrupted safe operation \n     of Metrolink, we need the continued availability of the \n     existing Amtrak certified and qualified employees.\n       While we encourage you to purchase your July Metrolink fare \n     media as usual, you should also explore other commute \n     options. Should Metrolink services be interrupted we will \n     reconcile any fare payment issues. We also will provide \n     updated information through the media, on our website \n     (www.metrolinktrains.com), and with fax and email updates to \n     the employee transportation coordinator that participate in \n     our Corporate Pass Program. You may also call (800) 371-LINK.\n       We apologize for any inconvenience or uncertainty that this \n     potential Amtrak action may have. We have hope that Amtrak \n     and the federal government can secure the needed funding to \n     avert the crisis.\n     David Solow, CEO\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Building, Room 331, Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Southern \n     California Regional Rail Authority, operators of Metrolink, I \n     am writing to urge your support for an immediate Amtrak loan \n     guarantee. We contract with Amtrak to provide our commuter \n     rail service throughout six counties of Southern California. \n     If bridge funds are not provided to Amtrak, our service is at \n     risk for shutting down as well.\n       As you are probably aware, David Gunn, Amtrak's new \n     president recently announced that Amtrak needs a $200 million \n     loan guarantee by June 30th from Congress or the company will \n     have to begin an orderly shutdown of all services. Metrolink \n     dispatchers, locomotive engineers and conductors are provided \n     under a contract with Amtrak. Our contract with Amtrak is \n     similar to many other passenger rail operator contracts with \n     Amtrak throughout the country. The Metrolink contract, which \n     expires on June 30, 2004, covers all Amtrak costs of \n     providing the 145 Amtrak employees needed to dispatch trains \n     and to operate Metrolink's 138 weekday trains and 32 weekend \n     trains.\n       Our commuter rail services are obtained through cost-\n     reimbursement contracts. This means we are not subsidized by \n     Amtrak. Nonetheless, Amtrak has been unable to ensure \n     continued Metrolink commuter rail service. In order to ensure \n     uninterrupted safe operation of Metrolink, we need the \n     continued availability of the existing Amtrak certified and \n     qualified employees.\n       Metrolink operates in the nation's most congested region. \n     Shutting down our service will not only impact our \n     ridership--34,000 daily--but also contribute to increased \n     peak hour congestion on the highways. Metrolink removes one \n     lane of traffic during peak hours on the highways we \n     parallel. Without our service, those lanes will be flooded \n     again with frustrated drivers.\n       Please contact President Bush to request his support for \n     Amtrak's request of $200 million in loan guarantees. We \n     respectfully urge you to work with Congress to ensure \n     continued operation of passenger rail and the contract \n     services upon which Metrolink depends.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      David Solow,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to you on behalf of \n     the North San Diego County Transit Development Board to \n     request your support for Amtrak and its provision of NCTD's \n     ``Coaster'' Commuter Rail Service in San Diego County.\n       David Gunn, Amtrak's new President, has recently announced \n     that unless Amtrak receives a $200 million loan guarantee by \n     the end of this month, the company will have no choice but to \n     shut down all passenger train services nationwide. NCTD, \n     along with three other public agencies in California, \n     contract with Amtrak for the operation of critical commuter \n     rail and inter-city rail services. Our commuter rail services \n     are obtained through cost-reimbursement contracts and do not \n     contribute to the national subsidy requirements for Amtrak's \n     overall network. Nevertheless, Amtrak has been unable to \n     provide assurance of continued commuter rail service \n     operation for the Coaster.\n       The shutdown of commuter rail service in San Diego County \n     would severely impact 5,000 Coaster passengers per day, add \n     significantly to peak hour freeway congestion, and reduce \n     regional mobility. Due to the complex requirements of \n     railroad operations, Amtrak's services cannot be readily \n     replaced overnight if Amtrak shuts its doors.\n       Please contact the President to request his support for \n     Amtrak's request for $200 million in loan guarantees, and \n     work with Congressional leaders to ensure continued operation \n     of passenger rail and the contract services upon which \n     Coaster operations depend.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thomas P.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 4, 2000 \nin Casper, WY. A man was arrested on charges of firing shots at a group \nof people watching a Fourth of July fireworks display in what police \ndescribed as a hate crime. Johnny Lee Hodge, who is white, was being \nheld on $100,000 bond after firing a shotgun at least three times at \nseveral black men and pointing a gun at the head of a teenage Indian \ngirl, authorities said.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \n10th anniversary of the renewed sister city relationship between the \nTownship of Princeton, NJ, and the village of Pettoranello, Italy. Over \nthe past 10 years the township and village have formed a strong bond \nand benefitted greatly from their relationship.\n  Guiseppe Perna and Achille Carnevale, sons of the village of \nPettoranello, came to Princeton in the 1850s. They, along with the many \nimmigrants who followed, built much of the Princeton community and \nUniversity that still stands today. The people of Pettoranello had a \ngreat influence on the Princeton community that continues to be felt. \nThose first immigrants from Pettoranello brought not only their \nfamilies, but also their traditions while maintaining strong ties to \ntheir village in Italy.\n  In 1994, a group of Princeton citizens led by Mayor Phyllis L. \nMarchand visited Mayor Antonio Camillo Paolino and the village of \nPettoranello, renewing the special sister city relationship between the \ntwo municipalities. Over the years, the Township of Princeton continues \nto recognize the ties that bind the Princeton community and the village \nof Pettoranello, Italy. The two sister cities have gained a great deal \nfrom each other through the exchange of music, athletics, medicine and \nliterature.\n  So, I join with people of the Township of Princeton, NJ, and \nPettoranello, Italy, in saluting the 10th anniversary of the renewed \nsister city relationship between these two municipalities. May their \nspirit of friendship and continued exchange of ideas and goods be a \nmodel for all of us to admire and emulate.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6125-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6125]]\n                      TRIBUTE TO ROBERT J. SEMLER\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today joined by my New \nEngland colleagues Senators Jeffords, Kerry, Snowe, Reed, Dodd, Gregg, \nLieberman, Chafee, Collins, and Leahy to congratulate Robert J. Semler \nas he ends an impressive career as the Regional Administrator for the \nDepartment of Labor. Since 1985, Bob has been responsible for the \nadministration of the Federal employment and training programs \nthroughout New England. He has ensured that workers and employers in \nNew England understood and took advantage of the opportunities in the \nJob Training Partnership Act, the School-to-Work Act, the Welfare-to-\nWork Act, and most recently in the Workforce Investment Act. He has \ntaken federal programs from print to the people and made every program \nwork for the particular needs of New England.\n  During his 33-year career with the Department of Labor Bob has \nactively tried to meet the needs of employers and employees, \nunderstanding that economic development means investing in people. He \nhas made the six New England States operate as a region, and with that \ncollaboration has come a renewed commitment to the cross-State \ninitiatives that have allowed our region to remain competitive in \nattracting new industries.\n  Bob's commitment to people began with his time with the Peace Corps. \nFrom 1964 to 1970 he served as the Western Venezuela Regional Director \noverseeing Peace Corps volunteers and programs that worked with \ncommunity development, health initiatives and agricultural \ncooperatives. He took the lessons learned in community building and \nimbedded those beliefs in the implementation of job training policy \nover the next 27 years.\n  Countless New England workers have raised their skills and found \nbetter jobs because of the work of Bob Semler, and it is with great \npride and genuine affection that we recognize his impressive \ncontributions to our region and wish him all our best as he begins the \nnext phase in his impressive career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6125-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FREE OVER-THE-AIR BROADCASTING\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nimportant role that free, over-the-air broadcasting plays in local \ncommunities.\n  Every 2 years, the National Association of Broadcasters conducts an \nindustry-wide census of television and radio broadcasters' public \nservice efforts. The results from the most recent census found that \nAmerica's radio and television stations contributed a staggering $9.9 \nbillion in service to their local communities throughout 2001.\n  The President has spoken in recent months of how Americans have \nrediscovered the value of service. Today, I would like to applaud an \nindustry that consistently demonstrates how small business can weave \nitself into the fabric of a community and play a vital role in helping \nothers.\n  In my home State, radio and television stations often assist local \ncharities and non-profits. It is estimated that local Arkansas \ntelevision and radio stations' community service efforts during 2001 \namounted to over 71 million dollars.\n  During 2001, KPOM-TV in Fort Smith continued its partnership with the \nSalvation Army to support the charity's year-end Red Kettle Drive. The \nevent netted a quarter of a million dollars to support needy families \nin the surrounding area. On their end, KPOM ran a schedule of 10 public \nservice announcements per day to support the effort.\n  Local Arkansas stations have also actively worked to promote health \nand health awareness in their communities. In Little Rock, radio \nstations KURB-FM and KLAL-FM were official sponsors and hosts of this \nyear's Arkansas Race for the Cure benefit for the Susan G. Komen Breast \nCancer Foundation. Thanks to these stations' promotional activities, \nmore than 34 thousand people participated, bringing in more than 1.6 \nmillion dollars to fight cancer. In Mountain Home, AM and FM stations \nKTLO and KCCT-FM partner every year to put on a Senior Fair and \nHospital Expo. The event brings in more than 3,000 senior citizens \nevery year for free health tests, information and referrals. In \nJonesboro, KAIT-TV conducted an active Public Service Announcement \ncampaign to promote prostate cancer awareness. The on-air effort \nincluded interviews with prostate cancer survivors in the community. \nThe timing of the campaign coincided with a local hospital's program to \nprovide free screenings for area men.\n  While $9.9 billion is an impressive figure, what is most impressive \nabout broadcasters' community service work is that each station \nendeavors to meet the community's unique needs. The efforts of \nbroadcasters are as diverse as the different communities they serve. \nLocal broadcast stations serve every community differently.\n  In this new era, I think it is important that we recognize those \namong us who have a solid record of service. And so to my local \nArkansas broadcasters, I would like to say thank you. We appreciate \neverything that you do to make our communities and our lives better, \nand we sincerely hope that you will keep up the good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6125-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SALUTING SOUTH CAROLINA CREDIT UNIONS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as we watch our budget deficits \ngoing up, up, and away, I take solace in knowing that today in South \nCarolina we are teaching our teenagers the real value of money.\n  The South Carolina Credit Union League, in conjunction with the \nClemson Cooperative Extension, is furnishing materials to teachers \nthroughout the State to help build financial literacy among our \nteenagers. Teenagers spend $155 billion a year nationwide, yet only 10 \npercent have any financial training in high school. It is imperative \nthat they learn, as early as possible, sound fiscal habits. I thank the \ncredit unions in South Carolina for taking on this initiative, which is \npart of a nationwide effort, spearheaded by the National Endowment for \nFinancial Education.\n  To recognize the important role high school teachers play in this \neffort, the credit unions also recently named Sue Dillon, a teacher at \nSpring Valley High School in Columbia, SC, as the Financial Literacy \nEducator of the Year. Her commitment to students' financial knowledge \nis reaching hundreds of young people in five South Carolina schools. \nSince today's high school graduates stand to earn more than $1 million \nas adults, the lessons Ms. Dillon teaches may be some of the most \nvaluable her students ever learn. I congratulate her on receiving this \nhonor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6125-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6125-S6126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RAY UHALDE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to pay a special tribute \nto a great public servant who is retiring later this month after nearly \n25 years of tireless and effective service. Raymond J. Uhalde has \nserved as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment and \nTraining for the past 8 years. As the senior career professional in the \nEmployment and Training Administration (ETA), he provided executive \ndirection for its $11 billion annual budget and 1300 employees. Ray \nalso served as acting Assistant Secretary from 1996 to 1998, and held \nother key policy positions during his tenure at the Department of \nLabor. As Deputy Assistant Secretary, he led important initiatives that \nimproved the nationwide systems of job training, job placement, and \nincome support that are administered by ETA. These public investments \nhelp millions of Americans increase their job skills, make smoother \ntransitions between jobs, and improve their wage levels. They also help \nemployers find the skilled workers they need. As a result, family \nincomes and our nation's prosperity have both improved.\n  Ray has received many accolades for his leadership over his years of \nservice, including recognition by President Clinton in awarding him \nwith the rank of Meritorious Executive in the Senior Executive Service, \nas well as the Department of Labor's most prestigious career award, the \nPhilip Arnow Award for excellence. But what stands above even these \nawards is Ray's unquestionable integrity and professionalism on a \nbipartisan basis. Ray enjoys a great deal of respect for his leadership \nand skill in shaping employment policy from Members of Congress and \ntheir staffs on both sides of the aisle, enabling him to be an \neffective representative for the Department of Labor\n\n[[Page S6126]]\n\nthrough several different Administrations.\n  His work has made a real difference in the lives of millions of \nAmericans. His legislative and administrative skills have played \ncritical roles in the enactment and implementation of many important \nbills including the Workforce Investment Act, a 5-year effort which \nfundamentally reformed the Nation's job training system; the Welfare to \nWork program, which has helped transition welfare recipients to gainful \nemployment; and the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act, which \nassists low income seniors earn a paycheck while providing important \ncommunity services. The passage and administration of each of these \nacts was due in large part to Ray's personal skills and dedicated \nefforts to assist in the development of consensus bills that would \nreflect the Administration's priorities and help Americans in need.\n  I am also grateful for his help and advice over the years on a range \nof immigration issues facing the Department of Labor. Ray embraced our \nimmigrant heritage, but also understood the importance of strengthening \nour immigration laws to ensure they would not be misused by those who \nsought to bring in immigrants to abuse them with substandard wages and \nworking conditions, and to displace U.S. workers.\n  These efforts represent only a small fraction of the most recent \naccomplishments that mark Ray's career at the Department of Labor. His \nfellow workers in the Department of Labor and throughout the \nadministration will sorely miss his wisdom and guidance, as will State \nand local workforce development leaders in every corner of the Nation. \nWhile I am sad to see Ray leave the civil service, I am happy to know \nthat he is going to become Co-Director of the Workforce Program at the \nNational Center on Education and the Economy, where I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with him in the years to come on issues involving \nworkforce development--a crucial social policy area in helping all \nAmericans to become full participants in the economic, social and \npolitical life of this great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6126-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RICHARD PEMBROKE\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nRichard ``Dick'' Pembroke, Chairman of the Vermont House Transportation \nCommittee, on his 16 years of service to Vermonters in the Legislature.\n  Dick has decided to retire from politics after a career largely \ndevoted to solving Vermont's transportation problems. And to be sure, \nhe understands the importance of a farsighted and diverse plan to meet \nVermonter's transportation needs.\n  But Dick will be remembered for more than just good transportation \npolicies for routes around Vermont. He was a politician in the finest \nsense. Bipartisan majorities consistently elected him, giving him the \nlargest numbers of votes in his two-seat district. He rightly \nconsidered consensus, negotiation, and compromise as the key \ningredients of good politics.\n  His attitude of cooperation in Montpelier spoke to voters so much, \nthat he never had to spend more than a few dollars on his campaigns. He \nwas repeatedly re-elected because of his exceptional spirit to get \nimportant things done. He used the legislative process for the benefit \nof all and the detriment of none.\n  His daily work in the Legislature was honest, and he served his \ndistrict and Vermont to the best of his abilities. As a Vermonter, I \nwould like to thank Dick for his years of service in the State House.\n  I am sure that his retirement from politics will never keep Dick from \ncalling me to discuss the issues that he thinks I should care about. \nAnd if an issue is important to Dick, it should be important to all \nVermonters.\n  My congratulations to Dick, and good luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6126-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6126-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6126-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:20 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4623.

A bill to provide for safe equestrian helmets, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transporation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Chafee, to introduce legislation to provide greater \nsafety for children and adults who ride horses in the United States. \nEach year in our country, nearly 15 million people go horseback riding. \nWhether it be professionally or for pleasure, Americans of all ages and \nfrom all walks of life enjoy equestrian sports. And, while everyone \nacknowledges that horseback riding is a high-risk activity, there are \nserious issues related to equestrian sports that can and should be \naddressed.\n  I first became aware of the problem of equestrian helmets when Kemi \nO'Donnell, a constituent of mine in Connecticut, called by office to \nrelate her family's tragic experience. The story she shared opened my \neyes to the danger posed by certain equestrian helmets. In 1998 Kemi's \ndaughter, Christen O'Donnell, was a young 12-year-old resident of \nDarien, CT, and a 7th-grader at New Canaan Country School. Active and \nsporty, Christen was a talented intermediate rider who had 5 years or \nriding experience under her belt when she mounted her horse on the \nmorning of August 11. As always, Christen wore a helmet and was \naccompanied by here trainer when she began a slow walk through the \nring. Suddenly, without warning, the horse she was riding shook its \nhead, and Christen was thrown off onto 4 inches of sand. Even though \nher horse was only at a walk, and Christen was wearing a helmet, that \nhelmet offered her little protection, and she sustained severe head \ninjuries as a result of the fall. She was rushed to Stamford hospital \nwhere, despite efforts to save here, she died the next day. The \nmagnitude of their loss has been compounded by the thought that, had \nChristen been wearing a better constructed helmet, it is possible she \ncould have survived this accident.\n  My colleagues may be shocked to learn, as Christen's parents were, \nthat there are no government standards in existence for the \nmanufacturing of equestrian helmets. Some helmets are voluntarily \nconstructed to meet strict American Society of Testing and Materials, \nASTM, testing requirements, but the vast majority of helmets sold in \nthe United States offer little or no real protection and are merely \ncosmetic hat, a form of apparel. Frequently, parents of young riders \nlike Christen, and even more mature riders, do not know that they are \nbuying an untested and unapproved item when they purchase a riding \nhelmet. Indeed, most riders believe that when they buy a helmet at the \nstore, they are purchasing a product that meets standards designed to \nprovide real and adequate head protection. Bike helmets are built to \nminimum safety requirements, as are motorcycle helmets.\n  Apparel helmets, like the one worn by Christen, offer little or no \nhead protection, while ASTM-approved helmets are designed to \nsignificantly reduce head injury. The difference in aesthetic design \nbetween the two is minimal, but the underlying support structures of \nthese types of helmet are substantial. ASTM-approved helmets offer a \nhigh degree of head protection, increase the survivability of \nequestrian accidents and, in my view, should be the standard for all \nequestrian helmets.\n  This lack of adequate safety standards in riding helmets is why USA \nEquestrian, (USAEq), one of the largest\n\n[[Page S6129]]\n\nequestrian organizations in the country, recently mandated that ASTM-\napproved helmets must be worn in all USAEq-sanctioned events. While \nthis decision effectively eliminates the danger posed by ``apparel \nhelmets'' at these events, each day many more students ride in lessons \nand in private shows that are not USAEq-sanctioned. For their safety, I \nbelieve that Congress should establish minimum safety standards for all \nequestrian helmets sold in the United States, so that all riders can \nobtain headgear that offers actual protection against head injury. This \nnot an unprecedented suggestion. As I stated before, Congress has \nalready acted to similarly ensure the safety of bike helmets. The \nlegislation that I and Senator Chafee introduce in Christen's memory \ntoday is modeled on this successful bike helmet law and would go a long \nway toward reducing the mortality of equestrian accidents.\n\n  The Christen O'Donnell Equestrian Helmet Safety Act would require \nthat the Consumer Product Safety Commission establish minimum \nrequirements, based on the already proven ASTM standard, for all \nequestrian helmets in the United States. Thus, there would be a uniform \nstandard for all equestrain helmets, and riders could be confident that \nthe helmet they buy offers real head protection. Let me be clear. This \nmodest legislation does not mandate that riders wear helmets. That is a \nmatter better left to individual States. But, it would take a \nsignificant step toward improving the survivability of equestrian \naccidents and would bring the United States in line with other \nindustrialized countries with sizable riding populations. Countries \nlike Australia and New Zealand have enacted similar helmet safety \nlegislation, and the European Union has set standards to make sure that \nhelmets for equestrian activities meet continental standards. It is \ntime for the United States to take similar steps.\n  This bill is supported by a wide-ranging coalition of equestrian, \nchild safety, and medical groups. This bill has received the \nendorsement of USA Equestrian, one of the nation's largest equestrian \ngroups, the National SAFEKIDS coalition, an organization dedicated to \npreventing accidental injury to children, and the Brain Trauma \nFoundation, a leading medical group dedicated to preventing and \ntreating brain injury. Further, in the ``Chronicle of the Horse,'' the \ntrade publication for the Masters of Foxhounds Association, the U.S. \nEquestrian Team, the U.S. Pony Clubs, the National Riding Commission, \nthe Foxhound Club of North America, the National Beagle Club, the U.S. \nDressage Foundation, the American Vaulting Association, the North \nAmerican Riding for the Handicapped Association, and the \nIntercollegiate Horse Show Association, an article was published \nendorsing the ASTM rule. Given the wide range of organizations that \nendorse this bill, or have endorsed the ASTM rule, it is clear that \nriders, coaches, and medical professionals alike recognize the need for \na standard, tested helmet design.\n  I would like to draw my colleague's attention to some alarming \nstatistics that further demonstrate the importance and expediency of \nthis bill. Emergency rooms all across America have to deal with an \ninflux of horse-related injuries each year. Nationwide in 1999, an \nestimated 15,000 horse-related emergency department visits were made by \nyouths under 15 years old. Of these injuries, head injuries were by far \nthe most numerous and accounted for around 60 percent of equestrian-\nrelated deaths. These injuries occurred, and continue to occur, at all \nages and at all levels of riding experience. That an inadequately \nprotected fall from a horse can kill is not surprising when you examine \nthe medical statistics. A human skull can be shattered by an impact of \nless than 6.2 miles per hour, while horse can gallop at approximately \n40 miles per hour. A fall from two feet can cause permanent brain \ndamage, and a horse elevates a rider to eight feet or more above the \nground. These statistics make it evident that horseback riding is a \nhigh-risk sport. While all riders acknowledge this fact, reducing the \nrisk of serious injury while horseback riding is attainable through the \nuse of appropriate head protection. We should pass this bill, and pass \nit soon, to ensure that head protection for equestrian events is safe \nand effective.\n  American consumers deserve to be confident that their protective \ngear, should they choose to wear it, offers real protection.

A bill to amend the Black Lung Benefits Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, coalminers in this country have \nrisked their lives and limbs, making enormous sacrifices to fuel our \nnation. We owe them the respect and benefits they have earned. Sadly, \nthese miners' families are being abandoned in their time of greatest \nneed: when they are coping with the devastating loss of a loved one \nfrom black lung disease. Current policy arbitrarily forces some widows \nof black lung victims to wade through bureaucracy to prove and reprove \ntheir spouse's illness, and this simply is not right.\n  The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund was created to assist miners who \nwere terminated prior to 1970, or who worked in mines where no mine \noperator can be assigned health care liabilities. The Black Lung \nBenefits Act, BLBA, was amended in 1981 to strengthen the finances of \nthe Trust Fund, but it made it extremely difficult for those suffering \nfrom black lung to qualify for benefits.\n  Currently, there are two very different standards governing \nentitlement to benefits for the spouses of deceased black lung victims. \nIn the event that a Trust Fund beneficiary died prior to\n\n[[Page S6130]]\n\nJanuary 1, 1982, benefits rightly continue uninterrupted to the \nsurviving spouse. But if the beneficiary died or dies after January 1, \n1982, the surviving spouse must file a new claim to benefits and must \nprove that the miner was already deemed eligible to receive benefits.\n  This issue affects more than 11,000 West Virginia retirees and their \nsurvivors, as well as another 51,000 black lung families across the \ncountry. I have introduced legislation that would begin to rectify the \nfailures of the Black Lung Benefits Act. It is a companion to \nlegislation Representative Rahall introduced in the House. The Black \nLung Benefits Survivors Equity Act of 2002 would give benefits to \nwidows of black lung victims, benefits that these women rightfully \ndeserve.\n  Linda Chapman, one very strong and courageous woman from Spencer, WV, \ntragically lost her husband, Carson, to black lung disease last \nJanuary. On top of this tragedy, she was denied survivor benefits \nsimply because of the BLBA's double standards. But rather than giving \nup, Linda stood up.\n  On behalf of the surviving widows of black lung victims, she walked \nseveral hundred miles from Charleston, WV, to Washington, DC, to \ngenerate public interest and to get the attention of lawmakers as well. \nI applaud Mrs. Chapman's efforts, and was pleased to meet her when she \narrived in Washington.\n  I hope this Senate will act quickly to remedy this problem for Mrs. \nChapman and other black lung widows like her. After all that they have \nendured, these women should not have to fight against bureaucracy \nsimply to obtain the survivors' benefits due them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2685\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to strengthen national security by providing \nwhistleblower protections to certain employees at airports, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. Grassley. Mr. President, I, along with Senator Levin, am pleased \nto introduce a bill, the Airport Employee Whistleblower Protection Act \nof 2002, that will enhance airport and air travel safety. It will do \nthis by protecting all security screeners at all airports from reprisal \nfor blowing the whistle on security violations, not just the select few \nwho are currently protected. As my colleagues know, I have long \nbelieved that a good government is an accountable government, and \nwhistleblower protection laws go a long way toward making government \naccountable.\n  This is particularly true when it involves our nation's security. \nJust recently we saw enlightening disclosures of massive systemic \nproblems at the FBI by a whistleblower, Special Agent Rowley, that will \nno doubt lead to improvements and better security for Americans. \nAlthough Director Mueller has promised Special Agent Rowley that she \nwill not be discriminated against because of her disclosures, \nwhistleblower protection laws do not currently apply to the FBI, a \nproblem that I'm trying to fix. Likewise, whistleblower protection laws \ndo not currently protect many baggage screeners and x-ray technicians \nwho witness security breaches.\n  In the Spring of 2000, Congress passed a law known as Air 21 that \nprovided whistleblower protection to employees and contract employers \nto air carriers. At that time, when baggage screening was usually the \nresponsibility of the airlines, screeners with whistleblower protection \ncould alert their bosses or the Federal Aviation Administration about \nsecurity violations. But that legislation didn't go far enough. That's \nbecause only employees of air carriers were protected from retribution \nunder the law.\n  Under Air 21, security screeners employed by state or municipal \ngovernments, or regional airport authorities, had to rely on a \npatchwork of state whistleblower protection laws, or just the good \nsense of their employers, when they decided to blow the whistle on \nsecurity breaches.\n  Worse still, when Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation \nSecurity Act last Fall, it specifically denied whistleblower protection \nto the new Federal baggage screeners. During the debates, I called for \nwhistleblower protection for airport screeners because the best way to \nmake an effective workforce is by creating an accountable government. \nBut when Congress federalized the baggage screeners, it took Federal \nscreeners out of the Air 21 air carrier whistleblower protections, and \ncreated a class of Federal contractors that perform security screening \nservices, but are not covered by any whistleblower protections.\n  This legislation will fix these problems. First, the bill will ensure \nthat until airport security screener personnel are fully federalized, \nall airport security screeners are given whistleblower protection, \nregardless of whether they're employed by air carriers, state or local \ngovernments, regional airport authorities, or contractors. Second, the \nbill will close the loophole in the law so that Federal baggage \nscreeners receive protection under the same Whistleblower Protection \nAct that protects many other Federal employees, and so that contractors \nfor the Federal government also will get whistleblower protection.\n  I note that the Secretary of the Department of Transportation has \ntaken a good step toward supplying whistleblower protection to Federal \nscreeners by signing a memorandum of understanding with the Office of \nSpecial Counsel, the office that enforces the Whistleblower Protection \nAct. The idea is that the OSC will agree to investigate cases of \nalleged whistleblower retaliation by the Transportation Safety \nAdministration. But this agreement is not enough because it does not \nafford a right of appeal, so the TSA is free to ignore any OSC \nrecommendation. Further, it does not provide whistleblower protection \nfor contract screeners. Finally, unlike legislation, the agreement can \nbe cancelled by either the TSA or the OSC on 90 day's notice. So the \nadministration's agreement to provide whistleblower protection, though \nan admirable effort, is just not enough. We need statutory \nwhistleblower protection for airport screeners.\n  In all my years of doing oversight, I have found that it's pretty \nrare for an agency to identify and fix its own problems, especially \nsecurity problems. Most of the time, it takes a whistleblower or an \nInspector General or a Congressional investigation to expose and fix \nsecurity problems.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support the Airport Employee \nWhistleblower Protection Act of 2002 to improve security at our \nnation's airports. Let's close the loophole and give all security \nscreeners whistleblower protection so that our nation's aviation system \nis more safe and secure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By. Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2687. A bill to facilitate the extension of the Alaska Railroad \nfor national defense purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to \nfacilitate the construction of national defense facilities in Alaska.\n  It is a given that the best way to move very large quantities of bulk \ngoods between points is by sea or by train. This bill will allow the \nextension of the Alaska Railroad from Eielson Air Force Base, just \nsouth of Fairbanks, AK, to a point near the location on Fort Greely, AK \nthat has been chosen for the national missile defense system. This will \nsignificantly reduce the cost of shipping construction materials and \noperational supplies to the site, and incidentally allow a considerable \nsavings in the cost of wear and tear on the highway system that would \notherwise be the only possible route for those goods.\n\n[[Page S6131]]\n\n  The extension will allow materials to be shipped to Alaska by sea to \nbe transferred to the railroad and carried all the way to the vicinity \nof the defense project by rail. This is preferential to being loaded, \nunloaded, loaded on long-distance trucks, unloaded, and loaded again \nwhen they move to the actual work site.\n  The bill provides for the Secretary of the Interior, working with \nother agencies as appropriate and necessary, to identify and acquire \nall of the lands necessary for this modest rail line extension of \napproximately 80 miles. Where those lands are held by other entities, \nthere will be a fair exchange for lands held elsewhere. Once the entire \nroute has been acquired, the lands will be transferred to the Alaska \nRailroad under the same circumstances that have been used previously \nunder the Alaska Railroad Transfer Act.\n  This is a very important step toward ensuring the most economical \npossible approach to this major project, and I urge my colleagues \nsupport.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2687\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This act may be cited as the ``National Defense Rail \n     Connection Act of 2002.\"\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) A comprehensive rail transportation network is a key \n     element of an integrated transportation system for the North \n     American continent, and federal leadership is required to \n     address the needs of a reliable, safe, and secure rail \n     network, and to connect all areas of the United States for \n     national defense and economic development, as previously done \n     for the interstate highway system, the Federal aviation \n     network, and the transcontinental railroad;\n       (b) The creation and use of joint use corridors for rail \n     transportation, fiber optics, pipelines, and utilities are an \n     efficient and appropriate approach to optimizing the nation's \n     interconnectivity and national security;\n       (c) Government assistance and encouragement in the \n     development of the transcontinental rail system successfully \n     led to the growth of economically strong and socially stable \n     communities throughout the western United States;\n       (d) Government assistance and encouragement in the \n     development of the Alaska Railroad between Seward, Alaska and \n     Fairbanks, Alaska successfully led to the growth of \n     economically strong and socially stable communities along the \n     route, which today provide homes for over 70% of Alaska's \n     total population;\n       (e) While Alaska and the remainder of the continental \n     United States has been connected by highway and air \n     transportation, no rail connection exists despite the fact \n     that Alaska is accessible by land routes and is a logical \n     destination for the North American rail system:\n       (f) Rail transportation in otherwise isolated areas is an \n     appropriate means of providing controlled access, reducing \n     overall impacts to environmentally sensitive areas over other \n     methods of land-based access;\n       (g) Because Congress originally authorized 1,000 miles of \n     rail line to be built in Alaska, and because the system today \n     covers only approximately half that distance, substantially \n     limiting its beneficial effect on the economy of Alaska and \n     the nation, it is appropriate to support the expansion of the \n     Alaska system to ensure the originally planned benefits are \n     achieved;\n       (h) Alaska has an abundance of natural resources, both \n     material and aesthetic, access to which would significantly \n     increase Alaska's contribution to the national economy;\n       (i) Alaska contains many key national defense \n     installations, including sites chosen for the construction of \n     the first phase of the National Missile Defense system, the \n     cost of which could be significantly reduced if rail \n     transportation were available for the movement of materials \n     necessary for construction and for the secure movement of \n     launch vehicles, fuel and other operational supplies;\n       (j) The 106th Congress recognized the potential benefits of \n     establishing a rail connection to Alaska by enacting \n     legislation to authorize a U.S. -Canada bilateral commission \n     to study the feasibility of linking the rail system in Alaska \n     to the nearest appropriate point in Canada of the North \n     American rail network; and\n       (k) In support of pending bilateral activities between the \n     United States and Canada, it is appropriate for the United \n     States to undertake activities relating to elements within \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. IDENTIFICATION OF NATIONAL DEFENSE RAILROAD-UTILITY \n                   CORRIDOR.\n\n       (a) Within one year from the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Transportation, the State of Alaska and the \n     Alaska Railroad Corporation, shall identify a proposed \n     national defense railroad-utility corridor linking the \n     existing corridor of the Alaska Railroad to the vicinity of \n     the proposed National Missile Defense facilities at Fort \n     Greely, Alaska. The corridor shall be at least 500 feet wide \n     and shall also identify land for such terminals, stations, \n     maintenance facilities, switching yards, and material sites \n     as are considered necessary.\n       (b) The identification of the corridor under paragraph (a) \n     shall include information providing a complete legal \n     description for and noting the current ownership of the \n     proposed corridor and associated land.\n       (c) In identifying the corridor under paragraph (a), the \n     Secretary shall consider, at a minimum, the following \n     factors:\n       (a) The proximity of national defense installations and \n     national defense considerations;\n       (2) The location of and access to natural resources that \n     could contribute to economic development of the region;\n       (3) Grade and alignment standards that are commensurate \n     with rail and utility construction standards and that \n     minimize the prospect of at-grade railroad and highway \n     crossings;\n       (4) Availability of construction materials;\n       (5) Safety;\n       (6) Effects on and service to adjacent communities and \n     potential intermodal transportation connections;\n       (7) Environmental concerns;\n       (8) Use of public land to the maximum degree possible;\n       (9) Minimization of probable construction costs;\n       (10) An estimate of probable construction costs and methods \n     of financing such costs through a combination of private, \n     state, and federal sources; and\n       (11) Appropriate utility elements for the corridor, \n     including but not limited to petroleum product pipelines, \n     fiber-optic telecommunication facilities, and electrical \n     power transmission lines, and\n       (12) Prior and established traditional uses.\n       (d) the Secretary may, as part of the corridor \n     identification, include issues related to the further \n     extension of such corridor to a connection with the nearest \n     appropriate terminus of the North American rail network in \n     Canada.\n\n     SEC. 4. NEGOTIATION AND LAND TRANSFER.\n\n       (a) The Secretary of the Interior shall--\n       (1) upon completion of the corridor identification in Sec. \n     3, negotiate the acquisition of any lands in the corridor \n     which are not federally owned through an exchange for lands \n     of equal or greater value held by the federal government \n     elsewhere in Alaska; and\n       (2) upon completion of the acquisition of lands under \n     paragraph (1), the Secretary shall convey to the Alaska \n     Railroad Corporation, subject to valid existing rights, title \n     to the lands identified under Section 3 as necessary to \n     complete the national defense railroad-utility corridor, on \n     condition that the Alaska Railroad Corporation construct in \n     the corridor an extension of the railroad system to the \n     vicinity of the proposed national missile defense \n     installation at Fort Greely, Alaska, together with such other \n     utilities, including but not limited to fiber-optic \n     transmission lines and electrical transmission lines, as it \n     considers necessary and appropriate. The Federal interest \n     in lands conveyed to the Alaska Railroad Corporation under \n     this Act shall be the same as in lands conveyed pursuant \n     to the Alaska Railroad Transfer Act (45 USC 1201 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 5. APPLICABILITY OF OTHER LAWS.\n\n       Actions authorized in this Act shall proceed immediately \n     and to conclusion not withstanding the land-use planning \n     provisions of Section 202 of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976, P.L. 94-579.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6131-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6131-S6132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 292--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Warner, \nMr. Reid, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Dewine, Mr. McCain, Mr. Akaka, \nMr. Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, \nMr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \nBurns, Mr. Campbell, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Carper, Mr. \nChafee, Mr. Cleland, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. \nConrad, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Craig, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \nDomenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Ensign, Mr. \nFeingold, Mrs. Feinstein Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Frist, Mr. Graham, Mr. \nGramm, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \nHelms, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Hutchinson, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nInouye, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln Mr. Lugar, Mr. \nMcConnell, Ms. Mikulski Mr. Miller, Mr. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray Mr. \nNelson\n\n[[Page S6132]]\n\nof Florida, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Reed, Mr. Roberts, \nMr. Rockefeller, Mr. Santorium, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer,  Mr. \nSessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Smith of Oregon, \nMs. Snowe Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \nThompson, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Wellstone, \nand Mr. Wyden) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 124\n\n       Whereas the Eighth Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution prohibits ``cruel and unusual punishments'' and \n     torture is prohibited by law throughout the United States \n     without exception;\n       Whereas the prohibition against torture in international \n     agreements is absolute, unqualified, and non-derogable under \n     any circumstance, even during a state of war or national \n     emergency;\n       Whereas an important component of the concept of \n     comprehensive security in a free society is the fundamental \n     service provided by law enforcement personnel to protect the \n     basic human rights of individuals in society;\n       Whereas individuals require and deserve protection by law \n     enforcement personnel and need the confidence in knowing that \n     such personnel are not themselves agents of torture or other \n     forms of cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or \n     punishment, including extortion or other unlawful acts;\n       Whereas individuals who are incarcerated should be treated \n     with respect in accordance with the inherent dignity of the \n     human person;\n       Whereas there is a growing commitment by governments to \n     eradicate torture and other forms of cruel, inhumane, or \n     degrading treatment or punishment, to provide in law and \n     practice procedural and substantive safeguards and remedies \n     to combat such practices, to assist the victims of such \n     practices, and to cooperate with relevant international \n     organizations and nongovernmental organizations with the goal \n     of eradicating such practices;\n       Whereas torture and other forms of cruel, inhumane, or \n     degrading treatment or punishment continues in many countries \n     despite international commitments to take effective \n     legislative, administrative, judicial and other measures to \n     prevent and punish such practices;\n       Whereas the rape of prisoners by prison officials or other \n     prisoners, tolerated for the purpose of intimidation and \n     abuse, is a particularly egregious form of torture;\n       Whereas incommunicado detention facilitates the use of \n     torture and other forms of cruel, inhumane, or degrading \n     treatment or punishment, and may constitute, in and of \n     itself, a form of such practices;\n       Whereas the use of racial profiling to stop, search, \n     investigate, arrest, or convict an individual who is a \n     minority severely erodes the confidence of a society in law \n     enforcement personnel and may make minorities especially \n     vulnerable to torture and other forms of cruel, inhumane, or \n     degrading treatment or punishment;\n       Whereas the use of confessions and other evidence obtained \n     through torture or other forms of cruel, inhumane, or \n     degrading treatment or punishment in legal proceedings runs \n     counter to efforts to eradicate such practices;\n       Whereas more than 500,000 individuals who are survivors of \n     torture live in the United States;\n       Whereas the victims of torture and other forms of cruel, \n     inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment and their \n     families often suffer devastating effects and therefore \n     require extensive medical and psychological treatment;\n       Whereas medical personnel and torture treatment centers \n     play a critical role in the identification, treatment, and \n     rehabilitation of victims of torture and other forms of \n     cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment; and\n       Whereas each year the United Nations designates June 26 as \n     an International Day in Support of Victims of Torture: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) condemns the use of torture and other forms of cruel, \n     inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment in the United \n     States and other countries;\n       (2) recognizes the United Nations International Day in \n     Support of the Victims of Torture and expresses support for \n     all victims of torture and other forms of cruel, inhumane, or \n     degrading treatment or punishment who are struggling to \n     overcome the physical scars and psychological effects of such \n     practices;\n       (3) encourages the training of law enforcement personnel \n     and others who are involved in the custody, interrogation, or \n     treatment of any individual who is arrested, detained, or \n     imprisoned, in the prevention of torture and other forms of \n     cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment, in \n     order to reduce and eradicate such practices; and\n       (4) encourages the Secretary of State to seek, at relevant \n     international fora, the adoption of a commitment--\n       (A) to treat confessions and other evidence obtained \n     through torture or other forms of cruel, inhumane, or \n     degrading treatment or punishment, as inadmissible in any \n     legal proceeding; and\n       (B) to prohibit, in law and in practice, incommunicado \n     detention.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am joined by Senators Dodd, Feingold, \nClinton, and Wellstone in introducing today a resolution condemning the \nuse of torture and other forms of cruel, inhumane, or degrading \ntreatment or punishment in the United States and other countries, and \nexpressing support for the victims of torture. An identical version is \nbeing introduced by Congressman Christopher H. Smith, who co-chairs the \nCommission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which I am privileged \nto chair.\n  Torture is prohibited by a raft of international agreements, \nincluding documents of the 55-nation Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe. It remains, however, a serious problem in many \ncountries. In the worst cases, torture occurs not merely from rogue \nelements in the police or a lack of appropriate training among law \nenforcement personnel, but is systematically used by the controlling \nregime to target political opposition members; racial, ethnic, \nlinguistic or religious minorities; and others.\n  In some countries, medical professionals who treat the victims of \ntorture have become, themselves, victims of torture in government's \nefforts to document this abuse and to hold perpetrators accountable. \nThe U.S. Congress can continue to play a leadership role by signaling \nour unwavering condemnation of such egregious practices.\n  Torture is, in effect, prohibited by several articles of the U.S. \nConstitution. Nevertheless, some commentators have suggested that \ntorture might be an acceptable tool in the war on terrorism. I believe \nwe should answer that proposition with a resounding ``no''. To repeat: \ntorture is unconstitutional. Moreover, as many trained law enforcement \nofficials note, it is also a lousy way to get reliable information. \nPeople subjected to torture will often say anything to end the torture. \nFinally, it makes no sense to wage war to defend our great democracy \nand use methods that denigrate the very values we seek to protect. \nTorture is unacceptable, period.\n\n[[Page S6133]]\n\n  The resolution I am introducing today underscores that message. It \nrecognizes the United Nations International Day in Support of the \nVictims of Torture, marked each June 26th, and encourages the training \nof law enforcement personnel. Experts estimate that more than 500,000 \nindividuals who are survivors of torture live in the United States. \nVictims of torture and other forms of cruel, inhumane, or degrading \ntreatment or punishment and their families often suffer devastating \neffects and therefore require extensive medical and psychological \ntreatment.\n  I am pleased to note the contribution of the Rocky Mountain Survivors \nCenter, located in Denver, CO, in meeting the needs of torture \nsurvivors living in Colorado. The Rocky Mountain Center and similar \ntorture treatment centers located elsewhere in the United States play a \ncritical role in the identification, treatment, and rehabilitation of \nvictims of torture and deserve our continued support.\n  As we mark the United Nations International Day in Support of the \nVictims of Torture, I urge my colleagues to declare their opposition to \ntorture and solidarity with torture survivors by lending their support \nto this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/26/senate-section/article/S6133-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6133-S6135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3990.

Security at Russian nuclear weapon \n     storage sites is insufficient, and tactical nuclear warheads \n     are more vulnerable to terrorist or rogue state acquisition \n     due to their smaller size, greater portability, and greater \n     numbers compared to Russian strategic nuclear weapons.\n       (3) Russia's tactical nuclear warheads were not covered by \n     the START treaties or the recent Moscow Treaty. Russia is not \n     legally bound to reduce its tactical nuclear stockpile and \n     the United States has no inspection rights regarding Russia's \n     tactical nuclear arsenal.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--\n       (1) One of the most likely nuclear weapons attack scenarios \n     against the United States would involve detonation of a \n     stolen Russian tactical nuclear warhead smuggled into the \n     country.\n       (2) It is a top national security priority of the United \n     States to accelerate efforts to account for, secure, and \n     reduce Russia's stockpile of tactical nuclear warheads and \n     associated fissile material.\n       (3) This imminent threat warrants a special non-\n     proliferation initiative.\n       (c) Report.--\n       Not later than 30 days after enaction of this act, the \n     President shall report to Congress on efforts to reduce the \n     particular threats associated with Russia's tactical nuclear \n     arsenal and the outlines of a special initiative related to \n     reducing the threat from Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 4055.

RUSSIAN TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, in addition \n     to rogue states, are known to be working to acquire weapons \n     of mass destruction, and particularly nuclear warheads.\n       (2) The largest and least secure potential source of \n     nuclear warheads for terrorists or rogue states is Russia's \n     arsenal of non-strategic or ``tactical'' nuclear warheads, \n     which according to unclassified estimates numbers from 7,000 \n     to 12,000 warheads. Security at Russian nuclear weapon \n     storage sites is insufficient, and tactical nuclear warheads \n     are more vulnerable to terrorist or rogue state acquisition \n     due to their smaller size, greater portability, and greater \n     numbers compared to Russian strategic nuclear weapons.\n       (3) Russia's tactical nuclear warheads were not covered by \n     the START treaties or the recent Moscow Treaty. Russia is not \n     legally bound to reduce its tactical nuclear stockpile and \n     the United States has no inspection rights regarding Russia's \n     tactical nuclear arsenal.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--\n       (1) One of the most likely nuclear weapon attack scenarios \n     against the United States would involve detonation of a \n     stolen Russian tactical nuclear warhead smuggled into the \n     country.\n       (2) It is a top national security priority of the United \n     States to accelerate efforts to account for, secure, and \n     reduce Russia's stockpile of tactical nuclear warheads and \n     associated fissile material.\n       (3) This imminent threat warrants a special non-\n     proliferation initiative.\n       (c) Report.--\n       Not later than 30 days after enactment of this act, the \n     President shall report to Congress on efforts to reduce the \n     particular threats associated with Russia's tactical nuclear \n     arsenal and the outlines of a special initiative related to \n     reducing the threat from Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 4134.

This health education should \n     also include basic emergency lifesaving skills.\n       (6) Incorporating these lifesaving training programs into \n     the health curriculum of elementary and secondary schools \n     will give school children these skills.\n       (7) Project Automatic Defibrillation in Adam's Memory \n     (ADAM) has been successful in fostering awareness of the \n     potential for cardiac arrest in the childhood and adolescent \n     population, encouraging improvement of screening procedures, \n     and facilitating the training of high school staff and \n     students in CPR and the use of automatic external \n     defibrillators (referred to in this Act as ``AED'').\n\n     SEC. 3.
