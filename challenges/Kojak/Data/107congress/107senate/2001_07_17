Madam President, today the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the Bankruptcy Reform Act. The prior agreement called \nfor 3 hours of debate prior to a rollcall vote on cloture of a \nsubstitute amendment at approximately 12 o'clock today. There will be a \nrecess for the weekly party conferences from 12:30 to 2:15. We expect \nto return then to the Energy and Water Appropriations Act today, with \nrollcall votes on amendments expected throughout the afternoon.\n  Last week the Senate confirmed 53 nominations. I don't know that \nthere has been a week in recent times where we have accomplished that \nmuch with regard to nominations. I expect to continue that level of \nprogress this week. There are currently 10 nominations on the Executive \nCalendar. Our caucus is prepared to move immediately on 8 of those 10. \nOne of the remaining two, Mr. Graham, already has a time agreement \nregarding his consideration. I expect to be able to dispose of his \nnomination between the energy and water appropriations bill, which we \nwill resume after the bankruptcy bill is sent to conference, and the \nTransportation appropriations bill. I also expect to dispose of the \nFerguson nomination at that time.\n  The legislative branch appropriations bill is on the calendar. The \ncommittee staff has informed us that they know of no amendments. So we \nhope to be able to complete action on that bill as well this week.\n  If we can accomplish these items, including the Transportation bill, \nby the close of business on Thursday, then we will not have votes this \nFriday. If not, of course, we will then be on the bill on Friday with \nvotes possible throughout the day.\n  That is the plan for the week. We will do bankruptcy this morning, \nenergy and water this afternoon for whatever length of time it takes. \nTomorrow we will do the Graham nomination, then the Transportation and \nlegislative appropriations bills.\n  This will be a busy week but, I think, a productive week. Hopefully, \nwe can accomplish a good deal by continuing to work together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7721-7", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7721-S7735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    BANKRUPTCY ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2001\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of H.R. 333, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 333) to amend title 11, United States Code, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Leahy/Hatch/Grassley amendment No. 974, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I yield myself such time as I need \nfrom the time allotted to Senator Hatch.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support the \ncloture motion to substitute the language of S. 420 to H.R. 333, the \nHouse bankruptcy bill.\n  As we all know, the substitute amendment to the House bill is the \ntext of the bill that passed the Senate on March 15 by an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 83-15. This bill went through \nhearings and markups in Judiciary, went through an extensive amendment \nprocess on the floor, so no one can dispute that this is a bipartisan \nbill that has gone through a bipartisan process in the Senate.\n  The bill has gone through the regular order and we should proceed to \nconference under the regular order.\n  There are a lot of reports out there that have distorted the truth \nabout this bill. Many groups have said this bill is very controversial. \nThat is not the case. I first started working on bankruptcy reform back \nin the 1990s, when Senator Heflin, now retired, and I set up a \nBankruptcy Review Commission to study the bankruptcy system. This \ncommission was not made up of any Members of the Congress. It was made \nup of experts in the area of bankruptcy to study the issue so that what \nwe did in this Chamber, with their recommendations, would be done \nright.\n  The debate that set up the Bankruptcy Review Commission was prompted \nby small business and other small proprietors that had problems with \nindividuals who were reneging on their debts but then turned out, it \nseemed, to have the ability to pay their bills. The impact on these \nsmall businesses, obviously, was significant: Prices had to be raised \nfor items; maybe some businesses went out of business. When that \nhappens, employees are laid off. There is no sense having this economic \ncondition, not because we want to deny people a fresh start, because it \nhas been a policy of our bankruptcy laws to let people have a fresh \nstart when they are in financial straits through no fault of their \nown--natural disaster, high medical bills, et cetera--but when people \nhave the ability to repay, then they should not get off scot-free and \ncause employees of businesses that go out of business to lose jobs.\n  We want to be fair to everybody. You can't be fair to businesses and \nemployees that lose their businesses and jobs when somebody who has the \nability to pay bills gets off without paying those bills.\n  I was interested in what was going on in the bankruptcy system in the \nearly 1990s when we set up this commission because of my concern about \nfundamental fairness.\n  Why should people get out of repaying their debts if they can pay \nthem? The issue is not new. In fact, the issue of bankruptcy and \npersonal responsibility has been debated since the 1930s, and Congress \nhas made numerous attempts to decrease the moral stigma associated with \nbankruptcy. As in previous versions of the bankruptcy bill, the \nlanguage in the substitute amendment is part of an effort to ensure \nthat bankruptcy is reserved for those who truly need it, and that \npersons with the means to repay their debts should assume their \nresponsibilities.\n  Some say this bill is unfair and unbalanced because it makes it \nharder for normal people to avail themselves of bankruptcy. This is \njust not true either.\n  First, the bankruptcy bill applies to everyone, rich and poor, and \nthe premise behind the bill--that you should pay your debts if you \ncan--does not discriminate against poor people. In fact, there is a \nsafe harbor provision for lower income people. The bill specifically \nexempts people who earn less than the median income for their State. \nAnd for those consumers to which the bill does apply, the means test \nthat is set forth in the bill is flexible, as it should be. It takes \ninto account the reasonable expenses of a debtor as applicable under \nstandards not set by me but issued by the IRS for the area in which the \ndebtor resides. The means test permits every person to deduct 100 \npercent of medical expenses. The means test permits every person to \ndeduct expenses for the support and care of elderly parents, \ngrandparents, and disabled children. In addition, the means test would \npermit battered women to deduct domestic violence expenses and protects \ntheir privacy. Furthermore, the means test allows every consumer to \nshow ``special circumstances'' to avoid a repayment plan, just in case \nthere is something within this formula that just doesn't fit every \nparticular family in America.\n  Let me again remind people about the enhanced consumer protections \nand credit card disclosures that are contained in the bill. The \nbankruptcy bill requires credit card companies to provide key \ninformation about how much a customer owes on his credit card, as well \nas how long it is going to take to pay off the balance by making just a \nminimum payment. We do that by requiring that the credit card companies \nset up a toll-free number for consumers to get information on their \nspecific credit card balances.\n  The bill prohibits deceptive advertising of low introductory rates. \nThe bill provides for penalties on creditors who refuse to renegotiate \nreasonable payment schedules outside of bankruptcy. The bill \nstrengthens enforcement against abusive creditors and increases \npenalties for predatory debt collection practices. The bill also \nincludes credit counseling programs to help avoid and break the cycle \nof indebtedness.\n  Let me remind colleagues about the provisions contained in this bill \nthat will help women and children because there has been a dramatic \nchange in the direction of this legislation when it was introduced \nthree Congresses ago until it now has reached the point where it is \ntoday. The bill before us makes family support obligations the first \npriority in bankruptcy. The bill makes staying current on child support \na condition of discharge. The bill gives parents and State child \nsupport enforcement collection agencies notice when a debtor who owes \nchild support or alimony files for bankruptcy. It also requires \nbankruptcy trustees to notify child support creditors of their right to \nuse State support child support enforcement agencies to collect \noutstanding amounts due. The bill also permits battered women to deduct \ndomestic violence expenses and protects their privacy in bankruptcy.\n\n  I also remind colleagues that we adopted a number of amendments in \nthe Judiciary Committee and in this Chamber that make this a bipartisan \nbill. It started out as a bipartisan bill anyway, through the help of \nSenator Torricelli of New Jersey. If I am correct, I believe we adopted \nsomething on the order of 8 amendments in the Judiciary Committee and \n30 amendments on the floor of the Senate. For example, the Senate \nadopted an amendment that, for the first time, would protect consumer \nprivacy when businesses go into bankruptcy. Specifically, the Senate \nagreed that personally identifiable information given by a consumer to \na business debtor in bankruptcy should have privacy protections. The \nSenate also created a consumer privacy ombudsman in the bankruptcy \ncourt.\n  The Senate agreed to amendments that expand farmer eligibility in \nbankruptcy and facilitate postbankruptcy proceedings for farmers. The \nlist goes on. While I did not agree with all of the amendments adopted, \nthe Senate went through a lengthy and fair process. That is why it got \nan 83-15 vote. The whole process doesn't need to be repeated now. Some \nof those 15 who voted against it won't give up, and that is their right \nunder the Senate rules. But, eventually, an overwhelming majority in \nthe Senate wins out. Maybe all the time a majority in the Senate \ndoesn't win out, but eventually an overwhelming majority in the Senate \nwins out. And if it doesn't, it should. This is one of those times. So \nwe need to go to conference now and iron out the differences with the \nHouse.\n  I am asking my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. We need \nto send a message that people cannot use bankruptcy as a financial tool \nor an easy way out of paying their debt. The bill promotes responsible \nborrowing and provides financial education to financially troubled \nconsumers. It also provides some of the more proconsumer provisions \nrelative to credit card companies in years. We have not dealt with \nthese issues in years. This bill deals with it and it should. We all \nrecognize that the proliferation of advertising for\n\n[[Page S7723]]\n\ncredit cards and the junk mail we get is part of the cause that we have \npeople in bankruptcy.\n  It also creates new protections for patients when hospitals and \nnursing homes declare bankruptcy. The bill makes permanent chapter 12 \nbankruptcy for family farmers and lessens the capital gains tax burden \non financially strapped farmers who declare bankruptcy. This is a bill \nthat the Senate passed with this overwhelming margin, which my \ncolleagues probably get tired of my mentioning so many times, but it \nwas 83-15. So I think it is just common sense. Maybe common sense \ndoesn't rule around this institution enough, but it is common sense \nthat we move on to the next step. I urge my colleagues to vote in \nsupport of the cloture and in support of the Leahy-Hatch-Grassley \nsubstitute amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and since there are no other Members present, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum and that it be charged to Senator \nWellstone. I have been advised by staff that that is the proper thing \nto do.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, my understanding is that there may be \na number of other Senators who are coming to the floor to speak in \nopposition to the bankruptcy bill. Senator Durbin may try to come down. \nSo Senator Durbin and others know, when they come I will simply break \nmy remarks and others can speak at their convenience.\n  At the beginning of last week, the majority leader moved to proceed \nto the bill and I objected. Then we had a cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed. In the time I had, I implored, called upon, begged the Senate \nto step back from the brink and to decline to go to conference with the \nHouse on this so-called bankruptcy reform. I believe we would be making \na grave mistake.\n  I am trying to figure out a way not to repeat all the arguments I \nmade last week. I will simply say I think this is a measure we are \ngoing to deeply regret. There are a lot of people--Elizabeth Warren \ncomes to mind, law professor at Harvard--who have done some very \nimportant scholarship at Harvard in this area. I don't know that I can \nthink of a single law professor who has argued in favor of this bill. \nMaybe there is someone somewhere. The opinion of the scholars in the \nfield, the opinion of people who work in the field, is almost unanimous \nthat this is a huge mistake.\n  We need to understand that bankruptcy is something most families do \nnot think they will ever need. They do not think they will ever need to \nfile for bankruptcy. But it is really a safety net, not just for low-\nincome families but for middle-income families as well.\n  Fifty percent of the people who file for bankruptcy in our country \ntoday do it because of a medical bill. You have a double whammy. It is \nnot just the situation where you have the expense of the medical bills \nbut also it may be that, because of the illness or injury, you yourself \nare not able to work so you are hit both ways, or it might be your \nchild's medical bill, but also you may not be able to bring in the \nincome because you are not able to go to work because you need to be at \nhome taking care of your child. That is 50 percent of the people. We \nare not talking about deadbeats.\n\n  Frankly, most of the rest of the cases can be explained--it should \nnot surprise anybody--by loss of job or divorce. These are the major \nexplanatory variables why people file for bankruptcy, file for chapter \n7. The irony of it--and I tried to make this argument last week as \nwell--is that for a long time my colleagues were facing a problem that \ndid not exist; that is to say, they were talking about all the abuse \nand all the ways in which people were gaming the system in American \nbankruptcy, but they came out with a record that said that is 3 percent \nof the debt. So let's come out with legislation that deals with the 3 \npercent, but let's not have legislation where people who find \nthemselves in terrible economic circumstances no longer are able to \nrebuild their lives, all because of a small number of people who abuse \nthe system.\n  Moreover, actually the bankruptcies were going down. So quite to the \ncontrary of the claim we had this rash of bankruptcies and people no \nlonger felt any stigma or shame and people were no longer responsible, \nnone of it really held up very well if you closely examined the \narguments.\n  Now what we have, in case anybody has not noticed, is an economy that \nis leveling off with a turn downward. It is not the boom economy we saw \nwhile the Presiding Officer's husband, President Clinton, was President \nof the United States of America. It is a different economy now. There \nare going to be more people who will lose their jobs and more people \nwho will be faced with these difficult economic circumstances through \nno fault of their own. We are going to make it well nigh impossible for \nthem to rebuild their lives.\n  Madam President, I argued last week that we are hardly talking about \ndeadbeats. This bill assumes people who file for chapter 7 are \ndeadbeats and they are not. The means test aside, there are 15 \nprovisions in the House and Senate-passed bills that will affect all \ndebtors, regardless of their income--15 provisions. The means test will \nnot protect them. The safe harbor will not protect them. These \nprovisions are going to make bankruptcy relief more complicated, more \nexpensive, and therefore harder to achieve for debtors--again, \nregardless of income. That means they will also fall the hardest, in \nterms of the people who will be most affected by this legislation, on \nlow- and moderate-income debtors.\n  The irony is that those who advocate for this bill justify it by \narguing that we need to go after the wealthy deadbeats. But if the cost \nof filing for bankruptcy doubles, which is exactly what it does in this \nbill, who gets hurt the most? A middle-income family who had to save \nfor 6 months, under current law, to pay for an attorney and for filing \nfees, or a multimillionaire like the ones the proponents cite in this \nstatement? It just makes no sense.\n  There will be no problem for millionaires who are gaming the system. \nThey are not the people who get hurt by this legislation. This \nlegislation is the most harsh on the most vulnerable.\n  I also argued and tried to make the case that this couldn't be a \nworse time to do this in terms of where the economy is headed.\n  So while the bill would be terrible for consumers and for regular \nworking-class families even in the best of times, its effects will be \nall the more devastating now that we have a weakening economy.\n  Colleagues, you are going to regret this.\n  It boggles the mind that at a time when Americans are most \neconomically vulnerable and when they are most in need for protection \nfrom financial disaster we would eviscerate the major fiscal safety net \nin our society for the middle class. It is the height of insanity that \nwe would be contemplating doing what we are doing right now given what \nis happening to this economy.\n  Colleagues, I couldn't support this legislation in the best of times. \nEven in the sunniest of economic circumstances, there are many families \nwho are down on their luck and who are sent to the sidelines. \nBankruptcy relief lets these families rebuild their lives again. It is \na little bit like ``there but for the grace of God go I.''\n  I think Time magazine had a series which was just a blistering attack \non this bill. They did it in two ways. They did it, first of all, by \ntalking about what this legislation means in times--which quite often \non the floor of the Senate we don't make those connections as we \nshould--to a lot of these families and what happened to these families \nbecause of their economic circumstances. They did not ask that their \nchild be stricken by a terrible illness. They did not ask for the \nphysical pain. They did not ask for the economic pain. But we are going \nto make it harder for them to rebuild their lives. People do not ask to \nbe laid off work. People do not ask that their families be shredded \nbecause there is a divorce. You wish it would not have to happen. But \nit does happen. Sometimes\n\n[[Page S7724]]\n\nsomeone is at fault and sometimes no one is at fault, but it happens.\n  It is usually the woman who is the one taking care of the children, \nand she doesn't have the income she once had. These are the kinds of \ncitizens who file for bankruptcy relief. That is why every labor \norganization, civil rights, women's, and consumer organizations in the \ncountry and more--religious organizations--oppose this legislation.\n  This legislation is a testimony to the absolutely sickening power of \nthe financial services industry in Congress. We wouldn't be doing this \notherwise.\n  I did not say this is a one-to-one correlation. Anyone can play the \ngame that people vote this way because they are in the pockets of the \nfinancial services. That is not the argument that I make. Everybody can \nsay that about everybody who votes in the Senate on every issue.\n  What I am saying is not at the personal level but at the \ninstitutional level in terms of who has the lobbying coalition, who is \never present, who has all the financial resources, and who has the \npolitical power. This industry has a heck of a lot more power than \n``ordinary consumers and ordinary citizens'' who are the very people we \nought to be representing.\n  I want to make it clear that this is not a debate about winners and \nlosers because we all lose if we erode the middle class in this \ncountry. We all lose if we take away some of the critical underpinnings \nthat shore up working families. Sure, in the short run big banks and \ncredit card companies may take their profits. But in the long run, it \nis going to be ordinary families and entrepreneurs--all \nbusinesspeople--who take the risk and who are going to pay the price.\n\n  This isn't a debate about reducing the high number of bankruptcies. \nIn no way will this legislation do that. Indeed, I would argue that by \nrewarding reckless lending that got us here in the first place, you are \ngoing to see more consumers overburdened by debt.\n  By the way, there isn't hardly a word in this legislation that calls \non these credit card companies to be accountable. It is all a one-way \nstreet.\n  This debate is about punishing failure--whether self-inflicted or \nuncontrolled and unexpected. This is a debate about punishing failure. \nIf there is one thing that our country has learned, punishing failure \ndoesn't work. You need to correct the mistakes. You need to prevent \nabuse. But you also need to lift people up when they stumble and not \nbeat them down.\n  I thought I made a pretty good case last week. I didn't think it was \nreally refuted. The proponents of the bill came down and they did their \nthing, but I don't think they did much damage to my argument.\n  What did the proponents of this legislation say? We need to talk \nabout this. It might be that it is going to go through. But, darn it, \nthere ought to be some discussion before the Senate about what we are \ndoing.\n  What do the proponents say? My friend from Alabama got up and \ncomplained that I was taking on or presenting this critique of the big \nbanks and credit card companies. He said this is a bankruptcy bill, and \nit only deals with the bankruptcy code and bankruptcy court reform. \nTherefore, holding the lender accountable is not appropriate.\n  That was one criticism. It sounded a little bizarre to me, as much \nfondness as I have for him. I think it sounds kind of bizarre to most \ncommonsense Americans in Minnesota who reach in their mailboxes every \nday of the week and pull out a handful of credit card solicitations. \nBut apparently some of my colleagues see no connection whatsoever \nbetween the irresponsibility of the lenders and the high number of \nbankruptcies. That is preposterous.\n  The reason colleagues do not see any connection between the \nirresponsibility of the lenders and the high number of bankruptcies is \nbecause they don't want to see any connection because these folks have \na lot of clout and a lot of power.\n  Both the House and the Senate bills basically give a free ride to \nbanks and credit card companies that deserve much of the blame for the \nhigh number of bankruptcy filings because of their lose credit card \nstandards. Even the Senate bill, which is better than the House bill, \ndoes very little to address this problem. There are some minor \ndisclosure provisions in the Senate bill. But even those don't go \nnearly as far as they should. Lenders should not be rewarded for \nreckless lending.\n  Where is the balance? If you are holding a debtor accountable, why \nare you not holding lenders accountable in this legislation?\n  Let me just give you some examples of some of the poor choices that \ncan be made. In this particular case I am talking about the lenders--\nnot the borrowers. Here are some real world examples.\n  In June of 1999 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency reached \na settlement with Providian Financial Corporation in which Providian \nagreed to pay at least $300 million to its customers to compensate them \nfor using deceptive marketing tactics. Among these were baiting \ncustomers with ``no annual fees'' but then charging an annual fee \nunless the customer accepted the $156 credit protection program--\ncoverage which was itself deceptively marketed. The company also \nmisrepresented the savings their customers would get from transferring \naccount balances from another card.\n  In 1999, Sears, Roebuck & Co. paid $498 million in settlement damages \nand $60 million in fines for illegally coercing reaffirmations--\nagreements with borrowers to repay debt--from its cardholders. But \napparently this is just the cost of doing business: bankruptcy judges \nin California, Vermont, and New York have claimed that Sears is still \nup to its old strong arm tactics but is now using legal loopholes to \navoid disclosure. Now, I say to my colleagues, Sears is a creditor in \none third of all personal bankruptcies. And by the way, this \nlegislation contains provisions that would have protected Sears from \npaying back any monies that customers were tricked into paying under \nthese plans.\n  That is unbelievable. I will tell you something. With the one-\nsidedness of this legislation, there is no wonder. Again, I am not \nattacking colleagues at a personal level but at an institutional level. \nNo wonder ordinary people think the political process in Washington is \ndominated by powerful folks and that powerful interests are opposed to \nthem.\n  How else can one explain the complete lack of balance? July 2000, \nNorth American Capital Corporation, a subsidiary of GE, agreed to pay a \n$250,000 fine to settle charges brought by the Federal Trade Commission \nthat the company had violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by \nlying to and harassing customers during collections.\n  Another example: October 1998, the Department of Justice brought an \nantitrust suit against Visa and Mastercard, the two largest credit card \nassociations, charging them with illegal collusion that reduced \ncompetition and made credit cards more expensive for borrowers.\n  To make the argument that when we look at bankruptcies we only hold \nthose who are the lenders accountable and not the creditors makes no \nsense whatsoever.\n  The goal of this bill was supposed to be to reduce bankruptcies. That \nis why the big banks and credit card companies have been pushing for \nit. They are the only ones pushing for it. I am hard pressed to find \none bankruptcy judge in the United States who supports this \nlegislation. I am hard pressed to find one bankruptcy expert in the \nUnited States who supports this legislation. This legislation was \nwritten by and for the lenders. It is that simple.\n  Maybe it is different in Rhode Island; I doubt it. I can't remember a \nconversation in a coffee shop anywhere in Minnesota, be it metro or be \nit in greater Minnesota, out in rural Minnesota, where people have \nrushed up to me and said: What we want you to do is please support that \nbankruptcy bill which will make it more difficult for people who are \ngoing under because of medical bills or because they have lost their \njob or because of a divorce in their family to rebuild their \nlives. Please, Senator, that is our priority.\n\n  I hear people talking about children and a good education. I hear \nyoung working people talking about affordable child care. I hear \nelderly people talking about the price of prescription drugs. I hear \nelderly people terrified, along with their children, about what will \nhappen to them at the end of their life if they are faced with \ncatastrophic medical expenses. I hear people talking\n\n[[Page S7725]]\n\nabout all of the health insecurity they feel because they don't believe \nthey have good coverage or because it costs much more than they can \nafford.\n  I hear veterans who are concerned about veterans health care. This \nThursday we are going to have a hearing in the veterans committee, \nwhich Senator Rockefeller chairs, on homeless veterans. I am guessing \nthat probably a third of all the homeless males--too many are women and \nchildren--are veterans, and most of them are Vietnam vets. Many of them \nare struggling with PTSD. Many are struggling with substance abuse. It \nis a scam that these veterans are homeless in America.\n  I hear discussion about why can't we do better for veterans. I hear \nconcern about the environment. I hear concern about energy costs. I \nhear concern about a fair price in farm country. I hear small \nbusinesspeople talk to me about how hard it is to have access to \ncapital. I don't see the ground swell of support all around the United \nStates for this piece of legislation.\n  What in the world are we doing debating this piece of legislation in \nthe Senate today? Why is this legislation out here? What kind of good \ndoes this do for the people we represent? It does a lot of good for the \ncredit card companies. It does a lot of good for the financial services \nindustry. I know that. I would just like somebody to explain to me how \nit does a lot of good for ordinary people, those folks who don't hire \nthe lobbyists, the people who don't have the big bucks, the people we \nsee every day. I hope we see them every day when we are back home.\n  It is ridiculous on its face that we can divorce the behavior of the \ncredit card companies from the high number of bankruptcies. Indeed, all \nthe evidence points to the fact that the lenders and their poor \npractices are a big part of the problem. It is just outrageous we don't \ntake them on.\n  I call this going down the path of least political resistance. It is \neasy to pass legislation that has such a cruel and harsh effect on \npeople who are being put under because of medical bills or because they \nhave lost their jobs. They don't have that much economic clout, and \nthey don't have that much political clout. As a matter of fact, I will \ncome up with an amendment on our bill sometime when there is an \nappropriate vehicle that will go after the credit card companies and \nthe lenders on their lending practices; we will have a vote on it. Then \nit will be more difficult because we have to go against those \ninterests, but we ought to at least have some balance.\n  In the debate last week, my friend from Alabama stood up and said \nthat the core of this bill is the means test. All the means test does \nis force those folks with high incomes to go to chapter 13. What is \nwrong with that? Therefore, the bill doesn't hurt low-income people.\n  The means test is only 9 pages of a 200-page bill. If the means test \nwere all this bill consisted of, then it would have passed 12 years \nago. We have been trying to hold this matter up for 2\\1/2\\ years, \nsomething such as that.\n  The bankruptcy bill purports to target abuses of the bankruptcy code \nby wealthy scofflaws and deadbeats who make up 3 percent of the filers, \naccording to the American Bankruptcy Institute. Yet hundreds of \nthousands of Americans file for bankruptcy every year, not to game the \nsystem but because they are overwhelmed by medical bills or job loss or \ndivorce.\n\n  Unfortunately, there are at least 15 provisions in both bills that \nmake it harder to get a fresh start regardless of whether the debtor is \na scofflaw and/or a person who must file because they are made \ninsolvent by their medical debt. These include, but are in addition to, \nthe means test.\n  Neither the means tests nor the safe harbor in this bill applies to \nthe vast majority of the new burdens placed on debtors under both \nbills. Debtors will face these hurdles to filing regardless of their \ncircumstance.\n  The final point made by proponents last week was actually made by \nseveral Senators. I think in some ways it is the most insidious. The \nargument advanced is that the bill is good for women and children \nbecause it places child support as the first priority debt to be paid \nin bankruptcy.\n  First, it is the case that this is a useful change in the law as far \nas it goes. Unfortunately, it doesn't go very far. Child support is \nalready nondischargeable in bankruptcy. In theory under this bill, a \nwoman who is owed child support is more likely to receive that support \nfrom her deadbeat husband while he is going through bankruptcy. But \nonce he emerges from bankruptcy, the other provisions of these bills \nwill make it less likely that his ex-wife or kids will get anything.\n  Under current law, an ex-spouse postbankruptcy often has few other \ndebts; they have all been discharged. The child support is \nnondischargeable. After his other debts are gone, the ex-spouse can \ndevote more of their income to their support obligations. In this way, \nthe current law actually helps women and children because they don't \nhave to compete with other more sophisticated creditors postbankruptcy. \nBut under this bill, the ex-spouse will emerge with much more debt than \nunder current law. Less credit card debt is dischargeable. Creditors \nwill have more leeway to force reaffirmations, agreements where debtors \nreaffirm their intention to pay back debt, and so the debt is not wiped \nout in bankruptcy.\n  The net effect is that women and children whose spouses file for \nbankruptcy under this bill will have to compete more than ever with \nauto dealers, with big retailers such as Sears, and with credit card \ncompanies for the paycheck of their ex-husband. Do we think they are \ngoing to do well?\n  The Senate giveth with one hand and taketh away with the other. That \nis part of the reason that 31 groups that are devoted to women's and \nchildren's issues oppose this bill.\n  I can't think of one women's or children's organization that supports \nthis legislation.\n  May I make one other point. There is another reason. That is, one \ngroup of citizens--in fact, it is the fastest growing number of \ncitizens who file for bankruptcy--are women. Since 1981, the number of \nwomen filing increased 700 percent. Divorced women are the ones who end \nup supporting the children. Income drops.\n  Are single women with children deadbeats? This bill assumes they are. \nThe new nondischargeability of credit card debt will hit hard those \nwomen who use the cards to tide them over after a divorce until their \nincome stabilizes. The ``safe harbor'' in the House bill, which \nproponents argue will shield low- and moderate-income debtors from the \nmeans test, will not benefit many single mothers who need help the most \nbecause it is based on the combined income of the debtor and the \ndebtor's spouse--are you ready for this--even if they are separated, \nthe spouse is not filing for bankruptcy, and the spouse is providing no \ndebt for the debtor and her children. That is figured in as the \nmother's income.\n  I will tell you something. This is one harsh, mean-spirited piece of \nlegislation, and I am stunned that so many Senators are supporting it.\n  Now, while I am waiting for Senator Durbin to come to the floor, let \nme talk about the pending amendment to this bill, which is actually the \ntext of the bill that the Senate passed earlier this year. Here is \nwhere I will give the Senate some credit. We started this year with a \ntruly terrible, completely one-sided bill. It was basically identical \nto the House version. The committee marked it up over the chairman's \nobjections and made improvements. Once it was considered by the Senate, \nadditional improvements were made. The Senate bill is still a very bad \npiece of legislation. Unfortunately, most of what we have accomplished \nhas been nibbling around the edges. But it is better than the House \nbill; that is clear.\n  The Senate bill has better credit card disclosure provisions. They \nare inadequate, but the House is completely silent on that. The Senate \nbill allows more credit to be discharged, thanks to an amendment by \nSenator Boxer. The Leahy amendment fixed the ``separated spouse \nproblem'' with the safe harbor. Why there was even a fight on that is \nbeyond me. The House bill has no such fix.\n  The Senate bill is less harsh when it comes to filing chapter 13 \ncases. We also limited some but not all of the hurdles this bill \ncreates in the successful filing of chapter 13 cases.\n  A Feingold amendment adopted in committee protects, to some degree, \nrenters from eviction if they pay the overdue rent when they file for \nbankruptcy.\n\n[[Page S7726]]\n\n  Very significant is the Kohl amendment on the homestead exemption. \nWith its adoption, the Senate takes on wealthy debtors who file \nfrivolous claims and shield their assets in multimillion-dollar \nmansions. This is a real abuse of the current system and it ought to be \ncorrected. Five States, under current law, allow a debtor to shield \nfrom creditors an unlimited amount of equity in their home. In fact, \nthe Florida Supreme Court, in a case last month, established that even \nif a debtor uses Florida's unlimited homestead exemption for nakedly \nfraudulent purposes, there is nothing the courts can do. You would \nthink that with all the bluster of the proponents of the bill about \ncurbing abuse of the deadbeats they would rush to close this loophole. \nNot so. Senator Kohl had to drag the Senate kicking and screaming to \nplug this obvious gap.\n\n  Unfortunately, the House and the President have drawn a line in the \nsand over this issue. While the House of Representatives--or at least \nthe majority party in the House--and the President of the United States \nof America support harsh, punitive hurdles to a fresh start for low- \nand moderate-income folks who virtually nobody claims are abusing the \nsystem, they are unprepared to go to the mat for folks who want to \nprotect their mansions and who are openly flouting their obligation.\n  May I repeat this again. The Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives and the President of the United States support a very \nharsh and punitive piece of legislation making it very difficult for \npeople to rebuild their lives--people who have been put under because \nof medical bills, for example. On the other hand, they have no problem \nwith folks who want to protect their property and protect their income \nby buying these multimillion-dollar mansions in States in the country \nand shielding themselves from any obligation.\n  It doesn't get any weirder than that--actually, it does. It does if \nthe Senate conferees--and I don't have any illusion; this bill will go \nto conference--knuckle under to the House on any of these issues. I \nthink the Senate conferees should be trying to improve this bill \nfurther in conference. I think that is Senator Leahy's intention, and I \nsalute him for it. But I certainly hope you can get the backing of the \nSenate conferees.\n  I have to worry about what is going to happen in the conference \ncommittee. Look at the past. Look at the evidence from the past. Since \n1998, the House has passed terrible bills. The Senate has passed better \nbills. Every time it emerges from conference, it is a nightmare. I hope \nthat doesn't happen again, and I certainly hope all of the Senate \nconferees will stick with the Senate position on the Kohl amendment, \nthe Schumer amendment, and other efforts which have made the bill at \nleast slightly better.\n  This time, I am sorry to say, this legislation is much more likely to \nbecome law. With this President, this ridiculous giveaway to the big \nbanks and credit card companies is going to make it. To the everlasting \ncredit of President Clinton, he vetoed this legislation. Look, I was \ncertainly one of his critics in the Senate. I have to admit that \nsometimes as I look at the values and policy preferences of this \nadministration, I certainly miss the Clinton administration. I \ncertainly do. But to give credit where it is due, President Clinton \nvetoed this legislation.\n  The White House has all but said they will sign the bill, as long as \nit protects wealthy deadbeats and their mansions. That is the position \nof the White House: We will sign this piece of legislation as long as \nyou guarantee us that you will protect the wealthy deadbeats and their \nmansions--as in Texas.\n  I am afraid, given what wealth and power get you in this town, given \nthe kind of backing this bill has, and given that some of the biggest \ninvestors of both parties are involved, it is going to be far too easy \nfor the majority of the conferees to go along with this proposition. I \nam sorry, I am going to repeat this again. People in Minnesota--I do no \ndamage to the truth--and I think people in Rhode Island do not know \nabout this legislation or any of the details. I promise you, they will \nbe deeply offended with this proposition, that a whole lot of people--\nbecause a few people game the system. True, a small percentage. Every \nindependent study says that regarding bankruptcy. If we pass this piece \nof legislation that basically makes it impossible for a lot of good \npeople, middle-class people, low- and moderate-income people, who, \nthrough no fault of their own--there but for the grace of God go I--\nthrough the loss of job, medical bills, you name it, find themselves in \nbrutal circumstances, this legislation is going to make it difficult to \nrebuild their lives.\n  At the same time, this piece of legislation, because of the \ninsistence of the President and the Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives, is going to protect wealthy deadbeats and their \nmansions and enable people to shield their assets--not the people I am \ntalking about but the wealthy people. Does that make any sense \nwhatsoever? That offends me as a Senator from Minnesota.\n  I hope I am wrong. I hope the Democratic conferees in the Senate will \nsupport Senator Leahy, the chairman. He has done good work on this bill \nunder very difficult circumstances. He did good work with an equally \ndivided Senate. I don't agree on the final product, but I am not going \nto ignore some of the improvements. I just hope the Democrats in the \nSenate do not let him down.\n\n  Mr. President, I will conclude on this note. Last week, the Senate \nvoted to move forward to conference. The Senate voted overwhelmingly. I \nthink it is fair to say that. The die is cast. It is going to happen. I \ncan block the Senate, I suppose, for a week, but the result will be no \ndifferent. I know that.\n  I came to the Chamber last week. I have come to the Chamber today. I \nwill have another amendment probably postcloture, but I do not know how \nto stop this any longer. I do not know of any way to stop it.\n  Let me say this: I will have an amendment that is going to call for a \nGAO study of this bill over the next 2 years, and I say to Senators, \nthere should be 100 votes for it. I will wait to use my hour after the \nvote to talk about it, but there should be 100 votes for it.\n  I am going to go over each of the arguments and ask GAO to look at \nthem, and we will see who is right or wrong. I am not saying that in \nsome macho way. I am saying at a minimum we ought to be willing to have \nan evaluation of this legislation and what it is going to do to people.\n  I do not regret holding up this legislation. Maybe it comes with \nbeing 5 foot 6 inches. I am almost defiantly proud, along with the help \nof other Senators, in stopping this, in blocking it, in fighting it. I \ndo not regret it at all. This bill should not be moving forward. I do \nnot think it should be a priority. I am in disagreement with the Senate \nmajority leader on this question. I think it is too harsh and too one-\nsided. Unfortunately, it is a perfect reflection of who all too often \nhas the power in the Nation's Capital. With the economy heading in the \nwrong direction right now and slowing up and people losing jobs and \npeople being underemployed--that is to say, they are not counted among \nthe ranks of the official unemployed, but they are not working at the \nkinds of jobs they would be working at with a better economy, and \npeople under more economic pressure and more economic strain--this is \nthe worst time to pass this legislation.\n  In fact, I do not know--maybe this is a stretch. I read an article \nthe other day in the New York Times that a number of economists were \nexpressing their concern that it has been the consumer spending which \nhas kept the economy going because a lot of business investment is way \ndown now. They are saying they do not know how much longer consumers \nwill continue to spend. There is a fair amount of debt.\n  I imagine this legislation may, in fact, add to our economic \ntroubles. People may be even more skiddish about consuming; they may be \neven more reluctant to be buyers, especially if they are going to wind \nup in the poorhouse for the rest of their life.\n  This legislation does not make sense on economic grounds. It does not \nmake sense in terms of what people in our States are asking us to do \nand what our priorities should be. This legislation should not be \nbefore the Senate. I am in disagreement with my majority leader on this \nquestion. This legislation violates the basic standard of elementary \njustice. It is going to pass, but it should not.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S7727]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today, as I did earlier this year, \nin opposition to the Senate-passed bankruptcy bill, Senate bill 420. It \nis likely this week we will appoint conferees and start the debate \nabout this bankruptcy bill.\n  Let me say at the outset, I support bankruptcy reform. A few years \nago, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, I was the ranking Democrat \non the subcommittee that produced a bankruptcy bill. At the time, we \nsaw a rather dramatic increase of public bankruptcy filings across \nAmerica, and there also appeared to be, and I believe there are, \nserious abuses where people are going to bankruptcy court to be \ndischarged from debts when, in fact, they could pay many of those \ndebts. When a person is able to pay their debts and does not, for \nwhatever reason, the economy absorbs it and all of us as consumers are \ntaxed or end up paying the cost of those unpaid debts. It is passed \nalong in one version or another.\n  So bankruptcy reform in and of itself is warranted and should be part \nof our agenda. I was happy to be part of the creation of a bill a few \nyears ago which dealt with changing our bankruptcy code.\n  Bankruptcy law is one of the most arcane laws in America. Although it \naffects probably more Americans than we imagine, it is an area of the \nlaw to which very few people pay attention. Almost by accident, I took \na course in bankruptcy law in law school at Georgetown. As a practicing \nattorney in Springfield, IL, I was appointed as a trustee in bankruptcy \nfor a local truckstop that was going bankrupt. Those were my two \nbrushes in the law with bankruptcy. Other than that, I didn't include \nit in my practice, and I paid little attention to it. When the time \ncame to debate it in the Senate Judiciary Committee, it turned out I \nhad more experience in bankruptcy law than any other Senator. It is a \nrather obscure area of the law that, unless it is focused on, is \ndifficult to understand, and more difficult to suggest meaningful \nreforms that make a difference.\n  What I tried to do in the earlier debate on the bankruptcy law was to \nsuggest that if there are abuses, there should be reforms so people do \nnot abuse the bankruptcy process. But we should also look to the other \nside of the ledger. There are abuses on the credit side, on the \nfinancing of debt side, which also should be addressed as part of \nbankruptcy reform. I believe this balanced approach, saying don't go in \nand abuse the bankruptcy courts, is a good one as long as we couple it \nwith an admonition, warning, a prohibition in the law, if necessary, \nagainst those who abuse the credit side.\n  I still remember and I have repeated it often, those who came to see \nme first about bankruptcy reform--these are people from banks and \nfinancial industry and credit card companies--said it used to be filing \nbankruptcy was something of which people were ashamed. They didn't want \nto do it, they didn't want to admit they had done it. They were \nembarrassed by the experience. Now, in the words of those who came to \nsee me, bankruptcy has lost its moral stigma.\n  I am not sure if that is altogether true. In fact, I question whether \nit is true except in isolated cases. I said back to them: Do you \nbelieve there is a moral stigma attached to credit practices, as well?\n  The fact is, when I went to a college football game in Illinois and \nwent up the ramp, and as I started to go into the stadium in Champaign-\nUrbana there stood someone offering me a free T-shirt for signing up \nfor a University of Illinois credit card sponsored by one of the major \ncredit card companies. Let me make it clear, they were not looking for \nme at the top of the stairs. They were looking for students to try to \nget them to sign up for credit cards and get deeper into debt. Where is \nthe moral stigma there? Who is asking the hard question whether that \nstudent can pay off a debt?\n\n  At the University of Indiana a few years ago, the dean of students \nsaid the No. 1 reason kids were dropping out of school and taking some \ntime away from school was to pay off credit card debts. So I say to the \ncredit industry, when we are talking about moral stigma, do you think \ntwice about offering credit cards?\n  I suggest to anybody listening to this debate, go home tonight and \nopen your mail. How many new solicitations will you receive for a new \ncredit card? Literally hundreds of millions of them descend on America. \nAre hard questions asked whether a person is creditworthy? Perhaps. But \nin many cases, no.\n  You see people getting deeper and deeper into debt, finally being \npushed over the edge into bankruptcy court. I suggest as part of this \nbankruptcy debate, let's ask the question on both sides: Who is abusing \nthe bankruptcy court? But also, who is abusing when it comes to \noffering credit in the United States?\n  I think, to address bankruptcy reform in that context is an honest \napproach. It is one that I think is sensible and balanced. The bill I \nsupported that passed this Senate a few years ago with 97 votes was a \nbalanced bill. This bill we have before us is not. This bill, which has \nbeen pushed through by the credit industry, by the financial \ninstitutions, sadly, does not have the balance that I think is \nabsolutely essential.\n  I had hoped we would be able to come up with such a bill. That has \nnot happened. We had a conference committee after we passed this bill a \nfew years ago. It was a conference committee in name only because what \nit boiled down to was the Republican members of the conference \ncommittee did not invite the Democrats to attend. They sat down with \nthe financial industry and wrote a bill and said take it or leave it, \nand we left it, as we should have.\n  Fast forward a couple of years: Same experience, credit industry \ncomes forward with a bill, they refuse to include in there protections \nfor consumers when it comes to credit, and that bill died as well.\n  Now we are in the third chapter of this long saga and we are \nconsidering this bankruptcy bill, which is S. 420. The question is \nwhether or not we will report out a bill from conference that addresses \nsome of the issues I have raised.\n  I think this bill has some serious defects and weaknesses. I am \ndisappointed the Senate failed to take the opportunity to achieve \nmeaningful reform on credit card disclosure and marketing practices.\n  There was a recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston. It \nconcludes that the rise in personal bankruptcy in America roughly \nmirrors the increase in credit card loans outstanding--a direct \nrelationship. So we see people getting deeper and deeper into credit \ncard debt until a moment comes that pushes them over the edge. What is \nthat moment? Perhaps it is when the debt becomes intolerably high, or \nthe loss of a job, or a serious illness, or a divorce. These sorts of \nthings push people over the edge and into bankruptcy court. But the \nreason they reach these terrible situations has a lot to do with credit \ncard debt in America that continues to grow.\n  I was back in Illinois over the weekend and ran into a couple who \nstarted\n\n[[Page S7728]]\n\ntalking about some of the outrageous things happening to them. They \ntold me a story about some of the things of which I was not aware. The \nfellow said:\n\n       Our family, like a lot of families, has several credit \n     cards.\n\n  This is on a Friday night at the Navy Pier in Chicago. He pulled me \nover, and we weren't even talking about bankruptcy. He said:\n\n       I wanted to ask you about credit card companies. Did you \n     know if you fail to make a timely payment on one of your \n     credit cards that information is shared among the credit card \n     companies? What happened is that I missed a payment on one of \n     my furniture loans. As a result, my monthly interest rate on \n     all my credit cards went from 12 to 20 percent. I called them \n     and said I made timely payments on all these credit cards. \n     They said, ``But you missed your furniture loan over here.''\n\n  He said:\n\n       Is that right? Is that fair?\n\n  I said:\n\n       The sad reality is, that is probably part of your contract.\n\n  I am a lawyer. When I flip over that monthly statement from the \ncredit card companies--I have reached the point where I need pretty \ngood glasses to read something, but I could not even make sense of the \nfine print on the back of my monthly credit card statement. I imagine \nmost Americans, when they sign up for a credit card or see the monthly \nstatement, don't say, Dear, we are not going to be able to go out to \nthe movie because I need to take the next half-hour and read the back \nof my monthly credit card statement. People don't do that. But there \nare things going on with those credit cards that can severely \ndisadvantage you.\n  We had an opportunity to do something about it in this bill and we \ndid not do it. We did not do it. One of the things I pushed for I think \nis so basic, I cannot believe the credit card industry opposed it. Let \nme tell you what it was. On each monthly statement they say: Here is \nthe minimum monthly payment. This is all we really want to receive from \nyou.\n  I suggested as part of that monthly statement they say: This is the \nminimum monthly payment which you can make on your credit card balance. \nIf you make that minimum monthly payment, here are the number of months \nyou will have to pay to eliminate the balance completely. Here is how \nmuch you will have paid in principal and how much in interest. So \npeople would be knowledgeable when they made a minimum monthly payment \nthat in fact they were really signing up for paying off that balance \nover a period of years--and it is literally years--if they made the \nminimum monthly payment. Because what credit card companies do is keep \ncharging interest so you just never catch up with yourself.\n  I suggested the credit card companies at least give us that \ninformation so consumers across America will be knowledgeable: OK, I \nhave a $2,000 balance. If the minimum monthly payment is $25--or \nwhatever it happens to be--how long is it going to take me to pay off \nthat balance? Guess what. It is about 5 or 6 years or more. So, will I \njust pay $25? If I could, I would pay more. Let's get rid of that \nbalance because the interest is going to accumulate.\n  I went to the credit card industry and said: Include that information \nin the monthly statement. That cannot be something you would oppose. Do \nyou know what they said? We just can't figure that out. We can't \ncalculate that. We cannot produce that information for every borrower, \nit is just too complicated.\n  Baloney. With computers today and all the information we have \navailable, that would be an easy calculation. But the credit card \nindustry doesn't want you to know it. They want you to dig that hole \ndeeper and deeper because they make money in the process.\n\n  People who genuinely need credit, who may in a bad month only be able \nto make that minimum monthly payment--that is a situation that families \ncan face. But shouldn't consumers be informed in America? When we talk \nabout a bankruptcy reform bill, is it unreasonable to suggest that kind \nof credit card disclosure be part of that bill? The credit card \nindustry said flat no, and it is not included.\n  Let me tell you another area that really rankles me. This is an \namendment I offered on the bill, the bankruptcy bill here on the floor. \nIt relates to a situation called predatory lenders. You read about them \noccasionally and see them on television. We see stories on some of the \nnews reports. Here is what it is. You have people who prey on those who \nare elderly and not well informed and have them sign up for new debt on \ntheir homes, particularly for home improvements or vinyl siding or a \nnew furnace or whatever it happens to be. They put provisions in those \npredatory loans that give them an opportunity to make extraordinarily \nhigh interest profits off those predatory loans, and they include other \nprovisions called balloon payments and the like.\n  How many times have you read in the newspaper or watched on TV the \nstory of a retired widow--and it has happened in the city of Chicago \nwhere I represent a lot of people--a retired widow who was safely in \nher little home for which she saved up for her life, and some smooth \ntalker came by and had her sign up for what turned out to be a new \nmortgage on her home with really bad conditions and terms. So as time \nwent on--usually the work turns out to be shoddy and the debt turns out \nto be intolerable, and it reaches a breaking point. When it reaches \nthat breaking point, sometimes this person, in retirement, in their \nsafe little family home, stands the risk of losing their home because \nof these predatory lending situations.\n  These are the most deceptive loans in America. They cost borrowers an \nestimated $11 billion each year in lost equity, back-end penalties, and \nexcess interest paid.\n  The American Association of Retired Persons, the largest group of \nseniors in America, did a survey. Eight out of ten Americans over the \nage of 65 own their home free of any mortgage. That is good. It shows \npeople have planned ahead. When they reach retirement, they want to \nhave that home and not have to worry about a monthly mortgage payment. \nWe want seniors to be in that position.\n  However, the unscrupulous lenders out there know those seniors have \nan asset and if they can get their hands on it, get their hooks into \nthat senior, they set out to do that, and foreclosure is often the \nresult when the senior fails to make these outrageous loan payments. \nThe elderly person, the senior living alone or a person from a low-\nincome neighborhood, can get a cold call from a telemarketer or a visit \nfrom somebody knocking on the door, telling them how they can get a new \nroof or windows: We can give you insulated windows with a little cheap \nloan; just sign up. It usually puts the unsuspecting victim in danger \nof losing their home. Almost before the victims know what hit them, \nthey are whacked with outrageous fees, $8,000 or more, slapped with \nskyrocketing interest rates and battered into a financial hole they \nnever get out of.\n  This is what happened to Janie and Gilbert Coleman from Bellwood. The \nColemans had purchased their home with a court settlement and had no \nmortgage payment at all. But this elderly couple with a 9th grade \neducation had Social Security disability income and predators mortgage \nlenders moved in for the kill.\n\n  Although the Colemans were first able to meet the $200 monthly \npayments on a $12,000 loan, 8 years and 5 refinancings later they found \nthemselves $130,000 buried in debt.\n  They borrowed $12,000. Over a period of 8 years, with all of the \nrefinancing and all of the interest payments on this little home, the \ndebt grew to $130,000. That is what I am talking about.\n  Six loans were made to the Colemans. Four of these loans were made by \na national lender, Associates, including two loans made just seven \nweeks apart.\n  Associates repeatedly sold the Colemans insurance that they did not \nwant or need. And twice they were charged more for fees and insurance \nthan they received.\n  Associates, a lending arm of Citigroup, is now the target of a \nmultimillion dollar lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission.\n  Associates earned over $1 billion in premiums last year but paid only \n$668 million in benefits.\n  This is a situation that is also going to illustrate what I am \ntalking about.\n  People like 72-year-old Bessy Alexander from the South Side who \nbelieved that she was getting a fixed rate\n\n[[Page S7729]]\n\nbut really received a mortgage with an interest rate adjusting upward \nevery 6 months--from an initial rate 10.75 percent to as high as 17.25 \npercent.\n  People like Nancy and Harry Swank of Roanoke, IL, who took a small \nloan from Associates to pay for a new stove and ended up with two \nloans, one at nearly 19 percent interest, totaling over $76,000, well \nabove the $60,000 value of their home.\n  They started off buying a stove for their $60,000 home. When it was \nall over, they owed $76,000 more than the value of their home.\n  People like 70-year-old Mrs. Genie McNab and other victims of \npredatory lending practices testified in 1998 before the Special \nCommittee on Aging in a hearing chaired by Senator Grassley.\n  If my colleagues have not done so already, I would encourage them to \nread the committee report from this hearing for a human face on this \nissue.\n  You ask yourself, what does this have to do with the bankruptcy bill \nthat is before us? I will tell you what it does. I said in my amendment \nthat if you have been guilty of violating fair credit practices, if you \nhave taken advantage of people such as those I have described, if you \nare in a position as a company where you have used the law improperly \nand now have a foreclosure against someone who is going into bankruptcy \ncourt, we will not allow you to walk in and claim you have clean hands \nin bankruptcy court and take the home. Predatory lenders would have \nbeen put on notice that when it was all said and done after they \nbattered these elderly people to the point where they can no longer \nmake payments and force them into bankruptcy that our bankruptcy code \nwill not protect these vultures.\n  My amendment lost on the floor of the Senate by one vote. You think \nto yourself, if you are going to have a balanced bill that says people \nshouldn't file for bankruptcy who have used the process, shouldn't the \nbalance in the law also extend to creditors who walk into bankruptcy \ncourt and want the protection of our legal system to collect from these \npoor people who have been swindled out of their life savings? That \nseems fairly obvious to me. Doesn't it really suggest a balance in the \nlaw that we should have?\n  My amendment was defeated. Who defeated it? The financial \ninstitutions that don't want to be held accountable for their lending \npractices. That to me is one of the sad realities of the law that faces \nus.\n  We know who these predatory lenders are. When we had this testimony \nbefore our committees, we asked them: How do you pick out the homes of \nthe people who you are going after? Well, they said, we look for \nprimarily elderly people--primarily elderly widows, those who appear to \nbe able to make a decision and sign the document but don't have a lot \nof advice from lawyers, or relatives, or anyone on whom they can rely.\n  They catch them in the most vulnerable situation. They take advantage \nof them. They take their money. They take their homes away, and they \ntake it away in our court system. This bankruptcy law which we are now \nconsidering should be protecting those people instead of preying on \nthem as it does.\n  There is a study I would like to share with you entitled ``Unequal \nBurden: Income and Racial Disparities in Subprime Lending in America'' \nby the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. They found \nthat: subprime loans are five times more likely in black neighborhoods \nthan in white neighborhoods. In addition, homeowners in high-income \nblack areas are twice as likely as homeowners in low-income white areas \nto have subprime loans.\n\n  Unsuspecting minority and low- to moderate-income consumers--often \nequity rich and cash poor--are targeted by predatory lenders that \nextend credit to high-risk borrowers ineligible for conventional loans. \nOf course, predatory lenders do not commit outright fraud. Many of \nthese borrowers lack not only sufficient funds but also financial \nliteracy. And they take advantage of them.\n\n  Let me tell you what one of these predatory lenders said when he was \nassured that he would be testifying behind the screen so that the \ntelevision cameras couldn't see his face. He was so embarrassed and \nafraid that he didn't want to say this in public.\n  My perfect customer would be an uneducated woman who is living on a \nfixed income, hopefully from her deceased husband's pension and Social \nSecurity, who has her house paid off, is living off of credit cards, \nbut having a difficult time keeping up with payments, and who must make \na car payment in addition to her credit card payments.\n  There you have it. When you are out there looking for your prey as a \npredatory lender, that is what you are looking for. Your hope is that \nyou push them so deeply into debt that they make all the payments they \ncan until they reach the breaking point and then they go into \nbankruptcy court and you take the home.\n  Oh, what a happy day it must be that these predatory lending offices \njust picked up another home from another widow in bankruptcy court.\n  When I put the amendment on the floor, I basically wanted to spoil \nthis party that these predatory lenders have at the expense of senior \ncitizens across America. My amendment failed by one vote. This bill \ndoes not address that problem. To think we can call this bankruptcy \nreform and not offer that kind of balance, as far as I am concerned, is \ndisgraceful.\n  We have seen the percentage of these predatory loans in precincts \nacross the United States. It seems over and over again that these \nsituations are where elderly people have become victims. Predatory \nlending is an epidemic.\n  Seven years ago, mortgages to people with below average credit was a \n$35 billion business. Today, it is a $140 billion business.\n  Who are we talking about? We are talking about somebody's parents, or \ngrandparents, who are caught unsuspecting by one of these predatory \nlenders who are ultimately going to run the risk of losing the home \nthey saved for their entire lives. AARP--with 34 million members--has \nlaunched a campaign to fight this problem.\n  I know Senator Sarbanes of Maryland, the Senate Banking Committee \nchairman, is going to have hearings this month on lenders that take \nadvantage of vulnerable borrowers. I commend him for his leadership on \nthis important issue.\n  Why wasn't this included in the bankruptcy bill? We have Senators \nstanding up and saying: We need to protect these predator lenders. That \nis exactly what happened. I lost by one vote.\n  Let me talk to you for a moment about credit card disclosure and \nwhether or not there is more information that we can ask for so we can \nhave some balance when it comes to credit card predators across the \nUnited States.\n  There are 78 million creditworthy households in America. Remember \nthat number--78 million. Each year there are 3.5 billion credit card \nsolicitations. As I said, go home tonight and look through your mail. \nYou are going to find them. If it is not there tonight, it will be \nthere tomorrow night asking you to sign up for a new credit card. They \nare coming at you in every direction--not just through the mail, but in \nmagazines, television; wherever you turn, they want us to sign up for \nmore credit cards. Frankly, I think you understand what they are \nlooking for.\n  One of the things they like to do is go after college students. There \nis a brand loyalty here. Major credit card companies think that when \nthey set up a college student for a credit card, the college student \nwill stick with their credit card for the rest of their lives. They do \nnot ask hard questions as to whether the student will pay off the debt.\n  One of the things that I suggested about the minimum monthly payments \nwas rejected by the credit card industry. I don't think it is a \ndifficult thing to calculate. If you were to pay a 2-percent monthly \nminimum on a balance of about $1,300, it would take you 93 months to \npay it off. We are talking about over 7 years with your minimum monthly \npayment.\n  I am not for credit rationing. I believe credit cards have done quite \na bit of good for a number of people. The credit card industry knows \nthe fact that 10 or 20 years ago it might have been impossible for \nsomeone such as a waitress to get a credit card. Today they can in \nAmerica. That is a good thing. There are times when credit cards are \ninvaluable for individuals and\n\n[[Page S7730]]\n\ntheir families. But we see that the credit card industry is not just \noffering credit to people who otherwise might not have a chance to get \nit; we see them overwhelmingly offering credit way beyond the means of \npeople to pay it off. I think the monthly statement should be a lot \nmore informative.\n  Let me also go to one other issue before I give the floor to my \ncolleague from Kansas. One of the issues which is part of this is the \nso-called homestead exemption. The homestead exemption is this: If you \ngo into bankruptcy court and you say you have more debts than you can \npossibly pay off, you list all of your debts and all of your assets. \nAnd many States have said one of the things that you are able to retain \nis your homestead or your home. The value that you are able to keep \ndepends on the State in which you live. So each State kind of defines \nwhat a home can be worth to be exempt from bankruptcy.\n  On its face it doesn't sound unreasonable that people would be \nallowed to keep their home even if they are bankrupt. You wouldn't want \nthem to be homeless or out on the street. But there is such a gross \ndisparity in the exemptions States offer for this homestead that we \nhave seen some terrible and outrageous abuses.\n  There was a fellow who was the commissioner of baseball, Bowie Kuhn, \nwho many years ago decided to file for bankruptcy. Before he filed, he \nmoved to Florida. Why did he move to Florida? He bought himself a \nmansion worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Then he filed for \nbankruptcy in Florida, and he was able to keep all of the money that he \nput in that mansion set aside and not opened to the creditors because \nFlorida had a very generous homestead exemption.\n  The same thing is true in many other States. One of the famous \nactors, Burt Reynolds, did the same thing; he bought himself a big \nranch worth over $2 million and then filed for bankruptcy realizing \nthat he had protected his assets. That is allowed; that is part of \nState law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If we are going to have real bankruptcy reform, then \nshouldn't we have some consistency? The poor person I mentioned earlier \nwho goes into court suffering from a predatory lender and is about to \nlose her home, for which she saved for a lifetime, is not going to have \nthe same advantages that this actor and this commissioner of baseball \nhad when it comes to a homestead exemption.\n  If it is real bankruptcy reform, it should address all levels of \nincome in this country. It should be fair to every one. This bill is \nnot.\n  O.J. Simpson filed for bankruptcy after being ordered by the court to \npay a $33.5 million judgment. He got to keep his $650,000 Los Angeles \nhome. These poor people I talked about in Chicago who are about to lose \ntheir little home over predatory lenders don't have the advantage O.J. \nSimpson had in California. That isn't fair.\n  Actor Burt Reynolds' home was worth $2.5 million. He got to keep \nthat. Onetime corporate raider Paul A. Bilzerian kept his extravagant \n11-bedroom, 36,000 square foot estate, the largest in the Tampa Bay \narea. It had a basketball court, movie theater, nine-car garage, \nelevator, and it was worth $5 million. Because Florida law is very \ngenerous to wealthy people filing for bankruptcy, he was able to keep \nhis home. The person I talked about in the city of Chicago didn't have \nthat benefit.\n  Elmer Hill, Tennessee coal broker, 3 days before being ordered to pay \n$15 million to a company he defrauded, shielded his assets by \npurchasing a $650,000 waterfront home in Florida and paying $75,000 to \nfurnish it. Then he declared bankruptcy. The Florida Supreme Court \nrecently ruled he was permitted to keep his home. The court said that \n``a debtor with specific intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors'' \nis presently able to shield his or her assets in their home.\n\n  Senator Kohl of Wisconsin offered an amendment to reform this. I \nsupported it. The amendment passed. But, the interests that support \nwealthy people here want this provision stripped in conference.\n  When we consider bankruptcy reform, should we not have basic \nfairness? Shouldn't all families across America, regardless of their \nwealth and income, be treated fairly? Sadly, this bill does not.\n  I will not be supporting this bankruptcy bill in its current form.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Torricelli be allocated 10 \nminutes of the time controlled by the proponents of the substitute \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Pursuant to the previous order, the Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague from Illinois who I have some agreement with on the \nbankruptcy bill, although not on the homestead provision. I want to \narticulate why I have a different viewpoint.\n  Overall, I believe the House version of this legislation, the \nbankruptcy legislation, is a good piece of legislation with which we \ncan work. I have worked hard on it. We have worked hard for a number of \nyears on getting bankruptcy reform. The last conference report on \nbankruptcy passed with over 70 votes, which is a substantial vote and \nthe agreement of a number of people.\n  One of the key provisions that was worked out on this overall \nbankruptcy legislation was the homestead provision. That is key to me. \nIt is key to my State because of the nature of the homestead provision \nthroughout bankruptcy and the bankruptcy code's history, how we have \nleft that to the States. In previous bankruptcy bills, we have \nconstantly left the homestead provision to the States, which is where \nit should be. The States should determine this.\n  In seven States in this country, including my own of Kansas, there is \na homestead provision that is in our State's constitution. The founders \nof my State saw as so important the protection of the homestead that \nthey provided in the constitution of our State a protection for the \nhomestead of 160 acres, 160 contiguous acres to be in a farm, or one \nacre in town of contiguous acreage in protecting that home. They said \nthis is something that is central to us. I will talk about why that is \ncentral.\n  It is central because farming, agriculture has been so much a part of \nour State's past. A number of farmers would borrow to protect, not \nagainst the homestead; they would borrow against other areas for the \nfarm and leave the homestead out of it because if they would lose the \nfarm, they could at least protect their home and 160 contiguous acres.\n\n  I used to be a lawyer in private practice prior to getting involved \nin public office. As such, I would examine a number of abstracts. \nAbstracts are titles to the land. They are histories of the land--who \nused to own it, who had a mortgage against the land, who had a lien \nagainst the property. You would examine that to see if there was clear \ntitle to the land or not.\n  You could track a piece of property and see the farm cycles in it. If \nthe years were going well, there wouldn't be a mortgage against the \nproperty. If it was going poorly, there would be a mortgage against the \nproperty. But almost always they would leave clear and free, if they \npossibly could, that homestead because just as sure as you would get \none bad year, you might get 2, and then you might get 3, and then you \nwould lose the farm.\n  The history would follow the farm cycle. Just as farm prices and farm \nproduction would go down, mortgages would mount up. And then you would \nhave a loss of the farm.\n  They would set aside and protect this homestead. They wouldn't put a \nmortgage against it, if at all possible, because our State's \nconstitution said they could keep that homestead to start farming \nagain. If they got on the bottom of the trough, lost the rest of the \nfarm, lost livestock, they could still have that home and 160 acres to \nbe able to start farming again and build back up in a cycle.\n  We built this into our State's constitution. Seven other States did. \nIt was an important part of maintaining that farming tradition and of \nkeeping people on the farm. That is what it did.\n  In the last cycle we went through, which was the early 1980s, I was \nstill practicing law at that time. We continued to have at that time \nthe homestead\n\n[[Page S7731]]\n\nprovision for family farmers, where you would leave within that a home \nand 160 acres. There are a number of people in Kansas who are still \nfarming today because they didn't mortgage the homestead. They lost \nmuch of the rest of the farm in the downturn of the farm cycle, but \nthey were able to rebuild around that home and 160 acres and start and \nmove forward again.\n  It was used then. It will be used again in the next farm cycle, if we \ndon't take that right away in the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001.\n  What has taken place is that this has been a long, hard-fought battle \nover the past several years--the bankruptcy reform that we have put \nforward. We worked out a compromise in the House that protects the \nsanctity of those State laws on homestead provisions and allows \naccumulation of a certain amount of property. It doesn't allow fraud. \nIf you are trying to move money into the homestead within 5 years of \nbankruptcy, that can get pulled back out in bankruptcy proceedings. It \ndoesn't allow you to fraudulently say: I am going to cash out this \nasset and put that into my homestead as a way of building up equity on \nthe homestead. That can all be set aside by the court. This was a \ncarefully compromised package that came from the House bill.\n  The problem is in the Senate bill where it takes away the States \nrights to establish a homestead. There was an exemption provision \ncarved out for the family farm by Senator Kohl, for which I am \ngrateful; but it wasn't within the home in town. So now you have the \nFederal Government, for the first time in 120 years, telling the States \nwhat is the homestead. They have not done that for 120 years. We should \nnot do that now. This is the wrong time for us to start; it is the \nwrong thing for us to do to take that away.\n  As I understand it, we are going to vote on inserting the Senate \npackage, which takes away this homestead right from the States. That is \nin the Senate package on which we will soon be voting. I am opposed to \ndoing that, and I will vote against that bill if it continues to \nmaintain that type of homestead provision which takes away the \nhomestead rights from the States and puts it into Federal bankruptcy \nlaw. That is against our State's constitution and against the \nconstitution in seven other States in this country. We should not be \ndoing that. It is a bad precedent to start.\n  I have no doubt that if we start it in this bankruptcy reform, in the \nnext bankruptcy reform we do we will go after the family farm homestead \nprovision because there will be some allegation of, OK, there was \nsomebody who shielded assets here and they were able to protect too \nmuch, going through a family farm type of setting, and then we will set \nit aside. There will undoubtedly be an example or two, but we find in \nmost of the lawsuits--the vast majority--that there are not abuses \ntaking place to the homestead provisions. It would be wrong for us to \nsay we have a couple of examples, and because of the abuse in a couple \nof cases we want to take this right completely away from the States for \nthousands of people, hundreds of thousands of people who have depended \nupon this for the past 120, 130 years.\n  I think particularly if we start down this road of Federalizing the \nhomestead provision, while we may not hit the family farmers now, we \nwill the next time around, and that would be a wrong way for us to go.\n  I want to make it clear on this point again that if there is fraud \ninvolved, if somebody is taking assets from another area and putting \nthem in the homestead to hide from a creditor, that is covered by the \nlaw. You cannot do that today. You cannot do that under the provision \nthat is in the House bill, and we should not allow people to do that. \nSo we are not talking about fraudulent transactions. Many examples \ncited by my colleagues on the homestead provision actually involve \nfraudulent transactions. They are against the law and they should be. \nWe should not allow people to fraudulently hide assets. But we should \nnot, as well, take away this homestead provision from States on homes \nand family farms because of allegations of examples that don't even \napply in the situation. This is not fraud--what I am talking about. \nThis is about a basic home, a home on 160 acres in the country, if you \nare a family farmer.\n  The Kohl amendment in the Senate version is one that I vigorously \noppose because it jeopardizes the compromise that was worked out last \nyear in the bankruptcy bill, and I believe it jeopardizes the fate of \nthe entire bill, as well, because of what it does to the homestead \nprovision. That is what this amendment is about.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against inserting the text of the Senate \nbill into H.R. 333 and to support, instead, the House version, which \ncontains the compromise language with which I am comfortable, and with \nwhich I believe Senator Hutchison of Texas is comfortable as well. It \nmaintains the homestead provision and authority in the States, with \nsome limitation on it, which is a concession on our part.\n  The Senate bankruptcy bill, if it is inserted in the House version \nwith the Kohl amendment included, radically alters the homestead \nprovision from what was crafted last year. It is in this carefully \nbalanced legislation we have before us. If the Senate language is put \nin with the Kohl amendment that takes away the homestead rights from \nthe States, I will be vigorously opposing this legislation, as will a \nnumber of other colleagues who have similar homestead problems, given \nthe constitutions within their States. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst doing that.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from New Jersey is recognized \nfor up 10 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, for more than 4 years, the Senate has been \nconsidering various proposals to address the bankruptcy system in the \nUnited States. Everyone on all sides of this debate seems to have \nagreed the bankruptcy system is in need of serious repair.\n  There have, however, been many questions about how to address the \nproblem. In both the 105th and 106th Congresses, efforts to pass \nbankruptcy reform came very close. In the final days of each session, \nwe could not make the mark.\n  At the start of the 106th Congress when I assumed the role of the \nranking Democratic member on the Judiciary subcommittee of \njurisdiction, I felt some optimism that we could succeed. In the \nprevious Congress, Senator Durbin had come very close, and we began \nwith an outline of his legislation.\n  During the 106th Congress, literally hundreds of hours were spent \nwith Senators Grassley, Biden, Hatch, Sessions, and Leahy over many of \nthese very difficult issues.\n  The bill before the Senate today is a culmination of all of those \nhours, months, indeed, years of work. It represents the suggestions of \nmany Members of this Senate now included in provisions of this bill.\n  It is a fair bill. It genuinely represents the sentiments of the \nSenate and both political parties. It improves the bankruptcy system, \neliminating many of its abuses without doing injury to vulnerable \nAmericans and continuing the protection that Americans need to \nreorganize their lives. It may be tougher than current law, but it is \nalso fair.\n  The best indication, I believe, of our success in this effort is the \nbipartisan vote in the Senate itself earlier this year when the bill \npassed by an 83-15 vote.\n  For the Senate to speak in such a loud, consistent, and bipartisan \nvoice is probably a reflection of the understanding of the depth of the \nproblem. In 1998, during the largest economic expansion in American \nhistory, 1.4 million Americans sought bankruptcy protection. That is a \nstaggering 350-percent increase since 1980.\n  In 1999, filings were reduced by 100,000 but still remained at the \n1.3 million filing level. It is estimated that 70 percent of these \nfilings were made in chapter 7, allowing a debtor to obtain relief from \nmost of their unsecured debts. Conversely, only 30 percent of filings \nwere in chapter 13 which requires a repayment plan.\n\n[[Page S7732]]\n\n  The Department of Justice has estimated that 182,000 people per year, \npeople currently filing under chapter 7 to avoid their debts, properly \nbelong in chapter 13 where they will repay part of their debts. The \ndifference is not insignificant. If those 182,000 people were moved \ninto chapter 13 and were paying those debts which were affordable, $4 \nbillion would be returned to creditors.\n  Critics of the bill argue that $4 billion would only enrich large \nfinancial institutions, transferring money from people who live \nmarginal economic lives to wealthy institutions. That claim ignores the \nfact that much of the debt burden that is avoided by chapter 7 filings \nalso goes to local contractors--the mechanic on the corner, the small \nretailer, the family business which provides services or goods, only to \nface someone entering into bankruptcy and avoiding paying their debts. \nThis creates a situation where one debtor passes a debt on to a family \nbusiness and causes that business to fail and then another family \nbusiness. It is not fair, and it is not right.\n\n  Critics have also argued that bankruptcy reform will deny poor people \nthe protection of the bankruptcy system, recognizing the bankruptcy \nsystem has always been an important part of American life, giving \npeople a second chance, ensuring that because someone has made a \nmistake or, more likely, through a problem of health in the family or \ndivorce, illness, they are not denied a chance of fulfilling a \nprosperous life.\n  This claim simply is not true. No American is being denied access to \nbankruptcy. Indeed, the bill contains several provisions to ensure that \nno one genuinely in need of debt cancellation is prevented from \nreceiving a fresh start under chapter 7. It is done in several ways.\n  First, the bill gives the judge discretion to consider the debtor's \nspecial circumstances under which they are unable to meet a payment \nplan, an escape clause where a judge can always ensure that a person \nwith no means is given chapter 7 protection.\n  Second, it contains a safe harbor to ensure that all debtors earning \nless than the State median income will have access to chapter 7 without \nqualification. If one is under the median income, one is in chapter 7, \nperiod.\n  Third, the bill adds a floor to the means test to guarantee that \ndebtors unable to pay more than $6,000 of their outstanding debt will \nnot be moved into chapter 13: Again, protection for people of modest \nmeans.\n  All this gives people of lower income a chance to sweep away their \ndebts and to start again an American life. It has always been our way.\n  Finally, probably the most unfair criticism and the one to which I am \nmost sensitive is the issue of whether this adds a new burden to women \nand children. The bill contains language that Senator Hatch and I \noffered in an amendment to protect exactly this element of our society: \nsingle parents and children in need of protection.\n  Under current law, when it comes to prioritizing which debts must be \npaid off first, child support is seventh in bankruptcy court. It ranks \nafter rent, storage garages, accountant fees, tax claims, or other \nclaims by government, and that is wrong.\n  Not only does this new bill not make it worse, we make it better. \nUnder the bill, child support is moved to where it belongs: First, \nahead of government, other businesses, or financial institutions. The \nobligations of a father or mother to their child will never be put \nbehind another debt.\n  Finally, this compromise deals with one other area of the law that is \nequally important. We were not going to reform bankruptcy laws without \ndoing something about the overreaching efforts by the credit card \nindustry itself.\n  The credit card industry yearly has more than 3.5 billion \nsolicitations of Americans, encouraging them to incur debt. That is 41 \nmailings for every American household, 14 for every man, woman, and \nchild in the Nation. Not surprisingly, with this level of solicitation, \nAmericans with incomes below the poverty line have doubled their credit \nusage in the last decade. The result is not surprising. This doubling \nof credit usage has involved 27 percent of families earning less than \n$10,000 a year, having consumer debt that is 40 percent or more of \ntheir income.\n\n  If we are going to do something about the abuse of bankruptcy laws, \nit is only right and fair we do something about the credit industry \nencouraging Americans to incur debts they cannot afford and in which \nthey should not have become involved.\n  We deal with these abuses of the credit industry in several ways. \nFirst, we require that lenders prominently disclose the following \naspects of their debt solicitations: The effects of making only the \nminimum payment every month; second, when late fees will be imposed; \nthird, the date on which introductory or teaser rates will expire, as \nwell as what the permanent rate will be after that time.\n  This is balanced legislation protecting the most vulnerable Americans \nwho have marginal economic lives; ensuring that single parents and \nchildren are protected; ensuring that the credit industry itself has \nnew obligations but also ensuring that bankruptcy laws are not misused \nand do not become an opportunity for Americans to escape the financial \nobligations they have willfully encountered and passing that burden on \nto other small businesses or institutions that cannot afford them.\n  Madam President, $4 billion of unpaid bills, unfairly passed on to \nothers, is more than American businesses, industries, family firms, and \nfarms should have to incur.\n  At long last we have reached reform of our bankruptcy laws. It is a \ngood moment for the Senate and for the Judiciary Committee for these \nyears of struggle with this legislation. I commend again Senator Leahy, \nSenator Hatch, and all who joined in the process through the years.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased to rise today to support the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the substitute amendment to H.R. 333. The \nsubstitute language is the text of S. 420, the Bankruptcy Reform Act, \nwhich passed this Chamber with a bipartisan vote of 83 to 15 on March \n15. As you may recall, the conference report to last year's bill, H.R. \n833, passed the Senate by a similarly wide margin just last December, \nbut was pocket-vetoed by President Clinton at the end of the \nlegislative session.\n  Today, we are another step closer to getting this bill to conference \nand heading down the home stretch of this legislative marathon. It is \ntime to wrap up this debate and appoint conferees who will present a \ngood bill to the President for his signature so American consumers can \nreap the benefits.\n  As my colleagues well know, we have cooperated and compromised at \nevery step along the way in order to produce a fair piece of \nlegislation that provides new consumer protections, helps children in \nneed of child support, and makes other necessary reforms to a system \nthat is open to abuse.\n  Contrary to the views of the bill's opponents, this legislation does \nnot make it more difficult for people to file for bankruptcy, but it \ndoes eliminate some of the opportunities for abuse that exist under the \ncurrent system. Right now, certain debtors with the demonstrated \nability to pay continue to abuse the system at the expense of everyone \nelse. Current law perpetuates a system in which people with high \nincomes can run up massive debts, and then use bankruptcy to get out of \nhonoring them. In the end, all of us pay the price for those who abuse \nthe system in the form of higher interest rates and rising consumer \nprices.\n  I am optimistic that this much needed bankruptcy reform legislation \nwill be signed into law this year once the procedural roadblocks put \ndown by the narrow opposition have been removed. It is beyond time to \nappoint conferees and to enact meaningful bankruptcy reform. As I have \nsaid many times here on the floor, and just as lately as last week, the \nAmerican people have waited long enough.\n  I also oppose amendments that may be offered at this stage after we \ninvoke cloture.\n  I take very seriously the role of the Senate as a deliberative body, \nbut with\n\n[[Page S7733]]\n\nrespect to this reform bill, I am beginning to feel like the passenger \non the Titanic who said, ``I asked for ice, but this is ridiculous.'' \nThe offering of any additional amendments on this bill at this stage \nwill set a dangerous precedent for reopening bills that have already \nbeen fully considered here on the Senate floor. I urge any and all of \nthe 83 Senators who voted for this bill in March to vote to defeat \nthese amendments to send a clear message that ``final passage'' means \njust that. Resolving remaining issues is the job of a conference \ncommittee. It is simply fortunate, and, in my opinion bad faith, to \nreopen issues after holding a hearing and mark-up in committee followed \nby a prolonged debate on the floor, with almost one hundred amendments \nconsidered at that time.\n  No one can say that the Senate has not already adequately considered \nbankruptcy reform. The Senate has literally been engaged in the process \nof deliberating on this issue for years, with numerous hearings, \nmarkups, and votes. Back in 1997, a comprehensive bankruptcy reform \nbill was developed by Senators Grassley and Durbin which we marked up \nand reported out of committee in May of 1998. In September of that \nyear, the Senate passed bankruptcy reform by a vote of 97 to 1. This \noverwhelming Senate vote in favor of bankruptcy reform was followed by \nthe appointment of conferees, negotiations with the House, and in \nOctober of 1998, an overwhelming House vote in favor of the conference \nreport.\n  Although the motion to proceed to consideration of the conference \nreport was agreed to in the Senate by a strong vote of 94 to 2, the \nSenate ran out of time for a vote on final passage before the end of \nthe Congress.\n  In February of 1999, Representative George Gekas introduced \nbankruptcy reform again, which passed out of the House in May of 1999 \nby another overwhelming vote of 313 to 108. Then, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee once again marked up Senator Grassley's bill and in May of \n1999, we reported it out of committee.\n  Then, in February of last year, the reform legislation passed the \nSenate by another impressive margin of 83 to 14. The Senate requested a \nconference, but the objection of a single member from the other side of \nthe aisle blocked the appointment of conferees. As a result, we had to \nturn to an informal conference process with the House. With a great \ndeal of effort by members on both sides of the aisle, we reached a \ncompromise agreement on over 400 pages of legislation, and on all but \none issue.\n  In October of 2000, the House passed the bankruptcy reform conference \nreport, and in December, the Senate passed it by yet another vote of 70 \nto 28. And, as my colleagues know, later that month, the President \npocket-vetoed the legislation.\n  The issue of bankruptcy reform is not a new one. We have studied it, \nheld hearings on it, compromised on it, and come to resolution on it \nwith veto-proof margins, in both houses time and again. An elaborate \nrecord that sets out the issues, documents the debate and makes the \ncompelling case for reform is available to anyone who cares to give it \ntheir attention. At some point, the process of deliberation needs to \ncome to a close, and the will of the Congress needs to be exercised\n  Only those who want to use delay to kill bankruptcy reform altogether \ncould possibly argue for more process. Now is our opportunity to enact \ninto law the legislation that the Congress supports and that the \nAmerican people want. Let's get on with the Nation's business.\n  I would hope that we defeat any obstructionist amendments at this \nstage, or we may never see the end to any legislation already passed by \nthis body ever again.\n  I yield the floor:\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on this \nmotion for up to 15 minutes, and at the conclusion of my remarks that \nthe vote on the motion commence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Minnesota for \nhis efforts to educate our colleagues and the American people about the \nunfairness of this bankruptcy bill. It has been a lonely struggle for \nhim, but the Senator from Minnesota has never avoided a struggle \nbecause it is lonely. He has succeeded in framing the issues for the \nconference quite well. Are we passing this reform for the credit card \ncompanies or for consumers? Who is the Senate working on behalf of \nhere? Are we going to pass a bill that passes muster with bankruptcy \nlaw experts in the law schools and the courts or with the big banks?\n  I spoke back when we considered this bill in March about the problems \nwith this legislation and why I believe it should not be passed. Even \nwith the addition of a number of important amendments during the Senate \ndebate--and I hope that the bill that emerges from conference is more \nlike that bill than the House bill--I still believe that the bill will \ndo terrible damage to the bankruptcy system in this country, and even \nmore importantly, to many hard-working American families who will bear \nthe brunt of the unfair so-called ``reforms'' that are included in this \nbill. It is unfortunate to have to say it, but this is a harsh and \nunfair measure pushed by the most powerful and wealthy lobbying forces \nin this country, and it will harm the most vulnerable of our citizens. \nI voted against the bill when it came up for final passage in March, \nand I voted against proceeding to it last week. I continue to support \nbankruptcy reform, but not this version.\n  One of the major problems with the bill that came to the Senate floor \nwas fixed by an amendment offered by the senior Senator from my State, \nMr. Kohl. Senator Kohl has been crusading for years against the \nmillionaire's loophole in the bankruptcy law--abuse of the unlimited \nhomestead exemption. By a lopsided vote of 60-39, the Senate voted not \nto table his amendment to set a national ceiling on the use of that \nexemption. It is clear to everyone that the fate of Senator Kohl's \nhomestead exemption will be the most fiercely contested issue in a \nHouse-Senate conference.\n  Let me put it as simply and clearly as I can: A bankruptcy reform \nbill that does not contain limits on abuse of the homestead exemption \nis a fraud on the American people. We cannot claim to be acting in an \neven handed fashion if we leave this major loophole untouched, while at \nthe same time imposing harsh new limitations on average hard working \npeople forced by circumstances to seek the protection of the bankruptcy \nlaws.\n  There are a number of other problems with the bill that I hope the \nconference committee will try to work out. I will take my remaining \ntime this morning to highlight one. It has to do with the new \ndefinition of ``household goods'' in section 313 of the substitute \namendment.\n  As written, this bill very quietly undermines an extremely important \nprotection that current bankruptcy law offers to debtors. Section 313 \nis a gift to finance companies who have what I consider to be a \nquestionable practice of taking liens on the personal property of the \npeople to whom they lend money.\n\n  To understand how unfair the bill is here, my colleagues must be \naware that the practice of taking a non-purchase money security \ninterest in certain household goods has been illegal for many years. \nUnder 16 C.F.R. Sec.  444.2, a regulation first promulgated by the \nFederal Trade Commission during the Reagan Administration, it is an \nunfair credit practice under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission \nAct for a lender to ``take or receive from a consumer an obligation \nthat constitutes or contains a non-possessory security interest in \nhousehold goods other than a purchase money security interest.''\n  Let me take a step back and remind my colleagues of the difference \nbetween a purchase money security interest and a non-purchase money \nsecurity interest. A purchase money security interest is a lien that is \ntaken on the property that is being purchased with the proceeds of a \nloan. For example, an auto manufacturer or a bank takes a purchase \nmoney security interest in your car when you get a loan to pay for it. \nThat security means the lender can repossess the car to satisfy the \nloan if you don't make your payments. Major department stores might \ntake a purchase money security interest in a home entertainment center \nor a computer or a major appliance that you buy on credit. It makes \nperfect sense\n\n[[Page S7734]]\n\nfor these lenders to be secured creditors and to protect their interest \nin getting their loans repaid. No one has a problem with that.\n  But when a finance company takes an interest in property already in \nthe home to secure a loan, property that is already purchased and paid \nfor, that is a non-purchase money security interest. And as I said, the \nFTC determined long ago that such an interest on household goods is \nillegal. The FTC's definition of household goods, however, is limited. \nOn this chart, you can see the definition of household goods in the FTC \nregulation--clothing, furniture, appliances, one radio and one \ntelevision, linens, crockery, kitchenware, and personal effects, \nincluding wedding rings.\n  So this definition of household goods is relatively narrow. It \nincludes only a single TV, for example, and it doesn't cover things \nsuch as CD players that hadn't even been invented in 1984, or personal \ncomputers that were not nearly as common in family homes as they are \ntoday. Nonetheless, the FTC rule prohibits finance companies from \ntaking non-purchase money liens on items covered by this definition.\n  But finance companies that like having these liens as a bargaining \nchip with their borrowers have hardly been deterred. They want to turn \nwhat is essentially an unsecured loan into a secured loan. So they take \nliens in everything in the house they can get their hands on that is \nnot on the FTC's list of household goods.\n\n  This chart shows a typical form that the finance companies use to get \nborrowers to list their personal property when they apply for a loan. \nThey take a lien on everything that a borrower identifies--things like \ngarden tools, jewelry, rugs, cameras, exercise equipment. Make no \nmistake, these companies have no intention of repossessing these \nitems--most of them are probably worthless--they just use them as a \nthreat to try to get their loans repaid. This chart shows a typical \nloan application with a list of household goods that these lenders try \nto take an interest in. They try to cover it all: bicycles, tennis \nrackets, hedge trimmers, leaf blowers, mirrors, model airplanes, \nsleeping bags, the list goes on and on and on.\n  Under section 522(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor can apply to \nthe bankruptcy court to avoid these non-purchase money liens in \nhousehold goods. And the courts have generally interpreted household \ngoods broadly to include all items kept in or around the home to \nfacilitate the day-to-day living of the debtor. The courts have \nspecifically rejected the narrow list of household goods contained in \nthe FTC's regulation as too narrow.\n  Remember, in bankruptcy, liens can't be avoided on extremely \nexpensive items. The power of lien avoidance under section 522(f) only \napplies to property that falls under an exemption from the bankruptcy \nestate, and there are strict limits on the value of property that is \nexempt from liquidation in bankruptcy under State and Federal law. But \nthe power of lien avoidance serves the purpose of treating creditors \nequally and fairly, particularly in Chapter 13, and it protects debtors \nfrom being pressured into reaffirming debts that they would otherwise \nbe able to discharge in bankruptcy because they fear they will lose \ntheir family heirlooms or their child's model airplanes.\n  Section 313 of the bill is a new and very restrictive definition of \nhousehold goods for purposes of the lien avoidance power. It \nessentially codifies the FTC's list of household goods and makes it the \nexclusive list of household goods on which liens can be avoided in \nbankruptcy.\n  This chart shows how section 313 compares to the FTC's definition. \nThe bill would turn the law on its head. In effect, it says that \nvirtually the only liens that can be avoided are those that the FTC's \nregulation already prohibits. As you can see here, liens can be avoided \non clothing, furniture, appliances, one radio and one television, \nlinens, crockery, kitchenware, and personal effects, including wedding \nrings--all items that are on the FTC's list already.\n\n  Thus, under this definition, section 522(f) lien avoidance, which is \nintended to protect the exemptions for personal property that states \nand federal law provide, is almost completely gutted.\n  All of the things I mentioned before that finance companies commonly \ntake liens in are not included in the definition--garden tools, \njewelry, rugs, cameras, exercise equipment, bicycles, tennis rackets, \nhedge trimmers, leaf blowers, mirrors, model airplanes, and sleeping \nbags. Finance companies can take liens in these items and enforce them \nin a bankruptcy case.\n  The real problem here is that no list can be exhaustive. And there is \nreally no reason to have an exhaustive list anyway. The courts are \nfully capable of determining in a bankruptcy case what kinds of things \nare standard household items. The list in the bill is far too narrow, \nand there is absolutely no evidence that there are abuses taking place \nthat need to be addressed.\n  The reason that this provision is in the bill is simple--the finance \ncompanies that support the bill want more power to take these \nborderline unethical liens. They want more power to coerce people into \nreaffirming debts because they don't want their home stripped bare by a \ncompany that holds an interest in everything in it. This provision is \npart of the ``deal'' between all the creditors that support this bill. \nAll of them are getting their special protections in this bill, and \nconsumers are left with nothing.\n  Mr. President, I was prepared to offer an amendment to strike section \n313 back in March, but time ran out before I could offer it. I filed it \nso that it could be offered once cloture is invoked. I will not offer \nit today, but I believe we should remove this offensive provision in \nconference. That would move this bill just a little closer to one that \nactually treats American families fairly.\n  I thank my colleague from Minnesota for all he has done to fight for \nAmerican families on this issue. I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to come to the floor later with \nlengthier remarks, but there are two subject matters I want to bring to \nthe attention of my colleagues that I am sure they have taken note of \nover the last several days. The first is the continuing reports about \nlast year's elections in the United States. Obviously, there was \nparticular focus on the State of Florida. But, Mr. President, as you \nknow because of your deep interest in the subject as well, we believe \nthis was not exclusively a Florida issue. Nor was it merely an issue \ninvolving the national election last year. Mr. President, we have a \nserious problem, based on a number of studies that have been conducted \nby Members of the other body as well as the Civil Rights Commission and \nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whereby as many as 6 million \npeople did not have their votes counted last year. That is in addition, \nI suppose, to the 3 million people we now know who actually tried to \nvote but were told they were not allowed to vote despite the fact they \nactually had the right.\n  That is now 9 million people. I know of 10 million people who are \nblind in this country who did not vote last year. Only one State in the \nUnited States actually allows people who are blind to go in and vote on \ntheir own. In any other jurisdiction, if you are blind you must be \naccompanied by someone else. You never get to vote in private, in spite \nof the fact there is hardly an elevator in America built in the last 5 \nyears where there is not Braille to assist you. You can operate an \nelevator alone but you cannot cast a ballot alone in the United States.\n  So there is a growing sense of scandal, in my view, not because \nsomeone was involved in some criminal enterprise to deprive people of \nthe right to vote or to manufacture or manipulate the outcome of the \nelection. I use the word ``scandal'' to speak of a situation in which \nonly one out of every two eligible Americans is casting his or her \nvote. And even those who do are not having their votes counted \nproperly; that is of deep concern to me.\n  Patrick Henry, one of the great voices that gave birth to this \nNation, once said that the right to vote is the right upon which all \nother rights depend. I believe he was correct more than 230 years ago, \nand even now, as we enter into the 21st century.\n  We lecture the world all the time on how to conduct free and \ndemocratic elections, yet there is a growing body of evidence that \nsuggests we could do a much better job in America in how our elections \nare conducted, in what support we provide our local communities and \nprecincts, and by setting some national standards so we never again \nidly sit and watch an election during which as many as 6 million votes \nwent uncounted. These were people who exercised their civic \nresponsibility and showed up on election day to cast a ballot and, \nbecause of faulty machinery or other shortcomings, their ballots were \nnever counted--not to mention the people suffering a variety of \nphysical disabilities who were denied that right as well.\n  It is my hope that in the coming weeks, as we gather more information \nfrom across the country about how we could do a better job, we will put \nadequate resources into this. I say this as my seatmate, normally \nsitting to my right, is now sitting over here in a chair to the left--\nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I have not had a chance \nto speak with the chairman about this. I will not abuse a public forum \nto do so at this moment, but I know he cares about these issues as much \nas I do, and we might talk about how we might provide some resources to \nour States to ensure that the equipment is modernized, that we no \nlonger have machinery that is a half century old in some cases, as it \nis, to be used by people who wish to cast their ballots. My hope is we \ncan come up with some national standards, provide the resources to our \nStates, and do a much better job, a much better job in seeing to it \nthat people vote in this country and that their votes are then counted.\n\n  I cannot begin adequately to express the sense of outrage I sense \namong people all across this country who were so terribly disappointed, \nto put it mildly, who went to vote and discovered their votes were not \ncounted.\n  Put aside your feelings about the outcome of the election. We have a \nPresident. His name is George W. Bush. I stood on the west front of the \nCapitol on January 20, and I certainly believe in the depths of my soul \nthat this is the President of the United States. My concerns are not \nabout the legitimacy of the person who sits in the White House. My \nconcerns are about the legitimacy of a process that I think is in dire \nneed of repair--the election process in this country.\n  I don't know how much more evidence we need to have accumulated by \nindependent studies based on last year's results, especially now that \nthe New York Times, Miami Herald, other newspapers, as well as the \norganizations I have already mentioned, have looked at the elections of \nlast year and have concluded by and large that there are serious \nproblems with the present electoral process.\n  I would like to address this issue at greater length later today, but \nI wanted to raise the matter here before we went into recess over the \nnext hour or two.\n  Finally, I would like to mention a matter that I think is \ntremendously important--and I should point out to my colleagues here \nthat the Presiding Officer shares an equal passion about this issue as \nthe Senator from Connecticut. I look forward very much, working with \nhim as a member of the Judiciary Committee that has very specific \njurisdiction over the Voting Rights Act of 1965, on how we can listen \nto people across this country, gather as much adequate information as \nwe can and then propose to our colleagues some meaningful ideas, both \nresources and ideas, on how we can minimize the electoral problems that \noccurred not just last year but have been occurring over the last \nnumber of years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7735-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7735-S7736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. The second subject matter is the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. This morning the New York Times as well as others \nreported that there were serious reservations\n\n[[Page S7736]]\n\nbeing expressed by superintendents of schools and educators across the \ncountry about this mandating of testing in the third, fourth, fifth, \nsixth, seventh, and eighth grades. I certainly want to see young people \ntested. I think it is worthwhile to know how children are doing under \nthe elementary and secondary educational system of the country, but I \nam getting concerned that we are merely taking the educational \ntemperature of these children without really dealing with the problem \nthat has caused the public to lose faith in our public school system.\n  Every day the numbers indicate there is greater concern about the \nquality of public education. I think we can do a better job. But I do \nnot necessarily believe that just testing kids every year, and at what \ncost, is necessarily going to improve the quality of education. So \nwhile I am not opposed to testing, I think we ought to think more about \nwhat we can do for those children who are failing, what ideas can we \ncome up with and work on with our local communities and States to \nimprove the quality of teachers, the quality of classrooms, the quality \nof educational materials, wiring schools to take advantage of the \nexplosion in technology and information that is available.\n  I always find it somewhat mortifying when the Federal Government \nlectures the country about the quality of education, where we lecture \nlocal school districts, States and school boards about what they ought \nto be doing. The Federal Government contributes less than one-half of 1 \npercent of the entire Federal budget dedicated to elementary and \nsecondary education. I find that scandalous, to use the word I used \nwhen talking about the election process. The fact that the Federal \nGovernment in its resources only contributes one-half of 1 percent of \nits budget to the elementary and secondary educational needs of \nAmerica's children; that of every dollar that gets spent on education \nthe Federal Government's one-half of 1 percent amounts to about 6 \ncents. Mr. President, 94 cents of every education dollar comes mostly \nfrom local property taxes and some from the States.\n  In my view, in the 21st century we ought to become an equal partner \nwith local communities and States: one-third, one-third, one-third. \nThat can reduce property taxes and provide more meaningful resources to \ncommunities that do not have the wealth, the support for the kinds of \neducational opportunities their students should have. No child in \nAmerica ought to have the quality of their educational opportunity be \ndetermined solely by the wealth of the community in which they happen \nto have been born. That is just wrong.\n  If you are born in America, you ought to have an equal opportunity \nfor a good education. It seems to me that the Federal Government ought \nto do a better job of being supportive, particularly as we write bills \nthat mandate testing, without putting the resources there to allow \ncommunities to pay for these additional burdens.\n  For the last 35 years we did that on special education. We mandated a \nlaw that said you had to provide for the special education needs of \nchildren. Then we never came up with the money to pay for those costs. \nThe bill we just passed in the Senate now mandates full funding of the \n40-percent requirement of special education, but it has taken 35 years \nto do it. We have allowed for full funding of title I, but I would like \nto know when President Bush is going to tell us what sort of resources \nthe Federal Government is going to commit to these elementary and \nsecondary educational needs.\n  The President talks about how he wants this done, but I am waiting \nyet to hear from the White House. How much money is the administration \nwilling to commit to full funding of title I and to special education \nneeds?\n  They are telling us that they want to have mandatory testing. They \nwant accountability, but they are unwilling to say whether or not they \nwill commit the necessary resources to achieve those goals.\n  I hope the administration, as they urge us to get ready to pass this \nbill in conference, will also heed their own advice and more quickly \nexpedite the commitments made by the President as to what resources \nwill be provided.\n  It is now only a matter of a few weeks before children and their \nparents start to prepare to go back to school. We ought not wait much \nlonger to get the job done.\n  My point of these brief remarks is to urge the administration to step \nup to the plate and tell us what the resources are. If they are not \ngoing to make any at all, then we ought to rethink this bill. Do not \ntell me the administration will mandate costs on the local community \nand then not have the resources to pay for it. And do not tell me that \nAmericans will have to watch property taxes go through the ceiling \nbecause Uncle Sam tested their children every year from the third to \nthe eighth grade without providing the resources to help communities \nand parents meet those greater educational goals.\n  Both on election reform, and on education, I hope we can get \nsomething done.\n  I wish the President would support election reform. I hope he will \nspeak up and tell us what sort of resource commitments he is willing to \nmake to support the elementary and secondary education needs of \nAmerica's children.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair in listening to these brief \nremarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been in conversation with my \ncounterpart, Senator Nickles. We both recognize the importance of \nmoving this bill and other appropriation bills. At this time, however, \nafter consulting with Senator Nickles, we are not going to ask for a \nunanimous consent agreement that there be a time for filing of \namendments.\n  Senator Domenici and I will work through these amendments. We know \nthere are several amendments, and as soon as we get off the bankruptcy \nbill, Senator Stabenow is going to offer one. There may be others. \nSenator Domenici and I will work through them.\n  When we get to a point where we think the amendments are not coming \nin, we will move to third reading, and we will keep the leadership of \nthe minority advised as to what we are doing.\n  I appreciate the advice and counsel and suggestions made by my friend \nfrom Oklahoma. We will do our best to abide by these.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Republican leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator \nReid. I appreciate his not entering a request to limit or say that all \namendments would have to be filed by a certain period of time. I \nencourage my colleagues to work with the managers of this bill, Senator \nDomenici on our side, if they have amendments, to bring those to his \nattention.\n  It is certainly not our intention to procrastinate on this bill. We \nwould like to see the amendments that are pending and do some homework \non the amendments, consider them, take them up, pass them or defeat \nthem, and come to final passage in the not too distant future.\n  I urge all of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, if they have \namendments, to please bring those forward so we can deal with those \nappropriately and finish consideration of this important bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if my friend will yield, the other thing I \nwould like to bring to the attention of the Senate is, as soon as we \nfinish this bill, we move to one of President Bush's very\n\n[[Page S7737]]\n\nimportant nominations; that is, of Mr. Graham. The agreement that has \nbeen made by the two leaders and that is now part of the Senate record \nis that as soon as we finish this bill, we will move to that \nnomination. There is a time agreement that has already been made on \nthat matter. The sooner we finish this bill, the sooner we can get to \nthis important nomination of President Bush.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I concur. I compliment Senator Reid for \nbringing forward Mr. Graham's nomination. That is a very important \nnomination. It deals with the Office of Regulatory Affairs. It deals \nwith the cost of regulations. You cannot go a day without seeing some \nregulations that have an impact in the billions and billions of \ndollars. It is very difficult for President Bush to deal with this \nissue and not have his person installed as head of the office. We will \nhave 7 hours of debate on Mr. Graham's nomination. I look forward to \nthat debate and to his confirmation as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank my two colleagues. This is \nreasonable. I am concerned that when we have before us an important \nissue such as this energy bill, which really bears a lot on where we \nare going in this whole area of energy--and it is very important to me \nand to the American people--we get the amendments in. But this idea of \nhaving them filed by a certain time I think is really tough. We need a \nlist perhaps. But thank you very much for this little change in \ndirection.\n\n  Mr. REID.

STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF THE BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF \n                   2001.\n\n       (a) Study.--The General Accounting Office (in this section \n     referred to as the ``GAO'') shall conduct a study to \n     determine--\n       (1) the impact of this Act and the amendments made by this \n     Act on--\n       (A) the number of filings under chapter 7 and chapter 13 of \n     title 11, United States Code;\n       (B) the number of plan confirmations under chapter 13 of \n     title 11, United States Code, and the number of such plans \n     that are successfully completed; and\n       (C) the cost of filing for bankruptcy under chapter 7 and \n     chapter 13 of title 11, United States Code, in each State;\n       (2) the effect of the enactment of this Act on--\n       (A) the availability and marketing of credit; and\n       (B) the price and terms of credit for consumers; and\n       (3) the extent to which this Act and the amendments made by \n     this Act impact the ability of debtors below median income to \n     obtain bankruptcy relief.\n       (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than 2 years after the \n     effective date of this Act, the GAO shall submit a report to \n     the Congress on the results of the study conducted under \n     subsection (a).\n       (c) Data Collection by United States Trustees.--\n       (1) In general.--The Director of the Executive Office for \n     United States Trustees shall collect data on the number of \n     reaffirmations by debtors under title 11, United States Code, \n     the identity of the creditors in such reaffirmations, and the \n     type of debt that is reaffirmed.\n       (2) Availability.--Periodically, but not less than \n     annually, the Director shall make available to the public the \n     data described in paragraph (1) in such manner as the \n     Director may determine.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to get to the substance of my \namendment in a moment. I want to respond for a moment to some of the \ncomments from my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch. The Senator from \nUtah said he was going to oppose this amendment because it was a \n``delaying'' amendment.\n  I want Senators to know that I offer this amendment in good faith as \nan effort, in a modest way, to improve this bill. It says let's have a \nGAO study and look at the bankruptcy bill and analyze the effect of it. \nI don't know how Senators can vote against this, but I want to make it \nclear that a Senator could file a thousand amendments if this was all \nabout delay. To my knowledge, this is the only amendment--my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, had filed an amendment, but I don't \nthink he is going to offer it.\n  I just want to be clear that your vote on this amendment is a vote on \nwhether or not you think we should be accountable for our vote. That is \nreally what it is. So I don't want anybody to say I can vote against \nthis amendment because it is some kind of a delaying tactic. That is \nsimply not the case. What we have to say to people back in our States \nis: Look, in good conscience, I voted against an amendment to do a \ncareful evaluation of this bankruptcy bill to see how it is working. \nYou can figure out how you want to fill in the blank. That is the \nargument you have to make. You can't say: I voted against this \namendment because it was a strategy of delay. That is ridiculous. It is \njust one amendment.\n  The second thing I have to do because you have to have a twinkle in \nyour eye, and I think the Chair is one of the best at that. I just \nreceived today a solicitation from MBNA, which I think is the largest \ncredit card bank in the country. They offered me a credit line of up to \n$100,000. There is an introductory 1.7-percent annual percentage rate, \nincluding cash advance. I thank the credit card industry for not taking \nthis personally. This is sent to people--to our kids and \ngrandchildren--every day.\n  This amendment is straightforward. I hope, I say to the Chair, that \nit will garner universal support. It should. It doesn't attempt to undo \nanything the Senate did earlier this year. It doesn't revisit any of \nthe debate that we have had. This is no trick.\n  Look, if I had my way, I would kill this bill. For 2\\1/2\\ years, I \nhave been trying to do that. This amendment is all about \naccountability. The main provision of the amendment requires that the \nGAO do a study of the impact of the bankruptcy bill on debtors and \nconsumers of credit. It is that simple. Both sides have made dramatic \narguments or dramatic claims about this legislation. In my case, they \nhave been negative. In the case of some of my colleagues, they have \nbeen positive.\n  My amendment says, OK, 2 years after this bill has become effective, \nlet's have the General Accounting Office give us a report on how things \nhave turned out. How in the world--I am amazed that there is \nopposition. There was a great Swedish sociologist, Gunnar Myrdal, who \nwrote, ``Ignorance is never random.'' Sometimes maybe we don't want to \nknow what we don't want to know. But I think it is really hard for \nSenators, Democrats and Republicans, to make an argument that you are \nunwilling to let the GAO do a study of this careful policy evaluation. \nThat is what this amendment says. Will we be accountable for the votes \nwe cast? For those who think it will be a great bill, you will get a \nchance to see. For those who think it is going to be harsh in its \nimpact on people, of course, we want to know.\n  We are going to ask the GAO to study six things.\n  First, we are going to ask the GAO to report on the impact of the \nbill on the number of filings under chapter 7 and\n\n[[Page S7738]]\n\nchapter 13. This is important because the proponents of the bill have \nbeen something of a moving target on this issue. They argue that the \npoint of the bill--particularly the means test--is to force more \ndebtors who are now filing for chapter 7 into chapter 13--the logic \nbeing they can afford to do so.\n  I have heard colleagues say that is the only thing this is about. \nPeople should not get away with filing chapter 7 when they really have \nthe money and they can instead file for chapter 13. But then the \nAmerican Bankruptcy Institute found that very few people abuse chapter \n7. Perhaps as low as 3 percent do that. And then the chapter 13 \ntrustees reported that this bill will actually reduce chapter 13 \nfilings by 20 percent from the current level because of the problem \nthrough additional burdens that the bill creates for chapter 13 filers.\n  Now, the proponents admit there may be fewer successful 13s. Also, I \nhave argued that access to both chapters 7 and 13 are going to be \nreduced because of the means test and other burdensome requirements.\n  Let's find out. Those of you who say you are for the bill, you say it \nis because people have been gaming the system, but the evidence doesn't \nsupport that claim. I have talked about who the people are. Fifty \npercent of the people file for bankruptcy because of medical bills, or \npeople have lost jobs, or there has been a divorce. But what I am \nsaying is, since now we know that, in fact, there may not be so much \nabuse, and that many people can't file successfully for chapter 13, and \nmaybe even are less able to do so under this legislation, let's have a \nstudy. Let's look at this. Two years hence, let's look at how this has \nworked. How can anybody be opposed to a careful policy evaluation?\n  Second, the GAO will look at chapter 13 specifically and the impact \nof this act on the number of plan confirmations in chapter 13 and the \nnumber of chapter 13 plans successfully completed. This is a key \nquestion because 67 percent of chapter 13 cases fail under current law. \nI will repeat that. Under current law, 67 percent of the people can't \nmake it. If this legislation is going to make it even more difficult \nfor people to make it, and this is what my colleagues call reform, what \nthis amendment says is let's see what has happened. Let's see if I am \nright. Or forget me. Let's see if the U.S. Trustees are right, and if \nwe aren't, no harm has been done. But if we are right, then perhaps the \nCongress might want to revisit this legislation.\n  When it becomes clear that a lot of hard-working people, through no \nfault of their own, wound up in very difficult, hellish financial \ncircumstances, and then could not rebuild their lives because of this \nlegislation, don't you think we want to know?\n  Colleagues, if you are right, you are right. But if you are wrong, \nyou want to know if you are wrong. How can any Senator vote against \nthis amendment?\n  Third, the General Accounting Office will examine the impact on the \ncost of filing chapter 7 and chapter 13 bankruptcies in each State. \nThis is another key question--whether or not this bill will allow \ndebtors to get bankruptcy relief. There is overwhelming evidence that \nthe cost of filing bankruptcy is a major hurdle. Some families are \ngoing to have to save for months in order to do it.\n  They are, after all, insolvent. It is also a virtual certainty that \nthis bill will make it more expensive to file, as the Wall Street \nJournal noted earlier this year. Again, let's hold ourselves \naccountable and have the General Accounting Office study this issue for \ncertain.\n  Fourth, the GAO will report on the impact of the bill on the \navailability and marketing of credit. Something very interesting \nhappened in 1999 and 2000 while the proponents of so-called reform were \nbleating about the rising number of bankruptcies. The bean counters in \nthe consumer credit industry realized that all these bankruptcies were \nnot good for profits so they started lending less money, and they were \nmore careful about who they lent the money to and, in fact, overall \nconsumer debt level actually declined in 1998, and guess what. We had \nfewer bankruptcies. This trend continued to 1999 and 2000. Bankruptcies \nonly started rising again as the economy started to turn downward.\n  Several economists have suggested that when you restrict access to \nbankruptcy protection, as this bill does, you are going to increase the \nnumber of filings and defaults because the banks are going to be more \nwilling to lend the money to marginal candidates because they do not \nhave to worry about people then filing for bankruptcy. Indeed, it is no \naccident that that is exactly what happened after the bill was passed \nin 1984.\n  As the May 21 issue of Business Week notes in an article titled \n``Reform That Could Backfire\":\n\n       Indeed, [Mark] Zandi believes that tougher bankruptcy laws \n     will simply induce lenders to ease their standards even more. \n     States with the highest bankruptcy rates already have \n     stringent wage garnishment laws, yet net losses to credit \n     card issuers in such States have been similar to those in \n     States following less restrictive bankruptcy rules.\n\n  Let's see if the experts are right. Have the General Accounting \nOffice do a study.\n  Fifth, we want to look at the effective so-called reform bill on the \nprice and terms of credit for consumers. What we hear by the credit \ncard companies and proponents of these bills is that all of these \nbankruptcies have led to higher interest charges and fees for honest \nconsumers. That is because, they say, the credit card companies and \nbanks pass on the costs of the default to consumers.\n  In fact, I remind colleagues, the credit card companies have \ncalculated the cost of this tax on consumers to be $400 per year. This \nhas been cited as a reason that we need reform. The decent, hard-\nworking people are getting charged $400 more a year because of people \nwho are the slackers and are gaming the system, although there are not \nvery many slackers.\n  Maybe this is all true, but it only matters in the context of the \nbill if passing this ``reform'' measure actually results in savings to \nconsumers.\n  By the way, there is not much evidence that is going to happen. \nConsider this: In 1999 and 2000, when bankruptcy rates and defaults \nwere dropping sharply, interest rates and fees on credit cards were \nactually rising, and the bank and credit card lender profits were also \nrising. This suggests that if there were any savings, they were not \npassed on to consumers.\n  If this industry is going to run the show, let's insist, after this \nbill passes, there are going to be these great savings for consumers. \nLet's just do a careful study of that.\n  Sixth, the GAO will investigate the extent to which the bill impacts \nthe ability of debtors below median income to obtain bankruptcy relief.\n\n  I have heard colleagues say over and over that nothing in this bill \nwill affect the ability of low-income debtors to get a fresh start. In \nfact, I heard the Senator from Alabama make that claim the other day. \nIf that is the case and if the only thing this legislation is about is \ngoing after those people who are the slackers or the cheaters, then \nlet's take a look at it.\n  As I said before, there are a lot of provisions in this bill that are \ngoing to make it much harder for people to get a fresh start, and it \nhas nothing to do with whether or not they were cheaters or slackers. I \nam talking about the people who have really been put under, no fault of \ntheir own.\n  Let's have the GAO take a look at this question: Are we going to have \na lot of debtors who are going to face these hurdles to filing \nregardless of their circumstances?\n  Finally, there is one other part of this amendment. It directs the \nDirector of the Office of U.S. Trustees to collect data on \nreaffirmation agreements, the identity of the creditors in such \nreaffirmations, and the type of debt that is reaffirmed.\n  Under this bill, creditors will have more leeway to force \nreaffirmations--agreements where debtors reaffirm their intention to \npay back the debt and so the debt is not wiped out in bankruptcy. \nUnfortunately, these agreements are commonly abused by creditors under \ncurrent law.\n  I talked about what happened with Sears, Roebuck. They paid $498 \nmillion in settlement damages in 1999 and $60 million in fines for \nillegally coercing reaffirmations--agreements with borrowers to repay \ndebt--from its cardholders. Apparently this is just the cost of doing \nbusiness. Bankruptcy judges in California, Vermont, and New York have \nclaimed that Sears is still\n\n[[Page S7739]]\n\nup to its old strong-arm tactics but is now using legal loopholes to \navoid disclosure. This amendment will bring some transparency to the \nreaffirmations and allow us to study how they are being abused.\n  This is a modest amendment. I have been fighting this bankruptcy bill \nfor a long time, and other Senators have been out here fighting. If it \nis going to go to conference committee, then I am going to depend on \nSenator Leahy and others to improve this bill, although I think there \nis going to be a vote we are going to deeply regret.\n  The most vulnerable people are the ones who are going to pay the \nprice. The economy is turning downward and a lot of people may find \nthemselves in terrible circumstances--no fault of their own--and are \ngoing to have a very difficult time rebuilding their lives.\n  I am amazed that the credit card industry in institutional terms--not \nSenator to Senator. Every Senator votes how he or she thinks is right. \nI am saying can we not at least do an evaluation? Can we not at least \nmake sure that 2 years from now we have the General Accounting Office \ndo a study so we know what is happening around the country?\n  If the proponents of this legislation are right and this truly was a \nreform and it truly works well and all of the harsh and negative \nconsequences I have spent hours talking about do not turn out to be the \ncase, I will be glad to be proven wrong. But for those of you who \nsupport this legislation, surely you also, first of all, want to be \nright, but if you are wrong and I am right, then you want to know you \nare wrong so you can change the course of policy. You do not want to \nsee a lot of innocent people, ordinary citizens hurt by this \nlegislation just because the large financial service industry has such \nclout. We all know about their power. We all know that this is one-\nsided.\n  There is not a word in this legislation--I am sorry, on the Senate \nside, there is a minuscule piece on disclosure, but nowhere are they \ncalled into question or called into accountability. They pump this \nstuff out every day. I got one today. Credit line up to $100,000. Our \nchildren get it. Every day they send this stuff out in the mail. Every \nday they try to hook people on their credit, and we are arguing that \nwhen it comes to bankruptcy, the only people who are at fault are the \npeople who wind up in trouble, not these big credit card companies for \ntheir irresponsible, reckless lending policies.\n  Shouldn't we call on them to be more accountable? We have not. \nShouldn't there be more balance to this legislation? There is not. Am I \nright that a lot of low- and moderate-income people are going to be \nhurt, that a lot of single-parent families headed by women are going to \nbe hurt? Am I right that a lot of children who live in these families \nare going to be hurt? Am I right that a lot of families who have been \nput under because of medical bills are going to be hurt? Am I right \nthat families--because the husband or the wife, the major wage earner, \nloses his or her job and finds themselves in terrible circumstances--\nare going to be hurt?\n\n  I think I am right. If I am wrong, I will be prayerfully thankful to \nbe wrong. If I am right and you are wrong, you will want to know you \nare wrong so we can do something in a hurry before a whole lot of \nordinary citizens get hurt very badly by this legislation.\n  Every Senator should vote for this amendment. There is no reason to \nvote no.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow) for herself, Mr. \n     Fitzgerald, Mr. Levin, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Feingold, \n     Mr. Schumer, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Wellstone, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Bayh, \n     and Mr. Voinovich proposes an amendment numbered 987.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To set aside funds to conduct a study on the effects of oil \n                  and gas drilling in the Great Lakes)\n\n       On page 2, line 18, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``, of which such sums as are necessary shall be \n     used by the Secretary of the Army to conduct and submit to \n     Congress a study that examines the known and potential \n     environmental effects of oil and gas drilling activity in the \n     Great Lakes (including effects on the shorelines and water of \n     the Great Lakes): Provided, That during the fiscal year for \n     which this Act makes funds available and during each \n     subsequent fiscal year, no Federal or State permit or lease \n     shall be issued for oil and gas slant, directional, or \n     offshore drilling in or under 1 or more of the Great Lakes \n     (including in or under any river flowing into or out of the \n     lake)''.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, my amendment, which is a bipartisan \namendment and which shares the strong support of colleagues from around \nthe Great Lakes Basin, seeks to protect the waters of the Great Lakes \nby asking for a study of the impact of any oil and gas drilling in our \nGreat Lakes. And it places a moratorium on new drilling until we have \nfactual scientific review of the danger of any potential oil and gas \ndrilling.\n  In case my colleagues are not aware, 30 to 50 new oil and gas \ndrilling permits could be issued as soon as the next few weeks for \nextraction under Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. This is moving forward \nonly in the waters of the State of Michigan despite the overwhelming \nopposition of almost all local communities that would be affected by \ndrilling and by the public at large.\n  We don't want to see these oil rigs dotting the shoreline of Lake \nMichigan or any of our beaches around the Great Lakes.\n  This amendment says that before anything as serious as this picture \nshows would occur we want to make sure that the Army Corps of Engineers \ndoes a complete study and analysis, and that we have thoughtful \nconsideration of the impact this would create.\n  I want to make it clear that this is a local and regional issue. \nDrilling in the\n\n[[Page S7740]]\n\nGreat Lakes is not a part of President Bush's energy strategy, nor is \nit a component of any of the major energy bills pending in Congress.\n  We are talking about the Great Lakes Basin. We have one of our \nNation's most precious public natural resources. As you can imagine, \nthe citizens of the Great Lakes and all of the States involved are very \nproud and protective of the Great Lakes waters. We have 33 million \npeople who rely on the Great Lakes for their drinking water, including \n10 million from Lake Michigan alone.\n  Millions of people use the Great Lakes each year to enjoy the \nbeaches, great fishing, and boating. We welcome everyone to come and \nenjoy the splendor of the Great Lakes.\n  The latest estimate shows that recreational fishing totals $1.5 \nbillion to Michigan's tourist economy alone. The Great Lakes confines \nalso are home to wetlands, dunes, and endangered species and plants, \nincluding the rare piping plover, Michigan monkey flower, Pitcher's \nthistle, and the dwarf-lake iris. Lake Michigan alone contains over 417 \ncoastal wetlands, the most of any Great Lake.\n  As you can see, we are proud of our lakes. All of the States \nsurrounding the Great Lakes have a stake in what happens in these \nwaters, as do all of us, because this is 20 percent of the world's \nfresh water. All of us have a stake in making sure we are wise stewards \nof this important waterway.\n  Great Lakes drilling would place the tourism economy, the Great Lakes \necosystem, and a vital source of drinking water at great risk for a \nsmall amount of oil.\n  Last year, Michigan produced about 2 minute's worth of oil from Great \nLakes drilling of seven wells that have been in place since 1979. Since \n1979, Michigan's wells have only produced 33 minutes of oil. U.S. \nconsumers use 7 billion barrels per year.\n  This is not about a large source of oil. We are deeply concerned \nabout the risks involved in drilling.\n  I cannot stress enough how important tourism is to the Michigan \neconomy. Families from all over the country come to visit Mackinaw \nIsland and the hundreds and hundreds of miles of beaches up and down \nMichigan's coastline.\n  As I know my colleagues feel the same about their borders and their \ncoasts around Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, New York, and \nMinnesota, all around the Great Lakes we are proud of and depend on \ntourism as a part of our economy.\n  As it gets warmer and warmer and more and more humid here, we welcome \npeople to come and visit the beautiful Great Lakes' shoreline and the \nwonderful weather that we are now having in Michigan.\n  It is estimated, unfortunately, that a single quart of oil--a single \nquart of oil--through a mishap of any kind could foul as much as 2 \nmillion gallons of water. That is our fear.\n  If an oil spill happened in one of Michigan's tourist locations, it \ncould ruin these local economies forever.\n  The Great Lakes are all interconnected and they border eight States, \nas we know, from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, \nOhio, Pennsylvania, and New York.\n  This means that an oil spill in Lake Michigan could wash up on the \nshores of Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin. That is why we \nneed to have the Federal Government study this issue because it affects \nmore than just one State.\n  My amendment is a reasonable and prudent approach to the issue of any \noil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes. It asks the Army Corps of \nEngineers to study the safety and environmental impact of drilling \nunder the Great Lakes. It places a moratorium on new drilling.\n  Once this study is concluded, Congress can review this information \nand decide whether or not the moratorium should continue.\n  This is not a partisan issue. I am joining with colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle led by Senator Fitzgerald from Illinois, my \nRepublican colleague.\n  I am so pleased to have colleagues on both sides of the aisle coming \ntogether to protect our wonderful natural resource called the Great \nLakes.\n  We have in addition two prominent Republican Governors who have come \nout strongly against drilling in the Great Lakes.\n  If I might read their statements, Ohio Governor Bob Taft has stated \nthat he cannot see any situation where he would support drilling under \nLake Erie.\n  Governor Taft has ruled out drilling under the lake, saying many \nenvironmental issues would need to be considered before any drilling \ncould be approved.\n  That was April 11 of this year.\n  Second, the Governor of Wisconsin, Gov. Scott McCullum, also stated \nhis opposition to Great Lakes drilling. Governor McCullum's spokeswoman \nstated that he ``doesn't want any oil exploration in the Great Lakes. \nIf it's for oil and it's going to interfere with the Great Lakes, then \nhe opposes it.''\n  That was June 5 of this year.\n  This is a bipartisan issue--a joining together of those of us who \nbelieve very strongly that we have a special responsibility as stewards \nof this wonderful natural resource.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us from both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this study and this prudent approach by placing a moratorium \nand studying this critical issue before anything moves forward.\n  It is important that 20 percent of the world's supply of fresh water \nbe protected and that we be responsible in our approach. I am pleased I \nhave from around the Great Lakes colleagues who are joining me in this \nimportant amendment.\n  I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for his assistance as well, \nSenator Reid, and colleagues and staff who have been involved in \nputting this critical amendment together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, 33 million people rely on the Great Lakes \nfor drinking water, including 10 million on Lake Michigan alone. \nMillions of people use our Great Lakes for recreation, such as \nswimming, fishing, and boating. It is simply irresponsible to risk \ncontamination of this source of drinking water and a large portion of \nour tourism industry and our recreation without studying the potential \ndamages of drilling.\n  Our pristine Great Lakes' coastlines are home to wetlands, over 400 \nof them along Lake Michigan alone, and to some of the world's most \nspectacular sand dunes. They are home to endangered species. Even \nadvocates of drilling acknowledge that some damage at the shoreline is \ninevitable from more and more slant drilling. It just is not worth the \npotential harm for the small amount of oil that could be produced in \nthe Great Lakes. That is all we are talking about, a very small drop in \na very large bucket, taking risks that we should not be taking with \nabout 20 percent of the world's supply of fresh water.\n  The Great Lakes are a shared natural resource. That means that many \nof the States need to work together in order to protect them. What that \nalso means is that if we are going to protect them, we must work at a \nbroader level than just one State. That is why Governors of many States \nhave stated their opposition to drilling of the kind which is being \nproposed.\n  One of our highest priorities in the Great Lakes area is to protect \nthe ecological health of the Great Lakes and the economic and \nrecreational value of our lands, our wetlands, our beaches, and our \nshorelines.\n  This amendment would accomplish that goal. I hope this body will \nsupport the amendment. I believe most of the Senators from the Great \nLakes States support the amendment. It is an issue which is much \nbroader than one State. We should be very leery, and very careful, \nbefore action is taken without adequate study of slant drilling beneath \nthe Great Lakes because of the potential ecological damage that could \nbe done, particularly along our shorelines.\n\n  For that reason, I hope this body will give a strong endorsement to \nthe amendment of Senator Stabenow. It is the cautious, conservative \nthing to do. It does not jeopardize more than a minute amount of our \nenergy supply,\n\n[[Page S7741]]\n\nand it does that for a very good cause--the protection of one of the \nworld's truly great natural assets, the source of about 20 percent of \nthe world's fresh water.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have conferred with the two managers, and \nSenators Stabenow, Levin, and Fitzgerald who have an interest in this \nissue. We are confident we will resolve the issue. We have staff now \nworking on preparing the necessary amendment, and we will do that \nsubject to the approval of the movers of this amendment. In the \nmeantime, we ask that we move off this amendment, that it be set aside, \nand that we move to Senator Hatch, who wants to move to the bankruptcy \nbill, which is now part of the order before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the bankruptcy bill----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, may I have 30 seconds before we do that?\n  I want to clear up the record. We have not spoken yet. This idea \nabout drilling in the Great Lakes is not part of President Bush's \nenergy policy. So we are not here arguing that the President should not \nget what he wants; their policy does not involve the notion of drilling \nin the Great Lakes. We are trying to put something together that would \nbe a moratorium that would be satisfactory to the Great Lakes' \nSenators. We should have that ready soon, which we will be willing to \naccept and go to conference and do everything we can to keep it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Domenici and Senator \nReid and also the sponsor of this amendment, Senator Stabenow. I have \nbeen pleased to support this amendment, which would place a moratorium \non drilling for oil in the Great Lakes. As a Senator from a State which \nhas a large urban area--namely, the city of Chicago--and the \nsurrounding communities that rely on Great Lakes water for drinking \nwater, I think this moratorium is well advised.\n  Illinois, as a practical matter, doesn't allow any drilling off its \nLake Michigan coast. The issue has arisen, however, in Senator \nStabenow's State. I think this amendment has worked out very well. I \nappreciate Senator Domenici's commitment to work to try to hold this \namendment in conference.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to thank Senator Domenici and \nSenator Reid for working with us on this amendment to put together \nsomething that is a reasonable moratorium while a study is being \nconducted by the Army Corps of Engineers. As my friend from Illinois \nmentioned, this is important to all of us in the Great Lakes. We want \nto make sure that wise decisions are made. And for those of us in \nMichigan, we are extremely concerned about any effort to move ahead now \nwith drilling in oil and gas reserves.\n  I thank my colleagues and I look forward to working with them to make \nsure this language moves all the way through the process and, in fact, \nbecomes law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend Senators Stabenow and Fitzgerald \nand all the cosponsors of this amendment. It is a very reasonable \noutcome that has been agreed to. Their leadership is really important \nin getting this done. We are very grateful for the support of Senator \nReid and Senator Domenici for this outcome and their commitment to \nfight for the Senate position in conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Stabenow's \namendment. This amendment simply asks that a study be conducted on the \nenvironmental effects of drilling in the Great Lakes. And to give that \nstudy time to be completed, a moratorium be placed on drilling for the \nnext 2 years.\n  Before we put in jeopardy one of the world's largest bodies of \nfreshwater, it is sound public policy that we first have a better \nunderstanding of the impact drilling would have on the Great Lakes.\n  After all, the Great Lakes contain 20 percent of the world's \nfreshwater and 95 percent of the freshwater in the United States. The \nGreat Lakes contain 6 quadrillion gallons of freshwater--only the polar \nice caps and Lake Baikal in Siberia contain more.\n  Preserving our world's supply of freshwater is becoming increasingly \nimportant as the population grows. Think of it this way, if you put all \nthe water in the world in a 1 gallon container, 1 tablespoon of that \nwould represent all the freshwater in the world. And \\1/5\\ of that \ntablespoon would represent the freshwater from the Great Lakes.\n  Lake Michigan alone provides safe drinking water for more than 10 \nmillion people every day. More than 33 million people live in the Great \nLakes basin.\n  In addition to providing vital drinking water, the Great Lakes are a \nsource of a thriving tourism industry, and provide ecological diversity \nand habitat for migratory waterfowl and fish.\n  Last week, the Senate passed my amendment to the Interior spending \nbill to prevent energy developing in our national monuments. Much like \nour national monuments, the Great Lakes will do little to add to our \nenergy independence.\n  The 13 directionally drilled wells on the Michigan shore (7 of which \nare still in operation) have produced, since 1979, less than half a \nmillion barrels of oil. In contrast, the United States consumes more \nthan 18 million barrels of oil a day, according to the American \nPetroleum Institute. So all the oil drilled from the Great Lakes in the \npast 20 years has amounted to less than 1 hour's worth of U.S. oil \nconsumption.\n  As many as 30 new wells have been proposed for oil drilling under \nLake Michigan and Lake Huron. Even if we produced 30 times as much oil \nfrom these new wells as we have from the older ones, it wouldn't supply \nenough crude oil to keep the United States running for one day.\n  A serious accident could contaminate Lake Michigan and put at risk \nthe drinking water used by millions of people from Illinois, Michigan, \nand Wisconsin. Putting our Nation's largest supply of fresh water at \nrisk for less than a day's worth of oil makes no sense.\n  Modern technology may reduce the chances for a bad oil spill, but \nthere are always uncontrollable factors, as we saw with the Exxon \nValdez. Who would have thought that just one tanker could do so much \ndamage? The Exxon Valdez measured 986 feet long--about the size of \nthree football fields. But it spilled 10.8 million gallons of oil. It \naffected about 1,300 miles of shoreline. And it cost about $2.1 billion \nfor Exxon to cleanup.\n  Proponents of drilling in the Great Lakes focus on the revenues to be \ngained or the oil to be produced. Sensible expansion of crude oil \nproduction can be a valuable component of a new energy strategy. But we \nshould focus also on improved energy efficiency and target production \nin areas where the environmental risks are not as great.\n  Let's take care to protect our natural resources, and explore for oil \nand gas in environmentally safe locations. There is no sound reason to \nput the Great Lakes at risk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7741-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7741-S7789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   BANKRUPTCY ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2001--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I understand the Chair ruled in my favor on the point of order. \nI am glad that the Chair did so.\n  Let me be real clear about this amendment. There is no delay \nwhatsoever. This is one amendment. There could be many amendments. This \nis one amendment. We have had Senators on both sides of this question. \nSome of us have argued very much in the positive about this \nlegislation, and some of us have argued very much in the negative about \nthis legislation.\n  Let the General Accounting Office take a look at this 2 years from \nnow and give us a careful evaluation about how it is working, look at \nits impact on chapter 7, look at its impact on chapter 13, look at its \nimpact on low- and moderate-income citizens, look at its impact on \nchildren and single-parent families. That is all my amendment says.\n  I say to colleagues, if I am wrong about this legislation, which I \nbelieve is unbelievably harsh, which I think is a testimony to the \npower of the financial service industry, I will be pleased to be wrong. \nBut if my colleagues are wrong, they are going to want to know they are \nwrong. They are going to want to know what the impact is. I hope \nSenators will vote for this amendment.\n  All it calls for is a General Accounting Office study.

I rise in opposition to this \namendment. I will be very short, and we can go to the vote.\n  Senator Wellstone's amendment, which I am sure is well intended, is \nboth dilatory and duplicative. Section 205 of the Senate bill also \nincludes a GAO study on the reaffirmation process. This amendment was \noffered by Senators Leahy and Reid and agreed to by unanimous consent \njust before final passage of the bankruptcy bill on March 15.\n  At this point, this boils down to a question of both process and \nsubstance. Again, final passage should mean final passage. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on this amendment for these simple reasons.\n  I am prepared to go to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Utah, he is \nabsolutely right, the legislation does call for some studies, but there \nis nothing in the legislation that calls for a GAO study of all of the \nissues I indicated which are terribly important in understanding \nwhether this legislation works. That is all I am saying. Let's at least \nhave a policy evaluation to see how this works. I certainly hope \ncolleagues will support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n977. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD (when his name was called). Present.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Otherwise, your obligations will be determined by the \n     reaffirmation agreement which may have changed the terms of \n     the original agreement.

A ``lien'' is often referred to as a security \n     interest, deed of trust, mortgage or security deed. Even if \n     you do not reaffirm and your personal liability on the debt \n     is discharged, because of the lien your creditor may still \n     have the right to take the security property if you do not \n     pay the debt or default on it. If the lien is on an item of \n     personal property that is exempt under your State's law or \n     that the trustee has abandoned, you may be able to redeem the \n     item rather than reaffirm the debt. To redeem, you make a \n     single payment to the creditor equal to the current value of \n     the security property, as agreed by the parties or determined \n     by the court.'.\n       ``(ii) In the case of a reaffirmation under subsection \n     (m)(2), numbered paragraph 6 in the disclosures required by \n     clause (i) of this subparagraph shall read as follows:\n       `` `6.

Madam President, it is my understanding that we are now \nback on the energy and water appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, be recognized to speak on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the managers of \nthe energy and water appropriations bill for their commitment to \nrenewable energy. I particularly want to thank Senator Reid for his \nleadership in bringing additional funding to advance the cause of clean \nenergy in this Nation.\n  Growing problems associated with fossil fuel energy use, including \nfine particulates and global warming, make it critically important that \nrenewable energy play a much larger part in future energy needs.\n  Each year, the important role renewable energy should play in meeting \nour future energy needs becomes more apparent. This year 61 Senators \njoined Senator Bingaman and myself in requesting an increase for \nrenewable energy in this year's budget. I am happy to say that this is \nseven more Senators than we had last year.\n  I am also happy to say that Chairman Reid and Ranking Member Domenici \nprovided almost $60 million more than last year for renewable energy \nand $160 million more than was requested by the administration. They \nrecognize the importance of renewable energy and once again \ndemonstrated their strong Senate leadership on this issue.\n  For many years, I have come to this Chamber to offer an amendment on \nrenewable energy. This year is the second year in a row that I come to \nask Members to praise--not raise--the renewable energy budget. This is \na practice to which I could easily become accustomed to.\n  There is perhaps no better time to push these technologies forward. \nOur Nation is focused on energy issues unlike it was in the last \ndecade. We are at crossroads where we can begin to see the end of the \npath toward a clean, sustainable energy future. Renewable energy is the \nmost important landmark on that path.\n  Today, renewables are beginning to take hold. Our faith in these \nclean energy sources has not been without merit. Wind power, for \nexample, is the fastest growing form of energy in the world. In the \nUnited States, my home\n\n[[Page S7790]]\n\nState of Vermont is a leader in the use of wind power. My wind energy \nbill with representatives Blanchard and Mineta started this program in \nthe late 1970's. Worldwide almost 4,000 megawatts of new wind energy \ncapacity were added in the year 2000. This year will likely see a \nsimilar, if not larger increase.\n  Although much of that capacity was added outside the United States, \nmany of the high-tech jobs needed to make that possible came from \ninside the United States. And as the use of wind energy goes up, the \ncosts will only come down. The best news of all is that our own wind \nresources remain largely untapped.\n  Other forms of renewable energy--such as solar, biomass and \ngeothermal--have the same kinds of benefits:\n  These technologies provided high-tech jobs for U.S. workers.\n  They help reduce acid rain and other forms of air pollution, \nincluding greenhouse gas emissions.\n  They are not subject to the kinds of supply changes that lead to \nlarge fluctuations in the price of fossil fuels and they help us reduce \nour dependence on foreign sources of fossil fuels.\n  This is good for the health of citizens and for the health of our \neconomy.\n  I thank Senators Reid and Domenici, once again, for their leadership \non this issue. I will continue to assist in whatever way I can to \nensure that the strong statement made by the Senate today will be \nincluded in the final energy and water appropriations bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say to my friend from Vermont, there are \na lot of reasons that we increased the funding for renewables, but \nthere is no reason more than the diligence the Senator from Vermont has \nshown over the past several years on this issue. As a result of his \ntenacity, every year we have had to increase the funding in this bill.\n  Senator Domenici and I thought: We are not going to do this anymore. \nThe Senator should know his handprints are all over this part of the \nbill dealing with renewables. But for his efforts, it would not be \nhere.\n  I am a real believer in renewables. Any long-term energy policy we \nare going to have in this country will not be successful unless a large \nsegment of it deals with renewables. I express my appreciation to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I thank the Senator for those kind \ncomments, and I assure him I will continue to work to improve our \nsituation in this regard.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 987, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there is a matter pending. The Senator \nfrom Michigan has a modification to her amendment to have the amendment \naccepted.\n  On behalf of Senator Domenici and myself, I send a modification to \nthe amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 18, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``, of which such sums as are necessary shall be \n     used by the Secretary of the Army to conduct and submit to \n     Congress a study that examines the known and potential \n     environmental effects of oil and gas drilling activity in the \n     Great Lakes (including effects on the shorelines and water of \n     the Great Lakes): Provided, That during the fiscal years 2002 \n     and 2003, no Federal or State permit or lease shall be issued \n     for oil and gas slant, directional, or offshore drilling in \n     or under 1 or more of the Great Lakes (including in or under \n     any river flowing into or out of the lake)''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I inquire of the Senator from Nevada, \nis this the amendment we worked out when we put in a quorum call?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from New Mexico, that is right. Our \nstaffs have done just exactly what we asked them to do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Not only do we not have any objection, but we think it \nis a good compromise and ought to be accepted. We will do our best in \nconference to retain it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I thank my colleagues and leader who \nare working so hard. I very much appreciate both Senator Reid and \nSenator Domenici working with us to fashion a 2-year ban on any \ndrilling of oil and gas in the Great Lakes, coupled with a study that \nwould be commenced by the Army Corps of Engineers as to the \nenvironmental impacts of any future drilling.\n  I am very appreciative of the leadership on both sides of the aisle \nfrom our colleagues and their willingness to work with me to make sure \nthe Senate language is adopted by the Congress in the conference \ncommittee.\n  I also thank staff who have worked very hard on this amendment--\nSander Lurie, Noushin Jahanian, and my chief of staff, Jean Marie \nNeal--for all their hard work.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, it is my understanding Senator Reid \nwas on the floor with reference to the amendment regarding the Great \nLakes. It was his and my understanding we had agreed to that amendment. \nI think we stopped short of the magic words ``agreeing'' to it.\n  I indicate there is no further debate on the amendment, and we yield \nback all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n987, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 987), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment \nwas agreed to and I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have the bill before the Senate and \nhave recently accepted an amendment, and we have had a number of \nstatements on the bill. Senator Domenici and I hope to move forward \nwith amendments. I have spoken to the Senator from Idaho who has an \namendment to offer, although he will not offer it this evening. We are \nwaiting for him to offer that amendment.\n  Senator Domenici and I will be patient for the next little bit, but \ntomorrow afternoon if we do not have people offering amendments, we \nwill move to third reading. It is not fair to everyone else. I say to \nmy friends in the minority, they have been very anxious to move forward \non nominations. We have the President's choice to lead his consumer \nsafety board and we have agreed to go forward on that. It has been \nreported out of the committee. We have a time set for debating that \nnomination. That cannot take place until we finish this bill.\n  In addition to that, Senator Daschle wants to work on the \nTransportation appropriations bill. We have a number of things we need \nto do this week. We are not accomplishing them now. Part of it is not \nthe fault of the minority or the majority who have interests in this \nbill. Part of the problem is having been interrupted by the bankruptcy \nlegislation which takes our eye off the mark. We are back on it now and \nthere is nothing to take us off this until we complete the bill.\n  We have submitted an unanimous consent agreement not on a filing \ndeadline for amendments but, rather, a finite list of amendments. That \nis now being circulated. We hope that can be approved.\n  As chairman of this subcommittee and also the Transportation \nSubcommittee under the Environment and Public Works Committee, I spend \na lot of my time thinking about and worrying about the State of our \nNation's physical infrastructure. The American Society of Civil \nEngineers' 2001 report card for America's infrastructure gives the \nNation's infrastructure a cumulative grade of D+. That is pretty low. \nThe two prime reasons for the rating include explosive population \ngrowth, lack of current investment, and growing obsolescence of an \naging system, identified as problems in California and in the Nation's \ndecaying water structure. We have created some of the problems in \nWashington by setting, for example, water quality standards that\n\n[[Page S7791]]\n\nrural America simply does not have the money to meet. With these \nproblems, our infrastructure is in a deep state of distress.\n  In Nevada, we are witnessing these problems on a daily basis. We have \nthe most urban State in America. It is surprising to people when they \nlearn Nevada is more urban than California, Illinois, Michigan, New \nYork, and Florida. The reasons for that is 90 percent of the people \nlive in the metropolitan areas of Las Vegas and Reno. Only 10 percent \nof the people live outside those metropolitan areas. However, in that \n10 percent, it is very rural and it is an example of what we have in \nrural America.\n  The growth in the Las Vegas area has been phenomenal. We are having \nto build schools, roads, water systems, and all other basic \ninfrastructure for modern life for the exploding population. We are \nhaving trouble keeping up. We have to build one school each month to \nkeep up with the growth of school districts. We were the sixth largest \nschool district a few months ago; we are now the fifth largest school \ndistrict. There were 240,000 students in that school district, one new \nschool each month. We hold the record in America for dedicating 18 new \nschools in one year.\n  The superintendent of education in Clark County where Las Vegas is \nlocated it not a superintendent of education; that person is a \nsuperintendent of construction. He spends a great deal of his time \nsimply dealing with construction\n  At the same time, smaller communities throughout rural Nevada do not \nhave clean drinking water due to natural contaminants in the ground \nwater. The costs for moving the contaminants is several times the \nannual budgets of most small communities. Flooding problems throughout \nNevada continue to devastate lives and property. As I said yesterday, \npeople wonder, how can you have flooding problems in Nevada?\n  The Senator from Washington, the Presiding Officer, knows the whole \nState of Washington is not like Seattle, but as you move east in the \nState of Washington it becomes much the same as some parts of Nevada. I \ndon't know if it could be called desert, but it sure doesn't rain very \nmuch so the Presiding Officer understands what I am talking about when \nI talk about the fact that these rural, arid areas can suffer from real \nflood problems. It happens. When the rains come the waters come, and \nthey cause all kinds of degradation to property and sometimes lives are \nlost.\n  Environmental projects are sorely needed when we restore the natural \nareas of our environment, not only in Nevada but all over the country. \nOur Nation's medium and large cities have similar problems as well. \nHartford, Atlanta, Chicago, and Richmond have antiquated storm systems \nthat allow sewage and storm water runoff to be collected by the same \nsystem and sent to a treatment plant. During heavy rains, these systems \nare overwhelmed and raw sewage is dumped into our Nation's waterways.\n  Many of our citizens still live with the threat of flooding. \nEnvironmental restorations of degraded ecosystems are needed throughout \nour country. The infrastructure that makes up our inland and coastal \nwaterways is really aging. The Corps of Engineers operates 276 \nnavigation locks at 230 sites around the country. One hundred fifty of \nthese locks are more than 50 years old. Nearly 100 of the remaining \nlocks are nearly 25 years old. Most of these structures continue to \nperform as designed, but evidence of the need for reconstruction and \nmodernization is becoming, very evident. Some facilities have reached \ntheir capacity and have reached the end of their design lives.\n  The Army Corps has been serving our Nation's infrastructure needs for \nmore than 200 years, primarily in the areas of navigation and flood \ncontrol. While some may quibble with individual projects that Congress \ninstructs the Corps to undertake, no one can question the value that \nthe Corps has historically played and continues to play in our Nation's \ndevelopment. However, we are slowly but surely strangling the Corps and \nour Nation's infrastructure to death with our fiscal inattention.\n  Financial shortfalls year in and year out in the water accounts of \nthe Army Corps have now resulted in the backlog of $40 billion in \nauthorized projects. They are awaiting the first dollar of funding; $40 \nbillion of authorized projects have yet to receive their first dollar \nof funding.\n  This shortfall just takes into account the Corps' historic missions \nof navigation and flood control and does not take into account some of \nthe new directions Congress has pushed the Corps in recent years. It is \nwrong to give short shrift to important components of our Nation's \ninfrastructure. Flood control projects protect human lives and \nproperty. Navigation projects ensure that our Nation's economic engine \ncontinues to hum.\n  We have received some criticism in this bill that we spent too much \nmoney on dredging, having water areas made clear so dredges can come up \nand down. There are examples given that a lot of these projects that we \nhave, there is not much commerce moving. But think what it would do if \nwe did not have this barge traffic. It would only add to the trains \nthat are already overwhelmed. It would only add to the number of \ntrucks, and in my opinion there are too many of them on the roads \nanyway. So we have to understand that these projects are important.\n\n  In the western United States, the Bureau of Reclamation is facing \nsimilar issues as the Army Corps, an aging inventory of projects and a \nshrinking budget. Many do not realize Reclamation has been around for \nalmost 100 years. Next year will be the 100th anniversary of the first \never Bureau of Reclamation project. It took place in Nevada. It was the \nNewlands Project named after the Nevada Congressman and it was to \nsupposedly make the desert blossom like a rose.\n  A few problems developed as it was blossoming. It dried up one river. \nLake Winnemucca is as dry as this table. Pyramid Lake is beautiful. \nThere are only 21 lakes like it in the world, desert terminus lakes. We \nhave two of them in Nevada. It almost dried up, but it is now on the \nroad to recovery because of actions taken by this Congress to reverse \nsome of the bad parts of the Newlands Act. But the Army Corps does the \nbest it can, as has been said, with the tools it has.\n  The Newlands Project has done good for Nevada but also bad. We have \nto keep changing these projects. I cannot imagine what this part of \nNevada would look like today without what has happened with water, but \nI can imagine what it used to look like with water going into these two \nlakes, one of which is now dried up.\n  Still, we continue to underinvest in both of these agencies. The need \nfor water for municipal and industrial uses is not declining. The need \nfor flood control is not declining. The need for a modern navigation \nsystem to transport products to market is not declining. Yet the \nbudgets of these two agencies seems to continue to dwindle.\n  For example, I talked about the Newlands Project. One hundred years \nago, people were enticed to come there. We said: This is going to be \ngreat for you and generations to come. People did come there. They have \nbeen farming for generations. Now the Federal Government has \ninterfered, causing a disruption in their lives. It is not the fault of \nthe farmers, but certainly the people who put in these reclamation \nprojects did not understand what the full brunt of these programs would \nbe.\n  So I repeat, we need to go back. We need to go back and review and \nchange some of these projects. We have not had the money in the past to \ndo that. We still don't. As I have indicated, we continue to \nunderinvest in both of these agencies.\n  The need for water for municipal and industrial uses is not \ndeclining. The need for flood control is not declining. The need for a \nmodern navigation system to transfer products to market is not \ndeclining. Yet the budgets of these two agencies continue to dwindle.\n  Public investment including authorization for water infrastructure in \n1960 amounted to 3.9 percent of the gross domestic product. Today that \nfigure is down to 2.6 percent, approximately. That may not sound like \nmuch of a change, but let's look at the Corps during that period.\n  In the mid-1960s, the country was investing $4.5 billion annually in \nnew water infrastructure. Today, it is less than $1.5 billion. That is \na significant change. From 1960 to now, we have gone from $4.5 billion \nto $1.5 billion. Our water resource needs are no less\n\n[[Page S7792]]\n\ntoday than they were 40 years ago; They are more. Yet we are investing \none-third as much.\n  One major impact of that reduction is the increasingly drawn out \nconstruction schedules forced by underfunding these projects. These \nartificially lengthened schedules cause a loss of some $5 billion in \nannual benefits and increase the cost of these products by some $500 \nmillion.\n\n  When many of these reclamation projects came into being, the main, \nthe only intent was for agricultural purposes. Over the years, it has \nbeen found that some areas are very interested in these reclamation \nprojects because of the recreation aspects of them. People like to \nwater ski. They like to fish. They like to boat. They like to have \npicnics on the beach. Now they are competing with these farming \nprojects. We need to go back and take a look at them.\n  These artificially lengthened schedules cause the loss, as I have \nindicated, of some $5 billion in benefits, either agricultural or \nrecreational, and increase the cost of these projects by some $500 \nmillion--and that is each year. Failure to invest in maintenance, major \nrehabilitation, research and development, and new infrastructure \nresulted in the gradual reduction in the value of our capital water \nresources stock and, in turn, the benefits we receive.\n  The value of the Corps' capital stock peaked in 1981 with a \nreplacement value of $150 billion. Today its estimated value has \ndecreased to $124 billion. We need to reverse this trend. Public \ninfrastructure is too important to our lives.\n  Federal waterway projects, including ports and inland waterways, \nhandle more than 2.2 billion tons of our Nation's cargo, valued at more \nthan $660 billion. As I said before, we could try to put that on \ntrains, on trucks, on airplanes--2.2 billion tons of our Nation's \ncargo. I do not think that would be a good idea.\n  These waterways generate more than 13 million jobs, and Federal taxes \ncollected at ports generate more than $150 billion a year. Federal \nflood control projects prevent more than $2 billion per year in \ndamages, and my being from Nevada, I can vouch for that. Even though \nLas Vegas gets 4 inches of rain a year, the flood control projects \nprobably save hundreds of millions of dollars more than that in \nproperty damage, loss of production, and certainly in lives.\n  Federal flood control projects prevent more than $2 billion per year \nin damages. Recreation provided by Federal water projects provide more \nthan 500,00 jobs and provide recreational opportunities to more than 10 \npercent of the U.S. population. Water stored at Federal projects \nprovides more than 250 million acre-feet of water for municipal, rural, \nand industrial users.\n  How much water is that? Las Vegas with 1.6 million people uses just a \nlittle more water than that. Two-hundred and fifty million acre-feet of \nwater is stored at Federal projects. That is important.\n  Finally, Federal water projects provide nearly 30 percent of our \nNation's hydropower or about 4 percent of our total electric capacity. \nIn the west, Federal hydropower project provide an even higher \npercentage of the total electric capacity--as we have recently learned \nwith the California energy crisis.\n  Public water infrastructure is the only Federal program that is \nrequired to be analyzed on a strict benefit to cost basis. The water \ninfrastructure provided by the Army corps alone provides an annual rate \nof return of approximately 26 percent. The steam of benefits are \nrealized as flood damages prevented, reduced transportation costs, \nelectricity, recreation, and water supply services.\n  Society's values are increasingly emphasizing sustainability and \necological considerations in water infrastructure management and \ndevelopment. Like most people, I support these considerations.\n  The Army corps and reclamation expend nearly a quarter of their \nannual budgets on environmental projects. These ranges from major \nrestoration projects such as the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration, \nto smaller projects, such as oyster recovery efforts in the Chesapeake \nBay. Both agencies will continue to meet the nation's challenges in \nthis arena.\n  As you can see, I am one who firmly believes that investments in our \nnation's infrastructure more than pay for themselves through improved \nproductivity and efficiency. To ignore these needs in the short term is \ngoing to cause us problems over the long haul.\n  All of this is to say that we, as a body, need to think about the \nstate of our nation's infrastructure comprehensively and soon.\n  Our physical infrastructure sustains our way of life, so we must \nsustain it.\n  We are here today to discuss energy and water matters, but, in the \nnext few weeks, I hope to come back to the floor to discuss our \nnation's transportation infrastructure, another area of concern.\n  Before I close, I want to say some words of praise for the Federal \nemployees and contractors that populate the departments, agencies, and \nother organizations that are funded under this bill.\n  Members of Congress are frequently critical of Federal agencies and \ndepartments, particularly ones where we have an oversight role. As I \nmentioned earlier, I have been a frequent critic of the Department of \nEnergy.\n  But I have said that I think things are greatly improving as a result \nof some work done by Senator Domenici and some of his colleagues.\n  None of that is to suggest that I, or any other Member, am anything \nother than proud of the hard work and accomplishments of our Federal \nworkforce, including, contractors, lab employees, and others that make \nthese important organizations run.\n  I invite everyone who has the opportunity--as I have had--to go to \nthe Federal Laboratories and some of our test sites where they have \ndone things relating to the cold war--places where Federal employees \nare in love with their jobs. They spend long hours with little \nrecognition. Many of these agencies, such as the Corps of Engineers, \nthe Bureau of Reclamation, and Department of Energy, that we fund in \nthis bill I think do a wonderful job. I have very few criticisms of the \nemployees. There is a tiny fraction--as in any organization--that tries \nto cause trouble to the whole organization, but as far as I am \nconcerned, they haven't succeeded.\n  I throw a bouquet to those entities funded within this bill, and I am \nvery proud of working with them. We expect a lot of these \norganizations. With very few exceptions, they live up to all of my \nexpectations and the demands we impose on them. I think they serve our \nNation with distinction. I think I speak for Senator Domenici when I \nsay we appreciate all the work they do.\n  My friend from New Mexico has been very patient with me. We are \nwaiting for somebody to come and offer the next amendment. The floor is \nopen. This is a good time to do it. After 5 o'clock, we are happy to \nwork, if the leader wants to work awhile tonight. But because I think \nwe are not coming in until 10:30 tomorrow because we have a special \norder in the morning dealing with our dear friend, Paul Coverdell, we \nare not going to be able to start on this bill until 10:30 in the \nmorning. I hope we can get some work done tonight.\n  I repeat that we are not going to be able to go to the nomination \nuntil we complete this bill. There are, I believe, 7 hours on it. All \nthat time probably won't be used. But then we have the Transportation \nappropriations bill on which we need to also work this week. I hope \nMembers will come and help work through this bill. If there are \nproblems, tell us. We have had a number of Members come to us during \nthe vote--some Democrat--and we have been able to recognize what the \nproblems are, and we have been able in most instances to satisfy the \nproblems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Let me say to the Republican Senators that it is important you begin \nto tell us what amendments you have. Obviously, we haven't been on this \nbill very long. For anybody who thinks we are wasting time, when you \nconsider all the time we took off this bill to do other things, we have \nbeen on it only a few hours. This is a serious bill with a lot of \nserious issues.\n  Once again, we are hopeful that Senators will be able to come up with \namendments. If in fact we can't complete that list this evening, we \nwill do\n\n[[Page S7793]]\n\nour best, and we will inform the distinguished chairman of our best \nefforts. For now, I once again ask if you have amendments, let us know \nthrough the Cloakroom. We can start listening. I think we only have a \nfew at this point. We have specifically requested amendments on our \nside.\n  I do not know about our distinguished friend, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee. Have you begun to accumulate a list? Is it small like our \nlist?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. We are getting our Senators to tell us what amendments \nthey want to offer. That is also being done on the other side. \nHopefully, within a short time we will have at least a finite list, and \nhopefully we will be able to work through that. Of course, our very \nable staff will work through them also. I hope we can have that done \npretty soon.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, let me proceed with some discussion while we wait for \nthe activities and desires of our Senators, both Democrat and \nRepublican.\n  First, I want to make a comment about the President's energy policy. \nThen I would like very much to talk about the future in terms of the \neconomies of the world, prosperity and growth, and how it is related to \nenergy, and how I see that future compared with others.\n  First, let me talk about the President's energy policy. It is \ncontained in notebook form. For anyone who wants to read it from cover \nto cover, it is a cover-to-cover approach. It covers almost every \nissue. They have assessed almost every kind of energy and conservation \nissue that I believe has been in or around Washington, or anywhere in \nthis Nation. They have begun to list what our energy needs of the \nfuture are and to come up with them in a rather basic way to let people \nchallenge what we need in the future. That is all well and good.\n  But essentially, I would like to make a point that has not been made \nvery often. If you look at the whole policy on energy that the \nPresident submitted to us--which was worked on for weeks on end by the \nVice President and a distinguished staff, some of whom used to serve us \nhere in the Senate--let's talk just a bit about how much new energy we \nare going to need out to 2020. They worked on it with economic experts, \nwith projectors of growth, and with those who could estimate the \nelectricity needs of our country for certain episodes during the next \n20 years.\n  The conclusion was that the current ratio between energy demand and \nthe gross domestic product might remain constant. Now gross domestic \nproduct is what we all reference to measure how much growth we have and \nhow much we grow is measured as an addition to gross domestic product. \nWhen it is growing over a sustained period of time at a powerful rate, \nin America we equate that with prosperity, with jobs, with more \nopportunity, and higher pay for those who are not earning so. I don't \nthink they have estimated the gross domestic product increase for the \nnext 20 years at any exceptional rate, but rather sustained--something \nlike blue chip experts estimate.\n  In doing that, we concluded we would need 77 percent more energy in \n2020 than we are producing today.\n  If we drew a pie chart of a certain size which showed how much we are \nusing today and then drew one around the outside, you would add 77 \npercent. Or you could take 2020 and draw one big pie. Then you would \nshow a piece of it that is current needs and another piece that is \nfuture. In any event, the piece that is future needs would be 77 \npercent more than we are using today.\n\n  Most interesting, this national energy policy recommends conservation \nand efficiency measures that would reduce that increase by over half, \nresulting in us only needing to produce 29 percent in real energy \nadditions.\n  The rest of it would be made up by enhancing and increasing our \nconservation and our efficiency. And there are numerous examples there \non how you would increase efficiency, which equals a lot of research on \nproducts that will use less, on conservation. All kinds of things that \nwe have already learned to do and are doing well, we would do more and \ndo better.\n  Frankly, the President and some of the President's spokesmen may have \nstarted off talking about supply. We might have gotten a little bit \nexcited about it. Some people in the country asked: What about \nconservation?\n  Well, I am just recalling, when it is all finally done, this is what \nit is: 77 percent new energy need; only 29 percent of it with new \npowerplants. They may use natural gas, which seems to be almost the \nsingular source of every new powerplant in the country, and that can't \ncontinue forever. We will have to do some others. There's not been many \nnew coal-burning powerplants, even though we are applying clean coal \ntechnology and, yes, not a new nuclear plant for two decades or so. But \neverything is moving in the direction of ``let's do it better.'' Let's \ndo it more efficiently; let's do it cleaner. And let's permit America \nto grow.\n  That is for starters. I am not changing any of that when I speak of \nthis bill being a very good start in implementing an energy policy that \nmoves us in the direction of diversity of energy, not just one kind; \ndiversity so there is competition; diversity so that, in fact, you can \naddress some overarching issues such as ambient air pollution that \nproduces global warming.\n  We ought to be able to address some of those issues in our future \nthinking, because they are caused by certain types of energy being used \nto produce our energy supply, by kinds that produce the carbon dioxide \nand other things that go into the atmosphere and cause pollution. What \nif we can produce energy that causes little or none of those gases or \nmuch less of those. You can understand that clearly we don't have to be \nworried about global warming to the extent that we reduce the very \nessence of global warming pollutants in the basic supply of energy for \nelectricity in our country.\n  Obviously, we are not talking as much about automobiles and their \npollution here, but clearly, it is a very powerful thing to just look \nat the electricity needs and see if we can do that in a way that truly \nhelps us with reference to global warming instead of hurting us.\n  There are a lot of people around that say there is a Kyoto agreement \nand we should follow it, even though the Senate voted about 2\\1/2\\ to 3 \nyears ago, 95-0, that the Senate would not ratify the Kyoto agreement \nif they sent it to us. It seems to me every time we get in this debate \nin this country and the President is talked to about Kyoto, or for \nthose who argue with him overseas, nobody even brings up the subject: \n``What about the Senate which voted 95-0 that we did not want to \nenforce that kind of program because it would put too much pressure on \nour future in terms of prosperity and, yes, indeed, may put a lot of \npressure on countries that truly need to build new electric \ngenerating capacity so they can prosper.''\n\n  What I am suggesting is, this bill moves in the direction of what we \nmight very well call ``beyond Kyoto'' or what we may call ``prosperity \nbeyond Kyoto.''\n  I will go through some of the very exciting things that are done in \nthis bill that permit us to move in the direction of having a mindset \nbeyond the Kyoto agreement, having a mindset for great prosperity for \nthe underdeveloped countries and the developed countries in terms of \nbeing able to use energy for growth and prosperity without concern \nabout global warming.\n  This is a pretty big vision, a pretty big idea, but frankly, I \nbelieve America should do it. I believe our President should take the \nlead.\n  I will go through a few things we are doing here and then fit them \ninto a wrap-up as to how that could be America's vision beyond Kyoto.\n  First, the renewable energy programs in this country have made great \nstrides in terms of innovation, proving concepts, but today it is still \na very small portion of the energy production in our country. We ought \nto do what we did in this bill--increase our focus on renewables, ask \nthat more be done in that area, and that it be part of a great \ninventory of potential products for this ``beyond Kyoto'' idea.\n  In this bill we made a good start. We funded renewable programs to \nthe tune of $435 million. This is not legislation saying we shall have \nsolar and who will do what. It just says we have these programs going, \nthe Department of Energy shall manage $435 million during this year for \nthe various renewable programs we have. That is 16 percent higher than \ncurrent levels. There is no\n\n[[Page S7794]]\n\nquestion that if we keep the pressure on and have a broader vision, \nthis would be part of what we can do better. We can impose on that kind \nof technology to do more.\n  Then there are hydrogen-based technologies. Some think the world \nought to be on a hydrogen diet for energy in the not too distant \nfuture, and some think it could be the basis for future growth \nprojections. I am not quite there yet, but clearly it belongs in the \nequation. We have added about 30 percent to the research in that area.\n  This might end up decreasing our use of petroleum products in \ntransportation, even though our basic agenda here is not with reference \nto the automobile and the internal combustion engine and the like. That \nresearch is largely being moved ahead in another appropriations bill.\n  High temperature superconductivity is important because it causes us \nto waste a lot less electricity as you run the electricity down the \nlines. Superconductivity would make it such that you would lose very \nlittle, if any, a very dramatic step forward. We have increased that \nabout 20 percent, hoping that our great scientists can move into \nsuperconductivity and capture some of the waste that now goes into \ntransmitting electricity--an exciting kind of idea.\n  Geothermal: We know there is a lot of it out there. We have added \nsome research money, although we have been doing this for many years; \nthat is, spending money on this system. We think we should try harder \nand do more.\n  Wind systems: They are already in existence. Now I am not one who \nthinks that wind energy can be as big a component of the future as \nothers, just because I have observed what we currently do and I can't \nvisualize doing 10 times as much or 50 times as much. But in any event, \nwe said let's proceed with a little more dispatch.\n  And then on the side that we would call nuclear: The problem is that \nwhen you say nuclear power, people think of driving by a nuclear \npowerplant. Incidentally, you don't see any smoke come out of the \nchimneys because there is none. You don't see any pollution because \nthere is none.\n  The spent fuel rods are inside that machine, and to the extent they \nare not careful with those, that creates some source of problem for \nhuman beings. But these are gigantic nuclear powerplants. They are \nalmost all of one type. It is amazing how the American people, over the \nlast 15 years, have grown more accustomed to driving by them and living \nwith them, such that today in America there is a willingness to take \nanother look at nuclear.\n  I know as soon as we take another look there will be those who would \nlike to blindfold us right now and say: ``Stop that. It is terrible, \nbad for everything.''\n  Let me tell you, it is not bad for global warming; I will guarantee \nyou that. If any group of environmentalists are really committed to \nsolving the problem of global warming, let them at least listen to a \nproposal that would bring the world into contact with a new generation \nof nuclear powerplants. We might be able to set a goal for 10 or 15 \nyears from now when we would be diminishing the pollution that would be \ncommensurate with that growth, as far as global warming is concerned.\n  Why should that be dismissed when it is that profound and gigantic a \npotential? Why would we dismiss clean coal, moving it to the furthest \nlevel of cleanliness, even if it costs a lot of money to do the \nresearch? Why would we say that would not work? What are we supposed to \nlive on?\n  Right now, people would say: Your State will continue to flourish, \nSenator Domenici. Natural gases will do it. New Mexico is the fourth \nlargest producer, and it is going up and away. Every new powerplant we \nhave heard of, including the three in New Mexico--that won't be for our \npeople but for somebody else--will be built with natural gas, as far as \nwe know. We didn't have any for many years. The price is causing people \nto invest in natural gas. For the long term, you need natural gas, but \nyou also need some other things.\n  What does this bill do about nuclear? Well, first, there are some \nvery significant increases and some very interesting approaches to \nkeeping this option alive. For the 21 percent that we already get from \nnuclear power today, we need to make sure we don't close those plants \ndown prematurely but continue them for their entire useful life and do \nwhat we can to make sure that transition is smooth, functional, and \nsafe.\n  Now, let me go through some of the things we are doing to create this \noption. This bill pushes nuclear power forward with the following \ninitiatives: $19 million for university research reactor support--that \nis a $7 million increase--to make sure our country has the educational \nresources necessary for an economy that continues to rely substantially \non nuclear power--the old ones plus new ones. After all, we came up \nwith this technology. Some of our great companies built these \npowerplants. They are all over the world, although we didn't build all \nof them in foreign countries\n  Seventy-eight percent of France's electricity comes from nuclear \npower. If you tell people that, they say they don't believe it, or so \nwhat? Well, they have a lot less problems with greenhouse gases than we \ndo--sufficiently less that Mr. Chirac can lecture our President about \nit. That is pretty interesting. If we had 68 or 70 percent of our \nelectricity from nuclear plants, we might be lecturing him. But we \ndon't; we have 21 percent. Germany has around 35 percent, and Japan is \nbuilding new ones--in fact, as we speak, they are building new ones.\n  The United States is sitting on this problem of not having enough \nenergy so we can maintain our prosperity in the future. We say our \nuniversities used to be the pride of the world in terms of creating \nnuclear physicists and design engineers who worked in this field. All \nof the universities, except a few, have dramatically reduced these \nprograms and are very excited about building some of this back into \ntheir programs through intramural-type grant programs, where they can \ndo research and learn these particular scientific professions.\n\n  There is a $4 million increase in a program to improve the \nreliability of our 103 existing nuclear powerplants. Let me suggest \nanother thing that is little known. While we had some brownouts in \nCalifornia and some shortages elsewhere, they were minimized because \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the nuclear powerplant industry \nin America had been working so well together, and the licensing process \nand the regulatory processed worked so well during the last decades, \nthat more energy was produced by the nuclear powerplants by upping \ntheir capacity in total safety, such that, on average, they increased \nby the equivalent of 22 new powerplants. Nobody knows that, but that \nhappened.\n  So while we are looking around for new sources, these licensed \nfacilities, getting up in years, ratcheted up a bit and produced the \nenergy equivalent of 22 new nuclear powerplants on top of the 100-plus \nwe have in the United States.\n  This bill continues with an increase of $7 million for a total of $14 \nmillion, in an area which is very exciting. I hope it will be used \nprudently. In fact, I hope it will be used to join with partners in the \nworld to produce something really important. This is for the next \ngeneration of nuclear reactors. Some people call it generation IV \nreactors. There are a couple of them in the design stage today, and \nsome people have read about them. They are very exciting new \ntechnology.\n  They are going to produce nuclear reactors that are passively safe. \nThat means that their makeup, in terms of the physics, is such that \nthey can't melt down. They will not have a meltdown possibility in the \ngeneration IV reactors that will be produced. In addition, they will \nhave much less left over, much less unused, enriched uranium, so there \nis much less risk. This reduces greatly the proliferation concerns, \nwith reference to the byproduct from the reactors.\n  This bill also addresses the Nuclear Regulatory Commission--which, \nincidentally, has been doing an outstanding job. The chairman now is a \nDemocrat appointee. We urged the President to keep him on. He has been \nso exciting and powerful and such a force in terms of leading that \nNuclear Regulatory Commission in the right direction toward the safety \nand well-being of our people, and maintaining the essence of our \nnuclear industry. We\n\n[[Page S7795]]\n\nhope he is going to remain as the chairman. Now, I don't think I was \nsaying anything out of school there. I think the chairman knows what is \nthought of him. I think I may have indicated that he is going to stay \non and he wants to stay on.\n  Remember, just a few years ago we didn't have any money in these \nprograms that I am talking about. We decided it was best to have an \nEnergy Department for this great United States. But back then, when you \nwalked in the door, what we wanted was no nuclear energy and nothing \nnuclear in the Department of Energy for the greatest nation on Earth. \nThat is the end to which we had gone in terms of our anti-nuclear-power \nsentiments. I am not exaggerating; that is a truism.\n  I was fortunate to be chairman of the subcommittee for 6 years. My \ngood friend was ranking member part of the time--Senator Reid. We \nstarted to build a little bit of nuclear energy capacity back up, so \nthat now they are no longer ashamed. Obviously, they have divisions and \ndepartments that are doing nuclear work, so they can't hide anymore. I \nthink they are very forward-thinking about it.\n  But just remember, with generation IV we are not talking about the \nkind of reactors we have now, although they are pretty safe and people \nnow are excited about how clean they are.\n  The only thing people who oppose nuclear power are saying is: What \nabout the waste that comes out of them? We are doing well when we can \nproduce energy that will no longer cause any global warming, but we \nhave a problem of how do we get rid of the waste. Just think of this. \nWhat is the dimension of this problem?\n  I want to speak of it in physical dimensions. A football field--you \nhave a number in your great State, Mr. President. A football field 12 \nfeet deep is the waste problem of America. That is how big it is. When \npeople scare us to death about it, the truth is, it is just a matter of \nhuman beings deciding with technical excellence, engineering expertise, \nand resources what to do about that. You can either bury it, put it \naway for an interim period of time, or change it from its current form \nto another.\n\n  In Europe, they are not in a hurry to bury it permanently. They are \ndoing other things with it--interim storage--and they are moving ahead \nwith other technologies to make the end product far less toxic.\n  This bill says we are not going to fund Yucca Mountain, the permanent \nrepository, as much as we have in the past. Although we will go to \nconference, where the House has a higher number to keep it going. We \nwill have that debate in conference, and we do not always win every \nnickel and every penny. So we are looking forward to going to \nconference and seeing what can be done.\n  There are two other technologies that are right there ready to go. \nOne of them is called accelerator transmutation. This is very exciting \nnew technology, proven out beyond the experimental stage, and we have \n$70 million to continue the work.\n  It is an accelerator, therefore it is not a nuclear reactor, that \nwill change what high-level waste is as this accelerator does its work \non the waste product. Ultimately, just to make it simple, what it will \nproduce is a residue that instead of having a half-life in the \nneighborhood of tens of thousands of years, the residue will have a \nhalf-life in the neighborhood of 700 years. After 300 years, it would \nbe no more dangerous than uranium ore from the ground.\n  If we can get a byproduct like that, there is nobody who would stand \nup and say we cannot handle that. What is difficult to handle is \nproving modular-wise and scientific-wise what will happen 10,000 years \nfrom now when we put something underground and leave it there. That is \nwhat makes the problem and the job for nuclear power of the future a \ndifficult one. I repeat. We are singularly the only country saying \nlet's put it underground and forget about it forever, when it has only \nused up 5 percent of its energy. Ninety-five percent of the energy is \nstill in the rod that you put in the ground.\n  So true and so powerful is that statement that you cannot talk to the \nRussian leaders at any level about energy. You cannot talk to any of \nthem about getting rid of the waste product in any way other than using \nit, which is amazing. As a matter of fact, they just put out word the \nother day that if we are so frightened about the waste product, they \nwould accept it. Nobody is seriously thinking about that, although \nmaybe some are. But it just shows you the difference, the mentality \nbetween those who have worked that problem in Russia. Some of them \nlearned from us; we learned some from them.\n  They had the greatest nuclear scientists; we had the greatest. We \nnever did decide who had the best. They both had so much respect for \neach other in nuclear weaponry; I think that kept us from ever having \nwar. You can bet the greatest scientists working on our nuclear weapons \nknew exactly who the greatest scientists were over there. And they were \nthe greatest. They were not just getting a degree in physics and going \nover and taking on a program. They were fantastic people. That \nexpertise has come down to nuclear reactor waste and they understand \nit. They even moved to the next generation of nuclear power, breeder \nreactors, which we have become so frightened about that even Senator \nDomenici does not talk about it. So we moved to an interim discussion \nof the kind of nuclear reactors we are talking about today.\n  We have transmutation, a big word which means changing the makeup and \ncontent of this product into something far less toxic.\n\n  Incidentally, it has two other uses that are very positive that come \nout of this accelerator process, one of which is to produce all the \nradioactive isotopes you need for the medical programs of the country. \nOne of these major accelerators would provide all you need.\n  Plus another use that is rather significant would be to back up our \ntritium production; it will do that, too. We are currently going to use \nreactors to do that job. Under Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson we \ndecided to do it down in Tennessee at one of their TVA nuclear \nreactors. So that is where the tritium in the program will be produced. \nThis could even be a backup for that reactor in the event we moved \nahead.\n  Some people talk about the estimated costs of transmutation. They use \nthe numbers wrong because the total number over a long period of time, \nwhen they tell you how much that is, does not take into consideration \nhow much electricity it produces. It is just telling you what it costs. \nThat would be like saying the next 10 nuclear powerplants, my gosh, are \ngoing to cost $1.5 billion each, but you don't know how much \nelectricity it produces. You just hold to the $15 billion number.\n  Let me emphasize I want to stop using the word ``waste'' and use \n``spent fuel'' because I just gave you an example of how much of the \nenergy is still in the spent fuel. It is 95 percent. It is still energy \nthat can be used. As long as we have cheap uranium, it is obvious we \nare not going to go full speed ahead to produce byproducts that cost a \nlot of money. In the process we do know these are some of the \napproaches to making sure we have options in the future.\n  To wrap up the vision, the vision is to take these resources and \nothers the administration might need to ask us for and produce a \ncommitment by the United States of America, led by our President, to \nput together a 10-, 15-, or 20-year plan that says ``beyond Kyoto'' and \nsay to the world: ``Let's bring together the electricity-producing \nresources we have been discussing--renewables, biomass, clean coal, \nnuclear--let's bring them together and decide in a scheduled approach \nto begin to produce them so that we can begin to use them in the world \nwithout any effect on global warming.\n  It is very doable. We ought to be excited about it. It means this \nproblem in America might have brought out the best in us. We may be \nable to tell poor countries with these new reactors that we can put one \nin every country. They will be very small. They will be modular in \nsize. Perhaps they will be 50 megawatts each instead of 1,000 \nmegawatts. Perhaps they have the characteristics I described here. But \nlet's set the world under our leadership to working on these kind of \ncriteria and then develop the science and technology with our \nbusinesses and other countries to do it.\n\n[[Page S7796]]\n\n  I have asked the President to think about this. I call it now \n``reaching beyond Kyoto,'' but it may be ``prosperity in abundance for \neveryone post-Kyoto.'' It may be an equal title because if, in fact, we \nhave to restrain the growth substantially because the energy source is \npolluting and thus causes some problems with reference to global \nwarming, then it is an admission that other people cannot become as \nwealthy as we are; that they cannot have as many things as we have.\n  We constantly remind the world how much energy we use, and, yes, we \ndo; we use more than any other country. We use maybe 25 percent. But \nthis little country, America, also produces about 25 percent of the \ngross domestic product of the world, too.\n  We have a chance to reach beyond this bill, beyond the discussions \nabout an energy policy in detail with reference to each of these \ndifferent things on transmission lines, using the public domain for \nmore gas and oil, and to set a goal beyond all of that which would say \nto the United States and the world: You can almost pick your resource \nbecause if you do not have any coal, you can use uranium; you can use \nthese new fourth-generation reactors. If you have coal, we are \ndeveloping the cleanest of coal technology so you can use that, be a \nnonpolluter and grow.\n  I think it makes a lot of sense. I am pleased to have thought it \nthrough a little bit and to have spoken to it a couple times. The \nSenator can tell I might have spoken about it one time or another. Yes, \nI have. It is a pretty good message to be accompanying an energy and \nwater bill if, in fact, this bill is supposed to be doing something \nabout the energy crisis.\n  We have discussed the approach that there might be something in \nAmerica that says it is good enough for an America of the future and an \nAmerica that can help lead the world in the future. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in support of \nS. 1171, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for fiscal \nyear 2002.\n  The Senate bill provides $24.96 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, which will result in new outlays in 2002 of $16.2 billion. \nWhen outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the Senate bill total $24.7 billion in 2002. \nOf that total, $15.2 billion in budget authority and $14.9 billion in \noutlays is for defense spending. The Senate bill is within its Section \n302(b) allocations for budget authority and outlays for both general \npurpose and defense spending. Further, the committee has met its target \nwithout the use of any emergency designations.\n  I again commend Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens for their \nbipartisan effort in moving this and other appropriations bills quickly \nto make up for the late start in this year's appropriations process. I \nalso commend subcommittee Chairman Reid and Senator Domenici for not \nonly bringing this important measure to the floor within its \nallocation, but also for providing significant additional resources \nabove the President's request for both the Department of Energy's \nAtomic Energy Defense Programs, which will help dramatically reduce the \nthreat of proliferation of nuclear warheads, materials, and expertise \nin the former Soviet Union, and for renewable energy resources, which \nwill help ensure an energy portfolio that balances the Nation's long-\nterm needs for both energy and the environment. I hope all Senators \nwill join me in thanking our able colleagues from Nevada and New Mexico \nfor their vision and good work.\n  I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the Budget Committee \nscoring of this bill be inserted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   S. 1171, ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT, 2002; SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                          SENATE REPORTED BILL\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  General\n                                  purpose   Defense  Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority.............     9,713    15,247          0    24,960\n  Outlays......................     9,782    14,908          0    24,690\nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority.............     9,713    15,247          0    24,960\n  Outlays......................    24,916         0          0    24,916\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority.............     9,670    14,034          0    23,740\n  Outlays......................     9,806    14,122          0    23,928\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority.............     9,003    13,514          0    22,517\n  Outlays......................     9,336    13,758          0    23,094\n \n SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED\n              TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority.............         0         0          0         0\n  Outlays......................

The clerk will read the Republican resolution.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n[[Page S7797]]\n\n     Resolution Relating to the Retirement of Elizabeth Letchworth\n\n       Whereas Elizabeth B. Letchworth has served this conference \n     ably and honorably for over 25 years;\n       Whereas in 1995 she was elected as the Secretary for the \n     Majority becoming the first women to hold this post;\n       Whereas during her service she has assisted all members of \n     this Republican Conference with diligence and \n     professionalism;\n       Whereas her knowledge of the Senate rules and Institutional \n     history has been a valuable asset to all Members: Now \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Republican Conference extends its \n     sincere thanks to Elizabeth B. Letchworth for her service for \n     over 25 years and wishes her all the best in her future \n     endeavors.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Daschle for allowing me to \ncomment on these resolutions. I would like to begin by thanking the \nDemocratic caucus for doing this. This is a very magnanimous gesture \nand I know it is being done because of appreciation for the job that \nour floor assistants do, but specifically for the job that has been \ndone over many, many years by Elizabeth Letchworth. She protects the \ninstitution. She loves the institution. She works not only with \nRepublicans but, as your resolution says, with Democrats too, Senators \non both sides of the aisle, collectively and individually. So we in the \nRepublican Conference appreciate the generosity of your resolution and \nthe fact that you did that.\n  We did one also. But I must confess, when I made the announcement \nthat she would be leaving after 25 years, there was a very strong round \nof boos and objections to the whole idea. I said: My colleagues, this \nis not in the form of a motion; this is an announcement of a decision \nthat has been made by a friend and loved one--to which they stood and \napplauded, unanimously thanking her for her dedication and \nprofessionalism.\n  I believe later on we will have a resolution on behalf of the entire \nSenate at a time when we will notify all of our colleagues that it \nwould be appropriate for them to come to the floor and express their \nappreciation. I know she has a special relationship with Senator Byrd, \nfor instance, because she not only knows his love of the institution \nbut respects his knowledge of the rules and his insistence that we \ncomply with them, sometimes when we are a little bit derelict in doing \nthat. So we will have that opportunity to speak further. At that time, \nI will go into great detail about her Senate service.\n  We all know she has been part of the institution for 25 years. It is \nhard to believe, looking at her, that she has been here 25 years. It is \nobvious, Senator Byrd, that she was very young when she started working \nfor the Senate--and that in fact is true. She came here, I believe, as \na page, working for then-Senator Hugh Scott from Pennsylvania. I know \nshe did a great job there.\n  Over the years she has worked in the Cloakroom, worked as a floor \nassistant, worked for Senator Baker, Senator Dole, and for me when I \nwas majority leader and when I was minority leader. She has served so \nwell as the Secretary for the Majority since 1995 and Secretary for the \nMinority for the past few weeks. She has just done an outstanding job.\n  I appreciate her knowledge of the rules, but I also appreciate her \ndetermination to make sure we conduct ourselves appropriately, knowing \nwhat the rules are. We have been through some tough times while she has \nbeen here, both in the majority and the minority. We did the historic \nimpeachment trial for only the second time in history, and I think we \ndid it in a way that was appropriate. We complied with our \nresponsibility under the Constitution. We did it in a reasonable period \nof time, and we tried to make sure we did it in a respectful way and a \nfair way for all concerned. That took a lot of time, a lot of effort by \nour floor assistants, by all of our staff members.\n  But beyond her knowledge is just the fact that she is a very fine \nperson. I have grown to appreciate her, love her, admire her--as a \nmember of the family, if you will. I must say she has shown great, \ngreat wisdom because in the husband to whom she is married she chose \none with a Mississippi background, so she truly became even further a \nmember of the family by making that wise decision.\n\n  They have plans for the future that include a little more free time, \nnot quite as many nights here in the Senate Chamber, 6 or 7 or 9 or so \non a Thursday night, but also, hopefully, some business investments \nthat will be a great success--just, most importantly, some personal \ntime.\n  To Elizabeth Letchworth and to Ron I offer my most sincere \nappreciation personally and the appreciation of the Senate Republican \nConference.\n  Again, my thanks to Senator Daschle and our Democratic colleagues for \ntheir gesture in their resolution also.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Republican \nleader has spoken for all of us in expressing his affection and his \ngratitude for a very special person. This will not be our farewell \nspeech. We will give that later as it accompanies an official Senate \nresolution that I am certain will be offered on a bipartisan basis by \nthe two leaders and perhaps with the cosponsorship of others but \ncertainly with the unanimous, enthusiastic support of the entire \nSenate. But we take the floor this afternoon to acknowledge the \ndecision Elizabeth has made and to call attention to that decision and \nto express our gratitude and our deep affection for a person to whom we \nhave turned, on both sides of the aisle, on countless occasions.\n  I have been leader now for about 7 years. I have had the good fortune \nof working with Elizabeth all 7 of those years. But that is just less \nthan a third of the time she has worked in various capacities in this \nChamber.\n  She has served the Senate, not just the Republican caucus but the \nSenate, so admirably, so professionally, so capably that it goes \nwithout saying that on occasions such as this it is a heartfelt gesture \nfor us to pass a resolution as we did in the caucus this afternoon.\n  I might say, even though she wasn't there, there was rousing applause \nafter the resolution passed, with the hope that she might have heard it \neven though she wasn't in the room.\n  Isaac Bassett was the second page to serve in the Senate. He was \nDaniel Webster's choice as a page. He served here for a long period of \ntime, over a half a century. Isaac Bassett wrote prodigiously about his \nexperiences and never rose to a level any higher than Assistant \nDoorkeeper. Isaac Bassett would talk about his remarkable view of \nhistory. To read his notes is to read history in the first person. I \nthink Elizabeth could write notes in the first person about the history \nshe has witnessed, as Senator Lott has noted.\n  She could write history that I am sure would enlighten all of us. I \nam sure it would be every bit as valuable to future historians and \nfuture citizens a hundred years from now as Isaac Bassett's notes are \nto me today. Regardless of how much history she writes, she should know \nthat she has helped make history. She has been a witness to history. As \nshe has witnessed history, and as she has made it, she has done it in a \nway that will make her family and future generations very proud.\n  Today, rather than saying farewell, we simply say that we admire her, \nand we are grateful to her not only for what she has done but for what \nshe will continue to do here in the Senate for the next few weeks and \nbeyond as she serves in other roles and recognizes the importance of \nbeing a member of the family that goes beyond the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I received late word of this little \nseance and wanted to make sure that I was present to thank our friend \nwho is retiring.\n  My first father-in-law said that English is the only language in \nwhich that word means other than go to bed. I am glad to know that \nElizabeth is going on to another career and a beautiful place in the \ncountry. And I am here to wish her very well.\n  I can remember the various steps of her employment in the Senate. At \neach level she has excelled and deserved the promotions she has gotten. \nBut above all, Catherine and I will remember the trips that she and her \nhusband have taken with us as she represented the Senate so well as one \nof our officers.\n  I have no prepared remarks. I heard the leaders' very kind remarks. I \njoin\n\n[[Page S7798]]\n\nwith both leaders in wishing you well and expressing our sadness that \nyou are leaving because you have been really one of the Senate in terms \nof your services here. We will miss you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as one who has served with Elizabeth for \nthese long years now, I will have something to say on another day about \nthat service and about my feeling toward her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7798-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            KATHARINE GRAHAM\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, \nwho passed away today, was a towering figure in the world of \njournalism.\n  Her courageous stance during the publication of the Pentagon Papers \nin 1971 and during the Watergate saga, and her steadfast support for \nher editors and reporters during those trying times, left an \nunalterable mark upon American journalism and earned her a place in \nhistory. With Mrs. Graham at the helm, the Post became one of the \nleading newspapers in the United States and a veritable American \ninstitution.\n  During her three decades at the helm of the Post she became one of \nthe most influential and admired women in the business world. She was \nthe first woman to head a Fortune 500 company and the first woman to \nserve as a director of the Associated Press.\n  Mrs. Graham was an accomplished scribe in her own right. She began \nher career as a newspaper reporter in San Francisco. After her many \nsuccessful years in the business end of journalism, she returned to \nwriting and in 1997, at the age of 80, earned a Pulitzer Prize for her \nautobiography, ``Personal History.''\n  Despite the Post's success under her leadership, Mrs. Graham remained \nmodest about her own role. In words that could serve as a guide to \nfuture publishers, or even to United States Senators, she said:\n\n       You inherit something and you do what you can. And so the \n     person who succeeds you inherits something different, and you \n     add to it or you subtract from it . . . . But you never \n     totally control it.\n\n  Katharine Graham certainly added ``something'' to the world of \nAmerican journalism--a mark of professionalism and integrity that time \ncannot erase.\n  Personally, I shall recall her as gracious, elegant, and extremely \ndignified. She had a bearing one did not forget. She will serve as an \nexample of journalism at its best for many, many years to come.\n  Erma and I extend our condolences to Mrs. Graham's family and her \nhost of friends.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, it is nearly 6:30 and we have not had an \nopportunity to make much progress on the energy and water \nappropriations bill. I am a little disappointed. I had hoped that we \ncould move at least to the adoption of a few of the amendments that I \nknow are pending. I am hopeful that we can get an agreement on a finite \nlist tomorrow morning. The Republican leader has indicated that might \nbe a possibility tomorrow morning.\n  We have colleagues on both sides of the aisle who, I know, have \namendments, and I hope they can come to the floor as quickly as \npossible and begin offering them. I will say to those who may feel the \nneed to drag this out that we have to get this work done. If we can't \nget it done between now and Thursday night, of course, we will have no \nrecourse but to continue for a reasonably full day on Friday--Friday \nmorning and at least a part of Friday afternoon.\n  I will also say that these appropriations bills I know are important \nto the administration, important to the Congress, and I hope nobody \nmakes any definite date for their plans for the August recess. We are \ngoing to finish this work, and if we have to bump into the August \nrecess some to complete it, we will do that. Each day we delay now \npossibly entails additional days at the end of the July work period \nthat we will have to use in order to accommodate the work. We will not \nallow this work to go over until September. We will stay here. That is \nnot meant to be anything other than an observation of the reality of \nour responsibilities here.\n  So I just caution everybody not to let these days go by thinking that \nsomehow it is time that we can make up down the road. We are going to \nhave to make it up before we leave for the August break.\n  So I hope we can make this a productive week. My hope is that we can \ncomplete our work on the energy and water bill in a reasonably prudent \nperiod of time, and then we will move on to the Graham nomination, \nwhich I know is important to the administration, as well as other \nnominations.\n  I am hopeful, as well, that we will take up the legislative branch \nappropriations and Transportation. It would be my expectation that we \ncan make a lot of progress on those bills as well. Senators have to \ncome to the floor to offer amendments. I thank my colleague, the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water, for his effort in \ngetting us to this point. I know he shares my interest in working for \nwhatever length of time is necessary.\n  I think I will announce at this point that there will be no more \nrollcall votes tonight. But it is with the expectation that we can get \na finite list of amendments, and we could be in late tomorrow. We will \ntake amendments, and if we have to do it, we will do other work. We \nwill stay in to accommodate the need to get a lot of additional matters \ndone before the end of the week. So there will be no more votes \ntonight. There will be a number of votes tomorrow.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the majority leader, I know he has an important \nstatement to give. I wanted to make this observation. These are not \nSenate bills alone. The President of the United States needs these \nbills to operate the Government. He needs these bills, as we do. I \nthink if there were ever a time when we needed to work together, it is \nnow. We have a Democratic majority in the Senate, a Republican majority \nin the House, and a Republican President. These bills are our joint \nresponsibility. If anybody thinks they are being clever by stalling, \nthey are only hurting George W. Bush, not us. He runs the Government of \nthis country. Would the Senator agree with me in that regard?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right. Just today, I have had, \nI don't know the number but I would say countless discussions with my \ncolleagues about other legislative items that ought to come up, and all \nwith good reason.\n  There are a number of authorizations and legislative issues that \ndeserve the consideration of the Senate. What we have said is that we \nwant to work as the Senator suggests, in a very constructive way, in an \neffort to try to accommodate the priorities of the administration, as \nwell as the Congress, in achieving what we know we have to in passing \nthese appropriations bills. It is important to get the work done, and \nit is important to spend the time on the Senate floor to ensure that \nhappens. We have not had a very productive couple of hours, but I am \nconfident that tomorrow will be a much more productive day.\n  Mr. REID. If I can say one more thing, the majority leader and the \nminority leader and the two managers of this bill, Senator Domenici and \nI, had a conference earlier in the day. Senator Domenici said he \nthought we could finish the bill tomorrow. He is one of the real pros \nhere, very experienced. He knows this bill as well as anyone. So I take \nthe Senator at his word, as I do everything he tells me.\n  I say to the majority leader, tomorrow it would seem to me that we \nnot only have to finish this bill but also we have the Graham \nnomination that we have to finish tomorrow. Because the majority leader \ntold me this previously--and everybody should understand this--we could \nbe working well\n\n[[Page S7799]]\n\ninto tomorrow night, real late, to finish the assigned time we have on \nthe Graham amendment. Is that a fact?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. If I didn't say it as clearly as \nI needed to, let me repeat it. We will have a full day tomorrow. We \nwill be, hopefully, completing our work on energy and water and taking \nup the Graham nomination. My hope is that we can complete both of those \ntomorrow. We will stay late and make some decision late in the day \nabout how much time may be required. But there is no reason to believe \nthat we cannot finish energy and water and the Graham nomination before \nthe end of the day tomorrow.\n  So Senators should be prepared to work late tomorrow in order to \naccommodate those two very important priorities--again, not just to us \nbut certainly to the administration. The administration has made it \nvery clear that this Graham nomination is important, and they have a \nright to assert that. We will attempt to accommodate their desire to \ncomplete the work on that confirmation before the end of the day \ntomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7799-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE LIFE AND EXTRAORDINARY CONTRIBUTIONS OF KATHARINE GRAHAM\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing my \ngreat admiration for Katharine Graham and my profound sadness on her \npassing.\n  I also convey my regrets to Mrs. Graham's family and friends. Our \nthoughts and prayers are with them on this very sad day.\n  America lost a legend this afternoon.\n  Katharine Meyer Graham was a woman of great dignity, intelligence, \nand wit. She was a pioneer. She was a patriot who believed deeply in \nthe strength of our democracy, and in the indispensability of a free \npress in preserving this democracy.\n  Much has been made of Mrs. Graham's gender--and rightly so. No woman \nhas ever achieved what she achieved in journalism, and her \naccomplishments helped change people's perceptions about the role women \ncould play in journalism, in business, and in the world. But Katharine \nGraham needs no modifiers.\n  She was not simply one of the best woman newspaper publishers in the \ncountry; she was one of the best newspaper publishers America has ever \nseen--period.\n  Katharine Graham was a 46-year-old widowed mother of four when she \ntook over as president of the Washington Post in 1963.\n  At the time, the Post was one of three daily papers in Washington and \nnot even the best or most widely read of the bunch.\n  A decade later, largely because of the courage and the extraordinary \ntalent of Katharine Graham and editor Ben Bradlee, the Post was not \nonly indisputably the best newspaper in Washington; it was one of the \nbest newspapers in the world.\n  In June 1971, with Katharine Graham's backing, the Washington Post \njoined the New York Times in fighting a court order banning publication \nof the so-called Pentagon Papers.\n  Thirty years later, the Supreme Court decision overturning that \ninjunction remains one of the most important decisions in first \namendment law.\n  One year later, in June 1972--again with Katharine Graham's \nblessing--the Post began its coverage of the Watergate break-in and \ncover-up. She never wavered in her support of her reporters and their \nquest for the truth.\n  Mrs. Graham was modest about her professional achievements. She once \nsaid of her paper's Watergate coverage:\n\n       The best we could do was to keep investigating . . . to \n     look everywhere for hard evidence . . . to get the details \n     rights . . . and to report accurately what we found.\n\n  She made it sound almost like a routine story. It was, of course, \nanything but routine.\n  It led eventually to the resignation of a President of the United \nStates, and it earned the Post the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.\n  Over the next nearly three decades, there would be many other awards \nand accolades for Katharine Graham, including a Pulitzer of her own--\nthe Pulitzer Prize for Biography for her 1998 autobiography, ``Personal \nHistory.''\n  We are so fortunate that in what would be the last years of her life, \nshe took the time to sit down and write an incredible story that had \nlargely gone untold--her story.\n  In recalling her sudden ascendancy as president of the Post, she \nremarked:\n\n       What I essentially did was to put one foot in front of the \n     other, shut my eyes and step off the ledge. The surprise was \n     that I landed on my feet.\n\n  For those who knew her, for those who loved her, and for those of us \nwho were simply lucky enough to have met her and seen her work, \nKatharine Graham's success seems no surprise at all. She was a woman of \nremarkable insight and remarkable strength.\n  My deepest sympathies go out to her children, Donald, Lally, William, \nand Stephen, her many grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren.\n  Our Nation's Capital will not be the same without her and neither \nwill American journalism.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7799-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7799-S7800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NOMINATION OF LORI A. FORMAN TO BE ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR OF AID FOR \n                           ASIA AND NEAR EAST\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I did earlier \nthis spring, to commend the efforts of a South Dakotan who is having a \ndirect impact on America's international interests. Last Thursday \nevening, I was proud when the Senate confirmed Lori A. Forman, born and \nraised in Sioux Falls, SD, to be Assistant Administrator of USAID for \nAsia and the Near East. She is the first South Dakotan nominated and \nconfirmed to serve in the Bush Administration.\n  The Assistant Administrator for Asia and the Near East, ANE, has a \ntremendous responsibility. Stretching from Morocco in the West to the \nPhilippines in the East, the ANE region is large and diverse and covers \na wide range of issues of critical importance to the U.S., including \nthe challenges posed by terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  The region is also home to vital economic interests. As a market for \nU.S. goods and services, it is second only to Europe. Countries in the \nregion provide 50 percent of the oil consumed in the United States and \ncontrol vital shipping lanes for the world's commerce. As the world \nwitnessed with the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, instability in this \nregion has direct and significant ramifications for global economic \ninterests.\n  Furthermore, the region poses a development challenge for the United \nStates. According to the World Bank, the ANE region accounts for more \nthan two-thirds of the world's extremely poor. And those poor are \nsuccumbing more and more to the threat of infectious disease, \nespecially HIV/AIDS. In India alone, there are 1,500 additional cases \nof HIV daily.\n  In such an important region, USAID requires a talented and \nexperienced Assistant Administrator. Our interests there are too vital \nand the costs of failure too high for us to accept anyone but the \nfinest.\n  I can think of no better candidate than Lori Forman. She has written \nextensively on the development challenges in Asia. Her writings are \nbased on years of experience--in both the governmental and non-\ngovernmental sectors--as a development practitioner throughout Asia. \nShe knows the region and Washington, ensuring that assistance will get \nto the people for whom it is intended, not become tied up in \nbureaucratic wrangling here.\n  Lori has an additional asset which has served her well in her \ncareer--and will continue to serve her well. Though she has been \nengaged in Asia policy for much of the last 25 years, she is from the \nGreat State of South Dakota. In South Dakota we pride ourselves on \nhumility, self-reliance and hard work, traits that are valuable, even \ncrucial, to anyone in the development field.\n  Americans from each and every state are having a positive impact on \nthe\n\n[[Page S7800]]\n\nlives of people the world over. I am particularly proud when \nindividuals from South Dakota have done such a fine job. Lori Forman's \nefforts make me proud, America stronger and the world better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7800-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO COY SHORT\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, whether as an officer in the United \nStates Army or as a dedicated public servant at the Social Security \nAdministration, Coy A. Short has served his Nation with honor and \nintegrity. After two and a half decades of devoted service, Coy will \nretire from the Social Security Administration, and I rise today to pay \ntribute to a man who has made countless contributions to the welfare of \nAmerica.\n  Coy has a rich history of public service which began when he \nvolunteered to serve as an officer in the United States Army. \nRecognized as a leader with a solid work ethic and uncompromising \ncharacter, Coy eventually rose to the rank of Captain. After departing \nthe Army, he has continued to support our Armed Forces. He served as \nChairman of the Georgia Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and \nReserve for over ten years, and continues to work with this committee \nand other organizations dedicated to assisting our men and women in \nuniform.\n  Coy's selfless involvement with these associations has resulted in \nhis receipt of numerous awards and recognitions, including the Sam Nunn \nAward, the Oglethorpe Distinguished Service Medal for Outstanding \nSupport of the Georgia Guard, and the Patrick Henry Award from the \nNational Guard Association both in 1997 and 1999. Also, in 1998, he was \nappointed to the prestigious position of Ambassador for the U.S. Army \nReserve.\n  Though a successful businessman, Coy's devotion to his country \neventually lured him back to the realm of public service. In 1977, he \nbegan his career at the Social Security Administration--an agency on \nwhich many livelihoods depend.\n  During Coy's tenure with the Social Security Administration, his \nworkhorse attitude and proficient managerial skills enabled him to \nquickly ascend through the ranks. He held several management positions \nat both district and branch offices throughout the Atlanta region and \nserved as Director of the Office of Congressional, Governmental and \nExternal Affairs prior to his selection as Deputy Regional \nCommissioner. Though a humble man, whose greatest reward is assisting \nothers, he was recognized for his dedication to the Social Security \nAdministration with their highest award, the ``Commissioner's \nCitation.''\n  It has been a privilege to know Coy for the last thirty years. He is \na true patriot, and I commend him for his service to our Nation. Though \nthe Administration will be losing one of their finest, they will no \ndoubt continue to benefit from his contributions for years to come. I \nwish him, his wife Judy, and their two children, Greg and Karen, \nhealth, happiness, and success in all of their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7800-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7800-S7801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

A gay man, James Rebuck, 55, was stabbed to death \nat his residence after he allegedly made a pass at a man at a bar. \nDavid Alan Elliott, 23, and Scott Stocklin were charged with first-\ndegree murder, burglary, criminal conspiracy and possession of deadly \ninstruments.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7801-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7801-S7802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 VA LEADS THE NATION IN QUALITY OF CARE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Department of Veterans Affairs \nhas made great strides in becoming a leader within the health care \nprofession. Too often, we dwell only on what is going wrong or what \nelse can be done. However, as Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, I would like to instead draw attention to what VA has done to \nbring a high quality of care to our nation's veterans. While there is \nno doubt that VA go even further in this area, we know that they have \nmade great strides in delivering the standard of care veterans deserve.\n  A few years ago, the Democratic staff of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs issued a report examining the standards of quality within the \nVA Health Care system. VA spends considerable effort and resources \naimed at providing veterans with the highest quality health care in its \nhospitals and clinics. Over the years, VA has developed dozens of \nprograms devoted exclusively to quality of care issues, yet public \nattention continues to be focused on examples of poor care within the \nhealth care system.\n  With nearly 950 sites and growing, VA operates the largest health \ncare system in the United States. Veterans should know that the care at \none VA hospital or clinic is at the same high quality level as the care \nat another VA health care facility. The study concluded that this can \nonly be possible if the VA has a national system of quality which has \nbuilt-in safeguards sufficient to overcome the inevitable fact that \nhuman error will always occur.\n  The committee is currently working on a follow-up to the original \nstudy. As more technological solutions to the problem of quality \nstandardization are implemented, they will need to be examined. Quality \nof care is a vital issue to which I am very committed, and will \ncontinue to monitor closely as the VA health care system reconfigures \nitself to accommodate the changing demographics of the population it \nserves.\n  Coronary disease care is one area in particular that VA has excelled \nin with regard to quality of care. With coronary atherosclerosis being \nthe second-most frequent diagnosis among veterans enrolled in VA health \ncare, it is imperative that VA is able to treat this condition with the \nbest care possible. They have met that challenge, with VA medical \nfacilities now providing the same level of care as non-VA hospitals. \nThe New England Journal of Medicine recently published a report that \nmade this conclusion, based on a study of heart attack patient care \nwithin VA. The report also applauded VA's efforts to improve their \noverall quality of care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from The Topeka Capital-\nJournal, highlighting the report from The New England Journal of \nMedicine on the study of VA's quality of care, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            VA System Quietly Becoming Model for Health Care\n\n                          (By Mathew J. Kelly)\n\n       It has long been one of American medicine's most precious \n     assets and, until recent years, its best-kept secret.\n       On Dec. 27, the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) \n     published a report on a study that found the quality of care \n     for heart attack patients is as high in Department of \n     Veterans Affairs medical facilities as in non-VA hospitals.\n       At first review, that might seem like faint praise--but not \n     for a health care system often singled out to prove its value \n     and justify its existence. And it continues to do so. The \n     accompanying NEJM commentary of a VA doctor nailed it: \n     ``Overall, the [VA health care system's] quest to improve \n     quality must be regarded as a laudable success and itself \n     deserves study for lessons that may have general value.''\n       The study and associated observations corroborate what we \n     in VA have long been aware of--the exceptional quality of \n     care we provide, and the fact that VA is a model for the \n     health care industry, often outperforming the private sector. \n     VA is delivering cutting-edge health care, and its patients \n     and the medical world are noticing and applauding.\n       For too long VA has methodically and quietly improved the \n     way it delivers health care to a special population, while \n     allowing the public to believe that our hospitals are like \n     those shown in movies such as 'Born on the Fourth of July'' \n     and ``Article 99.'' At the time these motion pictures were \n     released, the portrayal was inaccurate, and today, they and \n     the images they conjure are even more distorted.\n       The Department of Veterans Affairs health care delivery \n     system, once maligned, has overcome the stereotypes, is \n     quieting its critics, and has established itself as a force \n     in health care delivery, research, and medical education, and \n     in such special services as blind rehabilitation, severe \n     psychological conditions, prosthetics and spinal cord injury. \n     Of the latter, actor Christopher Reeve, now quadriplegic, \n     said, ``The whole VA system today is a model for what \n     research can and must be. And when I look down the list of \n     accomplishments of various centers and how proactive it is, I \n     just rejoice.''\n       The patient population VA cares for is, on average, \n     significantly older and poorer than the non-veteran \n     population, more likely to have mental illness or substance \n     abuse problems, more likely to have hepatitis C, more likely \n     to have multiple diseases, and less likely to be married and \n     have a social support structure. Despite these challenges, VA \n     health care has transformed itself into what Dr. Donald \n     Berwick, President and CEO of the Institute for Healthcare \n     Improvement, calls ``the most impressive work in the country \n     so far on patient safety'' and ``the benchmark in many \n     areas.''\n       Even though the veteran population is declining, veterans' \n     health problems are increasing as they age. More veterans \n     than ever are enrolling for VA health care. In the last five \n     years, VA, which operates the nation's largest integrated \n     health care organization, has shifted from an inpatient-\n     focused system--we have closed more than half of our acute \n     care beds--to one that is outpatient-based.\n       To apply for health care, veterans can now fill out and \n     submit an easy-to-follow Internet-based application form, \n     which is automatically electronically mailed to the VA health \n     care facility selected by the veteran. VA employees register \n     the data, print the form and mail it back to the veteran for \n     signature. Veterans can also print out the completed form and \n     mail it to a VA health care facility themselves.\n       Since 1996, when all honorably discharged veterans became \n     eligible to enroll for VA health care, more than a half-\n     million additional veterans have done so. Why? Every VA \n     patient now has a primary care provider and team. VA has \n     computerized mail-out pharmacy services that ensure the \n     timely delivery of drugs to patients. VA has instituted\n\n[[Page S7802]]\n\n     aggressive performance measures that have led to \n     implementation of the best practices of government and \n     private sector health care. On average, VA medical facilities \n     now receive higher accreditation scores than do private \n     sector facilities.\n       While this transformation was taking place, VA became an \n     industry leader in such areas as patient safety, surgical \n     quality assessment, the computerization of medical records, \n     telehealth, preventive screenings and immunizations.\n       There have been no big wars lately, no long lines of troops \n     coming home, no welcoming parades necessary. And as these \n     events and the years between fade, so too do memories. It \n     might be only human to become complacent about those who not \n     so long ago left their families, their schools, their jobs, \n     and the security of their lives because their country asked. \n     They now need our help, as will future generations of \n     servicemen and women, but platitudes on Veterans Day and \n     Memorial Day are woefully inadequate. Words alone will not \n     mend broken spirits and cannot heal broken bodies. The best \n     possible care--the type VA provides as part of a \n     comprehensive system of benefits--is the most appropriate \n     honor we can bestow on veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7802-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, every one of us has a life story. \nEvery person is a book, and I would like to tell you about one young \nman from the state of Georgia who is beginning a new chapter in his.\n  Kwame Brown has known adversity since the age of 5, when his parents \nsplit up for good and he landed in a shelter with his mother and \nsiblings for 10 months. With the help of relatives, Kwame and his \nfamily got out of that shelter and things got better--but not by much. \nKwame's mother, Joyce, raised him and his seven siblings by herself in \nBrunswick, GA, supporting the family by cleaning hotel rooms. That job \nended in 1993 when a back injury and other health problems left Ms. \nBrown unable to work. Since then, the family has scraped by on a \nmonthly disability check and a few extra dollars from babysitting. \nTheir mode of transportation: a bicycle. Such adversity would break \nmost families, but not Kwame Brown's family.\n  With the help of a church mentor, Kwame and his siblings became \nfocused and set goals for themselves. Kwame decided he wanted to be a \nbetter student and a better basketball player. Through his faith and \nmany hours of hard work, Kwame improved his grades so much that he \nlanded on the honor roll at Brunswick's Glynn Academy. And now he has \nachieved something that no other person in this country ever has.\n  On June 27, 2001, 19-year-old Kwame became the first high school \nplayer ever to be picked as the No. 1 draft in the NBA. This young man \nwho once lived in a neighborhood so poor it was nicknamed ``The \nBottom'' has pulled himself up to the very top.\n  At 6-feet-11 inches tall and 240 pounds, Kwame averaged 20.1 points, \n13.3 rebounds and 5.8 blocked shots as a senior last year at Glynn \nAcademy; he scored 1,539 career points. His exceptional talent has \ngiven rise to a number of awards. He was named to McDonald's All-\nAmerica Team and USA Today's All-USA First team. He was also Georgia's \nHigh School Player of the Year.\n  Kwame Brown is not only a star on the court. His off-the-court life \nis just as exemplary. Even though he went against his mother's wishes \nin postponing plans to attend the University of Florida, Kwame believes \nthat his decision to enter the NBA will allow him to give his family a \nbetter life than they have ever known. And he has promised his mother \nand himself that he will still get that college education. First, he \nwants to give his mother something she has never had: the keys to a \nbrand new home.\n  Basketball legend Michael Jordan, who is part-owner of the Wizards, \ncalled Kwame ``a confident kid who understands his surroundings . . . \nHe comes from a family where nothing has been given to him. He has \ngotten this far with hard work and a little dreaming.''\n  I am honored to recognize Kwame Brown, a young man who is not only a \ntalented athlete, but also humble, wise and mature beyond his years. I \nlook forward to this new chapter in Kwame's life with great \nanticipation. I know his will be a fascinating story with a wonderful \nending.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7802-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7802-S7803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JAMES LAKE\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to James \nLake upon the occasion of his completion in June of a tenure as the \nPresident of the American Nuclear Society for the 2000/2001 year. The \nAmerican Nuclear Society is an international scientific and educational \norganization established in 1954. Its membership now has approximately \n11,000 engineers, scientists, administrators, and educators \nrepresenting over 1,600 corporations, educational institutions, and \ngovernment agencies.\n  The work of nuclear engineers and scientists is especially relevant \nto meeting the increasing need of the Nation for electricity. Around \nthe United States, there is a growing public interest in new nuclear \nplants which offer an economical, safe and environmentally-friendly \nalternative for the generation of electricity. The development of \nnuclear professionals is a valuable service for the Nation that \nadvances our energy security and economic well-being.\n  Jim Lake's service as the President of the American Nuclear Society \nthis year has helped to stimulate the interest in new nuclear \ngeneration which has stemmed from energy shortages in California and \nhigher energy prices in many areas. He has crossed the Nation many \ntimes this year to meet with nuclear professionals, industry \nexecutives, public servants, educators and students to seek their views \nand ideas on an expanding role for nuclear energy in the Nation's \nfuture. He has represented the professionals of the United States in \nmany forums overseas, and has brought home a broad perspective on \nnuclear energy's role in a balanced energy portfolio.\n  Jim Lake's career now spans twenty-eight years, of which he has spent \nthe last seventeen at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental \nLaboratory in my State. As he completes his tenure as President, he \nreturns to the Laboratory as an Associate Laboratory Director with an \nenthusiasm for nuclear energy that is fueled by his many experiences of \nthe last year.\n  Always interested in the development of the professionals at the \nLaboratory, Jim has been an active and tireless supporter of the Idaho \nSection of the American Nuclear Society. His leadership of that section \nresulted in its award for Outstanding Section Management in 1992. The \nIdaho Section has won many awards in the last ten years and is \nconsidered to be truly one of the best in the society.\n  Jim Lake attended the Georgia Institute of Technology, receiving a \nMaster's degree in 1969 and a Doctoral degree in 1972. He was elected a \nDistinguished Engineering Alumnus by Georgia Tech in 1996, and a Fellow \nof the American Nuclear Society in 1992. He is the author of over \nthirty technical publications in the disciplines of reactor physics, \nnuclear engineering and nuclear reactor design. I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in extending our\n\n[[Page S7803]]\n\ndeep appreciation to Jim Lake for his outstanding service, for his \nleadership of the American Nuclear Society and in wishing him well in \nall future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7803-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF WILLIAM N.

Guertin for his election as President of the American \nAssociation of Medical Society Executives and for his 30 years of \nservice to the medical doctors of Alameda-Contra Costa counties and his \nmany achievements.\n  Mr. Guertin has been a member of the Alameda-Contra Costa Medical \nAssociation, ACCMA, since 1971, and has held two executive offices, \nAssistant Executive Director and Executive Director. The ACCMA serves \nover 3,100 doctors and is the second largest medical association in \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. Guertin's leadership supported many California doctors' efforts \nto help, cure, and care for people in need of support and medical help. \nHe has worked to create programs that promote public health, quality \naccess to care, and professional standards in California. Mr. Guertin \nhas worked to protect physicians from impositions that would interfere \nwith their ability to interact successfully with their patients. Mr. \nGuertin created the first doctor-owned professional liability insurance \ncarrier in California, at a time when doctors were not able to obtain \nthe insurance necessary to practice quality medicine.\n  The practice of medicine has long been a profession of people who \ndevote their time and effort to helping others. Mr. Guertin has worked \ntirelessly for the past 30 years to facilitate the work of physicians \nand to enhance the quality of care for the people of Alameda-Contra \nCosta counties.\n  For these reasons, I congratulate Mr. Guertin on his new position as \nPresident of the American Association of Medical Society Executives.

Mr. President, today I remind my colleagues of a \nstory I read in the New York Times almost exactly one year ago today. \nIt was the July 15, 2000, obituary of a man named Jan Karski. I was \nabsolutely fascinated by this man's life story and with the first \nanniversary of his death, I am reminded of the role he played in our \nmodern history. Like few others, he had a unique window view into an \nappalling and shameful era of history--the Holocaust. Let me explain.\n  During World War II, Jan Karski brought to the Allied leaders in the \nWest--and at no small risk to his own life--what is believed to be the \nfirst eyewitness reports of Hitler's indescribable acts of hate and \ncruelty against the Jews. In 1942, Jewish resistance leaders asked Jan, \nthen a 28-year-old courier for the Polish underground, to be their \nvoice to the West--to convey to the Allies an actual eyewitness account \nof the Jewish genocide in Europe.\n  He readily accepted this dreadful task, as he knew that someone had \nto tell the world exactly what was happening in Europe. Though he \nsucceeded in relaying the nightmarish sights to Western leaders, his \nreports were met initially by indifference. While many others \neventually would confirm Jan's horrifying accounts of the Jewish \nconcentration camps and the Warsaw Ghetto in Poland, he was one of the \nfirst--and one of very few--to take a stand against these atrocities.\n  We are discovering that Jan's voice was not the only warning of the \nwholesale slaughter of innocent human life by Nazi Germany. As we \nspeak, a dedicated group of individuals, both in government and in the \nprivate sector, are declassifying and releasing to the public thousands \nand thousands of pages of previously classified material about Nazi war \ncriminals, persecution, and looting. This effort is the result of the \n``Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act''--legislation I wrote into law with \nmy friends and colleagues from New York, Senator Patrick Moynihan and \nCongresswoman Carolyn Maloney.\n  Just this past April, in fact, our law made history with the release \nof 10,000 pages of previously classified Central Intelligence Agency, \n(CIA), files on 20 key figures from the Nazi party, including Adolf \nHitler, Klaus Barbie, Adolf Eichmann, Kurt Waldheim, Heinrich Mueller, \nand Josef Mengele. And, prior to that last summer, 400,000 pages of \nother historical documents were released.\n  A number of those documents contained information that Fritz Kolbe \nprovided to U.S. intelligence authorities in 1943. Mr. Kolbe was a \nmember of the German resistance and worked in the German Foreign \nOffice. Code-named ``George Wood,'' Mr. Kolbe put his life on the line \nby traveling to Switzerland, carrying highly sensitive information on \nNazi activities for delivery to U.S. intelligence agents. A complete \nset of these documents in translation is now available for historical \nreview. Also available in its entirety is the U.S. State Department's \ncomplete debrief of Mr. Kolbe from September 1945. This document shows \nthat he did not act alone, but relied on what he called his ``Inner \nCircle,'' which consisted of as many as 20 other Germans. The names of \nthese individuals are not well known members of the resistance--they \nare ordinary people, like Jan Karski.\n  While the gruesome reality of Nazi Germany eventually became clear to \nthe world and as the Allies acted to end Hitler's evil regime, Jan's \njob--his mission--never really ended. For the rest of his life, he \ncarried with him the sights, the sounds, the smells, and the sadness of \nthe Holocaust. Karski, himself, once said: ``This sin will haunt \nhumanity to the end of time. It does haunt me. And, I want it to be \nso.''\n  Jan Karski wanted us all to be haunted by the Holocaust. He wanted us \nnever to forget. He devoted his life to ensuring that such inhumane \nhorror would be present forever in our collective conscience, so that \nwe, above all else, will never let this dark chapter in our history \never, ever repeat itself.\n  While we often think of heroes in terms of epic feats on the \nbattlefield or in the face of great danger, Jan Karski is no less a \nhero for giving a voice to a silent slaughter. I ask my colleagues to \nthink about that and to take some time to consider the life of Jan \nKarski and the life of Fritz Kolbe. Their stories, along with others \nnewly discovered, help fill the holes of history, while revisiting a \nfundamental, troubling question of what the West knew about the \nHolocaust and when we knew it.\n  I encourage my colleagues to learn more about Jan and Fritz. Read \nlast year's New York Times obituary about Jan's life. Talk about his \nstory with your families. To understand the Holocaust is to remember \nthe lives of Jan Karski and Fritz Kolbe--to remember--``always \nremember,'' as Jan would say--what their sacrifices meant--and still \nmean--for our world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7803-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7803-S7804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. MORTIMER ADLER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute \nto a great American who passed away on June 28, at the age of 98\\1/2\\--\nan American whose life spanned virtually the entire 20th century and \nwhose work influenced the course of the century.\n  Dr. Mortimer Jerome Adler, author, educator and philosopher was born \nin New York City and subsequently moved to California where he lived a \ngreat portion of his life.\n  Mortimer Adler devoted his life to the pursuit of wisdom, \nunderstanding, truth and knowledge, and to sharing what he learned with \nothers. After having read John Stuart Mill's Autobiography at age 14 \nand learning that Mill had read Plato by the time he was five, he hit \nthe books and never looked back.\n  A prolific writer, Adler authored well over 50 books, including How \nto Read a Book; The American Testament; The Common Sense of Politics; \nAristotle for Everyone; Ten Philosophical Mistakes; and Art, the Arts \nand the Great Ideas. It is readily apparent, Mr. President, that his \ninterests were wide ranging and extensive. As editor of the \nEncyclopedia Britannica, Adler was responsible for revamping the \nencyclopedia in the form we know it today. He was also editor of the 60 \nvolume set, The Great Books of the Western World and was also \ninstrumental in devising\n\n[[Page S7804]]\n\nthe Great Books reading program, a book discussion program with \nchapters throughout the United States in which participants read and \ndiscuss classic texts.\n  A professor at several universities including Columbia University and \nthe University of Chicago, Mortimer Adler was probably the only person \nin America to receive his PhD before receiving his high school diploma, \nbachelors or masters degrees. As part of his unending quest to reform \nthe American education system, he wrote, on behalf of the Paideia \nGroup, The Paideia Proposal, a book explaining how and why the \neducation that the best receive should be the education that all \nreceive.\n  Known as ``Everyone's Philosopher'' or ``the Philosopher of the \nCommon Man,'' Mortimer Adler spent a lifetime demonstrating that \nphilosophy was not a field only for some, but an endeavor for everyone. \nAs the title of a journal that he published since the early 90's puts \nit succinctly, ``Philosophy is Everybody's Business.''\n  He was also the founder of the Institute for Philosophical Research \nand was instrumental in founding the Aspen Institute, an organization \nwhich engages leaders in business, academia and politics in discussions \nof perennial ideas using classic texts to facilitate discussion.\n  Only rarely does a person of Mortimer Adler's intellect and ability \ncome along. We are fortunate that Professor Adler was with us for as \nlong as he was.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7804-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO LT. GEN. HENRY T. GLISSON\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a lifetime \ncommitment to serving the United States of America. On August 31, 2001, \nLt. Gen. Henry T. Glisson of Alexandria, Virginia, will retire as a \nLieutenant General after 34 years of dedicated service in the United \nStates Army.\n  General Glisson was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant of the \nQuartermaster Corps through the Reserve Officer Training Corps program \nat North Georgia College, where he earned his bachelor of science \ndegree in Psychology. Thereafter, he received his master's degree in \nEducation from Pepperdine University of California.

His next assignment was Commander of \nthe 87th Maintenance Battalion of the 7th Support Group for the United \nStates Army in Europe. He served as Chief of the Quartermaster Branch \nof the United States Army Military Personnel Command in Alexandria, \nVirginia, from 1985 to 1987.\n  In 1989 he became Commander of Division Support Command for the 4th \nInfantry Division in Fort Carson, Colorado. He returned to the Pentagon \nin 1991, serving as the Executive Officer and Special Assistant to the \nDeputy Chief of Staff for Logistics; and then as Deputy Director, \nDirectorate for Plans and Operations in the Office of the Deputy Chief \nof Staff for Logistics. In 1993, he was promoted to Brigadier General \nand has served in four consecutive command assignments: Commander of \nthe Defense Personnel Support Center for the Defense Logistics Agency; \nCommander of the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Command of the U.S. Army \nMateriel Command; and 44th Quartermaster General and Commandant of the \nU.S. Army Quartermaster Center and School. In 1997, he was promoted to \nLieutenant General and began his service as Director of the Defense \nLogistics Agency in Fort Belvoir, Virginia.\n  His tireless and selfless dedication to serving his country is \nrepresented by the many decorations he has earned, including the \nDefense Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service \nMedal, the Legion of Merit with Five Oak Leaf Clusters, the Bronze Star \nwith ``V'' Device, the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Meritorious \nService Medal with Four Oak Leaf Clusters, the Army Commendation Medal, \nthe Air Medal, the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Parachutist Badge, the \nParachute Rigger Badge and the Army Staff Identification Badge.\n  In closing, I wish to commend General Glisson for his many years of \ndistinguished service to our Nation, protecting our freedoms of life, \nliberty and the pursuit of happiness. I wish him and his wife, Sherry, \nGodspeed in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7804-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO REVEREND CHRISTIAN\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues a great man in the State of New Jersey, Rev. Ron Christian.\n  Reverend Christian is a man of integrity who is committed to the \nspiritual, mental, social, civil, and economic well-being of his \ncongregation and of the residents of Essex County.\n  I want to congratulate him on his installation as the pastor of the \nChristian Love Baptist Church. He is a dynamic gentleman who has turned \nhis life around and has become a leader and role model in the \ncommunity.\n  Reverend Christian is a true American, who believes that all people \nshould have access to America's Promise. He has the enviable gift of \nbeing able to bring people together to work for a common cause. \nReverend Christian is an unselfish man whose motivation is not self-\ngratification. He possesses a higher calling.\n  On July 8, Reverend Christian became the pastor of the Christian Love \nBaptist Church in Irvington, New Jersey. I am certain that under his \nguidance, Christian Love Baptist Church will experience enormous growth \nand will continue its tradition of being a warm congregation filled \nwith joy and love.\n  Reverend Christian's devotion to the community is very well known, \nand the State of New Jersey is a better place because of his \nleadership.\n  Lastly, I am proud to call Reverend Christian a friend. It is an \nhonor for me to bring him to your attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7804-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7804-S7805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ALBUQUERQUE HISPANO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE GRAND OPENING\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today and ask my \ncolleagues to join me in congratulating the Albuquerque Hispano Chamber \nof Commerce in my home state of New Mexico, as they continue their work \nto serve the community, with the opening of their Barelas Job \nOpportunity Center.\n  The Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of Commerce was founded in May 1975 \nand is dedicated to improving the quality of life for citizens, by \npromoting economic and education activities, with an emphasis on small \nbusiness.\n  In those many years, the Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of Commerce has \nhelped small business people by providing much needed services and \ninforming them of business opportunities. It also serves as an advocate \nfor issues affecting the small businessperson.\n  Through the Chamber, the entrepreneur also has access to a portal \nthrough which they can contribute to the economic and civic development \nof the community.\n  The Chamber just moved into a new building in an area of Albuquerque \nthat is not affluent or wealthy, but one that is predominately \nHispanic, and with history and pride: the South Valley. It is a fitting \nlocation for the Chamber, since it has always worked to protect, \nperpetuate and promote the Hispanic Culture, language and tradition.\n  The Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of Commerce will now be able to take \ntheir assistance a step further with the opening of their Barelas Job \nOpportunity Center within their new building.\n  The Opportunity Center, to be dedicated on August 10, 2001, will \nallow the\n\n[[Page S7805]]\n\nChamber to provide even more services individually designed to help \nmembers and small businesspersons with their business needs.\n  The Barelas Job Opportunity Center will serve the neighborhood, \ncommunity, State and Nation for generations to come.\n  I applaud the Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of Commerce as it opens its \nnew Barelas Job Opportunity Center. The Chamber has made a great impact \non our community and with the new Job Opportunity Center, will continue \nand further its contribution. We wish them much continued success in \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7805-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7805-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7805-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO SIERRA LEONE MESSAGE--\n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 35\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\n       To the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a 6-month \nperiodic report on the national emergency with respect to Sierra Leone \nthat was declared in Executive Order 13194 of January 18, 2001.\n                                                      George W.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. Earl \nShinhoster for his distinguished career of service to the public and \nthe cause of civil and human rights. In tribute to Mr. Shinhoster I \nhereby introduce legislation to designate the facility of the United \nStates Postal Service located at 2853 Candler Road in Decatur, Georgia, \nas the ``Earl T. Shinhoster Post Office.'' Before his tragic death on \nJune 12, 2000, he had been an active member of the National Association \nfor the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP, for more than 30 years as \nboth a volunteer and staff member, most recently as Acting Executive \nDirector and Chief Executive Officer of its National Board of Directors \nin 1996, and Southeast Regional Director from 1978-1994.\n  In May 1998, Mr. Shinhoster was Chairman of the Georgia Delegation to \nthe National Summit on Africa and he was the Field Director for the \nNational Democratic Institute in Accra, Ghana from 1996 to 1997 where \nhe observed and monitored the 1996 Presidential and Parliamentary \nelections. He also monitored and observed the electoral process in \nSouth Africa and Nigeria. He was active on both the State and local \nlevel serving in the administration of Georgia Governor George Busbee \nfrom 1975 to 1978 as Director of the Governor's Office of Human \nAffairs. In 1998, Mr. Shinhoster served as Coordinator of Voter \nEducation for the State's Election Division.\n  Earl Shinhoster earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in political \nscience from Morehouse College in Atlanta, GA in 1972 before pursuing \nlegal studies at Cleveland State University College of Law in \nCleveland, OH. The particular Post Office to be named after him is the \nsame Post Office in South DeKalb where he retrieved his mail and is \nlocated in the same community where his family and friends still reside \ntoday. I, along with Senator Miller, urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation and recognize Mr. Shinhoster's long and distinguished \ncareer as a public servant promoting civil and human rights in Georgia, \nthe United States, and around the world.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Ron Wyden, in the introduction of the Seniors \nPrescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act of 2001, or ``SPICE.'' I \nwant to thank him for his enthusiasm about and his commitment to this \njoint venture.\n  It was just about two years ago now that Senator Wyden and I \nintroduced this bill for the first time. SPICE 2001 is the product of \nalmost three years of work and development. Since 1999, when we first \ntackled this issue, there has been much discussion about how to design \na prescription drug coverage plan that is both comprehensive and \naffordable, that provides choice but guarantees availability of basic \ncoverage. And, perhaps most importantly, one that is workable for \nseniors, the Medicare program and one that private providers will \noffer. We believe we have struck this balance in SPICE 2001.\n  I believe that this bill is a benchmark for the Senate's \nconsideration of a comprehensive out-patient prescription drug program \nunder Medicare. I offer this bill today, with my friend Senator Wyden \nbecause it is the product of a three year collaborative effort to \nprovide our Nation's seniors with prescription drug coverage, and I \noffer it with the hopes that it will be considered as part of a broader \nreform when the Senate takes one up.\n  Americans age 65 and older are only 12 percent of the population but \naccount for over 40 percent of all drug spending. Which isn't \nsurprising considering that over the past five years, per capita drug \nspending for the Medicare population has approximately doubled, \nreaching an estimated $1,756 this year.\n  This comes at a time where fewer retirees have health coverage from \ntheir former employers than ever before. In 1998, an estimated 66 \npercent of large employers offered retiree health coverage, fewer than \n40 percent did so in 2000. At a time when fewer and fewer of our \nseniors have retiree health care coverage from their former employers, \nand when the cost of prescription drugs are skyrocketing, no one can \nargue that it isn't essential we ensure that Medicare beneficiaries \nhave comprehensive coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. And, \nthis is a problem, I might add, which will only grow when the 77 \nmillion Baby Boomers begin to enter Medicare in 2011.\n  For the past several years, Senator Wyden and I have been united in \nour belief that we owe it to our seniors to develop the best and most \npractical solution. SPICE 2001 represents a straightforward, \ncomprehensive, and responsible approach that should appeal to anyone \nwho believes that seniors need prescription drug coverage.\n  To accomplish these goals we have built upon the model of the first \nSPICE bill and added components that have continued to be part of the \nlarger debate on this issue--that of public programs versus private \ncompetition. As a result, SPICE 2001 now creates a partnership between \nthe Federal Government and private insurers to share the cost, and the \nrisk, of offering outpatient prescription drug coverage for our senior \npopulation.\n  Specifically, SPICE 2001 creates a prescription drug coverage program \nfor all Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in both Part A and Part B, and \nwho choose to enroll. SPICE offers a premium subsidy of at least 25 \npercent to all enrollees. To provide extra assistance to those who need \nit most, there is a 100 percent premium subsidy for those whose income \nis at or under 150 percent of poverty, $12,885 for a single person and \n$17,415 for a couple. Those whose income is between 150 percent and 175 \npercent of poverty, $15,033 for an individual and $20,318 for a couple, \nwill receive a subsidy based on a sliding scale down to 25 percent of \nthe cost of the premium.\n  SPICE 2001 offers two choices in the coverage so they can pick a plan \nto best serve their needs. One option is basic coverage, with a $350 \ndeductible and a 25 percent coinsurance requirement. This can be \npurchased with a Stop-loss plan of $3,000 or separately.\n  The second option is stop-loss coverage. While only 17 percent of \nbeneficiaries have costs above $3,000, they account for almost 54 \npercent of all spending on prescription drugs. This coverage is \nprovided completely through the private insurer. According to CBO's \nJanuary 2001 baseline projections, 83 percent of those enrolled in \nMedicare fee for service plans pay less than $3,000 for their drugs. \nFor these seniors, they might only want to purchase the basic coverage. \nThose who need more than just the basic coverage can buy them both. For \nthose who can manage their spending and only want to protect themselves \nfrom catastrophic expenses, they can purchase stop-loss coverage.\n  And, importantly, all SPICE enrollees receive the benefit of the \nnegotiated discount on the cost of their prescription drugs, starting \nwith their first prescription.\n  Choice is one of the cornerstones of this program. Seniors will not \nonly have the choice of their level of coverage but will be able to \nchoose from a variety to have their care delivered. SPICE can be run \nthrough Medigap, Medicare+Choice plans, or private entities. In areas \nwhere there are no insurers, the SPICE Board will have the authority to \nnegotiate with entities to bring them into the market.\n  One of the perennial arguments against government sponsored or \nassisted prescription drug coverage for our retirees has been that if \nwe did it, employers wouldn't. We already know that fewer employers are \noffering retiree health benefits than just 12 years ago, this is a \ntrend we hope to discourage. This is why the SPICE Board is authorized \nto provide the 25 percent premium subsidy as an incentive to employers \nwho provide prescription drug coverage for their retirees. It is \ncritical we encourage employers to continue to offer this type of \ncoverage and we acknowledge that in this bill.\n  According to a 1998 Wall Street Journal poll, 80 percent of retirees \nuse a prescription drug every day. The average Medicare beneficiary \nfills a prescription 18 times a year. It is long past time that we \nensure that these prescriptions are covered.\n  SPICE 2001 offers something for everyone interested in providing our \nseniors with prescription drug coverage. It is a program that can be \nincorporated in existing health plans, will be run through a government \nBoard whose sole purpose is ensuring that this program runs well, and \nwill foster competition and allow for choice in both coverage and \nproviders.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Campbell, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Allard, Mr. Johnson, and \n        Mr. Kyl):\n\n[[Page S7819]]\n\n  S. 1186. A bill to provide a budgetary mechanism to ensure that funds \nwill be available to satisfy the Federal Government's responsibilities \nwith respect to negotiated settlements of disputes related to Indian \nwater rights claims and Indian land claims; to the Committee on the \nBudget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to \nthe order of August 4, 1977, with instructions that if one Committee \nreports, the other Committee have thirty days to report or be \ndischarged.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, both as chairman and now as the ranking \nmember on the Budget Committee, I have been working over the last year \nwith the Western Governors' Association, the Western Regional Council, \nthe Native American Rights Fund, the Western States Water Council, as \nwell as several Indian tribes to correct what I believe to be a flaw in \nthe Budget Enforcement Act as it relates to the Federal funding of \nIndian land and water settlements.\n  I, along with a group of bipartisan Senators, including the chairman \nand ranking member of the Indian Affairs Committee are introducing \ntoday legislation that will help Congress fulfill its commitment to \nauthorized Indian land and water settlements.\n  In FY 2002, the President's request for Indian land and water \nsettlements funding was $61 million. This represents an increase from \nfiscal year 2001 of $23 million. The increase is due to the \nauthorization of several large settlements in California, Colorado, \nMichigan, New Mexico, and Utah.\n  I am pleased to report that the full request was included in both the \nSenate and House passed budget resolutions. In turn, the request was \nfully appropriated in both the House and Senate versions of the fiscal \nyear 2002 Interior appropriations bill. This is a tremendous first step \nin making sure the Congress fulfills its obligation regarding these \nsettlements. But it is only the first step.\n  In the near future, there are, at least, three additional large \nsettlements likely to come before Congress. The States involved in \nthese settlements are Arizona, Idaho, and Montana. Under current \nbudgetary treatment these settlements will be difficult to fund without \ntaking critical resources from other Bureau of Indian Affairs programs.\n  Currently, once the settlements have been agreed to by the parties \ninvolved, the settlements come to Congress for authorization and \nappropriation. When all appropriations have been distributed the \nIndians give up any future claims to the land or the water.\n  Appropriations for these settlements are usually spread over 3-10 \nyears depending on the size of the settlement. The payout in one year \nfor an individual settlement does not usually exceed $30 million.\n  I feel, however, that the current budget mechanisms have unfairly \ntreated the handling of Indian land and water settlements in relation \nto other federally funded Indian programs.\n  The problem with the current status is that, due to the statutory \ndiscretionary caps, the perception exists that there is not enough \nmoney in BIA's budget to spend on settlements without taking money from \nother programs in their budget, such as Indian school construction, \neducation, community development.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, the Fiscal Integrity of \nIndian Settlements Protection Act of 2001, provides for a cap \nadjustment similar to the one that deals with U.N. arrearages. It would \nbe for authorized Indian land and water settlements and would set a \nceiling on what could be spent in one year. Under this proposal, the \nsettlements would still have to be authorized and appropriated, but it \nwould hold the BIA budget harmless for the cost of the settlements.\n  Let me be clear, if these claims are not settled, the US government \nstill can be held liable in court. Claims that go through the court \nprocess are authoritatively paid out of the Claims and Judgement Fund. \nIn most cases, negotiated settlements provide more water to the tribes \nand a less expensive bill to the Federal Government.\n  Frankly, this simple cap adjustment for authorized and appropriated \nmonies for settlements provides a win-win situation for all parties \ninvolved.\n  We have made good progress toward funding our Indian responsibilities \nthese past few years. This legislation is a very important step.\n  I, along with Senators Inouye, Campbell, Allard, Baucus, Bingaman, \nCrapo, Johnson, and Kyl, urge my colleagues to support this bill and \nfuture funding of Indian land and water settlements.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Ad Hoc Group on Indian \nWater Rights be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   Ad Hoc Group on\n\n\n                                          Indian Water Rights,\n\n                                                    June 27, 2001.\n\n     Members of the United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We write to urge your support and co-\n     sponsorship of proposed legislation to be introduced shortly \n     entitled the ``Fiscal Integrity of Indian Settlements \n     Protection Act of 2001''. A ``Dear Colleague'' letter by \n     Senators Domenici, Bingaman, Crapo, Inouye, Kyl, and Campbell \n     was sent to your office on May 23, 2001, describing the bill.\n       Across the country, numerous negotiations are on-going to \n     settle complex Indian land and water claims. Funding for \n     these settlements is one of the biggest hurdles to overcome. \n     This legislation is important so that Indian land and water \n     right settlements can be completed in a timely manner, \n     consistent with the federal government's responsibility and \n     liability associated with them, and without taking scarce \n     resources from other critical programs within the Department \n     of the Interior.\n       Three settlements were approved by the last Congress and \n     others are expected to be submitted to this Congress. Under \n     current budgetary policy, funding of land and water right \n     settlements must be offset by a corresponding reduction in \n     some other discretionary component of the Interior \n     Department's budget. It is difficult for the Administration, \n     the states and the tribes to negotiate settlements knowing \n     that they may not be funded because funding can occur only at \n     the expense of some other tribe or essential Interior \n     Department program.\n       We believe that the funding of land and water right \n     settlements is an important obligation of the United States \n     government. The obligation is analogous to, and no less \n     serious than, the obligation of the United States to pay \n     judgments which are rendered against it. We urge that steps \n     be taken to change current budgetary policy to ensure that \n     any land or water settlement, once authorized by the Congress \n     and approved by the President, will be funded. If such a \n     change is not made, these claims will likely be relegated to \n     litigation, an outcome that should not be acceptable to the \n     Administration, the Congress, the tribes or the states.\n       The members of the Ad Hoc Group on Indian Water Rights have \n     consistently supported the negotiated settlement of Indian \n     land and water right disputes, and have been actively engaged \n     in drawing more awareness to the important issues associated \n     with settlement of land and water right claims.

Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today with \nSenators Cleland and Specter the Department of Veterans Affairs Nurse \nRecruitment and Retention Enhancement Act of 2001.\n  On June 14, 2001, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing \nto explore reasons for the imminent shortage of professional nurses in \nthe United\n\n[[Page S7820]]\n\nStates, and how this shortage will affect health care for veterans \nserved by Department of Veterans Affairs' health care facilities.\n  Working conditions for nurses, never easy, have become even more \nchallenging in recent years. Managed care principles lead hospitals to \nadmit only the very sickest of patients with the most complex health \ncare needs. As the pool of highly trained nurses shrinks, many health \ncare providers rely heavily upon mandatory staff overtime to meet \nstaffing needs. Several registered nurses, including Sandra McMeans \nfrom my state of West Virginia, testified before the committee that \nunpredictable and dangerously long working hours lead to nurses' \nfatigue and frustration, and patient care suffers.\n  The legislation we introduce today includes a requirement that VA \nproduce a policy on staffing standards. Such a policy shall be \ndeveloped in consultation with the VA Under Secretary for Health, the \nDirector of VA's National Center for Patient Safety, and VA's Chief \nNurse. While we leave it up to VA to develop the standards, the policy \nmust consider the numbers and skill mix required of staff in specific \nmedical settings, such as critical care and long-term care.\n  Because mandatory overtime was frequently cited at the committee's \nJune hearing as being of serious concern, the legislation includes a \nrequirement that the Secretary report to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs on the use of overtime by licensed nursing staff and nursing \nassistants in each facility. This is a critical first step to \ndetermining what can be done to reduce the amount of mandatory \novertime. We will continue to monitor this issue with rigor and pledge \nto work to reduce the burdens borne by our nurses.\n  In terms of providing sufficient pay, our legislation mandates that \nVA provide Saturday premium pay to certain health professionals. These \ngroup of professionals include licensed practical nurses, LPN's, \ncertified or registered respiratory therapists, licensed physical \ntherapists, licensed vocational nurses, pharmacists, and occupational \ntherapists. This group of workers are known as ``hybrids'' as they \nstraddle two different personnel authorities, titles 38 and 5 of the \nUnited States Code. Hybrid status allows for the direct hiring and a \nmore flexible compensation system.\n  This is an issue of equity, especially for LPN's who work alongside \nother nurses on Saturday. While registered nurses, RN's are mandated to \nreceive Saturday premium pay, they may be working alongside an LPN who \nis not. Factoring in the looming nurse shortage, we should be doing all \nwe can to improve VA's ability to recruit and retain these caregivers.\n  Currently, hospital directors have the discretion to provide Saturday \npremium pay. Of the 17,000 hybrid employees, 8,000 are not receiving \nthe pay premium.\n  In my own State of West Virginia, many LPN's are not receiving \nSaturday premium pay. Deborah Dixon is an LPN at the VA Medical Center \nin Huntington, WV. She works nights 6 days in a row, has 2 days off, \nworks nights 5 days, then has 1 day off, then works 4 nights and has 3 \ndays off. As a result, she has off every third weekend. She says that \n``LPN's deserve Saturday premium pay. It feels like discrimination. It \nmakes me wonder why LPN's are not being respected.\n  I believe this change in law will make pay more consistent and fair \nfor our health care workers.\n  Programs initiated within VA to improve conditions for nurses and \npatients have focused on issues other than staffing ratios, pay, and \nhours. A highly praised scholarship program that I spearheaded allows \nVA nurses to pursue degrees and training in return for their service, \nthus encouraging professional development and improving the quality of \nhealth care. Included within the legislation we introduced today are \nmodifications to the existing scholarship and debt reduction programs. \nThese changes are intended to improve the programs by providing \nadditional flexibility to recipients.\n  In the Upper Midwest, the special skills of nurses and nurse \npractitioners are being recognized in clinics that provide supportive \ncare close to the veterans who need it. The legislation before us seeks \nto encourage more nurse-managed clinics and also includes a requirement \nthat VA evaluate these clinics.\n  There are various other provisions included in the bill. One \nprovision requires that VA nurses enrolled in the Federal Employee \nRetirement System have the same ability to include unused sick leave as \npart of the retirement year calculation that VA nurses enrolled in the \nCivilian Retirement System have. The legislation also would amend the \ntreatment of part-time service performed by certain title 38 employees \nprior to April 7, 1986, for purposes of retirement credit. Currently, \npart-time service performed by title 5 employees prior to April 7, \n1986, is treated as full-time service; however, title 38 employees' \npart-time services prior to April 7, 1986, is counted as part-time \nservice and therefore results in lower annuities for these employees. \nRetired nurses, such as Tonya Rich from Morgantown, WV, who has \ncontacted me, stress the inequity of the situation. In order to rectify \nthis, our legislation exempts registered nurses, physician assistants, \nand expanded-function dental auxiliaries from the requirement that \npart-time service performed prior to April 7, 1986, be prorated when \ncalculating retirement annuities.\n  This bill is a good start, but clearly, we must remain vigilant. \nAlthough the nursing crisis has not yet reached its projected peak, the \nshortage is already endangering patient safety in the areas of critical \nand long-term care, where demands on nurses are greatest. We must \nencourage higher enrollment in nursing schools, improve the work \nenvironment, and offer nurses opportunities to develop as respected \nprofessionals, while taking steps to ensure safe staffing levels in the \nshort-term.\n  We do not have the luxury of reflecting upon this problem at length; \nwe must act now. Fortunately, we have as allies hardworking nurses who \nare dedicated to helping us find ways to improve working conditions and \nto recruit more young people to the field.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1188\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Federal Communications Commission to \namend its daily newspaper cross-ownership rules, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation, the \nMedia Ownership Act of 2001, designed to rectify the increasing trend \ntoward consolidation and away from a vibrant exchange of news and \ninformation in today's media marketplace. I am joined in this effort by \nmy colleagues, Senators Inouye and Dorgan, who for years have \ndemonstrated their tireless pursuit of the public interest in the \nsensible regulation of media ownership.\n  This legislation is necessary to stem the tide toward concentration \nin the broadcast and newspaper industries and force a thorough and \nreasoned examination of the claims that further consolidation will \nserve the public interest. While the phrase ``public interest'' may \nhave a vague ring to it, its meaning should be quite clear to the five \nmembers of the Federal Communications Commission, which itself observed \njust a few months ago that it has both ``the duty and authority under \nthe Communications Act to promote diversity and competition among media \nvoices.''\n  Notwithstanding that duty, it has come to my attention that the FCC \nis planning a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to relax or eliminate the \nnewspaper-broadcast cross ownership rule. In addition, I understand \nthat the FCC may consider revising, among other media ownership \nrestrictions, the 35 percent national broadcast ownership cap later \nthis year. I do not believe that those rules should be changed at this \ntime. Others disagree. This legislation will enhance our debate on \nthese issues.\n  Locally relevant, independent programmers and distributors of media \ncontent are critically important energizers of civic discourse in this \ncountry. Indeed, that independence, localism and diversity are what \nseparate our nation from countries where information is not allowed to \nflow freely. Accordingly, any proceeding to revisit existing ownership \nrules involving broadcast, print, or cable television must examine the \npotential impact that undue influence over local and national media \noutlets may have on our democracy.\n  Because Congress understood the difficulty the Commission faces in \nquantifying democratic values such as localism and diversity, it gave \nthe Commission the explicit and implicit statutory authority and \nresponsibility to establish and maintain ownership caps in the media \nindustry. Pursuant to that authority, the FCC has imposed limits on the \nownership of broadcast and cable television properties, and on the \ncross-ownership within a market between broadcast and cable television \nstations, broadcast television and radio stations, and broadcast \ntelevision and radio stations and newspapers.\n  These ownership restrictions are based on factors outside the bounds \nof a traditional competitive analysis, and carry with them the \nauthority to prevent consolidation before it rises to the level \nnecessary to trigger antitrust intervention. for example, in light of \nthe importance of promoting localism and diversity, a higher importance \nmust be ascribed to preserving the balance of power between the \nnetworks and local stations than would otherwise be expected under \ntraditional competition analysis.\n  The reasons for this are simple, diversity in ownership promotes \ncompetition. Diversity in ownership creates opportunities for smaller \ncompanies, and local businessmen and women. Diversity in ownership \nallows creative programming and controversial points of views to find \nan outlet. Diversity in ownership promotes choices for advertisers. And \ndiversity in ownership and the related restriction on national \nownership groups preserves localism. And what in turn does this mean? \nMillions of Americans regularly receive their local news by watching \ntheir local broadcast stations or reading their daily newspaper. For \nthese citizens, localism still matters.\n\n  The proponents of increased consolidation, however, claim that the \ntransformed media landscape demands a deregulatory response. In my \nview, the burden should rest on those who wish to change the rules of \nthe game to justify those changes. If localism and diversity can be \npreserved in a consolidated marketplace, prove it. Arguments alone are \nnot persuasive.\n  Prior to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, the top radio station group \nowned 39 stations and generated annual revenues of $495 million. Today, \nthe top group owns over 1100 stations and generates revenues of almost \n$3.2 billion annually. This consolidation directly undercut diversity \nand localism in the radio marketplace. A year before Congress passed \nthe Telecommunications Act, the FCC lifted the rules that prohibited \nbroadcast networks from owning and creating their own television \nprogramming. This sanctioned consolidation freed the networks to seek \neconomic stakes in, and ownership of, television programs. As the \nWashington Post reported last fall in an article entitled, ``Even Hits \ncan Miss in TV's New Economy'', ``Just as supermarket might reserve its \nbest shelf space for its house brands, the networks have begun to favor \ntheir in house programs over shows created by others, which are often \nless profitable in the long term.'' So we see what deregulation has \nbrought us with radio and the market for television programming. \nSimilar consolidation among other major media outlets should only be \nallowed after a thorough analysis that justifies permitting such \nconcentration.\n  The legislation that we introduce today addresses the FCC's lack of \nenforcement of the newspaper-broadcast cross ownership rule. The FCC's \njurisdiction over newspaper broadcast ownership combinations arises \nfrom its authority to oversee broadcast communications licenses. In \npractice, the FCC has applied the rule only when there is a transfer or \nrenewal of a broadcast license. So, if a broadcast station owner \nacquires a newspaper in the same market, there is no FCC review of the \ncross ownership until the station's license is up for renewal. If a \nnewspaper owner acquires a broadcast station, however, the rule is \nimmediately triggered because the FCC has to approve the transfer of \nthe station's broadcast license for the transaction to go forward. When \nthe rule was adopted, television broadcast licenses were renewed every \nthree years. Accordingly, even when the FCC did not immediately enforce \nthe rule, the combined entity was aware it would have to come into \ncompliance, either by requesting a waiver, or divesting either the \nstation or newspaper, within a short period of time.\n  Today, however, broadcast station licenses are only renewed every \neight years, thereby creating a significant loophole in the cross \nownership rule, if it is only enforced by the Commission at the time of \nlicense renewals. Our bill would require the FCC to review immediately \nexisting cross ownership combinations. The legislation requires a \nbroadcast licensee to inform the FCC when it acquires a newspaper that \nwould place the license in violation of the newspaper-broadcast cross \nownership rule. Upon receipt of this information, the FCC could take a \nrange of action under the legislation, including forcing divestiture, \nor granting a waiver to allow the combination to go forward.\n  In addition, our legislation steps up a process whereby we in \nCongress can scrutinize any alternative that the Commission devises to \nreplace the current media ownership rules, and compare the efficacy of \na new cap or ownership measurement system against the current rules, to \ndetermine whether a new measurement provides a better mechanism to \npromote diversity and localism. Accordingly, our bill requires the FCC \nto provide to the House and Senate Commerce Committees, any proposed \nmedia ownership rule changes eighteen months before they become \neffective. These proposals must be transmitted to the Commerce \ncommittees along with clear and ample explanation of how the new \nformulations will better meet the Commission's public interest \nobligation to promote competition, diversity, and localism.\n  The legislation we are introducing takes two important steps. First, \nit forces the FCC to enforce the current version of the FCC's \nnewspaper-broadcast cross ownership rule. Second, it provides a check \non those who might otherwise move quickly to repeal other media \nownership limits without regard\n\n[[Page S7824]]\n\nto the impact of the consequent consolidation on diversity, localism, \nand competition in the media marketplace.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1189\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 60\n\n       Whereas the Group of Seven (G-7) was established as a forum \n     of the heads of state or heads of government of the world's \n     largest, industrialized democracies to meet annually in a \n     summit meeting;\n       Whereas those countries which are members of the Group of \n     Seven are pluralistic societies, with democratic political \n     institutions and practices committed to the promotion of \n     universally recognized standards of human rights, individual \n     liberties, and rule of law;\n       Whereas, in 1991 and subsequent years, the G-7 invited the \n     Russian Federation to a postsummit dialogue, and in 1998 the \n     G-7 formally invited the Russian Federation to participate in \n     an annual gathering that thereafter became known as the Group \n     of Eight (G-8);\n\n[[Page S7825]]\n\n       Whereas the invitation to then President Yeltsin of the \n     Russian Federation to participate in these annual summits was \n     to reinforce his commitment to democratization and economic \n     liberalization, recognizing the fact that the Russian \n     Federation's economy was not of the size and character of \n     those of the G-7 economies and that its government's \n     commitment to democratic principles was uncertain;\n       Whereas free news media are fundamental to the functioning \n     of a democratic society and essential for the protection of \n     individual liberties and such freedoms can exist only in an \n     environment that is free of state control of the news media, \n     that is free of any form of state censorship or official \n     coercion of any kind, and that is protected and guaranteed by \n     the rule of law;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has \n     undertaken a series of actions hostile and destructive toward \n     independently operated media enterprises and journalists, \n     particularly those news outlets and journalists that have \n     been critical of government policies and government actions;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation continues \n     its indiscriminate war against the people of Chechnya, a war \n     in which Russian forces have caused the deaths of countless \n     thousands of innocent civilians, caused the displacement of \n     well over 400,000 innocent individuals, forcibly relocated \n     refugee populations, and have committed widespread \n     atrocities, including summary executions, torture, and rape;\n       Whereas the Department of State's Annual Report on \n     International Religious Freedom 2000 concluded that the \n     Government of the Russian Federation ``does not always \n     respect [its Constitution's] provision for equality of \n     religions, and some local authorities imposed restrictions on \n     some religious minority groups'';\n       Whereas the continued participation of the Government of \n     the Russian Federation in the Group of Eight must be \n     conditioned on the former's acceptance of and adherence to \n     the norms and standards of democracy; and\n       Whereas the next summit meeting of the G-8 countries will \n     take place from July 20 to July 23, 2002 in Genoa, Italy: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should use the Genoa summit meeting of \n     the G-8 to condition future G-8 meetings upon a clear and \n     unambiguous demonstration of commitment by the Government of \n     the Russian Federation to adhere to the norms and standards \n     of democracy and fundamental human rights, and that this must \n     include--\n       (A) an immediate end to Russian military operations in \n     Chechnya and the initiation of genuine negotiations for a \n     just and peaceful resolution of the conflict in that region \n     with the democratically elected Government of Chechnya led by \n     Aslan Maskhadov;\n       (B) granting international missions immediate and full and \n     unimpeded access into Chechnya and surrounding regions so \n     that they can provide humanitarian assistance and investigate \n     alleged atrocities and war crimes;\n       (C) respect for the existence of a free, unfettered, and \n     independent media and the free exchange of ideas and views, \n     including the freedom of journalists to publish opinions and \n     news reports without fear of censorship or punishment, the \n     right of people to receive news without government \n     interference and harassment, and opportunities for private \n     ownership of media enterprises;\n       (D) freedom of all religious groups to practice their faith \n     in the Russian Federation, without government interference on \n     the rights and the peaceful activities of such religious \n     organizations; and\n       (E) equal treatment and respect for the human rights of all \n     citizens of the Russian Federation;\n       (2) the President and the Secretary of State should take \n     all necessary steps to suspend the participation of the \n     Russian Federation in meetings of the G-8 countries after the \n     Genoa summit meeting should the Government of the Russian \n     Federation fail to adhere to the norms and standards \n     described in paragraph (1); and\n       (3) the President and Secretary of State are requested to \n     convey to appropriate officials of the Government of the \n     Russian Federation, including the President, the Prime \n     Minister, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and \n     appropriate officials of the G-7 countries this expression of \n     the views of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/17/senate-section/article/S7825-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 981.
